According to the purveyor s of conventional wisdom, communism is dead, the Co ld War is over, and the greatest threats to world peace and security are ramp ant nationalism, inequita ble wealth distribution, overpopulation, and environmental degr adation. Yet the threat to a just world peace and comity among nations and peoples comes not fr om political fragmentation, ozone holes, greenhouse gases, an over- abundance of people, a shortage of natural resources, or ev en from the frequently offered scenarios o f \"rogue\" elements in the former USSR acquiring control of nuclear weapons. The true, imminent danger to America and to al l nations seeking peace and good will stems from widespread acceptance of the monstr ous falsehood that in order to live in an \"interdependent\" world, all nation-states must yield th eir sovereignty to the United Nations. Th is lie is given dignity by other lies, chief of which is that Soviet totalitarianism has been buried forever.1 A too wide acceptance of these dangerous falsehoods is resulting in : 1) a massive transfer of wealth from the taxpayers in the West to the still-socialist governments of the East that remain under the control of \"for mer\" communists; 2) the gradual but accelerating me rger or \"convergence\" of the U.S. and Russia through in creasing economic, p olitical, social, and military agre ements and arrangements; and 3) the rapidly escalating transfer o f p ower — military, regulatory, and taxing — to the UN. Unless the fiction underlying these developments is exposed, national suicide and global rule by an all-powerful world government are inevitable. \"The Bush Administration,\" Time magazine noted on September 17, 1990, \"would like to make the U.N. a cornerstone of its plans to construct a New Wo rld Order.\"2 That observa tion merely stated the obvious. In his speech to the na tion and the world on September 11, 1990, Mr. Bu sh stated: \"Out o f these troubled times, our fifth objective — a new world order — ca n emerge....\" He proceeded to announce his hopes for \"a United Na tions that performs as envisi oned by its founde rs.\"3 It became abundantly clear to vete ran students of \"world order\" polit ics that a major new push for world government had begun. Only a few ye ars ago, any such attempt woul d have flopped miserably. During the 1970s and 80s, the UN’s record as an enclave of spies, a sinkhole of corrupt spendthrifts, and an anti-American propaganda forum for terrorists, Third World dictators, and Comm unist totalitarians, ha d thoroughly tarnished its carefully manufactured image as mankind’s \"last best hope for peace.\" From 1959, when the UN could boast an 87 percent approval rating, th e annual Gallup Poll showed a continuous decline in popularity fo r the organization. By 1971, a Gallup survey reported that only 35 p ercent of the American people thought the UN was doing a good job. By 1976, Gallup claimed that the support had dropped to 33 percent. In 1980, it declined further to an all-time low of 31 percent. \"At no p oint since [1945],\" said Dr . Gallup referring to his latest figure s, \"has satisfaction with the overall p erformance of the world organizati on been as low as it is today.\"4 The John Bi rch Society’s long and frequently lonely billboard, bumpe r sticker, petition, le tter-writing, and pamphl eteering educational campaigns to \"Get US out! of the United Na tions\" had made good sense to many Americans. In the early years of the Reagan Administration, UN- b ashing became positively respectable, even fashionable. U.S. Ambassador to the UN Jeane Ki rkpatrick could be seen and heard almost daily denouncing the world body’s anti-Americanism, tyra nny promotion, and fiscal profligacy. Editorials opposing UN actions and the organiza tion itself began appearing with frequency in local and regional newspapers, and occasionally even in major national news organs. Anti-UN sentiment had already reached the point in 1981 that veteran UN-watcher Robert W. Lee could re p ort in his book, The United Nations Cons p irac y : \"Toda y the UN is increasin g l y re g arded not as a"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"sacred cow, but rather as a troika composed of a white elephant, a Trojan hor se, and a Judas goat.\"5 The supermarket tabloid Star , while not exactly a consistently reliab le heavyweight in the news and analysis category, expressed the sentiments of a large and growing segment of the American people with a N ovember 3, 1981 article by Steve Dunleavy entitled, \"Rip Down This Shocking Tower of Shame.\" In March of 1982, syndicated column ist Andrew Tully authored a piece headlined: \"[Mayor] Koch Should Chase UN Out of Town.\"6 Many similar articles and editorials could be cited, but perhaps one o f the most surprising was the August 24, 1987 cover story by Charles Krauthammer for The New R epublic , entitled \"Let It Sink: The Overdue Demise of the United Nations.\" But the advent of Mikhail Gorbachev’s \"new thinking\" in the late 1980s coincided with the beginning o f a remarkable rehabilitation in the public’s image of the UN. First Gorbachev, and then Boris Yeltsin, won plaudits for reversing the trad itional Soviet (or Sovi et surrogate) practice of using the UN as a venue for strident anti-American diatribes. Yassi r Arafat and his PLO terro rists dropped their regula r anti-Israel philippics. And the UN’ s \"peacekeepers\" won a Nobel Prize and worldwide praise for thei r roles as mediators in Afghanista n, Cambodia, Central America, Sout hern Africa, and the Middle East. Then came Operation Desert St orm, the holy war against the a ggression of Saddam Hussein. And mirabile dictu , the United Nations was once again the worl d’s \"last best hope fo r peace.\" Suddenly UN \"peacekeepers\" began to appear almost everywhere — with more than 40,000 troops in the field in Africa, Asia, Europe, Central Am erica, and the Middle East7 — a nd every new day now brings new appeals for the world body’s intervention and \"expertise.\" On United Nations Day 1990, a new Gallup Poll i ndicated that \"American support for the United N ations ... is higher than it has been in over 20 years.\" According to the national polling organization, \"Fifty-four percent of Americans now think the United Nati ons has done a good job of solving the p roblems it has had to face....\" Th e poll cited the \"rapprochement be tween the U.S.S.R. and the U.S., and the dissolution of the Iron Curtain,\" as well as the deve loping Persian Gulf situation, as majo r factors contributing to the e nhancement of the UN’s image.8 Gallup reported that \"almost six out of ten Americans think that the U. N. has been effective in helping deal with the current [Iraq-Kuwait] crisis, with only 8% saying that the U. N. has not been at all effective.\" Even more disturbing, if accurate, is the poll finding that 61 percent of those surveyed thought it a good idea to build up the United Nations emergency force to \"a size great enough to deal with ‘brush fire’ or small wars throughout the world.\"9 The euphoria following the Persian Gulf hostilities temp orarily boosted George Bush’s approval rating to an all-time high for any presid ent. Rude economic realities and an accumulating num ber of political p roblems then caused his star to plummet just as rapidly as it had risen. The UN’s gains, however, appear to have been more durabl e. As reported by Richard Morin (\"U. N. Real Winner After Gulf War,\" Salt Lake Tribune , January 24, 1992), a survey by the Amer icans Talk Issues Foundation \"found that approval for the United Na tions actually increased from 66 percen t in June to 78 percent in Novembe r [1991], a period when other measures of war-induced euphoria were sinking fast.\" The Tribune reported: [H]alf of those questioned — 51 percent — agreed that \"the U.S. should abide by all World Court decisions, even when they go against us, because this sets an example for all nations to follow.\" That was u p from 42 p ercent in Ma y ."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"More than half also would support increasing the amount of dues that the United States pays to the U.N. to \"help pay for a U.N. space sa tellite system to dete ct and monitor such problems as arms movements, crop failures , refugee settlements and global pollution.\" And, remarkably, 38 percent of those questioned said United Nations resolutions \"should rule over the actions and laws of individual countries, where n ecessary to fulfill essential United Nations functions, including ruling ove r U.S. laws even when our laws are different.\" While we recognize that pollsters often structure their polling questions to achieve results that will influence rather than accurately re flect public opinion, and th ese surveys may be exaggerating the rise o f p ro-UN sentiments, there is litt le doubt that the world organiza tion is experiencing a dramatic turnaround in citizen acceptance. In large measure, this has resulted from the enormously effective UN drum-beating campaigns of the Establishment news media. The New York Times , Los Angeles Times , and Washington Post have led the way, with an avalanche o f fawning editorials, news stories, and op-ed columns glorifying the al leged accomplishments and yet-to- be-realized potential of th e UN. These pro-UN public relations pieces have been reprinted in thousands of newspapers and have also found their way in to the mainstream of broadcast journalism. Unfortunately, the religiou s media have followed along with thei r secular brethren in promoting this unquestioning faith in the salvific ca pability of the United Nations. On e of the more egregious examples of this misplaced fervor appeared in a lengthy January 19, 1992 editorial in Our Sunday Visitor , the nation’s largest Catholic publicati on. Headlined \"UNsurpassed,\" the pi ece declared: \"If the John Birch Society had its way and the United Nations had ceased to exist back in the 1950s, 1991 would have been a far more dismal year.\" The editorialist then pro ceeded to praise the UN’s latest \"accomplishments\": It is unlikely that internati onal support for the liberation of Kuwait and the dismantling of the Iraqi war machine would have been so easily marshaled by the United States. Cambodia’s warring factions w ould most likely still be warring. Terry Anderson and his fellow hostages would still be languishing in Lebanon. Croats and Serbs would still be locked in their death grip with no internati onal organization pressing for a cease-fire. And El Salvador would still be a vast cemetery slowly filling up with the victims of its fratricidal opponents.... Now in its fifth decade of existence, the U.N. is finally coming into it s own, thanks in part to the demise of the super power standoff that hobbled the international organization for much of its existence. Nati ons are finding the mediation ef forts of U.N. negotiators preferable to either unilateral actions or a bloody status quo of unwinnable conflicts. Similar paeans of praise can be found in leading Protestant periodicals. Ne w Age publications which have multiplied in number and influence in the past decade virtually worship the UN. Readers of this book will be in a far better position to benefit from our presentation in the pages that follow, and to understand unfolding world events, if they keep in mind th e two major principles underlying virtually all of our fe deral government’s foreign and dom estic policies: \"convergence\" an d \"interdependence.\" The plan to bring about a convergen ce or merger of the U.S. and the USSR is not a recent policy response to the supposed reforms of Gorb achev and Yeltsin. It firs t came to light officially in 1953 when public concern over large tax-exempt foundation grants to co mmunists and communist causes p rom p ted Con g ress to investi g ate. Of p articular concern were the fundin g activities of the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Carnegie, Ford, and Rockefeller Found ations. Perhaps the most startling revelation of that investigation came when Ford Foundation president H. Rowan Gait her admitted to Norman Do dd, staff director of the Congressional Special Comm ittee to Investigate Tax-Exempt Foundations: Of course, you know that we at th e executive level here were, at one time or another, active in either the OSS, the State Department, or the European Economic Administration. During those times, and without exception, we oper ated under directives issued by the White House. We are continuing to be guided by just such directives.... The substance [of these directives] was to the effect that we should make every effort to so alter life in the United States as to make possible a comfor table merger with the Soviet Union.10 At that time — even though the activities of the f oundations coincided exactly with Gaither’s startling admission — it was simply too fantas tic for many Americans to believe. It still is. Asked to assess such information, most American s ask: Why would some of our nati on’s wealthiest and most powerful capitalists use their great fortunes to promote such a goal? This compelling question has stymied many good Americans for decades. If you, too, are perplexed about this seemingly suic idal practice, you will find it explained — and condemned — in the pages that follow. Of one th ing there can be little doubt: Our nation is plunging headlong toward \"convergence\" and the eventual \"mer ger\" referred to by Rowan Gaither many years ago. Simultaneously, our nation — along with the other nati ons of the world — is be ing steadily drawn into the tightening noose of \"int erdependence.\" Our politic al and economic system s are being intertwined and increasingly are being subjecte d to control by the Un ited Nations and its adjunct international organizations. Unless this process can be stopped, it will culminate in the creati on of omnipotent global governance and an \"end to nationhood, \" as Walt Whitman Rostow once phr ased the goal he shared with many others.11 These were (and still are) the ultimate objectives of Gaither, hi s world order cronies, and their modern-day successors. Thirty-five years after Mr. Gaither’s admission, U.S. Senator Jesse Helms (R -NC) warned America o f \"establishment insiders\" who are \"bringing this one-world design — with a convergence of the Soviet and American systems as its centerpiece — into bei ng.\" \"The influence of establishment insiders ove r our foreign policy has become a fact of life in our time,\" the Senator charge d. \"... It is an influence which, if unchecked, could ultimat ely subvert our constitutional or der.\" In this 1987 Senate speech, Senator Helms also identified the organizat ions through which these insiders operate: A careful examination of what is happening be hind the scenes reveal s that all of these interests are working in concert with the mast ers of the Kremlin in order to create what some refer to as a new world order. Private organizations su ch as the Council on Foreign Relations, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, th e Trilateral Commission, the Dartmouth Conference, the Aspen Institute for Hu manistic Studies, the Atlantic Institute, and the Bilderberg Group serve to disseminate an d to coordinate the pl ans for this so-called new world order in powerful business, fina ncial, academic, and official circles.12 Unfortunately, because of the trem endous power that these Establis hment Insiders* wield in our majo r media, Senator Helms’s warning never reached the American peopl e. It was drowned under a flood o f one-world propaganda on the Gorbachev \"revolution\" and the \"new potentia lities\" for world peace throu g h a revived and stren g thened United Nations."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Yet, contrary to the many seductive pro-UN siren songs, the lessons of history about the relationship o f man to government loudly and clear ly proclaim that far from guaranteeing a ne w era of peace and security, the centralization of pol itical and economic pow er on a planetary leve l can only bring about global tyranny and oppression on a scale never before imagined. In late September of 1938, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain journeye d to Germany for his third meeting with Adolph Hitler. Blind to the menace of Hitler ’s \"new world orde r\" (Hitler’s own words),13 Chamberlain returned fr om that now-infamous meeting br andishing an agreement he had signed with der Fuehrer and proudly proclaiming that he ha d won \"peace with honor\" and \"peace fo r our time.\" He was greeted with clamorous huzzahs by British politici ans, the press, and throngs o f citizens who also blindly called th e betrayal \"peace.\" Within months, Europe was convulsed in conflict, and soon even America was dragged into the bloodiest war in world history. The peril America and the free wo rld face today is every bit as real, though far greater in scope, than what a peace-hungry world fa ced in 1938. National sovereignty is threatened as never before. As UN p ower grows, the entire world stands on the brink of an era of totali tarian control. We must pull bac k before it is too la te — too late to save our country, our fr eedoms, our families, and all we hold dear. Here is what this book claims the new world order under the United Nations would mean: z An end to your God-given rights guaranteed by th e U.S. Constitution, i.e ., freedom of religion, speech, press, and assembly, the right to trial by jury, etc. (Chapter 6) z National and personal disarmament along with conscription of U.S. citizens into a United Nations Army or Police Force to serve at the pleasur e of the UN hierarchy. (Chapters 1 and 2) z The end of private property rights and the abilit y to control your own home, farm, or business. (Chapters 6 and 7) z Economic and environmental re gulation at the hands of UN bureaucrats. (Chapter 10) z Loss of your right as pa rents to raise and instruct your childr en in accordance with your personal beliefs. (Chapter 8) z Coercive population control measures that will determine when — or if — you may have children. (Chapter 9) z Unlimited global taxation. (Chapter 10) z A centrally managed world monetary system that will lead all but the ruling elite into poverty. (Chapter 10) z Environmental controls that will mean the end of single family homes and personal automobile ownership. (Chapter 6) z The enthronement of an occult, New Age, new worl d religion. (Chapter 12) z Communist-style totalitarian dict atorship and random, ruthless terror, torture, and extermination to cow all p eo p les into ab j ect submission.

The world’s future need not degenerate into what George Orwell wrote woul d resemble \"a boot stamping on a hum an face — forever!\" But the urge ncy of our situation cannot be overstated.

To most New Yorkers, it simply meant worse than usual traffic jams, as motorcades and security cordons for the many foreign dignitaries on their way to United Nations headqu arters tied up traffic fo r hours. For the rest of America, the bl ur of headlines and evening ne ws sound bites about the need fo r \"collective security\" coming from vi siting potentates gave little hint of the significance of what was transpiring. Yet, this 3,046th meeting of the United Nations Security Council that attracted the dignitaries marked the first time that the body had c onvened at the level of heads of state or government. The exalted group of world leaders representing the five permanent and ten rotating member states o f the Security Council included a king, five presidents, six prime minister s, a chancellor, a premier, and two foreign ministers. They were gathering to la unch a process that should have set off alarms worldwide: the arming of the United Nations. The assemblage took on a religious aura as, one by one, the national leaders worshipped at the UN altar, referred to the UN Charter with a reverence usually reserved for Holy Writ, and recited the by-now- familiar doxology always heard at these increasingly frequent \"sum mits\": new world order; peace, equity, and justice; interdepende nce; global harmony; democracy; human rights; the rule of law; collective engagement; an enhanced a nd strengthened United Nations; etc. President Bush enthusiastically extolled \"the sacred principles enshrined in th e United Nations Charter\" and, recalling its messi anic mission, proclaimed: \"For perhaps th e first time since that hopeful moment in San Francisco, we can look at our Ch arter as a living, breathing document.\"2 The UN's newl y -installed Secretar y -General, E gyp t's Boutros Boutros- Ghali, was no less cau g ht u p with"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"the spiritual purpose of the world organization. He called for additi onal summit-level meetings of the Security Council, since this \"would also help to assure that transfig uration of this house which the world hopes to be completed before its fiftieth annive rsary, in 1995.\"3 How he divined what the world's \"hopes\" for the organization on its 50th birthday mi ght be, he did not say. And he did not have to explain the motive behind his use of Bibl ical metaphor. That wa s transparent enough. Webster defines \"transfigure\" this way: \"to give a new and typically exalted or spiritual appearance to.\" To the Christian mind, of course, \"transfiguration\" recalls the Gospel account of Chri st's manifestation of his divine glory. Boutros-Ghali undoubtedly knows the power of the sy mbolism he chose and, like his fellow true believers in the one-world gos pel, he realized that much more of this evangelization is necessary if the masses are to be sold on the idea of the UN as the world's savior. When his turn at the UN podium ca me, even Boris Yeltsin was appropri ately religious, referring to the organization as \"the political Olympus of the cont emporary world.\"4 Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez proclaimed that \"the United Nations is indispensable to us all.\"5 Presumably, we cannot survive without it. \"This means,\" said Perez, \"placing our trust in its leadership and in it s set-up, as well as in the decision- making machinery. The guiding principl es must be those that inspired its establ ishment, now brought to complete fruition.\"6 That's quite a contrast with the scriptural injunction to \"t rust in the Lord,\" and fa r indeed from the admonitions of our founding fathers to avoid putti ng trust in man (and government) but instead to \"bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution.\"7 A Bigger and Better UN? Such quaint notions as national independence and limitation of govern ment held no sway with these internationalists. The participants in this special convocation of th e Security Council were virtually unanimous in their support of grea tly expanded United Nations powers . This was necessary, they said, b ecause of the rapid \"acceleration of history,\" the \"critical stage\" of current world events, \"global instability,\" \"nuclear proliferation,\" and the many \"t hreats to peace and securi ty\" presented by economic, social, humanitarian, and ecologi cal \"sources of instability.\" The obsolete nation-state is incapable of meeting the world's need s, claimed one speaker after another. Boutros-Ghali explained that in his vision of the new world order, \"State sovereignty takes a new meaning....\" \"[N]arrow nationalism,\" warned the E gyptian, \"can disrupt a peaceful global existence. N ations are too interdependent, na tional frontiers are too porous a nd transnational realities ... too dangerous to permit ego centric isolationism.\"8 Repeated calls were made at this special UN session for increasing th e powers of the Secretary-General, enhancing the jurisdiction of the World Court, expanding the member ship of the Security Council, abolishing the veto power of the five permanent me mbers, establishing a permanent funding mechanism for \"peacekeeping,\" convening a summ it meeting to address social development, increasing economic aid from North to South, and more. Hardly a speaker failed to ha il the \"end of the Cold War\" and the demise of communism, but socialis t thought was still the or der of the day as one leader after anothe r called for greater \"global manageme nt\" and redistribution of wealth. French President Francois Mitterrand made the first concrete proposal to give military teeth to the world body with his call for es tablishing a rapid- deployment UN army. \"I state that for its part France is ready to make available to the Secretar y -General a 1,000-man contin g ent for p eace-kee p in g o p erations, at an y"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"time, on 48-hours notice, \" said the internationalist Frenchman. And to buttress his enthusiasm for a UN military force, he added, \"That figur e could be doubled within a week.\"9 Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens seconded Mitterrand's proposal and announced that \"... Belgium will ensure rapid deployment of Belgia n contingents in United Nations peace-keeping forces.\"10 His idea was immedi ately endorsed by Russian Presid ent Boris Yeltsin and Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky. Going further, Yeltsin declared to the august assemblage: \"I think the time has come to consider creating a global defence system for the wo rld community. It could be based on a reorientati on of the United States Strategic Defense Initiative , to make use of high technologies developed in Russia's defence complex.\" This magnanimous gestur e on his part, said Yeltsin, could be made because \"Russia regards the United States and the West not as me re partners but rather as allies.\"11 To reinforce his contentions that the \"evil empire\" is no more, and th at his new-found devotion to human rights is genuine, Yeltsin announced : \"A few days ago, the 10 remaining political prisoners were p ardoned by a decree of the President of the Russian Federation. There are no longer any prisoners o f conscience in free Russia.\"12 Ther e were no guffaws and no one had the inclination (or the guts) to as k what had happened to the consciences of millions more political , social, and religi ous prisoners still p opulating the gulags. Or why this fo rmer member of the S oviet Politburo wasn't being held accountable for his part in the USSR's long hi story of crimes against humanity. Likewise, when Red Chinese Premie r Li Peng rose to speak of \"hum an rights,\" \"peaceful coexistence,\" and \"social tranquility,\" he was met with respectfu l attentiveness. The Butcher of Tiananmen Square was politely given a world stage for the most outrageous totalitarian pr opaganda. China, he proclaimed, \"will never become a threat to any country or any region of the world. China is of the view that no country should seek hegemony or practice power politi cs.\" His government, he said, looked forward to \"the establishment of a new interna tional order that will be stable, ra tional, just and conducive to world p eace and development.\"13 Not only was he not hooted down, he was granted the prestige of separate meetings with Presidents Bush and Yeltsin and Prime Ministers Major and Miyazawa. Hundreds of Chinese demonstrators w ho came to protest this travesty were kept blocks away from the UN building by security forces. The Los Angeles Times reported the following lamentation uttered by one of the young demonstrators: \"His [Li's] hand is full of the blood and tear s of the Chinese people, and I don't understand why world leaders would shake hands with hi m,\" said a weeping Chai Ling, one of the leaders of the Tian An Men Square pro-democracy demonstrations.14 On the morning following this preced ent-setting Security C ouncil session, the Esta blishment media were ready to peddle the politically co rrect one-world view. For example, Joseph S. Nye Jr., whose Inside r credentials include being the director of the Center for International Affairs, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), a Harvard University pr ofessor, and a former Deputy Under Secretary o f State, led off with an op-ed column in the New York Times entitled, \"Create a U.N.

But Kempster didn't stop there, adding: \"If adopted ... the plan woul d mark the transformation of the Security Council fr om a Cold War- hobbled debating society to an organization with the power to enforce its decisions....\"17 Even more chilling! But not, apparently, to the apostles of one-worldism who have been lustily cheering such p roposals. In the months following the summ it, as the Bush Administration m oved brazenly forward with never- announced plans to supplant the U.S. Constitution with the UN Charte r, the Establishment news media, dominated by members of the Council on Foreign Relations and led by the New York Times , the Washington Post , the Los Angeles Times , and the CFR's own Foreign Affairs , provided both cover and support. So began the audacious propaganda campaign to resurrect a decades-old, one-world scheme to transfer U.S. military might to the United Nations. In its March 6, 1992 lead editorial en titled \"The New World Army,\" the New York Times came close to dropping all pretenses and subtlety: For years the United Nations has been notable mo stly for its vocal cord s. That's changed. Nowadays the U.N.'s muscle - its blue-helme ted soldiers - seems to be everywhere. And costs have soared. The bill for 11 peacekeepin g missions could approach $3.7 billion this year. Never before have so many U.N. troops be en committed to so ma ny costly and diverse missions. But don't get the idea that anyone at the Times is about to let fiscal worr ies stand in the way of its commitment to \"world order\" politic s. The editorial ticked off the cu rrent count of blue-helmeted troops deployed worldwide: In Leba non 5,900; Cyprus 2,200; Golan He ights 1,300; El Salvador 1,000; Iraq/Kuwait 540; Angola 440; Arab-Israel confli ct 300; India/Pakistan 40; Cambodia 22,000; Yugoslavia 14,300; Western Sahara 2,700. This grand tota l of 50,720 UN troops is ju st the start of what these internationalists are planning. Any of these hot spots could, of course, develop into a majo r conflagration at any moment, requiring thousands - or tens of thousands - of UN reinforcements. There are also numerous other tr ouble spots around the globe offeri ng virtually unlimited opportunities for UN intervention: South Africa, Azerbaijan, Li thuania, Nicaragua, Northern Ireland, Korea, and Myanmar. Myanmar? Yes, alt hough you probably remember it by its former name, Burma. The Los A ngeles Times lead editorial for March 16, 1992 carried the title, \"Next Ta rget for World's Conscience: Myanmar - An apocalyptic 'killing fi eld' for the former Burma?\" It si gnaled that we may soon be seeing UN troops, possibly including American men and women, in that tragic land. In the face of all of this suppor t for a UN military ar m, the only protests in Congress about the developing \"New World Army\" questioned merely the financial costs of the peacekeeping operations, including the disproportionate share (a n automatic 30 percent) the U.S. is expected to shoulder. When Secretary of State James Baker a ppeared before a Senate subcommit tee on March 5, 1992 to present the Bush Administration's request for an addi tional $810 million (above the $107 million already appropriated) for peacekeeping in 1992-93, he ran into resistance ev en from traditionally strong UN supporters. Senator Jim Sasser (D -TN) told Baker that although he believed the UN peacekeeping efforts were im p ortant, in this recessionar y econom y , constituent o pp osition to forei g n aid had become"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"\"politically irresistible.\"18 After the hearing, Sasser told an interv iewer, \"Our constituents are saying that they have borne the burden as long as they intend to.\"19 Yes, the bill for the UN's blue helmet operations is escala ting rapidly. \"Yet,\" said the New York Times in its \"New World Army\" editorial, \"in hard cash te rms, peacekeeping is a bargain.... Every war prevented saves blood and treasure, expands ma rkets and trade.\" Though such an argument has a certain simplistic appeal, it breaks dow n rapidly under any close examination. And although the econ omic cost is a legitimate concern, a far more serious matter is the looming UN milita ry threat to U.S. sovereignty. As the Times itself pointed out: \"Now the pe acekeepers are doing more than monitoring truce lines. They are becoming peacemakers, too. U.N. forces were asked to disarm guerrillas, conduct elections and enforce human rights, first in Namibia, then in Cambodia a nd El Salvador.\"20 The UN itself is finding new opportunities right and le ft to justify expansion of its armed forces. \"The Security Council recently expanded th e concept of threats to peace,\" the Times reported, \"to include economic, social and ecological inst ability.\"21 Talk about proliferat ion! This kind of assumed, open- ended authority virtually guarantees unlimited interference by the Un ited Nations in the domestic affairs of sovereign states. And you can be sure that interference won't be directed primarily at stopping human rights violations in repressive comm unist/socialist regimes or petty thir d world dictatorsh ips. It will be directed against what these internationalists consider th e greatest threat to global peace and stability - the United States of America. Yes, America is the target. According to an Associated Press report appearing on March 12, 1992, \"a United Nations official said Wednesday ... that the Un ited States is the greatest threat to the world's ecological health.\" That of ficial, Canadian Maurice F. Strong, who served as secretary-general of the 1992 UN Earth Summit, declared: \"In effect, the United States is co mmitting environmental aggression against the rest of the world.\" He added: \"At the environmental level, the United States is clearly the greatest risk.\"22 This would not be the first or la st time Strong and othe r UN envirocrats would storm against what they consider the evils of U.S. consumption and pr oduction. It has become a standard theme at UN environmental conferences and was the major message at the worl d body's 1992 Earth Su mmit in Brazil. Judging from the vitriol these eco-gl obalists regularly throw at Americans, it's pr obably safe to assume they would eagerly deploy the blue helmets (or as some advocate, environmental police in green helmets) to close down much of the U.S. Will UN \"peacekeepers\" be depl oyed against the U.S. to rectif y economic, social, or ecological \"instabilities\" determined by UN Marxists to be \"t hreats to peace\"? America would never stand for it, you say? But the stage is already being set to render nations incapab le of blocking such moves by the UN. Many of the UN's defenders claim th at the organization can only send in its peacekeeping forces if they are officially invited. Yet, President Bush has alrea dy put the United States on record officially favoring UN action within the borders of s overeign nations. In his \"Pax Un iversalis\" speech delivered at UN headquarters on September 23, 1991, he said there was a need for UN action to settle \"nationalist p assions\" within nations and also to remove an undesirable nationa l leader from his post.23 Even New York Times columnist Leslie Gelb (CFR) found the Presiden t's clearly stated polic y \"revolutionary\" and \"threatening.\"24 According to the CFR globalists, no single nation should have veto power over whether or not the UN should act. Writin g in the S p rin g 1991 Forei g n A ff airs ( \"The U.N. in a New World Order\" ) , Professors"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Bruce Russett and James S. Sutterlin concluded: \"It is worth emphasizing that nothing in the [UN] charter prohibits the Security Council from deploying peacekeeping forces withou t the consent of all the p arties, or from including troop contingents from the permanent members of th e council in such forces where the need for deterrence arises .\" If this attitude prevails, UN eco-saviors can first declare you r factory, your logging, ranching or farming practices, or even your use of an automobile a threat to the environment, and then decide under authority derived from the new de finition of \"peacekeeping\" to send in the blue (or green) helmet ed troops to address the br each of \"peace\" with force. The Great Mutation Although the UN has not yet used a ny of this steadily building \"peacek eeping\" muscle for enforcement of environmental or social dicta, the precedent for uninvited interven tion has already b een established under the assumed authority of \"peacekeeping.\" As Los Angeles Times columnist William Pfaf f observed in his March 5, 1992 column appearing in the International Herald Tribune , the 1992 UN action in what was once Yugoslavi a is a signal event, representi ng an overturning of national sovereignty. \"Slowly, too slowly, th e great mutation occurs,\" said Pf aff. \"The principle of absolute national sovereignty is being overturned.... The civil wa r in Yugoslavia has rendered this service to us.\" Pfaff, a committed internationalist , applauded the UN's \"uninvited in ternational intervention into the affairs of a state\" which, until now, \"has been held an unacceptable attack upon the principle o f unlimited state sovereignt y.\" He saw the intervention of th e European Communi ty and the UN in Yugoslavia as a new model of colle ctive action that has many other potential applications. \"What they have thus far done has been improvisation, but it is a start on something new,\" the Paris- b ased columnist noted approvingly. \"We are now in a situation wher e improvisation and experi ment are essential, in contrast to the big programm atic reforms of 1918 and 1945 - the League and the U.N.\" The \"improvisation\" Pfaff and his fello w globalists talk about is hardly spontaneous and is eminently p redictable; it involves the expansion and concentr ation of the UN's politi cal, economic, and military p owers in response to global or re gional or even local \"crises.\" The excuse for UN \"peacekeeping\" action in a crisis invo lving civil war and et hnic fighting is the supposed potential for the confli ct to escalate to global dimensi ons if not checked by collective international force. \"What ma y now be needed,\" said the New York Times in its March 6, 1992 editorial, \"is a permanent force for rapid deploym ent in chaotic circumstances.\" The Times editorial continued: \"One promising possibility is to make fuller us e of the U.N. Charter. Article 43 already calls on members to make available 'armed forces, assistance and facilities' ne cessary to maintain international p eace. To that end, the Charter establ ished a Military Staff Committee....\" But, lamented the Times , this UN committee has never worked as intended, because \"American arme d forces have traditionally resisted [i t] as a threat to command autonom y.\" Again, the far greater threat to national security and sovereignty was ignored. \"But in a transformed world,\" continued the Times editorial, \"it makes sense to consider direct contributions of personne l and equipment to a rapi d deployment force under r eal multinational control.\" Going still further, the article proposed that the UN military force be expanded with funds taken from the U.S. defense budget instead of from its foreign aid budget. \"That won't be easy,\" the Times . \"But what a chance for President Bush to take the lead in giving real meaning to his still hazy vision of a New World Order.\" A Lon g -Established Polic y"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The only haze surrounding either Mr. Bu sh's or that newspaper's vision of the new world order is that which they have deliberately creat ed. They know that the real subs tance of the new world order was very clearly presented in 1961, more than 30 years ago, when Pr esident John F. Kennedy presented his p lan for national disarmament to th e United Nations. Crafted by his CF R -dominated State Department and entitled Freedom From War: The United States Pr ogram for General and Complete Disarmamen t in a Peaceful World (also known as Department of State Publication 7277), it presented a three-stage p rogram for the gradual transfer of U.S. arms to the United Nations.25 During Stage II (the stage we are currently in), the document mandat es: \"The U.N. Peace Force shall be established and progressive ly strengthened.\" This w ill be accomplished \"to the end that the United N ations can effectively in Stage II I deter or suppress any threat or use of force in violation of the p urposes and principles of the United Nations.\"26 This incredible policy - which has been actively but quietly brought along toward completion during successive administrations - concludes as follows: In Stage III progressive contro lled disarmament ... would proc eed to a point where no state would have the military power to challenge the progressively strengthened U.N. Peace Force.27 F reedom From Wa r was superseded in April 1962 by a nother disarmament document entitled B lueprin t f or the Peace Race: Outline of Basic Provisions of a Treaty on General and Complete Disarmament in a P eaceful World. 28 As before, its third stage calls for the stre ngthening of the UN Peace Force \"until it had sufficient armed forces and arma ments so that no state could challe nge it.\"29 That means, of course, that upon completion of this partia lly completed plan, every nation st ate, including the United States, would be subject to the unchallengeable milita ry forces of the all- powerful United Nations. But that was long ago; perhaps those policies and proposals have expired. Although that may be a comforting thought, unfortunately it is not true. On May 25, 1982, Congressman Ted Weiss (D-NY) called for the implementation of Blueprint for the Peace Race and entered its entire text into the Congressional Record. 30 He also pointed out that this disa rmament proposal had never been formally withdrawn by the United States government. When questioned about the co mmitment of the United States to the Blueprint , A. Richard Richstein, General Coun sel to the U.S. Arms Control an d Disarmament Agency, confirme d in a letter on May 11th of that year that \"the United States has neve r formally withdraw n this proposal.\"31 In January 1991, William Nary, the of ficial historian of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, confirmed again that \"the proposal has not been withdrawn.\" Mr. Na ry also confirmed that \"certain features of it have been incorporated into subsequent disarmament agreements.\"32 Indeed, significant portions of this long-range disarmamen t program have been al ready enacted into law. On September 23, 1961, Congress passe d the \"Arms Control and Disarm ament Act,\" which was signed into law (Public Law 87-297) on September 26th by President Kenne dy. According to the wording o f the law itself, its purpose was to establish a U.S. Arms Contro l and Disarmament Agency that would advance efforts \"toward ult imate world disarmament.\" But, is the objective really \"world disarmament\"? How can it be? Like Freedom From War , P.L. 87-297 calls not for the to tal elimination of arms - a completely utopian fantasy - but the transfer of arms from national to inte rnational control. Section 3 (a) of the Act states: The terms \"arms control\" a nd \"disarmament\" mean the id entification, verification,"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"inspection, limitation, control, reduction, or elimination, of armed forces and armaments of all kinds under international agreement ... to establish an effectiv e system of international control....\" [Emphasis added] By December 11, 1989, when President Bush signed the \"Arms Control and Disarmament Amendments Act of 1989\" (Public Law 101-216), the original Kennedy Administrati on legislation had already been amended nearly 20 times. This st eadily growing body of law is moving us step by step toward surrende r to a global UN military dictatorship. Like the original Act, the 1989 amendment contains the language \"identification ... elimination\" of \"a rmaments of all kinds.\" Questions rush to the fore. Such as: Could the phrase \"armaments of all kinds\" be construed at some future date by a federal court or the UN's World Court to include the personal arms of private citizens? In view of the increasing onslaught of state and federal anti-gun legislation, the j udicial activism of the federal courts, and the total absence in the UN Charter and UN \"Rights\" docum ents of any protecti on similar to our Seco nd Amendment guarantee of the right to keep and bear arms, it could hardly be considered extreme to consider the possibility. For apostles of the new worl d order, perhaps the closest thing to holy writ, and the scripture to which they all pay homage, is the 1958 volume World Peace Through World Law by Grenville Clark and Louis B. Sohn.33 In this venerated text, Clark and Sohn proposed a socialist world government through a revised UN Charter. The key to this global superstate would be a United Nations \"world police force\" invested with \"a coercive for ce of overwhelming power.\" \"This wo rld police force would be the only military force permitted anywhere in the world after the process of national disarmament has been completed.\" And what about the civi lian police and private firearms owners? The authors warned \"that even with the complete elim ination of all [national] military forces,\" local \"police forces, supplemented b y civilians armed with sporting rifl es and fowling pieces, might concei vably constitute a serious threat to a neighboring country....\" (Emphasis in original ) Accordingly, they recommend extremely rigid controls on all firearms and ammunition possessed by civil police and private citizens.34 Top Military Post If these proposals are impl emented, who will control these supreme United Nati ons forces? Isn't that a question everyone should be concerne d with? In the past, the person in charge of all UN military activities has been the UN Under-Sec retary-General for Political and S ecurity Council Affairs. Since the UN was created, 14 individuals have held that post. All have been communist s and all but one have come from the Soviet Union. This is no coincidence. -General Trygve Lie revealed that U.S. Secretary o f State Edward Stettinius (C FR) had agreed to naming a Soviet nati onal to this strategic post, which Lie described as \"the premier Assistan t Secretaryship.\"35 Lie said he fi rst learned of the agreement from Soviet representative Andrei Vish insky, and that \"Mr. Stettinius c onfirmed to me that he had agreed with the Soviet Delegation in the matter.\"36 The surprised Secretary-General Lie wrote: The preservation of intern ational peace and security wa s the Organization's highest responsibility, and it was to entrusting the di rection of the Secretar iat department most concerned with this to a S oviet national that the Americ ans had agreed. What did the Americans want for themselves ? To my surprise, they di d not ask for a department concerned with comparable subs tantive affairs, like the econom ic or the social. Rather, Mr. Stettinius proposed that an Am erican citizen be appointed A ssistant Secretary-General for the Administrative and Financial Services.37 The communists have remained in control ever since, even though, Lie maintained, this was not intended as a permanent arrangement.

The IPS duo quoted the Freedom From War Stage III passage (\"No state shal l have the military power ...\") and declared: \"We could refine and im plement the ... disarmament plan by requiring all countries to cut defense budgets by, say, 15%-20% per ye ar.\" Those nations that refused to go along \"could be penalized with economic sanctions or - in th e extreme - milita ry intervention.\" UN Leader Paves the Way At the close of the special S ecurity Council meeting convened on January 31, 1992, S ecretary-General Boutros-Ghali was instructed by the Council to pr epare by July 1st his \"r ecommendations on ways o f strengthening\" the UN's peacekeep ing capabilities. In June, the energetic Egyptian completed his assignment and issued An Agenda for Peace. 38 A more apt title would have been, An Agenda for Globa l Socialistic Rule . Signaling a new direc tion, the report notes that, in th e past, \"United Nations operations in areas of crisis have generally been established after conflict has occurre d.\" But now, the \"time has come to plan for circumstances warranting preven tive deployment.\" The Secretary-General explains: Under Article 42 of the Charter, the Security Council has the authority to take military action to maintain or restore international peace and security. While such action should only be taken when all peaceful mean s have failed, the option of ta king it is essential to the credibility of the United Nations as a guarantor of inte rnational security. Th is will require ... special agreements ... whereby Member States undertake to ma ke armed forces, assistance and facilities availabl e to the Security Council ... not only on an ad hoc basis but on a permanent basis .39 [Emphasis added] As a sop to anyone concerned about national independence, he promised : \"The foundation-stone of this work is and must remain the Stat e. Respect for its fundamental sove reignty and integr ity are crucial to any common international progress.\" But in the next breath, he showed his real intentions by noting, \"The time of absolute and exclusive sovereignty ... ha s passed.\"40 Yes, national sovereignty will remain, but only as defined by the United Nations . As the Secretary-General himself said, the concept o f sovereignty \"takes a new meaning.\" The new agenda championed by the UN 's top official calls for \"a Unit ed Nations capable of maintaining international peace and security, of securing justice and human ri ghts and of promoting ... 'social p rogress and better standards of life in larger freedom.'\"41 If that sounds to you like th e globalists intend to blur the distinction between foreign and domesti c matters, then you have begun to grasp the evolving meaning of \"peacekeeping,\" \"pe acemaking,\" and \"peacebuilding.\" For further evidence that the UN leader inte nds the world body to beco me a global Big Brothe r meddling in every aspect of our lives, consider the following from the Boutros-Ghali report: \"The sources of conflict and wa r are pervasive and deep.... To reach them will require our utmost effort ... to p romote sustainable economic a nd social development....\"42 In what social or economic spheres, if any, will the world orderites not find a pretext for intervention? According to the new UN agenda, there are none. Am ong the \"new risks for stability\" listed by the Secretary-General are \"e cological damage\" and \"disruption of family and community life.\" Othe r \"sources of conflict\" include \"unchecked population gr owth,\" \"drugs and the growing disparity between rich and poor,\" \"[p]overty, disease, famine,\" \"drought,\" \"a porous ozone shield,\" and about anything else you might imagine.43 Accordin g to the UN leader, \"t he efforts of the Or g anization to build p eace, stabilit y and securit y must"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"encompass matters beyond military thr eats in order to break the fetters of strife and warfare that have characterized the past.\"44 In other words, under the ne w UN definitions of \"pea cekeeping,\" virtually any circumstance or condition in any part of the world might conceivably constitute a \"risk for stability\" or a \"threat\" to peace, and therefore justify UN intervention, including military intervention. What is so incredible about all of this is not the arrogance and effr ontery of Boutros-Ghali and his many like-minded associates in proposing such a colossal power gr ab. What else can be expected from a gang of megalomaniacs? The far more incr edible feature of this developing nightmare is the almost complete ignorance of, and near total absence of opposition to it. What should be strikingly obvious to anyone - p articularly to Americans, who s hould have a special a ppreciation for the limi tation of governmental force - is that an orga nization powerful enough to enforce worl d \"peace\" would also be powerful enough to enforce world tyranny. No organizati on should ever have that kind of power! Americans should have been shocke d and outraged then, when Presiden t Bush, in his address to the United Nations General Assembly on Septem ber 21, 1992, announced: \"I welcome the Secretary General's call for a new agenda to strengthen the United Nations' ability to prevent, contain, and resolve conflict across the globe.... Robust peace-keeping requires men and equi pment that only member states can provide.... These forces must be available on short notice at the request of the Security Council....\" Mr. Bush said the challenges \"as we enter the 21st century\" will \"requi re us to transf orm our collective institutions.\" He pledged to wo rk with the UN \"to best employ our considerable lift, logistics, communications, and intelligence capabilities,\" and stated: \"The United States is prepared to make available our bases and faci lities for multinational training and fi eld exercises. One such base, nearby, with facilities is Fort Dix.\"45 Other than the John Birch Society, which has warned about these im pending developments for decades, very few have raised a voice to spread the alarm. One who has is syndicated columnist Sam Francis. Commenting on An Agenda for Peace , he wrote: \"If Amer icans would like to preserve the national independence and sovereignty they a nd their forebears have fought for, they need to pull down the one- world monstrosity Boutros-Ghali is planning before he and his planners have a chance to build it.\"46 And to that every freedom-loving American should say, Amen!

What they saw was a grim, menacing portrayal of life in our nation after it had been taken ove r by a Soviet-controlled United Nations force. Their TV sets showed a foreboding picture of America as an occupied police-state, complete with concen tration camps, brainwashing, neighborhood spies, and Soviet-UN troops, tanks and helicopter guns hips enforcing \"the rule of law.\" Liberals angrily denounced the mini-series, cla iming it demonized both th e Soviets and the UN an d insisting that it would re kindle anti-communist hysteri a at a time when Soviet -American relations were at their best point since the end of World War II. The fact that Sovi et troops were at that very time committing real atrocities against the peoples of Afghanistan didn' t matter. UN offici als, furious about the way their organization was being portrayed, even tried to have the program cancelled.2 Why all the furor? Is the UN's imag e so sacrosanct or th e goal of U.S.-Soviet ra pprochement so sacred that even fictional tarnishing is akin to blasphemy ? After all, it was just a television program. Haven't there been scores of hi ghly acclaimed Hollywood productions depi cting the U.S. mili tary and American p atriots in similarly bad or ev en far worse light? Besides, th e totalitarianism depicted in Amerika could never happen here. Could it? Dress Rehearsal? You may be surprised to learn that it has already happened here . No, not in the sa me manner and on the same scale as viewers saw in the tele vision series, but in an alarming real-lif e parallel of that dramatic p roduction. What follows is the true , but little-known story of the \"i nvasion\" of about a dozen American cities by \"UN forces,\" as told by economis t/author Dr. V. Orval Watts in his 1955 book, The Unite d N ations: Planned Tyrann y . At Fort MacArthur, California, and in other centers, consid erable numbers of American military forces went into training in 1951 as \"Military Government Reserve Units.\" What they were for may appear from their pract ice maneuvers during th e two years, 1951-1952. Their first sally took place on July 31, 1951, when they simulated an invasion and seizure of nine California cities: Co mpton, Culver City, Inglewood, Hawthorne, Huntington Park, Long Beach, Redondo Beach, South Gate and Torrance. The invading forces, however, did not fly the American flag. Th ey came in under the flag of the United Nations, and their officers stated that they re presented the United Nations. These forces arrested the mayors and police ch iefs, and pictures later appeared in the newspapers showing these men in jail. The officers i ssued manifestoes read ing \"by virtue of the authority vested in me by the United Na tions Security Council.\" At Huntington Park the y held a fla g -raisin g ceremon y , takin g down the American fla g and runnin g u p in its"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"place the United Nations banner. On April 3, 1952, other units did the same thi ng at Lampasas, Texas. They took over the town, closed churches, strutted their aut hority over the teachers and posted guards in classrooms, set up concentrati on camps, and interned busine ssmen after holding brief one- sided trials without habeas corpus . Said a newspaper report of that Texas invasion: \"But the stag ed action almost became actual drama when one student and tw o troopers forgot it was only make-be lieve. 'Ain't nobody going to make me get up,' cried John Snell, 17, his face beet-red. One of the paratroopers shoved the butt of his rifle wi thin inches of Snell's face and snarled, 'You want this butt placed in your teeth? Get up.'\" The invaders put up posters listing many offe nses for which citize ns would be punished. One of them read: \"25. Publishi ng or circulating or having in his possession with intent to publish or circulate, any printed or written matter ... hostile, detrimental, or disrespectful ... to the Government of any ot her of the United Nations.\" Think back to the freedom-of-speech clause of the United States Co nstitution which every American officer and official is sworn to support and defe nd. What was in the minds of those who prepared, approved and posted these UN proclamations? The third practice seizure under the United Nations flag occu rred at Watertown, New York, August 20, 1952, more than a year later than the first ones. It followed the same pattern set in the earlier seizures in California and Texas. Is this a foretaste of World Government, which so many American s seem to want?3 Who ordered these \"mock\" UN invasions? And to what purpose we re they carried out? Do answers to these questions really matter? Or ar e these merely idle concerns about curious but irrelevant events that happened decades ago and have no bearing on our lives today? Events, developments, and official policies in the succeeding years, un der both Republican and Democratic administrations, indicate that the mock invasions of the early 1950s do matter and that they do have a bearing on our li ves today. The dress-rehearsal takeovers of American cities described above occurred just six years after th e founding of the United Nations, while the organi zation was still enjoying widespread public support. American military personnel were at that very time fighting and dying under the UN flag in Korea. Bu t as recounted in our previous ch apter, a decade later in Septembe r of 1961, the President of the United States would propose a phased transf er of America's military forces to the UN. Under such a plan, our Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, even our nuclear arsenal, would be given over to UN command, making it possible for our nation' s military forces to be used in a real UN invasion at some future da te anywhere in the world. Interestingly, the Kennedy Freedom From War plan differed little from one proposed earlier that same month by the Soviet-dominated \"nonaligned\" nations at a conference held in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.4 And it was merely an expansion of the policy enunc iated by Secretary of State Christian Herter (CFR) during the latter days of the Ei senhower Administration. Bu t few Americans even saw, and fewer still ever read and understood the incredible disarmam ent document. For those who did see, read and understand it, however, there could be no doubt that it created a p ath leadin g to g lobal ."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"If the American public had been aware of Freedom From War and a number of then-classifie d government studies being pr epared at that time - each of which sp elled out even more explicitly the intent of government and Establishment elitists to surrender Americ a to an all-powerfu l United Nations - there may well have been a popular uprising that would ha ve swept all of the in ternationalist schemers from public office and public trust. In February 1961, seven months befo re the President released the Freedom From War plan to the public, his State Department, led by Secretary of State Dean Rusk (CFR), hired the private Institute for Defense Analyses (contract No. SCC 28270) to prepare a st udy showing how disarmament could be employed to lead to world government. On March 10, 1962, th e Institute delivered Study Memorandum No. 7, A World Effectively Controlled By the United Nations , written by Lincoln P. Bloomfield (CFR).5 Dr. Bloomfield had himself recently serv ed with the State Department's disarmament staff, and while writing his important work was servi ng as an associate professor of polit ical science and director of the Arms Control Project at the Center for Internati onal Studies, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This Bloomfield/IDA report is esp ecially significant because the aut hor is uncharacter istically candid, eschewing the usual euphemisms, code words, a nd double-talk found in t ypical \"world order\" p ronouncements meant for public consumption. The author believed he was addressing fellow internationalists in a classified memorandum that would never be made avai lable for public scrutiny. So he felt he could speak plainly. Here is the document's opening passage, labelled SUMMARY : A world effectively controlled by the United Nations is one in which \"world government\" would come about through the esta blishment of supranational in stitutions, characterized by mandatory universal membership and some ab ility to employ physic al force. Effective control would thus entail a pr eponderance of political power in the hands of a supranational organization.... [T]he present UN Charter could theoretically be revised in order to erect such an organization equal to the task envisa ged, thereby codifying a radical rearrangement of power in the world. Dr. Bloomfield was still fudging a little as he began. The phrase \"som e ability to employ physical force\" was more than a slight understatement, as the bulk of the report makes abundantly clear. He continued: The principal features of a m odel system would include the fo llowing: (1) powers sufficient to monitor and enforce disarmament, settle di sputes, and keep the p eace - including taxing powers - with all other powers re served to the nations; (2) an international force, balanced appropriately among ground, sea, air, and space elements, consisting of 500,000 men, recruited individually, wearing a UN uniform, and controll ing a nuclear force composed of 50-100 mixed land-based mobile and undersea-b ased missiles, averaging one megaton per weapon; (3) governmental power s distributed among three br anches...; (4) compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court....6 \"The notion of a 'UN-controlled wo rld' is today a fantastic one,\" th e professor wrote. \"... Political scientists have generally come to despair of quantum jumps to worl d order as utopian and unmindful o f p olitical realities. But fr esh minds from military, scientific, a nd industrial life ... have sometimes found the logic of world government - and it is world gove rnment we are discussing here - inescapable.\"7 Dr. Bloomfield then cited Christ ian Herter's speech of February 18, 1960, in which the Secretary o f State called for disarmament \"to the p oint where no sin g le nation or g rou p of nations could effectivel y"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"oppose this enforcement of internat ional law by international machin ery.\"8 To this CFR-affiliated academic, who had recen tly worked for the disarmament agency where Herter's speech had most likely been written, there was no question about the m eaning of the Secretary of State's words. \"Here, then,\" said Bloomfield, \"is the basis in recent American policy for the notion of a world 'effectively controlled by the United Nations.' It was not made explic it, but the United States position carried the unmistakable meaning, by whatever name, of world governme nt, sufficiently powerful in any event to keep the peace an d enforce its judgments.\"9 Then, to be absolutely certain th at there would be no confusion or misunderstanding about his meaning, he carefully defined his terms: \"World\" means that the system is global, with no exceptions to its fiat: universal membership. \"Effectively controlled\" connote s ... a relative monopoly of physical force at the center of the system, and thus a prepondera nce of political power in the hands of a supranational organization.... \"The United Na tions\" is not necessarily precisely the organization as it now exists.... Finally, to avoid endless euphemism and evasive verbiage, the contemplated regime will occasionally be referred to unblus hingly as a \"world government .\"10 [Emphasis added] If government is \"force\" - as George Washington so simply and accurately defi ned it - then worl d government is \"world force.\" Whic h means that Bloomfield and thos e who commissioned his report and agreed with its overall recommendations wanted to create a global entity wi th a monopoly of force - a p olitical, even militar y power undisputedly superior to any singl e nation-state or any possible alliance o f national or regional forces. It is as simple as that. \"The appropriate degree of relati ve force,\" the Bloomfield/IDA st udy concluded, \"would ... involve total disarmament down to police and internal security levels for the constitue nt units, as against a significant conventional capability at the center backed by a marginally significant nuclear capability.\"11 Again and again as the following excerpts demonstrat e, the study drives its essential points home: z \"National disarmament is a condition sine qua non for effective UN cont rol.... [W]ithout it, effective UN control is not possible.\"12 z \"The essential point is the transfer of the most vital element of sovereign power from the states to a supranational government.\"13 z \"The overwhelming central fact would still be the loss of cont rol of their military power by individual nations.\"14 Putting Theory Into Practice While Dr. Bloomfield was still wri ting his treatise for global rule, the hapless residents of a small corne r of Africa were experiencing the terr ible reality of \"a world effectivel y controlled by the United Nations.\" The site chosen for the debut of the UN's version of \"peacekeeping\" was Katanga, a province in what was then known as the Belgian C ongo. The center of world attenti on 30 years ago, th e name Katanga draws a complete blank fr om most peop le today. Katanga and its tragic e xperience have been expunge d from history, consigned to the memory hole. The re g ion a pp ears on toda y 's ma p s as the Province of Shaba in Za ire. But for one brief, shinin g moment, the"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"courageous people in this infant nation stood as th e singular testament to th e capability of the newly independent Africans to govern themselves as free people with a sense of peace, order, and justice. While all around them swir led a maelstrom of violent, communist -inspired revolution and bloody tribal warfare, the Katangese distinguished themselves as a paradigm of racial, tribal, and class harmony.15 What they stood for could not be tolerated by the forc es of \"anti-colonialism\" in the Kremlin, the U.S. State Department, the Western news media, and especially the United Nations.16 The stage was already set for the horrible drama that would soon unf old when Belgium's King Baudouin announced independence for the Be lgian Congo on June 30, 1960. The Sovi ets, who had been agitating and organizing in the Congo for y ears, were ready. Patrice Lumumb a was their man, bought and paid fo r with cash, arms, luxuries, and all the women, gin, a nd hashish he wanted. With his Soviet and Czech \"diplomats\" and \"technicians\" who swarmed all over the Congo, Lumumba was able to control the Congo elections.17 With Lumumba as premier and Joseph Kasavubu as pr esident, peaceful independence lasted one week. Then Lumumba unleashed a communist reign of te rror against the populace, murdering and torturing men, women, and children. Amidst this sea of carnage and terror, the province of Katanga remained, by comparison, an island of peace, order, and stability. U nder the able leadership of the courageous Moise Kapenda Tshombe, Katanga declar ed its independence from the central Congolese regime. \"I am seceding from chaos,\" declared President Tshombe, a de vout Christian and an ar dent anti-communist.18 These were the days when the whole world witnessed th e cry and the reality of \"s elf determination\" as it swept through the Africa n continent. Anyone should have expe cted that Katanga's declaration o f independence would have been gree ted with the same huzzahs at th e UN and elsewh ere that simila r declarations from dozens of communist revolutionary movement s and pip-squeak dictatorships had evoked. But it was Tshombe's misfortune to be pro-Western, pro-fr ee enterprise, and pro- constitutionally limited government at a time when the governments of both the U.S. and the USSR were supporting Marxist \"liberators\" throughout the world. Nikita Khrushchev declared Tshombe to be \"a turncoat, a traitor to the interests of the Congolese people.\"19 American liber als and the rabble at the UN dutifully echoed the hue and cry. To our nation's everlasting shame, on July 14, 1960, th e U.S. joined with the USSR in support of a UN resolution authorizing the world body to send tr oops to the Congo.20 These troops were used, not to stop the bloody reign of terror being visited on the re st of the Congo, but to assist Lumumba, the chie f terrorist, in his efforts to subjugate Katanga. With in four days of the pa ssage of that resolution, thousands of UN troops were flown on U.S. trans ports into the Congo, where they joined in the campaign against the only island of sanity in all of black Africa. Smith Hempstone, African correspondent for the Chicago Daily News , gave this firsthand account of the December 1961 UN attack on Elisa, the capital of Katanga: The U.N. jets next turned thei r attention to the cent er of the city. Scre aming in at treetop level ... they blasted the post office and the radio station, severing Katanga's communications with the outside world....

The child's face and belly had been smashed to jelly by mortar fragments.21 The 46 doctors of Elisabethville - Belgian, Swiss, Hungarian, Braz ilian, and Spanish - unanimously issued a joint report indicting the Un ited Nations atrocities against innocent civili ans. This is part o f their account of a UN attack on a hospital: The Shinkolobwe hospital is visibly marked wi th an enormous red cross on the roof.... In the maternity, roof, ceilings, walls, beds, tabl es and chairs are ri ddled with bullets.... 4 Katangan women who had just been delive red and one new-born child are wounded, a visiting child of 4 years old is killed ; two men and one child are killed....22 The UN atrocities escalated. Unfort unately, we do not have space here to devote to relating more of the details of this incredibly viciou s chapter of UN history - even though the progress toward establishing a p ermanent UN army makes full know ledge of every part of it mo re vital than ever. Among the considerable body of additiona l testimony about the atroci ties, we highly recommend The Fearfu l Master by G. Edward Griffin; Who Killed the Congo? by Philippa Schuyler; R ebels, Mercenaries, an d D ividends by Smith Hempstone; and 46 Angry Men by the 46 doctors of Elisabeth. In 1962, a private group of American s, outraged at our govern's acti ons against the freedom-seeking Katangese, attempted to capture on film the tr uth about what was happening in the Congo. They p roduced Katanga: The Untold Story , an hour-long documentary narrat ed by Congressman Donald L. Jackson. With newsreel footage and testimony from eyewitnesses, including a compelling interview with Tshombe himself, the program exposed the criminal activities a nd brutal betrayal perpetrated on a p eaceful people by the Kennedy Admi nistration, other Western leader s, and top UN officials. It documents the fact that UN (incl uding U.S.) planes deliberately bombed Katanga's schools, hospitals, and churches, while UN troops machine-gunned and ba yoneted civilians, sc hool children, and Red Cross workers who tried to help the wounded. This film is now avai lable on videotape,23 and is \"must- viewing\" for Americans who are de termined that this land or any other land shall never experience similar UN atrocities. After waging three major offensiv e campaigns against th e fledgling state, th e UN \"peace\" forces overwhelmed Katanga and forced it back under communist rule. Ev en though numerous international observers witnessed and publicly pr otested the many atrocities committe d by the UN's forces, the world b ody has never apologized for or ad mitted to its wrongdoing. In fact, the UN and its internationalist cheering section continue to refer to this shamef ul episode as a resounding success.24 Which indeed it was, if one keeps in mind the true goal of the organization. Following the Policy Line Why did the government of the United States side with the Sovi et Union and the United Nations in thei r support of communists Lumumba and Kasavubu a nd their denunciation of Tshombe? Why did ou r nation supply military assistance to and an official endorsement of the UN's military action against Katanga? The answer to both questio ns is that our government was guided by the same \"world order\" p olicy line laid out by the New York Times in its hard-to-believe ed itorial of August 16, 1961: [W]e must seek to discoura g e anti-Communist revolts in orde r to avert bloodshed and war."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"We must, under our own principles, live with evil even if by doing so we help to stabilize tottering Communist regimes, as in East Germany, and perhaps even expose citadels of freedom, like West Berlin, to slow death by strangulation.25 Further elaboration on this theme is revealed in a 1963 study conducted for the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency by th e Peace Research Instit ute. Published in Apri l of that year, here's what our tax dollars produced: Whether we admit it to ourselves or not, we be nefit enormously from the capability of the Soviet police system to keep law and order over the 200 million odd Ru ssians and the many additional millions in the sate llite states. The break-up of the Russian Communist empire today would doubtless be conducive to fr eedom, but would be a good deal more catastrophic for world order....26 \"We benefit enormously?\" Who is th is \"we\"? Certainly not the Ameri can taxpayer, who carried the tax burden for the enormous military expenditures needed to \"contain\" Soviet expansionism. And who determined that freedom must be sa crificed in the name of \"world order\"? Dr. Bloomfield, in the same classifi ed IDA study cited earlier, again let the world-government cat out o f the bag. If the communists remained too militant and threatening, he observed, \"the subordination o f states to a true world government appears impossible; but if the communist dynamic were greatly abated, the West might well lose whatever incentive it has for world government .\"27 (Emphasis added) In other words, the world order Insiders were faced with the following conundrum: How do we make the Soviets menacing enough to convin ce Americans that world governme nt is the only answer because confrontation is untenable; but, at the same time, not make the S oviets so menacing that Americans would decide to fight rather than b ecome subject to communist tyrants? Are we unfairly stretching these admi ssions? Not at all. Keep in mi nd that from the end of World Wa r II, up to the very time these statements were bei ng written, the communists ha d brutally added Albania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Poland, Roma nia, Czechoslovakia, North Kor ea, Hungary, East Germany, China, Tibet, North Vietnam, and Cuba to their satellite empire and were aggressively instigating revolutions throughout Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. And, as was later demonstrated by the historical rese arch of Dr. Antony Sutton and other scholars, all o f these Soviet conquests had been im measurably helped by massive and continuous transfusions from the West to the Kremlin of money, cr edit, technology, and scientific knowledge.28 It was arranged for and p rovided by the same CF R -affiliated policy elitis ts who recognized in the \"communist dynamic\" they created an \"incentive\" for the people in the West to accept \"world government.\" Project Phoenix The U.S. Departments of Stat e and Defense funded numerous other studies about U.S.-USS R convergence and world order under UN control. In 1964, the surfacing of the Project Phoenix reports generated sufficient constituent c oncern to prompt several members of Congress to protest the funding of such studies.29 But there was not enough pressure to force Congress to launch full investigations that could have led to putting an end to taxpayer funding of these serious attacks on American security and our constitutional s y stem of g overnment."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Produced by the Institute for Defense Analyses for th e U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, the Phoenix studies openly advocated \" unification\" of the U.S. and USSR .30 The following passages taken from Study Phoenix Paper dated June 4, 1963 leaves no doubt about this goal: Unification - ... At present the a pproach ... may appear so radical that it will be dismissed out of hand; nevertheless , its logical sim-plicity ... is so co mpelling that it seems to warrant more systematic .... Today, the United States and the Soviet Union combined have for all practical purposes a near monopoly of force in the world. If the use and direction of this power could somehow be synchronized, stability and, indeed even unity might be within reach.31 The Phoenix studies, like many other government re ports before and after, urged increased U.S. economic, scientific, and ag ricultural assistance to the Soviet Union. These recommendations are totally consistent with the long-range \"m erger\" plans admitted to a decade before by Ford Foundation President Rowan Gaither. And both Republican and Democratic administrations have fo llowed the same overall p olicy ever since. But world order thin k -tank specialists like Bloomfield realized that the incremental p rogress made through these program s was too slow. He even lament ed that reaching the final goal \"could take up to two hundred years.\"32 Bloomfield then noted that there was \"an alternate road\" to merger and eventual wo rld government, one that \"relies on a grave crisis or wa r to bring about a sudden transforma tion in national attitudes sufficient for the purpose.\"33 The taxpayer-funded academic e xplained that \"the orde r we examine may be brought into existence as a result of a seri es of sudden, nasty, and traumatic shocks.\"34 Incredible? Impossible? Couldn't happen here? Many Americans t hought so 30 years ago - before \"perestroika,\" the Persian Gulf War, propaganda about global warming, and other highly publicized developments. But by the fall of 1990, Newsweek magazine would be reporti ng on the emerging reality of \"Superpowers as Super\" and \"a new order.... th e United States and the Soviet Union, united for crisis management around the globe.\"35 (Emphasis added) In a seeming tipping of his hat to Bloomfield, President Bush woul d state in his official August 1991 report, National Security Strategy of The United States : \"I hope history will reco rd that the Gulf crisis was the crucible of the new world order.\"36 The CFR's house academics were al ready beating the convergence dr ums. Writing in the Winter 1990 issue of Foreign Policy (published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace), Thomas G. Weiss (CFR) and Meryl A. Kessler exhorted: \"If Washington is to se ize the full potential of this opportunity, it will have to ... begin to treat the Soviet Union as a real partner.\" The long-planned partnership began to take form officially with the si gning of \"A Char ter for American- Russian Partnership and Friendshi p\" by Presidents Bush and Yelts in on June 17, 1992. Among the many commitments for joint action in this agreement, we find the following: z \"... Summit meetings will be held on a regular basis\"; z \"The United States of America and the Russia n Federation recognize the importance of the United Nations Security Council\" and support \"t he strengthening of UN peace-keeping\"; z The p arties are determined \"to coo p erate in the develo p ment of ballistic missile defense"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"capabilities and technologies,\" a nd work toward creation of a jo int \"Ballistic Missile Early Warning Center\"; z \"In view of the potential for build ing a strategic partnership betwee n the United States of America and the Russian Federation, the parties intend to accelerate defense cooperation between thei r military establishments ...\"; and z \"The parties will also pursu e cooperation in peacekeeping, counter-terrorism, and counter- narcotics missions.\"37 Before this charter had even been signed, however, our new \"par tners\" were already landing thei r bombers on American soil. Airman , a magazine for the U. S. Air Force, reported in large headlines fo r the cover story of its July 1992 i ssue: \"The Russians Have Landed.\" The cover also featured a photo o f the two Russian Tu-95 Bear bom bers and an An-124 transport which had landed on May 9th at Barksdale Air Force Base in Loui siana. An accompanying article noted that the Russians were given \"a rousing salute from a bras s band and a thrilled gathering of Air Force people and civilians who waved U.S. and Commonwealth of Independent States flags.\" The long-standing plan of the Insiders calls for a merger of th e U.S. and the USSR (or Commonwealth of Independent States as it has become) and then world government under the United Nations (see Chapter 5). Details leading to completion of the pl an are unfolding week afte r week, month after month, before an almost totally unaware America. Notes 1.

Solemn references to the \"ideals,\" \"vision,\" an d \"wisdom\" of the UN founders abound in current speeche s and articles as we experience another round o f historical revisionism. In 1945, we are told, a peace-hungry world groped for solutions that would put an end to war. Atomic weapons made their quest an absolute necess ity, because an atomic exchange could p ut an end to mankind. Statesmen of great vision seized the opportunity and fashioned an instrument - the United Nations - to attain that lofty and elusive goal: world peace. Creation of the CFR That, of course, is the standard textbook rendering and th e interpretation of history most frequently encountered today. Unfortunately, it is not accurate. The organization known as th e United Nations did indeed officially come into bei ng with the signing of the UN Charte r by representative s from 50 nations meeting in San Francisco on June 26, 1945. But that signa l event was the culmination of years o f p lanning by a private, high-le vel policy group that had gained de facto contro l of our foreign policy during the Roosevelt Administration . Immediately after our entry into the war, that organization, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), planted the idea of a world-govern ing \"peace\" organization. At the instigation of our State Depart ment, the 26 nations at war agai nst the Axis powers proclaimed themselves the United Nations in Janua ry 1942. Historian Clarence Carson observed: Roosevelt worked to avoid the pitfalls that ha d helped to keep the Un ited States out of the League of Nations. His hand is clearly apparent in trying to get the name accepted even before the organization had been formed. (Americans continued to refer to their side as the \"Allies\" during World War II, not the \"United Nations,\" but officially the term was being used anyhow.)3 President Roosevelt, however, was merely implementing the policies th at were being handed to him.

All of these men - with the exception of Hull - were in the CFR. Later known as the Informal Agenda Group, they drafted the orig inal proposal for the United Nations. It was Bowman - a founder of the CFR and member of Colonel House's old \"Inquiry\" - who first put forward the concept. They called in three attorneys, all CFR men, who ruled that it was constitutional. Then they di scussed it with FDR on June 15, 1944. The President approved the plan, and announced it to the public that same day.4 The list of those in the U.S. delegation to the UN 's founding San Francisco Conference reads like a CF R roll call.

Some - like Hiss, Lauchlin Currie, and Lawrence Duggan - shared the odious distinction of membership in both the Council a nd the Communist Party. In the next chapter, we will explore the important relationshi p between these two seemi ngly disparate organizations as well as the communist leadership role at the conference. But for now, let us concentrate on the Council. What the historical record shows, and what is essential for all pe ople of good will to understand, is that the United Nations is completely a creature of the Council on Fo reign Relations and was designed by that organization eventually to become an instrume nt for an all-powerful worl d government. In order to establish the factual basis for this claim, and to perm it an appreciation for the significance of it, we must revisit some murky pages of the history of this century. Some Necessary Background Hitler's invasion of Poland, the casus belli of World War II, was la unched on September 1, 1939. Although the United States would not enter the war for two more years (Decemb er 1941), within days o f the German invasion top member s of the CFR were taking over post-war planning for the Roosevelt Administration. In 1947, the Council published its ow n version of how it came to run FDR's State Department: Within a week [of the war's start] , Hamilton Fish Armstrong, Editor of Foreign Affairs , and Walter H. Mallory, Executive Di rector of the Council, paid a visit to the Department of State to offer such aid on the part of the Council as might be useful and appropriate in view of the war. The Department was already gr eatly overworked as a result of the crisis.... The Council representatives suggested that, pending the time when the Department itse lf would be able to assemble a staff and begin research and an alysis on the proper scale, the Council might undertake work in certain fields , without, of course, any formal assignment of responsibility on the one side or restriction of independent action on the other.... The Department officers welcomed the Council 's suggestion and enc ouraged the Council to formulate a more detailed plan. This was done in consultation with Department officials. The Rockefeller Foundation was then approached for a grant of funds to put the plan into operation. When assurances had been received th at the necessary funds would be available, the personnel of the groups were selected and on Decem ber 8, 1939, an organization meeting was held in Washington....6 Following that meeting, as Robert W. Lee explained in his 1981 book, The United Nations Conspiracy , the State Department established a Committee on Post-War Problems. It was assisted by a research staf f that was organized in February 1941 into a Division of Special Research. \"After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor,\" wrote Lee, \"the re search facilities were expanded and the overall project was reorganized into an Advisory Committee on Post-War Foreign Policies. Serving on the Committee were a number o f influential CFR members, incl uding Hamilton Fish Armstrong, Su mner Welles, Isaiah Bowman, N orman H. Davis, James T. Shotwell, Myron C. Taylor, and Leo Pa svolsky. The Russian- b orn Pasvolsky became the Committe e's Director of Research.\"7 The Council and its defe nders insist that it has no sinister a g enda; that, in fact, it has no a g enda at all."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"\"The Council shall not take a ny position on questions of forei gn policy,\" the organizaofficially declares.8 It is simply a study group, its spokesmen regularly maintain, and its civic-minded members offered their expertise in service of their country during an hour of great peril. And they have continued to provide their services ever since. One who heartily disagreed with those protestations of innocence and benevolence was Admiral Cheste r Ward, a former Judge Advocate Gene ral of the Navy, who was himself a member of the Council for 16 years. His experience led him to conclude that the group was formed for the \"purpose of promoting disarmament and submergence of U. S. sovereignty and national indepe ndence into an all-powerful one- world government.\" Together with coauthor Phyllis Sc hlafly, he wrote that the most influential clique within the CFR \"is composed of the one-world-global-government id eologists - more respectfully referred to as the organized inte rnationalists. They are the ones who carry on the tradition of the founders.\" Moreover, he charged, \"thi s lust to surrender the sovereig nty and independence of the United States is pervasive throughout most of the me mbership.... The majority visualize the utopian submergence of the United States as a subsidiary administrativ e unit of a global government....\"9 These are serious charges from a man of considerable dist inction who enjoyed the benefit of an inside look at the Insiders of the American Establishment. Admiral Ward is far from alone in rendering this harsh judgement of the CFR. After surveying the colossal damage done to America and the Free World from the fo reign and domestic policies imposed b y members of the Council, many patriotic Americans have arrive d at the same conclusion. These include historians, journalists, acad emicians, members of Congress, a nd other civic leaders. We will be introducing some of their statem ents further along in this book. Mo re immediately, however, let us examine the origins of the Council on Foreign Relations. Origins of the CFR According to the CF R's own history: The origins of the Council on Foreign Relations lay in the concern of the founders at what they regarded as the disappointing conduct of th e Versailles negotiation s ... and at the short- sighted, as they saw it, reject ion by the United States of me mbership in the League of Nations. In 1921 they founded the Council as a privately funded, nonpr ofit and nonpartisan organization of individual members.10 Accompanying President Woodrow Wilson to the Vers ailles Peace Conference at the end of World Wa r I were a number of men who woul d become founders of the CFR. Preeminent among these was Wilson's closest adviser, the mysterious Colonel Edward Mandell House. So dependent was Wilson upon House that he referred to him as \"my second personality,\" \"my independent self,\" \"my alter ego.\" Further, he asserted, \"His thoughts and mine are one.\"11 According to Wils on biographer George Sylveste r Viereck, \"Woodrow Wilson stalks through history on the feet of Edward Mandell House.\"12 An appreciation of this abnormal dependency, what Viereck would call \"The Strangest Friendship in History,\"13 is essential to understa nding the course of American stat ecraft in the ensuing decades. It was Colonel House who penned the first draft of the covenant of the Lea gue of Nations.14 He also p revailed on Wilson to convene the group known as the \"Inquiry,\" a cabal of American one-worlders who formulated much of Wilson's \"Fourteen Poin ts\" peace program. Hand-picked by House, the group included Walter Lippman, Allen W. Dulles, John Foster Dulles, Ch ristian A. Herter, and Norman Thomas. Director of the In q uir y was Dr. Sidne y Mezes, House's brothe r -in-law.15"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Perhaps one of the best s ources of insight into the mind and charac ter of Wilson's \"alt er ego\" is a novel authored by H ouse entitled Philip Dru: Administrator. 16 Although it was published anonymously during the presidential campaign of 1912, the co lonel later acknowledged the book as his own. He admitted it was \"not much of a novel,\" but that fiction was the be st format for disse minating his political ideas to a large audience.17 One need barely ope n the book's cover to discover the author's radical ideals. The title page prominentl y features a quotation by the 19th century revolutionist and arch- conspirator Giuseppe Mazzini. Identified on the sa me page is the book's publisher, B. W. Huebsch, a longtime publisher of left-wing literature who was affiliated with numerou s Communist Party fronts. The dedication page declares, in t ypical Marxist fashion, that \"in th e starting, the world-wide social structure was wrongly begun.\" The novel's hero, Philip Dru, opines that American society is \"a miserable travesty\" and believes in \"Socialism as dreamed of by Karl Marx,\" modified with a \"spiritual leavening.\" Dru leads a military coup, establishes himself as dictator of the United States, abolishes the constitution and institutes Marxist reforms. Many of Administrator Dru's \"ref orms\" would later be adopted by President Wilson. Viereck observed that \"The Wilson Administration transferred the Colone l's ideas from the pages of fiction to the pages o f history.\"18 House's novel, commented Dr. J. B. Ma tthews, \"is an indispensable source book on the origins of Woodrow Wils on's New Freedom and Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.\"19 Through Philip D ru, House also proposed a \"league of nations\" - anticipating by se ven years Wilson's appeal at Versailles for an identically-named world body. In its 1928 Survey of American Foreign Relations , the CFR reported, \"In the first months of the Worl d War a new movement sprang up spontaneously - the League to Enforce Peace.\"20 Actually, it didn't spring up \"spontaneously\" at all. The League was the creation of one Theodore Marburg, a wealthy internationalist from Maryland, and was funded primar ily by Andrew Carnegie, at the time reputed to be the richest man in the world.21 The CF R history recounts that \"the four years' acti vity of the League to Enforce Peace served the League [of Nations] cause by preparing the public mi nd for its reception and b y popularizing the ideal of international organization in beha lf of peace.\"22 Concerning Wilson's involvement with the Marburg/Carnegie League to Enforce Peace, th e 1928 volume reported: As early as the autumn of 1914 Wilson said, when looking ahead to the end of the war; \"all nations must be absorbed into some great associ ation of nations... .\" When Wilson was persuaded to speak at the League to En force Peace banquet in Washington on May 27, 1916, he endorsed the program of that organization only indi rectly, making no mention of force; but he advocated the gene ral idea of a league with such ardor that he was henceforth regarded as its champion.23 The U.S. Senate, however, led by \"irreconcilables\" Henry Cabot L odge of Massachusetts and William Borah of Idaho, refused to ratify the Covenant. Americans were su spicious of entanglements with the constantly warring European powers and wanted no part of submersion in a world super-state. Without American participation, the one-worlders' plans for a global government would come to naught. \"Wilson had done his best in his i ndividualistic way from 1914 to stimul ate a public desire for a liberal p eace and a new world order,\" said th e CFR's director of research Ch arles P. Howland. But, he wrote, \"Men's minds were not ready for great decision s in a new political field; the mass opinion o f 120,000,000 people orientates itself sl owly in novel situations.\"24 Obviously, men's minds needed to be made \"ready.\" It wa s for this purpose that the Council on Foreign Relations was launched at a May 1919 meeting held at the Majestic Hotel in Paris. Joining American members of the Inquiry were like-m inded internationalists from Brit ain belonging to the elite, semi- secret Round Table g rou p be g un b y that diamond and g old mo g ul of fabled wealth, Cecil Rhodes.25"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"According to Rhodes biographer Sa rah Millin, \"The government of the world was Rhodes' simple desire.\"26 The Paris meeting was hosted by Co lonel House.27 Out of that gath ering was born an Institute o f International Affairs, which w ould have branches in London a nd New York. The locations were appropriate, since as one historian of the Council observed, \"nearly all of them [the CFR's founding members] were bankers and lawyer s.\"28 Not just your ordinary, ru n-of-the-mill bankers and lawyers, mind you, these were the top international barristers and financiers of Wall St reet who were associated with the magic name of J. P. . \"The founding president of the CFR, \" wrote author James Perloff, \"was John W. Davis, who was J. P. Morgan's personal attorney and a millionaire in his own right. F ounding vice-president was Paul Cravath, whose law firm also repr esented the Morgan interests. Mo rgan partner Russell Leffingwell would later become the Council's first chairman. A variety of othe r Morgan partners, attorneys and agents crowded the CFR's early membership rolls.\"29 In 1921, the American branch of the organization la unched in Paris was incorporated in New York as the Council on Foreign Relations. The British branch became the Royal Inst itute of International Affairs, otherwise known as Chatham House. CFR Globalist Influence Grows To propagate its \"internationalist \" world view among a select intell igentsia, the Council launched a quarterly journal, Foreign Affairs . Time magazine called Foreign Affairs \"the most influential periodical in print,\"30 while the CFR itself boasts that its journa l provides an \"insider's look at world politics.\"31 Admiral Ward said of its influence: \"By follow ing the evolution of this propaganda in the most p restigious scholarly journal in the world, Foreign Affairs , anyone can determine years in advance what the future defense and foreign policies of the United States will be. If a cer tain proposition is repeated often enough in that journal, then the U.S. Admini stration in power - be it Re publican or Democratic - begins to act as if that proposition or assumption were an es tablished fact.\"32 (Emphasis in original) The CFR's globalist bent was ev ident from the first issue of Foreign Affairs , where readers were told, \"Our government should enter hearti ly into the existing League of Nations....\"33 With CFR members in charge of dispersing tens of mi llions of dollars from the major tax-exempt foundations (Carnegie, Rockefeller, Twentieth Century Fund) each year, it was not long before an entire nationwide network o f one-world support groups was esta blished. By 1928 the CFR's resear ch division could report to the Council: University courses dealing with international affairs have trebled in number since the war; there has been an outpouring of books on fo reign relations, dipl omatic history, and international law; periodicals such as Foreign Affairs , Current History , and the American Journal of International Law , and the information service of the Foreign Policy Association are supplying materials for a sound background; and associations and organizations devoted to an impartial discussion of internati onal relations and the supplying of authentic information have sprung up in almost every great city. As yet, however, these agencies for furnishing adequate standards of judgment and accurate current information have not penetrated very fa r down in society.34 Whether or not the Council's appr oved sources provided \"impartial di scussion,\" \"authentic information,\" and \"ade q uate standards of j ud g ment\" is somethin g for each reader to decide for himself. It is worth"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"noting, however, that a congressional investigation by the Special Hous e Committee to Investigate Tax- Exempt Foundations (the Reece Committee) conclude d in 1954 that the CFR \"productions are not objective but are directed overwhel mingly at promoting the globalist c oncept,\" and that it had become \"in essence an agency of the United States Governme nt ... carrying its internati onalist bias wi th it.\"35 The director of research for th at investigative committee was th e same Norman Dodd whom we quoted in our Introduction (about the astonishing admissi on to him by Ford Foundation President H. Rowan Gaither). If Dodd was jarred (and he was) by Gaither's confessed i nvolvement in a ma ster scheme to merge the U.S. and the Soviet Un ion, he was no less shocked by what his investigative team found in the minutes of the Carnegie Endow ment for International Peace. In his 1980 exposé, The Tax-Exempt Foundations , William H. McIlhany, II interviewed Norman Dodd, who repeated what his investigator Kathryn Casey had found in the \"peace\" organization's minutes compiled several years before the start of World War I: [In the minutes] the trustees raised a ques tion. And they discussed the question and the question was specific, \"Is there any means known to man more ef fective than wa r, assuming you wish to alter the life of an entire people?\" And they discussed this and at the end of a year they came to the conclu sion that there was no more eff ective means to that end known to man. So, then they raised question numb er two, and the question was, \"How do we involve the United States in a war?\" And then they raised the question, \"How do we control the diplomatic machinery of the United States?\" And the answer came out, \"We\" must control the State Department. At this point we catch up with what we had already found out and that was that through an agency set up by the Carnegie Endowment every high appointment in the St ate Department was cleared. Finally, we were in a war. These trustees in a me eting about 1917 had the brashness to congratulate themselves on the wisdom of their original decision because already the impact of war had indica ted it would alter life and can alter life in th is country. This was the date of our entry in the war; we were involved. They even had the brashness to word and to dispatch a telegram to Mr. Wilson, cautioning him to see t hat the war did not end too quickly. [Emphasis added] The war was over. Then the conc ern became, as expressed by the trustees, seeing to it that there was no reversion to life in this country as it existed prior to 1914. And they came to the conclusion that, to prevent a reversion, th ey must control education. And then they approached the Rockefeller F oundation and they said, \"Will you take on the acquisition of control of education as it in volves subjects that are domesti c in their signi ficance? We'll take it on the basis of subjects that have an international significance.\" And it was agreed. Then, together, they decided the key to it is the teaching of Am erican history and they must change that. So, they then approached the most prominent of what we might call American historians at that time with the idea of getting them to alter the manner in which they presented the subject.36 The first president of the Endowment was Theodore Roosevelt's Secretary of State, Elihu Root,37 who became an honorary member of the CFR in 1922 and from 193 1-37 served as honorary president of the group. Later a U.S. senator a nd Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Root stated in his address to the CFR, at the opening of its new headquarters in 1930, that to achieve its goals the Council would have to engage in \"stead y , continuous, and uns p ectacular labor.\"38"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"That it has surely done. A host of adjunct organizati ons were created to prom ote the CFR viewpoint: the United World Federalists, Atlant ic Council, Trilateral Commission, Aspen Institute, Business Council, Foreign Policy Association, etc. Through its members, the CFR st eadily gained influence in and dominance of the executive branch of the federa l government, both major political parties, important organs of the news media, major universities, influential think tanks , large tax-exempt foundations, huge multi-national corporations , international banks, a nd other power centers. Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger (C FR), who served as a special assi stant to President Kennedy, wrote in 1965 of \"the New York financial and legal community - that arsena l of talent which had so long furnished a steady supply ... to Demo cratic as well as Re publican administrations . This community was the heart of the American Estab lishment ... its front organizations [are] the Rockefel ler, Ford and Carnegie foundations and the Council on Foreign Relations; its organs, the New York Times and Foreign A ffairs .\"39 John J. McCloy was known in CFR In sider circles as \"the chairman of the Establishment.\" Besides serving as chairman of the CFR from 1953 to 1970, a nd as chairman of both the Ford Foundation and the Rockefellers' Chase Manhattan Bank for long periods, he was fr iend and advisor to nine U.S. p residents, from Franklin Roosev elt to Ronald Reagan.40 McCloy r ecalled: \"Whenever we needed a man we thumbed through the roll of the Council members and put through a call to New York.\"41 The Council's imprimat ur has become so essentia l for many top posts that ve teran CFR member Richard Barnet has stated, \"failure to be asked to be a memb er of the Council has been regarded for a generation as a presumption of unsuitability for high offi ce in the national security bureaucracy.\"42 Commenting decades ago on this Insider lockgrip on our government, newspaper columnist Edith Kermit Roosevelt (a granddaughter of Theodore Roosevelt) wrote: What is the Establishment's view-point? Th rough the Roosevelt, Tr uman, Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations its ideol ogy is constant: That the best way to fight Communism is by a One World Socialist state governed by \"expe rts\" like themselves. The result has been policies which favor the growth of the supe rstate, gradual surren der of United States sovereignty to the United Nations and a steady retreat in the face of Communist aggression.43 That CFR lockhold on the White House and other top positions in the federal government has continued through to the present. Writing in the September 21, 1992 issue of The New American , Robert W. Lee briefly cited some ke y indicators of continuing CFR dominance: At least 13 of the 18 men to serve as Secretary of State since the CFR's founding have belonged to the organization, not counting current Acting Se cretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, who is al so a member. Our last eight CIA directors have also belonged, including current chief Robert M. Gates. During the past four decades alone, the ma jor-party candidates for President and Vice President who were, or eventually became , members of the CFR include: Dwight D. Eisenhower, Adlai Stevenson, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Hubert Humphrey, George McGovern, Gerald Ford, Jimm y Carter, Walter Mondale, Mich ael Dukakis, George Bush, Bill Clinton, Henry Cabot Lodge, Nelson A.

These people occupy high positions. They have very high salaries and almost all of these people have, in the pa st, been employees in the U.S. government in high and sensitive positions. 1 — U.S. Senator James O. Eastland , Activities of U.S. Citize ns Employed by the UN Hearings, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 1952 The creation of the United Nations, as we saw in the previous chapter, was the culmination of an intensive campaign begun in the early days of this century by thos e who could only be described as the p illars of the American Establishment. Names li ke Carnegie, Morgan, War burg, Schiff, Marburg, and Rockefeller headed the list of those promoting \"world order.\" It is interesting then, though a sour ce of confusion to many, to lear n that not only we re the ideas o f world government in general and the League of Nations and United Nations in particular especially fond goals of these \"arch-capitalists,\" but they were also the ultimate objects of desi re for world socialist and communist movements. This is not id le speculation but a matter of hi storical record so overwhelmingly evident as to hardly need proving. Unfortuna tely, that record is not widely known. As long ago as 1915, before the Bolshevik Revolution, Lenin himself proposed a \"United States of the World.\"2 In 1936, the official program of the Communist International proclaimed: \"Dictatorship can be established only by a victory of so cialism in different countries or groups of countries, after which the p roletariat republics would unite on federal lines with those already in existence, and this system o f federal unions would expand ... at length forming the World Union of Socialist Soviet Republics.\"3 Shortly after the founding of the UN , in March of 1946, Soviet dictator and mass-murderer Joseph Stalin declared: \"I attribute great im portance to U.N.O. [United Nati ons Organization, as it was then commonly called] since it is a serious instrument fo r preservation of peace and international security.\"4 The American communists, too, left no doubt about their commitment to S oviet-style, one-world government. In his 1932 book Toward Soviet America , William Z. Foster, national chairman of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA), wrote: The American Soviet government will join wi th the other Soviet governments in a world Soviet Union.... Not christianity [sic] but Communism will bring peace on earth. A Communist world will be a unified, organize d world. The economic system will be one great organization, base d upon the principle of planning now dawning in the U.S.S.R. The American Soviet government will be an im portant section in this world organization.5 Earl Browder, general secretary of the CPUSA, stated in his book, Victory and After , that \"the American Communists worked energetically a nd tirelessly to lay the foundations for the United Nations which we were sure would come into existence.\"6 Moreover, this leader of the American Reds declared: It can be said, without exagge ration, that ever closer rela tions between our nation and the Soviet Union are an unconditional requireme nt for the United Nations as a world coalition....7 The United Nations is the instrument for victor y . Victor y is re q uired for the survival of our"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"nation. The Soviet Union is an essential part of the United Nations. Mutual confidence between our country and the Soviet Union and jo int work in the leadership of the United Nations are absolutely necessary.8 Some indication of the importance th e Kremlin attached to the creati on of the UN can be gained from the April 1945 issue of Political Affairs , its official mouthpiece in the Un ited States directed principally at Party members. The American comrades were told: After the Charter is passed at Sa n Francisco, it will have to be approved by two thirds of the Senate, and this action will establish a weight y precedent for other tr eaties and agreements still to come. But the victory cannot be won in the Senate al one; it must emanate from the organized and broadening nationa l support built up for the Presid ent’s policy, on the eve of the San Francisco gathering and after.... Great popular suppor t and enthusiasm for the United Nations policies should be built up, well organized and fully articulate. But it is also necessary to do more than that. The opposition mu st be rendered so impotent that it will be unable to gather any significan t support in the Senate agains t the United Nations Charter and the treaties wh ich will follow.9 Support for the UN was even writte n into the Communist Party’s basi c document. The preamble to the constitution of the Comm unist Party, USA states: The Communist party of the Un ited States ... fights uncomprom isingly against ... all forms of chauvinism.... It holds further that the true national interest of our country and the cause of peace and progress require ... the strengthening of the Unit ed Nations as a universal instrument of peace.10 We have also the testimony of ma ny former communists which reveals the value the Party placed on the world organization. In her autobiography, School of Darkness , former top CPUSA official Dr. Bella Dodd told of her role in the Party’s campaign for the UN: When the Yalta conference had ended, the Co mmunists prepared to support the United Nations Charter which was to be adopted at the San Francisco conference to be held in May and June, 1945. For this I organized a corps of speakers and we took to the street corners and held open-air meet ings in the millinery and clothi ng sections of New York where thousands of people congregate at the lunch hour. We spoke of the need for world unity and in support of the Yalta decisions.11 Another former top Communist Party member , Joseph Z. Kornfeder, revealed in 1955: Now, as to the United Nations. If you were , let’s say, a building engineer, and someone were to show you a set of blueprints about a certain bui lding, you would know from those blueprints how that building was going to look. Organization \"blueprints\" can be read the same way. I need not be a memb er of the United Nations Secr etariat to know that the UN \"blueprint\" is a Communist one. I was at the Moscow headquarters of the world Communist party for nearly th ree years and was acquainted with most of the top leaders, and, of course, I was also a leading party work er. I went to their colleges; I learned their pattern of operations, and if I see that pattern in effect anywhere, I can recognize it.... From the point of view of it s master designers meeting at Dumbarton Oaks and Bretton Woods, and which include d such masterful a g ents as Al g er Hiss, Harr y Dexter White,"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Lauchlin Currie, and othe rs, the UN was, and is, not a failure. They and the Kremlin masterminds behind them never intended the UN as a peace-keepi ng organization. What they had in mind was a fancy and colossal Tr ojan horse under the wi ngs of which their smaller agencies could more effectively opera te. And in that they succeeded, even beyond their expectations.... Its [the UN’s] internal set up, Communist designed, is a patt ern for sociological conquest; a pattern aimed to serve the purpose of Communist penetration of the We st. It is ingenious and deceptive.12 Two years earlier (1953), a c ongressional committee heard test imony from Colonel Jan Bukar, a Czechoslovakian intelligence officer who had defect ed to the West. Among th e revelations he supplied was a lecture given by Soviet Ge neral Bondarenko at the Frunze Milita ry Academy in Moscow. In that lecture, Bondarenko told the elite tr ainees: \"From the rostrum of the United Nations, we shall convince the colonial and semicolonial peopl e to liberate themselves and to spread the Communist theory all ove r the world.\"13 Kornfeder was not suffering delusions when he cl aimed to see a communist design and a \"pattern fo r sociological conquest\" in the UN’s setup. The historical record am ply demonstrates that American citizens who were conscious Soviet agents operating at high leve ls of the U.S. government were very instrumental in the planning and formation of both the United Nations Charter and the organization itself. State Depart ment and Treasury Department officials who were key figures in planning the UN, and who were later exposed during official i nvestigations as Sovi et agents, include:14 Soloman Adler Virginius Frank Coe Lawrence Duggan Noel Field Harold Glasser Alger Hiss Irving Kaplan Victor Perlo Abraham G.

Ullman John Carter Vincent"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Henry Julian Wadleigh David Weintraub Harry Dexter White The UN’s Top Men As we have noted, the first secret ary-general of the United Nations at the organiza tion’s founding conference was Alger Hiss. Since that time, six other men have held th e position of secretary-general, the highest office in the world orga nization. Each of these individuals has advanced the causes of world communism and world government, while endangering American sovereignty a nd liberty. Because the leaders of any group tell much about the organization they represent, the records of each of these men deserve close examination. Unfortunate ly, we have space here for only a very brief look at the men who have led the UN. Alger Hiss . As far back as 1939, the FBI had presented solid evidence concer ning Hiss’s Communist activities to the executive branch. It continued to issue repeated warn ings concerning him. But, as had happened in so many previous cases and would cont inue to occur with a frequency that became an established pattern, the reports we re disregarded. In 1944, Hiss was ma de acting director of the State Department’s Office of Special Pol itical Affairs in charge of all pos twar planning. He was the executive secretary of the critically im portant 1944 Dumbarton Oaks Confer ence, where Stalin’s expert Vyacheslav Molotov and \"our\" expert Hiss worked together on the UN Charter. It was Hiss who accompanied President Roosevelt to the infamous Yalta Conference, where he served as the dying President’s \"top international organization specialist.\" It was at that conferen ce in the Soviet Crimea during February 1945 that FDR agreed to give the S oviets three votes in the UN General Assembly to our one. As critics pointed out when that secret agreement became known, giving the Soviets separate votes for the Ukraine and Byelorussia made as much se nse as giving extra votes to the United States for Texas and California. It was Hiss’s starring role at Sa n Francisco, however, that was most important. As the acting secretary- general, he was the chief planner and executive of that conference. Time magazine, reporting about Hiss and the upcoming conference, stated in its April 16, 1945 issue: \"As secretar y-general, managing the agenda, he will have a lot to say behind the scenes about who gets the breaks.\" At San Francisco, Hiss also served on the steering a nd executive committees, which pu t the finishing touches on the UN Charter. And it was Alger Hiss, who at the conclu sion of the conference, pe rsonally carried the new charter back to Washington for Senate ratification. Hiss was later exposed as a Soviet spy, and in 1950 wa s convicted for perjuring himself before a federal Grand Jury while being questioned about his communist ac tivities.15 The statute of limitations on his espionage charges had run out, but he served 44 months in the fede ral penitentiary for the perjury charges. His trial was one of the most celebrate d in American history. Not only did communists, socialists, liberals, and radical leftists turn out to support Hi ss, so too did the CFR-dominate d Establishment media. As we have noted, Hiss was himsel f a member of the CFR. Followin g his stint at the UN founding in San Francisco, he was named president of the Carn egie Endowment for Inte rnational Peace. The man responsible for hiring him was the chairman of th e Endowment, John Foster Dulles, a founder of the CFR. Dulles, who would later serve as Secretary of State (1953-59), was informed of Hiss’s communist b ack g round in 1946, but i g nored this information until Februar y 1948, j ust one month before Hiss went"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"before the Grand Jury.16 Trygve Lie. The first elected secretary- general of the United Nations , Trygve Lie, was a Norwegian socialist. Lie was a high-ranking me mber of the Social Democratic Labor Party in Norway, an offshoot of the early Communist Internati onal, and a strong supporter of the Soviet Union on virtually every issue. It was hardly surprising th en that the Soviet Union led the campaign to elect Lie as secretary- general. One of Lie’s pr incipal causes was the admission of Red China to the UN, which was also a p rimary objective of the Soviet Union. Dag Hammarskjšld . Lie was succeeded by another Scandinavi an socialist who was openly sympathetic to the world communist revolution. Hammarskjšld once stated in a letter to a friend that \"... Chou En-lai to me appears as the most superior brain I have so far met in the fiel d of foreign politics.\" This he spoke of the man who, together with Mao Tse-tung, was re sponsible for the murder of between 34 million an d 64 million Chinese.17 It was Hammarskjšld who was primarily responsible for the early planning and direction of the UN’s b rutal war against Katanga (see Chapter 2). When Soviet troops invaded H ungary to crush the 1956 uprising, Hammarskjšld turned a deaf ear to the Hungarian freedom fight ers. As secretar y-general, he p ersecuted the courageous Danish UN diplomat Povl Bang-Jensen, w ho refused to turn over the names of Hungarian refugees who ha d testified in confidence to a special UN committee. U Thant. Burmese Marxist U Thant continued and intens ified an anti-American, pro-Soviet tradition begun by his predecessors. While i gnoring the massive human rights abuses — torture, slaughter, imprisonment — of the communist regimes, Thant sl avishly followed the Soviet line by condemning Rhodesia and South Africa as terrible human ri ghts violators. During th e Vietnam War, Thant continually used the rostrum of the Secretariat to place the blame for the war on the United States. Secretary-General Thant revealed a great deal about both himself and the organization which he heade d with his statement in 1970 that the \"ideals\" of Bolshevik dictator and mass-mur derer Lenin were in accord with the UN Charter. \"Lenin was a man with a mind of great clarity and incisiveness,\" Thant said, \"and his ideas have had a p rofound influence on the course of contemporary history.\" The Burmese Marxist continued: \"[Lenin’s] ideals of peace and peacef ul coexistence among states have w on widespread international acceptance and they are in line with the aims of the U.N. Charter.\"18 For his personal staff assi stant, Thant chose Soviet KGB officer Viktor Less iovsky with whom he had established a friendship in the early 1950s.19 Kurt Waldheim. When U Thant retired on December 31, 1971, the Soviet Union was ready with a replacement. Austrian Kurt Waldheim was its choi ce, and for good reason. He had deep, dark secrets that would assure his usefulness to them. During World War II, Waldheim not only wore the uniform o f the Third Reich, but also worked wi th Yugoslavian communist leader Ti to. \"As soon as he was safely in office [as UN secretar y-general], Waldheim planted over 250 Russ ians in key posts,\" revealed foreign affairs expert Hilaire du Berrier. \"His immediate circle was composed almost complete ly of Titoists.... When Tito met his old friend at the UN, he hugged him to his brea st and gave him a decoration — a great honor for a man who had massacred Serbs, Slovenes, Mont enegrans and other Yugoslavs.\"20 During his reign as secretary-gene ral, the Establishment media kept Waldheim’s Nazi-C ommunist past under wraps.

Javier Perez de Cuellar . This Peruvian diplomat took the UN helm in 1981 and is credited with greatly burnishing the UN image. \"U nder his tutelage,\" said Wall Street Journal reporter Frederick Kempe, \"the U.N. has been midwife to more peace agreements than ever befo re.\"22 Perez de Cuellar helped convene and also addressed the Global Fo rum of Spiritual and Parliamentar y Leaders on Human Survival, the N ew Age-ecology-world religion confab convene d by Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990. He penned the Foreword to the radical so cialist New Age publication, Gaia Peace Atlas .23 Perez de Cuellar has distinguished himself as a man of \"peace.\" Like the other men who have held his p ost, however, he finds it impossible to condemn communist oppression. Speaking of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, an event that occurred during his watch at the UN, Perez de Cuellar has said: \"Tiananmen was exaggerated. I think it was a really cruel oppression, but from there to say it was a tremendous, dramatic, tragic viol ation of human rights is an ex aggeration.\"24 If an estimated 5,000 dead, 10,000 wounded, the subsequent torture and impris onment of tens of thous ands, and the execution of a still unknown number do not qualify as a \"tremendous, dramatic, trag ic violation of human rights,\" what does? Boutros Boutros-Ghali . A former professor of international re lations, Boutros-Ghali began his political career in the regime of the pro-Soviet Egyptian dict ator Gamal Abdel Nasser. As editor of the official E conomic Ahram , it was his job to give cred ibility to the communistic ideas of the Nasser revolution. As with all of the men who have held the UN’s top post, Boutros-Ghali had the support of the communists. As we have previously noted (Cha pter 2), Boutros-Ghali has initiated revolutiona ry advances in the UN’s march toward world governme nt. He has called for the forming of a permanent UN Army and is p ressing for taxing authority for the UN globocrats. Espionage and Propaganda Through the decades, communist leaders and their cl ients certainly have us ed the United Nations fo r world propaganda, as advocated by Soviet General Bondarenko. Red dictators and terrorists from Khrushchev, Tito, and Ceaucescu to Nkrumah, Ca stro, Lumumba, Arafat, and Mandela have been honored with rousing ovations at th e UN. Their anti-American tirades have been broadcast to the worl d from that forum of \"world peace and brotherhood.\" The Communists’ use of the UN as a principal center of espionage against the United States has been exposed time and again. FBI Direct or J. Edgar Hoover stated in 1963 that communist diplomats assigned to the UN \"represent th e backbone of Russian intelligence operations in this country.\"25 British espionage authority Chapman Pincher has observed: Because of the protection and c over they afford, all the major United Nations institutions have been heavily penetrated.... Whole books have been published li sting the abuse and manipulation of the United Nations by the Sovi ets. The area most blat antly used for active measures and espionage is the main headquarters in New York.26 Among the many defectors from the co mmunist bloc countries who have testified about the importance of the UN in the Soviet scheme of things is former KGB operative Ladislav Bittman. In his book The K GB and Soviet Disin f ormation: An Inside r ’ s View , Bittman wrote:"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The United Nations is an international organi zation that deserves special attention for the role it plays in overt and cl andestine propaganda campaigns conducted by the Soviets. As an organization that helps to shape world public opinion and plays a vital peacekeeping role, the United Nations is a major battlefield for the Soviet Union and the United States.... But the Soviet Union maintains the most impre ssive intelligence organi zation, consisting of the largest single concentration of Soviet spies anywhere in the West.... Spying in New York is so pervasive that some diplomats refer to the United Nations as \"the stock exchange of global intelligence operations.\"27 Arkady Shevchenko, who was an under-s ecretary-general at the UN when he defected in l978, has described the United Nations as a \" gold mine for Russian spying.\"28 The most senior Sovi et official to defect to the West, Shevchenko was a personal assistant to Soviet Foreign Secretar y Andrei Gromyko from 1970 to 1973. He then became Under-Secretary-General for Politi cal and Security Council Affairs at the United Nations. Shevchenko confirmed what anti-communists had been saying all along: The Soviet Politburo regarded dŽtente as simply \"a tactical manoeuvre wh ich would in no way supersede the Marxist-Leninist idea of the fina l victory of the worldwide revolut ionary process.\"29 And the Unite d N ations was continuing to play an essential role in that process. \"In spite of this and other exposur es,\" said Pincher in 1985, \"the In ternational Depart ment and the KGB have not reduced the scale of thei r operations out of the United Nati ons and its offshoots, being unable to resist the facility, denied to ordinary diplomats, that renders UN staff free to travel, without restriction, in the countries where they are based.\"30 KGB defector Oleg Gordievsky gave a similar assessment: The size of the KGB presence in both the United States and the UN delegation in New York increased more rapidly at the height of dŽte nte than at any other period: from about 120 officers in l970 to 220 in l 975. At the very moment when the London residency was being sharply cut back, those in the United States were almost doubling in size.31 It should be of no small concern to American taxpayers to learn that they have been subsidizing these KGB campaigns of espionage, subve rsion, and disinformati on against their own c ountry. In his massive 1974 study, KGB: The Secret Work of Soviet Secret Agents , John Barron revealed: The KGB derives still another advantage from placing its officers on the United Nations payroll. Since the United States pays 25 percent of the entire U.N. operating budget, it pays 25 percent of the bountiful sala ries granted KGB officers insinuated into U.N. jobs. American taxpayers thus are compelled to finance KGB opera tions against themselves and the noncommunist world. Moreover, the Soviet Union requires its citizens paid by international organizations to rebate the greater part of th eir salaries to the government. Thus, it actually makes money each time it plants a KGB officer in the U.N.32 The UN has also proved useful for the opportunity it of fers the Soviets to make contact with and transfe r funds to their agents in the CPUSA. John Barron’s KGB Today: The Hidden Hand (1983) reporte d concerning the Soviet modus operandi : From the United Nations, KGB officers additionally maintain clandestine contact with the U.S. Communist Party, deliveri ng money and instructions in behalf of the International De p artment. The U.S. Part y exists almost entirel y on secret Soviet subsidies....33"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Considering the fact that locating the UN headquarters in the United States, and in New York City in p articular, has afforded the en emies of America unparalleled oppor tunities for espionage, sabotage, terrorism, propaganda, subv ersion, and disinformation, it is important to note ho w the site for the world- body’s headquarters was chosen. Ameri cans have been encouraged to be lieve that the decision to buil d the United Nations in the United States was a great diplomatic c oup for our country. Nothing could be more patently false. In reality, it was exact ly what the communists and one-worlders wanted. In his book In the Cause of Peace , the UN’s first elected secret ary-general described the \"long an d heated discussions\" concer ning the future location of the permanent headquarters. Lie and many of his fellow socialists saw the merit of establishing the UN in the U.S. to overcome America’s \"isolationism.\" Lie asked: \"Why not locate the headquarters of the fu ture international organization within the United States’ own borders, so that the conc ept of international could match for ces on the spot with those of its arch-enemy, isolationism — utilizing at all times the American people’s own democratic media?\"34 The Kremlin certainly could see the merit of the plan. Lie wrote: The Americans declared their neutrality as soon as the Pr eparatory Commission opened its deliberations. The Russians disappointed mo st Western Europeans by coming out at once for a site in America.... ... Andrei Gromyko of the U.S.S.R. had come out flatly for the United States. As to where in the United States, let th e American Government decide , he had blandly told his colleagues. Later the Soviet Union modifi ed its stand to support the east coast.35 Even so, these best-laid plans almost fell apart for lack of funds to purchase a site. At that point, Lie said, he advised New York Mayor William O’Dwyer to \"Get in touc h with Nelson Rockefeller tonight b y phone.\" With the help of Nelson Rockefeller (CFR), Lie and his UN team were soon in \"secret consultations with the Rockef eller brothers and with th eir father, John D. Rockefeller, Jr.\" In very short order the Rockefellers produced \"a gift of $8,500,000 with which to pur chase the East River property as a Headquarters site.\"36 The More Things Change ... The world’s most famous capitalists provided the Kremlin with an incr edible bonanza. But that is all ancient history, according to current prevailing wisdom. As most news stories have it, the Soviet KGB has been disbanded and its archives completely th rown open. The Cold War is now over. Or is it? On October 24, 1991, the Wall Street Journal’s deputy features editor Am ity Shlaes commented on evidence indicating that the UN Secretariat headquartered in Ne w York City was still under the domination of old-line communists and Third World Marxist ideologues . Shlaes wrote that rather than becoming \"the cornerstone in President Bush’s oft-mentioned ‘n ew world order.’ ... [M]any of those working within the Secretariat, or at its missions in its vicinity, argue that communism left a legacy.... ‘It works like a scorpion’s stinger,’ says one U.N. professional. ‘The scorpion — East bloc socialism — dies. But the stinger remains poisonous , and strikes new victims.’\" Shl aes reported that \"Westerners who worked at the U.N. ... found themselves surrounded by what many have called a communist mafia.\" The KGB has undergone a number of re cent permutations, but to para phrase Mark Twain, reports of its death are highly exaggerated. Zdzisl aw Rurarz, the former Polish am bassador to Japan who defected to the United States in 1981, was one of the few Soviet expert s to take notice of Bo ris Yeltsin’s siniste r new security superagenc y, the MSIA. Ru rarz reported in January 1992 that Boris’s MSIA \"is an amal g am of four p reviousl y existin g institutions: the USSR MVD, or the Ministr y of Internal Affairs,"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"the Russian MVD, the ISS, or Interrepublican Securi ty Service, which was mainly the former KGB, and the FSA, the Federal Security Agency, or th e Russian equivalent of the former KGB.\" \"The MSIA has inherited the networ k of informers and collaborators of the former KGB and ISS which was in place throughout the USSR. Why,\" asks Rurarz, \"should Russia need such a network in the remaining former Soviet republics, now ‘independent states’?\"37 An obvious question — that yields an obvious answer — except to \"liberals\" who are too busy planning new welf are schemes on which to spend the \"peace dividend,\" and to \"conservatives \" who are too busy celebrating and congratulating themselves on their victory over communism. Commenting on the Kremlin security reshuffling, Albert L. Weeks wrote in April 1992 that the \"new\" Russian agency under Viktor Ba rannikov \"means that 500,000 officials and informers function today as a separate entity, going about their business largely as before. Thousands of other ex-KGBists work fo r Yevgeny Primakov, director of the Russian Forei gn Intelligence Agency.\" Dr. Weeks, professo r emeritus of New York University and author of numerous articles and books about th e Soviet Union, also noted that \"90-95% of middle- ranking KGB officiers rema in in the same posit ions as before the August, 1991, coup attempt, accord ing to a recent defector....\"38 The \"thawing\" of U.S.-Russian relations has not ended Communist espiona ge and disinformation activities in the West. To the contrary, it appears to have added new impetus to these operations in many areas. According to R. Patrick Wats on, deputy assistant director of the FBI’s intelligence division, \"It is clear that the foreign intelligence threat from the Soviet Union has not abated, and in fact it has become more difficult to counter .\" Watson, addressing the National Securi ty Institute on March 13, 1991, said: \"In recent months the KGB has empha sized the recruitment of scientists and businessmen to obtain information of economic value.\" Watson said the KGB and its military c ounterpart, the GRU, have intensified their efforts and regularly plant their agen ts in groups of Soviets vi siting the United States. A p rimary task of these agents is to identify Americans wi th access to technology or information sought by their organizations.39 In October 1992, FBI spokesman Stev e Markardt confirmed that the espionage agencies of the East European bloc and the \"former\" Soviet Union \"a re still highly active in this country engaged in espionage ... particular ly against economic and technological targets.\"40 As KGB defector Anatoliy Goli tsyn revealed, however, espionage — the stealing of technology an d state secrets — has always been of minor importance compared to the KGB’s primary purpose o f s trategic deception. Golitsyn, arguably the most important Soviet agent ever to defect to the West, exposed the inner workings and me thodology of this critically impor tant disinformation process. He demonstrated how, time after time, the Soviets had thoroughl y deceived the West concerning developments in the USSR and Mo scow’s geopolitical objectives. Through the use of elaborate, long- range programs of strategic dece ption, the Kremlin has been incr edibly successful, he showed, at manipulating the policy decisi ons of Western governments. Golitsyn’s signal warning to the West, New Lies For Old, 41 published in the prophetic year 1984, has p roven to be the most reliable and prescient co mmentary on the acclaimed changes in the communist world. Years before they occurred, Golitsyn predicted the \"liberalization\" polici es in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, the glasnost and perestroika ca mpaigns, the rise of independence movements, the p olitical restructuring, the ascendan ce of \"liberal\" leaders like Gorbac hev and Yeltsin, the dismantling o f the Berlin Wall, the breakup of the USSR, the disso lution of the Communist Party, the dismantling o f the KGB, and many other developmen ts. He was able to do this with such uncanny accuracy because he had been involved, as a me mber of the KGB inner circle on stra tegic disinformation, in planning these t yp es of dece p tions.

The real problem today is that of world government. 1 — Philip Kerr , Foreign Affairs, December 1922 There is no indication that American public opinion, for example, would approve the establishment of a super state, or permit American membership in it. In other words, time — a long time — will be needed before world government is politically feasible.... [T]his time element might seemingly be shortened so far as American opinion is concerned by an active propaganda campaign in this country.... 2 — Allen W. Dulles (CFR) and Beatrice Pitney Lamb, Foreign Policy Association, 1946 [T]here is no longer a question of whether or not there will be world government by the year 2000. As I see it, the questions we should be addressing to ourselves are: how it will come into being — by cataclysm, drift, more or less rational design — and whether it will be totalitarian, benignly elitist, or participatory (the probabilities being in that order.) 3 — Saul H. Mendlovitz, director World Order Models Project, 1975 A major obstacle to alerting Americans about plans to cancel our national sovereignty and personal freedoms and to submerge the United States in a world government is the dissembling double-talk and outright lying routinely employed by the world government advocates. While groups like Planetary Citizens, the World Federalist Association, the Association of World Citizens, the Committee to Frame a World Constitution, the World Constitution and Parliament Association, the World Association for World Federation, etc. have usually flown their world government flags openly, the Council on Foreign Relations and other Establishment groups seeking world government prefer to obfuscate their aims with terms like \"collective security,\" \"the rule of law,\" \"world law,\" \"global institutions,\" \"interdependence,\" and \"world order.\" As we have already shown and will further demonstrate, the CFR and its influential members are also on record favoring and promoting world government. However, most of these public CFR utterances have appeared in publications and speeches intended for a select, sympathetic audience where the new world order adepts can \"unblushingly\" (in the words of Lincoln Bloomfield) contemplate and discuss \"world government.\"4 file:///D|/DESTROY_THE_NWO(2.0)/Ebooks%20in%20progress/chapter_05.html (1 of 14)6/19/2004 10:29:52 PM"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 World government is not a subject to which most Americans, or other peoples of the world for that matter, give much serious thought. However, if John Q. Citizen does become cognizant of and disturbed about the threat of an emerging global leviathan, and if he expresses this concern to his congressman, senator, or local newspaper editor, he either meets with derisive charges that he is chasing chimera, or he is provided with solemn denials that plans for world government are even being considered. This writer experienced a typical example of this derision/denial paradigm in November 1990 at a branch of Purdue University in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The occasion was a Citizens Forum to discuss \"America’s Role in the New World Order.\" It featured as its three leading participants: Charles William Maynes (CFR), editor of Foreign Policy ; Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist David Broder; and Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN), former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. All three of these Establishment internationalists enthusiastically touted the newly enhanced role of the United Nations as a result of the Persian Gulf War and embraced President Bush’s oft-mentioned new world order. Attending as a member of the press, I questioned each of them concerning the meaning of the term \"new world order\" and its relationship to \"a strengthened UN.\" All denied that there were any plans to transform the UN into a world government. \"Nobody even talks about world government anymore, or seriously considers it,\" said Charles Maynes. \"People gave up on that idea 30 years ago.\" Maynes, whose journal is published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, one of the premier fountains of world government propaganda, obviously knows better because he regularly publishes the Establishment world order line. Most Americans, however, find it difficult to believe that individuals in prestigious positions, like Maynes, their senator, or the President, would lie to them or deceive them. But it is time to face facts: The historical record and the unfolding of current events patently contradict the denials and expose them for lies. It daily becomes more obvious that the world government advocates are pushing toward their goal with increased zeal and audacity. At the time of the Purdue conference, President Bush was pressing for the most far-reaching transfers of authority, prestige, and power to the United Nations that have taken place since its founding. Under the pretext of saving the people of Kuwait from the \"naked aggression\" of Saddam Hussein, he trumpeted his \"new world order\" gospel almost daily, even including as its centerpiece a call for new military muscle for the world body. In the succeeding months, as we have mentioned in previous chapters, he went even further, supporting UN Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali’s call for a permanent UN Army and pledging America’s economic and military support for the revolutionary venture. Extensive Evidence of Intent Anyone who is willing to spend a little time in a library researching this issue will have little difficulty verifying that the movement for world government has been underway in earnest for many decades. It has been led and supported by CFR members and their kindred spirits for most of this century.

During the 1930s, ’40s, and ’50s, many influential works by noted political leaders and intellectuals openly called for the supplanting of national governments by a one-world government. In his 1940 book, The New World Order , for instance, popular British novelist/historian H. G. Wells denounced \"nationalist individualism\" as \"the world’s disease\" and proposed as an alternative a \"collectivist one-world state.\"5 Wells, a leading member of the Fabian Socialist Society, stated further: [T]hese two things, the manifest necessity for some collective world control to eliminate warfare and the less generally admitted necessity for a collective control of the economic and biological life of mankind, are aspects of one and the same process .6 [Emphasis in original] That same year saw publication of The City of Man: A Declaration on World Democracy , which called for a \"new order\" where \"All states, deflated and disciplined, must align themselves under the law of the world-state....\"7 Penned by radical theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, socialist philosopher Lewis Mumford, and other famous literati, it was greeted with critical acclaim by the CFR Establishment media. \"Universal peace,\" these one-worlders declared, \"can be founded only on the unity of man under one law and one government.\"8 No, they were not envisioning the Second Coming of Jesus Christ and a world subject to God’s rule; they had in mind a worldly kingdom of their own making. In the fall of 1945, immediately following the UN founding conference in San Francisco, some of America’s most famous educators met at the Rockefeller-endowed University of Chicago to propose the creation of an Institute of World Government. Their proposal resulted in the Committee to Frame a World Constitution, under the chairmanship of University of Chicago Chancellor Robert Maynard Hutchins.9 Chancellor Hutchins was the Establishment’s \"golden boy\" of academe and the logical choice to lead the One-World crusade among the nation’s intelligentsia. The Committee was heavy with \"Hutchins’ boys\" from the University of Chicago faculty: Mortimer Adler, Richard McKeon, Robert Redfield, Wilbur Katz, and Rexford Guy Tugwell. They were joined by such luminaries as Stringfellow Barr (St. John’s College), Albert GuŽrard (Stanford), Harold Innis (Toronto), Charles McIlwain (Harvard), and Erich Kahler (Princeton).10 In 1948, the Committee unveiled its Preliminary Draft of a World Constitution , published by the University of Chicago Press.11 The principal author of this document was the Committee’s secretary- general, G.A. Borgese, a renowned author of books dealing with literary criticism, history, and political science and a professor of romance languages at the University of Chicago. The following year, Senator Glen Taylor of Idaho introduced a resolution in the U.S. Senate stating that \"the present Charter of the United Nations should be changed to provide a true world government constitution.\"12 Authored by Borgese, Hutchins, Tugwell, et al., it was reintroduced in 1950.13 file:///D|/DESTROY_THE_NWO(2.0)/Ebooks%20in%20progress/chapter_05.html (3 of 14)6/19/2004 10:29:52 PM"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 John Foster Dulles (CFR), who would become President Eisen’s first Secretary of State, added his considerable influence to the world government campaign in 1950 with the publication of his book, War or Peace . \"The United Nations,\" he wrote, \"represents not a final stage in the development of world order, but only a primitive stage. Therefore its primary task is to create the conditions which will make possible a more highly developed organization.\"14 A founding member of the CFR and one of Colonel House’s young protŽgŽs, Dulles was a delegate to the UN founding conference. He had married into the Rockefeller family and eventually served as chairman of both the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Endowment. It was Chairman Dulles who chose Communist Alger Hiss to be president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.15 Earlier, Dulles had turned his attention toward religion and, in 1941, had become the first chairman of the Commission on a Just and Durable Peace of the subversive Federal Council of Churches. The efforts to draft a set of internationalist principles on which peace might be built sounded to him, he said, like an echo of the Gospels.16 His commission’s first order of business was to pass a resolution proclaiming that ... a world of irresponsible, competing and unrestrained national sovereignties, whether acting alone or in alliance or in coalition, is a world of international anarchy. It must make place for a higher and more inclusive authority.17 Dulles’s credentials as a certified, top-level Establishment Insider intimately involved in the design and creation of the UN make this following quote from War or Peace especially significant. He wrote: I have never seen any proposal made for collective security with \"teeth\" in it, or for \"world government\" or for \"world federation,\" which could not be carried out either by the United Nations or under the United Nations Charter.18 That same year, 1950, fellow one-world Insider James P. Warburg (CFR) would testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee, claiming: We shall have world government, whether or not we like it. The question is only whether world government will be achieved by consent or by conquest.19 Additional intellectual ammunition for the campaign came with publication of Foundations of the World Republic by Professor Borgese in 1953. There was no mistaking the book’s intent; the publisher (again, the University of Chicago Press) had this to say in the opening sentences of the promotional fly-leaf of the book’s dust jacket: WORLD GOVERNMENT, asserts Mr. Borgese, is inevitable. It will be born in one of two ways. It may come as a World Empire, with mass enslavement imposed by the victor of World War III; or it may take the form of a World Federal Republic, established by file:///D|/DESTROY_THE_NWO(2.0)/Ebooks%20in%20progress/chapter_05.html (4 of 14)6/19/2004 10:29:52 PM"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 gradual integration of the United Nations.20 [Emphasis in original] Immediately below that promotional blurb appeared this endorsement from University of Chicago Professor Robert Redfield: \"This book is about the necessary interdependence of peace, justice, and power. It is an argument for world government. It is a revelation that justice is, in the end, love.\" At about the same time Saturday Review was candidly editorializing: If UNESCO is attacked on the grounds that it is helping to prepare the world’s peoples for world government, then it is an error to burst forth with apologetic statements and denials. Let us face it: the job of UNESCO is to help create and promote the elements of world citizenship. When faced with such a \"charge,\" let us by all means affirm it from the housetops.21 Lewis Mumford added more endorsements for the idea of a world state with statements like the following from The Transformations of Man : [T]he destiny of mankind, after its long preparatory period of separation and differentiation, is at last to become one.... This unity is on the point of being politically expressed in a world government that will unite nations and regions in transactions beyond their individual capacity....22 In his 1959 book The West in Crisis , CFR member James P. Warburg (who was also an Insider banker, economist and former member of FDR’s socialist \"brain trust\") proclaimed: ... a world order without world law is an anachronism ... since war now means the extinction of civilization, a world which fails to establish the rule of law over the nation- states cannot long continue to exist. We are living in a perilous period of transition from the era of the fully sovereign nation- state to the era of world government.23 Moreover, said Warburg, we must initiate \"a deliberate search for methods and means by which American children may best be educated into ... responsible citizens not merely of the United States but of the world.\"24 In 1960, Atlantic Union Committee treasurer Elmo Roper (CFR) delivered an address and authored a pamphlet, both of which were entitled, \"The Goal is Government of All the World.\" In his appeal for global rule, Roper said: \"For it becomes clear that the first step toward world government cannot be completed until we have advanced on the four fronts: the economic, the military, the political, and the social.\"25 file:///D|/DESTROY_THE_NWO(2.0)/Ebooks%20in%20progress/chapter_05.html (5 of 14)6/19/2004 10:29:52 PM"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 Just the Tip of the Iceberg We have, thus far, barely scratched the surface of the massive accumulation of world-government propaganda issued during the past several decades. Several additional chapters could easily be devoted to further presentation of examples from Establishment sources. We could turn to the late Norman Cousins (CFR, Planetary Citizens, United World Federalists, editor of Saturday Review ), a one-worlder who tended to wear his colors openly. On Earth Day, April 22, 1970, he asserted, \"Humanity needs a world order. The fully sovereign nation is incapable of dealing with the poisoning of the environment.... The management of the planet, therefore — whether we are talking about the need to prevent war or the need to prevent ultimate damage to the conditions of life — requires a world-government.\"26 We could also cite the Humanist Manifesto II (1973), a blatantly anti-Christian, anti-American document openly endorsed by some of America’s most prominent authors, educators, academicians, scientists, and philosophers. It declares: We deplore the division of humankind on nationalistic grounds. We have reached a turning point in human history where the best option is to transcend the limits of national sovereignty and to move toward the building of a world community.... a system of world law and a world order based upon transnational federal government.27 [Emphasis in original] It would also be worthwhile to discuss the campaign during the 1960s and ’70s for A Constitution for the World , another effort of Messrs. Tugwell, Hutchins, et al., funded and promoted by the Ford Foundation through the Fund for the Republic and the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions.28 Or, we could examine the growing momentum behind more recent efforts, such as those of the World Constitution and Parliament Association, which have attracted the support of political figures, jurists, celebrities, and intellectuals from 85 countries. In 1991, the World Constitution and Parliament Association launched a \"3-year intensive global ratification campaign\" for a proposed \"Constitution for the Federation of Earth.\" The organization enjoys the support of such \"Honorary Sponsors\" as Nobel laureates George Wald, Glenn T. Seaborg (CFR), and Desmond Tutu, and other notables such as actor Ed Asner, Scientific American editor and publisher Gerard Piel (CFR), SWAPO terrorist leader and President of Namibia Sam Nujoma, psychologist Kenneth Clark, and former Attorney General Ramsey Clark.29 We have space here, however, for presentation of only a small selection of material out of a vast deposit of globalist agit-prop. Those who require more evidence to become convinced that Americans have been subjected to — and are being subjected to — a conscious, well-orchestrated, long-range propaganda campaign by the CFR Establishment and its vast network of transmission belts and allies need only spend some time in a major library perusing the literature under the subject headings \"world government,\" \"world order,\" \"interdependence,\" \"internationalism,\" and \"globalism.\" file:///D|/DESTROY_THE_NWO(2.0)/Ebooks%20in%20progress/chapter_05.html (6 of 14)6/19/2004 10:29:52 PM"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 Attacks on National Sovereignty However, while many of the passages we have cited are straightforward appeals for world government, the CFR Insiders and their one-world propagandists more frequently resort to the oblique approach of advancing \"world order\" through attacks on national sovereignty. Since a one-world government is impossible as long as nations retain their sovereign powers to conduct their own affairs as they see fit, it makes sense for the globalists to undermine the whole concept of national sovereignty. Over a period of time, the peoples of the world might be convinced gradually to surrender aspects of national sovereignty to international institutions until, ultimately, world government is an established fact. This internationalist theme was delivered to the Foreign Affairs reading audience 70 years ago in the CFR journal’s second issue. \"Obviously there is going to be no peace or prosperity for mankind,\" the December 1922 Foreign Affairs claimed, \"so long as it remains divided into fifty or sixty independent states.\"30 The problem for the CFR was overcoming the American people’s \"sovereignty fetish.\" The Council pondered this difficulty in its 1944 publication entitled American Public Opinion and Postwar Security Commitments . Therein we find: The sovereignty fetish is still so strong in the public mind, that there would appear to be little chance of winning popular assent to American membership in anything approaching a super-state organization. Much will depend on the kind of approach which is used in further popular education.31 The gradualist approach, as outlined for instance in The International Problem of Governing Mankind , by Columbia University professor and later World Court justice Philip C. Jessup (CFR), was the strategy most often adopted by the Insider internationalists. \"I agree that national sovereignty is the root of the evil,\" Jessup wrote in his 1947 book. But, he noted: \"The question of procedure remains. Can the root be pulled up by one mighty revolutionary heave, or should it first be loosened by digging around it and cutting the rootlets one by one?\"32 Like most of his elitist confreres, he opted for the piecemeal approach. Archetypal CFR Insider and former FDR Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau recognized the need for the step-by-step approach: \"We can hardly expect the nation-state to make itself superfluous, at least not overnight. Rather what we must aim for is recognition in the minds of all responsible statesmen that they are really nothing more than caretakers of a bankrupt international machine which will have to be transformed slowly into a new one. The transition will not be dramatic, but a gradual one. People will still cling to national symbols.\"33 Years later, in 1975, former Secretary of the Treasury C. Douglas Dillon, an ardent CFR globalist and honorary chairman of the Institute for World Order, admitted that it would still \"take a while before people in this country as a whole will be ready for any substantial giving-up of sovereignty to handle file:///D|/DESTROY_THE_NWO(2.0)/Ebooks%20in%20progress/chapter_05.html (7 of 14)6/19/2004 10:29:52 PM"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 global problems.\"34 Not that members of the CFR crowd were taking a lackadaisical attitude. Far from it — they had been engaged in full-scale sovereignty-bashing for decades. In his 1960 book The United States in the World Arena, Walt Whitman Rostow (CFR), who would rise to become chairman of the State Department’s Policy Planning Board and the President’s national security advisor, declared: [I]t is a legitimate American national objective to see removed from all nations — including the United States — the right to use substantial military force to pursue their own interests. Since this residual right is the root of national sovereignty and the basis for the existence of an international arena of power, it is, therefore, an American interest to see an end to nationhood as it has been historically defined.35 [Emphasis added] That kind of statement — literally advocating an end to our nation and our constitutional system of government — should have immediately disqualified Rostow for any government position. It would be impossible for him, in good faith, to take the oath of office to defend and protect the U.S. Constitution while adhering to such a position. However, quite to the contrary, it was this very same subversive, internationalist commitment that guaranteed his promotion by fellow one-world Insiders. Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, the war against national sovereignty was being led by the likes of Senator J. William Fulbright, longtime chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and one of the most influential members of Congress. In his 1964 book Old Myths and New Realities , Fulbright declared: Indeed, the concept of national sovereignty has become in our time a principle of international anarchy....36 * * * ... the sovereign nation can no longer serve as the ultimate unit of personal loyalty and responsibility.37 New York Governor and perennial presidential aspirant Nelson Rockefeller also certified his globalist credentials with frequent attacks on nationalism. Echoing the familiar Establishment theme at the 1962 Godkin lectures at Harvard University, he averred that \"the nation-state, standing alone, threatens, in many ways, to seem as anachronistic as the Greek city-state eventually became in ancient times.\"38 In his Harvard lectures, published in 1964 under the title The Future of Federalism , Rockefeller warned against the \"fever of nationalism\" and declared that \"the nation-state is becoming less and less competent to perform its international political tasks.\"39 His solutions? \"All these, then, are some of the reasons — economic, military, political — pressing us to lead vigorously toward the true building of a new world order .\"40 (Emphasis added) \"More specifically, I hope and urge,\" stated Mr. Rockefeller, \"... there will evolve the bases for a federal structure of the free world.\"41 file:///D|/DESTROY_THE_NWO(2.0)/Ebooks%20in%20progress/chapter_05.html (8 of 14)6/19/2004 10:29:52 PM"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 In his 1972 book World Without Borders , Worldwatch Institute President Lester Brown (CFR) noted the continuing \"problem\" faced by himself and his fellow globalists: \"Needless to say, sovereign nation- states steadfastly resist the transfer of power necessary to create strong supranational institutions.\"42 He continued: There is discussion from time to time on the need for a full-fledged world government. Realistically, this is not likely to come about in the short run. If we can build some of the supranational institutions that are needed in various areas ... adding them to the International Monetary Fund, INTELSAT and the many others already in existence, these will eventually come to constitute an effective, though initially limited world government.43 The \"existing international system,\" Brown has declared, \"... must be replaced by a new world order .\"44 (Emphasis added) \"Declaration of INTERdependence\" One of the Insiders’ most audacious propaganda gambits in support of the new world order was the world-government-promoting \"Declaration of INTERdependence,\" unveiled in 1975 during the planning for our nation’s 1976 bicentennial.45 Sponsored by the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia and written by Establishment historian Henry Steele Commager (CFR), the \"Declaration of INTERdependence\" turned the Founding Fathers upside-down, declaring: When in the course of history the threat of extinction confronts mankind, it is necessary for the people of The United States to declare their interdependence with the people of all nations.... To establish a new world order of compassion, peace, justice and security, it is essential that mankind free itself from the limitations of national prejudice, and acknowledge ... that all people are part of one global community....

The declaration of interdependence is an attack on loyalty to American freedom and institutions, which the document calls \"chauvinistic nationalism,\" \"national prejudice,\" and \"narrow notions of national sovereignty.\"46 To accompany, promote, and expand upon the \"Declaration of INTERdependence,\" the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia and the Aspen Institute published The Third Try at World Order: U.S. Policy for an Interdependent World written by Harlan Cleveland (CFR).* In that book, Cleveland, a former Assistant Secretary of State and U.S. Ambassador to NATO, lamented that the first try at \"world order\" collapsed with the failure to secure U.S. entry into the League of Nations and that the second failure resulted from a United Nations that was not invested with sufficient authority and power to enact and enforce world law.47 According to Cleveland, the \"third try,\" now underway, is an attempt to arrive at \"world governance\" piecemeal, by strengthening the UN to deal with various global \"crises\" involving, for instance, \"the global environment,\" \"food reserve[s],\" \"energy supplies,\" \"fertility rates,\" \"military stalemate,\" and \"conflict in a world of proliferating weapons.\"48 It was a recapitulation of what he had written in 1964 in the foreword to Richard N. Gardner’s book, In Pursuit of World Order , wherein Cleveland stated: \"A decent world order will only be built brick by brick.\"49 Piece by Piece, Brick by Brick CFR luminary Richard N. Gardner took this same message of patient, persistent plodding to the Council’s members and followers in 1974, with his now-famous article in Foreign Affairs entitled \"The Hard Road to World Order.\" Since hopes for \"instant world government\" had proven illusory, he wrote, \"the house of world order\" would have to be built through \"an end run around national sovereignty, eroding it piece by piece.\" This could be done, he noted, on an ad hoc basis with treaties and international \"arrangements\" that could later be brought within \"the central institutions of the U.N. system.\"50 As we shall see, this gradualist road to world order, as outlined by Jessup, Cleveland, Gardner, et al. — \"root by root,\" \"brick by brick,\" \"piece by piece\" — has been followed assiduously by the one-worlders and is now rapidly approaching completion. However, even at this late hour, it still is not too late to throw a wrench into their well-oiled machine and topple their planned \"house of world order\" like a house of cards. * Like many of his fellow Establishment Insiders — Walt and Eugene Rostow, Dean Acheson, John McCloy, and Robert McNamara — Cleveland had a long career on the far left that is worthy of note. Dr. Francis X. Gannon, in his authoritative Biographical Dictionary of the Left, recorded: \"At Princeton, Cleveland was president of the Anti-War Society for three years and in the Princeton yearbook he listed file:///D|/DESTROY_THE_NWO(2.0)/Ebooks%20in%20progress/chapter_05.html (10 of 14)6/19/2004 10:29:52 PM"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 himself as a ‘Socialist.’\" Intelligence expert Frank A. Capell reported in his column for The Review Of The News for August 21, 1974: \"Cleveland wrote articles for Far Eastern Survey and Pacific Affairs , publications of the Institute of Pacific Relations, a subversive organization described by the Senate Judiciary Committee as ‘an instrument of Communist policy, propaganda and military intelligence.’ He worked with John Abt and other key Reds on the staff of the LaFollette Civil Liberties Committee. He worked as deputy to Soviet agent Harold Glasser inside U.N.R.R.A. [United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] and took part in ‘Operation Keelhaul,’ sending nearly five million Europeans into Russian concentration camps.\" William J. Gill’s shocking 1969 expose of the extensive subversion in the U.S. government, The Ordeal of Otto Otepka (New Rochelle, NY: Arlington House), devotes more than two chapters to the pro-communist exploits of Harlan Cleveland. After having been brought into the State Department during the Kennedy Administration on a security waiver signed by Dean Rusk, Cleveland began to load up his staff with other security risks. One of those he tried to hire was his longtime friend Irving Swerdlow, who had been discharged eight years earlier as a security risk. He then stunned Otto Otepka, the chief of the State Department’s personnel security, by asking: \"What are the chances of getting Alger Hiss back into the Government?\" In 1962, the State Department’s Advisory Committee on International Organizations, chaired by Cleveland, attempted to devise an end run around the security checks on Americans employed by the United Nations. The new security procedures had been instituted in the wake of the Hiss espionage scandal and the revelations that he and his brother, Donald Hiss, had personally recruited more than 200 people for UN jobs.

If it is, th en we have no Constitution. 1 — Thomas Jefferson, September 1803 Treaties make international law and also they make domestic law. Under our Constitution, treaties become the supreme law of the land.... [T]reaty law can overri de the Constitution. Treaties, for example, ... can cu t across the rights given the people by their constitutional Bill of Rights. 2 — Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, April 11, 1952 [A]fter all, the UN Charter is the law of the land.... 3 — George L. Sherry (CFR) , The United Nations Reborn , 1990 The main political obstacle to the new world order envisioned by the one-world schemers has been, and remains, the Constitution of the United States of Am erica. Unique in both its foundational principles and structure, the constitutional syst em established by America’s Founding Fathers — abused though it may be by decades of sustained assault on the one hand a nd neglect on the other — continues to stymie the architects of totalita rian global government. From their own experience, and from an acquain tance with history, the Americans of 1776 and 1787 well understood that the dangers to liberty from an unrestrained govern ment were, more often than not, far greater than the threat of tyranny from a conquering foreign power. Th e limitations placed on government by the designers of our founding document, therefore, se rved as formidable bulwarks against the dangerous centralization of power in the nationa l government; those limi tations also rendered any transfers of consti tutional powers of governance to an international govern ment virtually impossible. One of 20th century America’s mo st passionate defenders of libe rty against the encroachments o f omnipotent government was Frank Chodorov, editor of The Freeman . Writing in 1955, in a special issue devoted to exposing and opposing \"One Worldi sm and the United Na tions,\" he noted: Government is the monopoly of coercion. Its function is to pr event individuals from using violence or other coercive me thods on one another, so that the business of Society — the exchange of goods, services and ideas — may be carried on in safety and tranquility. Its contribution to social progress, though nece ssary, is purely negative. In this country, tradition and the Constitution hold that the function of gove rnment is to protect the individual in the enjoyment of those rights which inhere in hi m by virtue of existence, and which are the gifts of the Creator. And in the beginning, before traditi on and the spirit of the Constitution were perverted, Americans took for granted th at government had no other competence.4 \"But the hard fact,\" said Chodor ov, \"is that this monopoly of coerci on is vested in humans — of which government is necessarily composed — and that these humans are no different in make-up from those they are called upon to coerce.\"5 Th at is indeed a hard fact that no amount of wishful thinking or high- flown rhetoric about g lobal brotherhood can chan g e. It was the reco g nition of j ust such hard realities as"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"these that prompted Thomas Jefferson to issue his famous dictum: \"In questions of power let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the constitution.\"6 The failure of peoples to keep governme nt rigidly contained have time after time tragically proven the wisdom of Jefferson’s admoni tion. Chodorov agreed and noted: Thus in time the agency established for the purpose of protecti ng Society becomes its master. This tendency of government to expand upon its po wer and its prerogatives is inherent in it simply because it is composed of men.... Theref ore, the concern of Society, particularly in the last few centuries, has been to find some way to keep government within bounds. Thus came constitutionalism. Thus came the idea that to safeguard freedom — from government, of course — it is necessary to keep government small, so that it can be subject to constant surveillance, and poor, so that it cannot get out of hand.7 Chodorov was confirming what the founders believed, that government itself must be made subject to \"the rule of law.\" The American re public, as a result, in its earlier years, could proudl y claim to be \"a government of laws, not of men. \" Another champion of freedom, John F. McManus, more recently offered the following observation about the uni que foundation of American constitutionalism: The underlying premise of the American system is the t hunderous assertion in the Declaration of Independence th at \"all men ... are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights.\" Because they are endowed with rights, the Decl aration reasons, men have the power to protect their rights collectively. In other wo rds, they have the power to form a government. The government they create is to have as its sole purpose the protection of the God-given rights of the individual. Government is not to be the distributor of wealth, the regulator of the law-abiding citi zenry, or the ruler of the people.8 Unfortunately, there are in our midst today many powerful indivi duals and organizations who find such p ersonal freedom, and the principles of governance th at make it possible, totally repugnant. For both p ersonal freedom and limitations on government power obstruct their plans to create a \"new world order\" for the planet. CFR Versus the Constitution To the Council on Foreign Relations, for example, our exquisite system with its checks and balances and separation of powers, which has ear ned the plaudits of renowned polit ical observers worldwide, erects impenetrable obstacles that \"militate against the de velopment of responsible government.\" In one of its very early and revealing reports, Survey of American Relations (1928), we find the Council lamenting: The Roman republic and the Hanoverian monarchy described by Montesquieu and Blackstone were both governme nts of separation of powers maintained by checks and balances. Both were forced to achieve unity by the increase of international complications. One went the way of executive sovereignty; the other that of parliamentary sovereignty. The difficulties in the way of either such deve lopment in the United States are obvious. While presidents have sometimes acted like dictators in brief emergencie s, an intensive reaction of congressional control has always followed. The jealous control of the purse by Congress is a check which would inevitably curb an ambiti ous president if the el ectorate’s opposition to a third term should wane. Fu rthermore, the physical sepa ration of the cabinet from Con g ress, the com p arative e q ualit y of p ower of the two houses, renderin g each a check"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"upon the other, the \"states’ rights\" sentiment which prevents a gradua l subordination of the Senate, and the position of th e Supreme Court as final inte rpreter of the constitutional separation of powers — all these militate against the development of responsible government .9 [Emphasis added] The Council was, at this point, st ill struggling mightily against the tr iumphant \"isolationism\" that had ruined the internationalists’ \"first try at world or der,\" the League of Nations. It was the one-worlders’ failure to secure the constitutionall y required two-thirds majority in th e Senate necessary for ratification of all treaties that doomed the League. Thus, the 1928 Council repor t stressed at length the need to remove this constitutional obs tacle to \"responsible government .\" The CFR report stated: The seriousness of the situation is increased by th e apparent rigidity of the Senate’s attitude. Charles Cheney Hyde, former solicitor of the Department of State, believes that \"Any constructive proposal designed to make a successf ul appeal to those possessed of the treaty- making power of the United States must reckon with the following conditions: first, that this nation has a passion for independe nce; secondly, that it will not agree to be drawn into a war between other states; and, thirdly, that it will not delegate to any outside body the right to determine what is the natu re of a controversy or how it ought to be adjusted. These are facts.\" From this Professor Hyde assumes that the United States must limit her participation in international organization ac cordingly. Others have argued fr om the same premises that the Constitution must be amen ded to eliminate the two-th irds rule in the Senate.10 The Council report made clear its su pport for the elimination of this vital restraint on executive power. The 1928 report argued: Substitution of a majori ty of both houses for two-thirds of the Senate in treaty ratification would accord with the practice of most continental European governments. It would obviate the complaints of the House and eliminate the ever-present possibi lity of inability to execute a treaty, valid at internationa l law, because of the refusa l of the House to agree to appropriations or necessary le gislation. This would seem re asonable, in view of the constitutional provision that tr eaties are the supreme law of the land, and on this score was suggested in the Federal convention of 1787. It would also render deadlocks less frequent, because one political party is much more likely to control a majority of both houses than two-thirds of the Senate.... In any case, the desirability of preventing deadlocks when treaties are as necessary as legisl ation should overrule these objections.11 The two-thirds requirement \"exceed s the need for a check on administrative usurpation,\" said the Council’s Survey. \"... Such a division of pow ers,\" it held, far from provi ding needed protection, \"... has too often resulted in weakness, muddle, and delay, so metimes even in the paralysis of one of the most vital functions of modern governme nt.\"12 It is certain that the CFR hand-wri ngers would have foun d little if any sympathy among this nation’s founders for their interpre tation of \"the most vital functions o f modern government.\" More than half a century later, the Establishment’s brain trusters are still ve nting their spleen over the aggravation the Constitution cont inues to cause them. In his The Power to Lead (1984), Professor James MacGregor Burns stated: \"Let us fa ce reality. The framers [of the U.S. Constitution] have simply been too shrewd for us. They have outwitted us. They de signed separated instituti ons that cannot be unified by mechanical linkages, frail bridge s, tinkering. If we are to ‘turn the founders upside down’ — to put to g ether what the y p ut asunder — we must directl y confront the consti tutional structure the y erected.\"13"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Professor Burns has served as co-director of Project ’87 and as a board member of the Committee on the Constitutional System (CCS), two of the Establishment’s most important agencies working to radically change the Constitution. Both organizations, heav ily larded with CFR members, are ready with p roposals that would drasti cally alter our system of government should a constitutional convention be called. Most Americans are completely unaware that our nation is dangerously close to completing the p rocess to convene a constitutional convention.14 Professor Charles Hardin, a CCS founder, has written in the Commit tee’s important 1985 book o f essays, Reforming American Government , that the Senate \"should be de prived of its power to approve treaties and presidential nominations.\"15 Moreover, Ha rdin believes: \"The ideal is to create conditions so that the conduct of government itself will be ruled largel y by conventions rather than by fixe d laws .\"16 (Emphasis added) The one-worlders have failed thus far to effect the \"major surger y\" on the Constitution advocated by Hardin, Burns, et al.,17 bu t they continue undeterred on their s ubversive course. Since the Constitu’s amendment process was purpos efully made difficult by the framers so as to protect against the very tampering and aggrandizement the internationalists propose, their primary strategy to create \"world order,\" as we have seen, has i nvolved revising the Constitution \"pi ece by piece\" by means of \"treaty law.\" This gigantic fraud has been perpetrated ag ainst the American people by CFR Insiders working in concert with the media, aca deme, and the federal executive, legisl ative, and judicial branches during much of this century. It is highly doubtful that the UN Charter would have been ratified by the U. S., or by many othe r countries for that matter, w ithout inclusion of Article 2, Paragraph 7, which provides: Nothing contained in the presen t Charter shall authorize the Un ited Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domesti c jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter....18 The wording and meaning seem clea r enough: Membership in the UN, as indicated by acceptance of the Charter, in no way constitutes surrender of contro l over domestic affairs to the world organization. As successful as the CFR’s internati onalist propaganda campaign was in selling the UN idea in 1945, it would have failed if there had b een any admission that the real inte nt was to allow other nations and international bureaucrats to meddle in and dict ate policies concerning our internal affairs. However, what the UN provides with one hand it takes with the other. Article 2, Paragraph 7 of the UN Charter also states: \"... but this principle shall not prej udice the application of enforcement measures under Chapter VII.\" This wording c ould well be used by UN official s to authorize intervention by the organization in the domestic affairs of a member nation. So, even thou gh the first portion of Paragraph 7 would seem to prohibit a ny such meddling, the final portion could be construed as a loophole that would allow such intervention. Many other UN documents contain am biguous wording of this type. S hould the UN ever decide to act contrary to its own clea r prohibitions, internationa list legal scholars will focus on whichever portion o f the ambiguous wording suits their fancy. Indeed, almost before the ink on the Charter had dried, a well-orchestrated campaign was underway to undercut and reverse the meaning of Article 2, Para graph 7. In 1946, William G. Carr, a consultant fo r the United States delegation at the Sa n Francisco Conferen ce, wrote in his book One World In the M akin g :"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Under modern conditions, few ac ts of a nation affect only it s own people.... It seems clear that no nation which signs this [UN] Charter can just ly maintain that any of its acts are its own business, or within it s own domestic jurisdiction , if the Security Council says that these acts are a threat to the peace.19 [Emphasis added] Soon thereafter, this same them e was being transmitted via many respected sources. The April 1949 A merican Bar Association Journa l , for instance, carried an arti cle by UN staff member Moses Moskowitz contending that ... once a matter has become, in one way or another, the subjec t of regulation by the United Nations, be it by reso lution of the General Assembly or by convention between member states at the insistence of th e United Nations, that subjec t ceases to be a matter being \"essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the Member States.\" As a matter of fact, such a position represents the offi cial view of the United Nations , as well as of the member states that have voted in favor of th e Universal Declaration of Human Rights.20 Such incredibly arrogant advocacy of the usurpati on of sovereign national pow ers should have met with immediate rebuke from American of ficials. Instead, it was embraced as our nation’s official position with President Harry S Truman’s claim in 1950 that \"There is now no longer any real difference between domestic and foreign affairs.\"21 In like manner, President Dwight Eisenhower subsequently declared: \"For us indeed there are no longe r ‘foreign affairs’ and ‘foreign policy. ’ Since such affairs belong to and affect the entire world, they are essentially local affairs for every nation, including our own.\"22 Dulles and Treaty Law It was Eisenhower’s Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, however, who touched off heated national debate about the issue wi th his highly controversial speech before the regional meeti ng of the American Bar Association at Louisville , Kentucky in 1952. In his formal address, Dulles asserted: Treaties make international law and also they make domestic law. U nder our Constitution, treaties become the supreme law of the land. Th ey are, indeed, more supreme than ordinary laws for congressional laws are invalid if th ey do not conform to the Constitution, whereas treaty law can override the Cons titution. Treaties, for example, can take powers away from the Congress and give them to the President; th ey can take powers from the States and give them to the Federal Government or to some international body, and they can cut across the rights given the people by their c onstitutional Bill of Rights.23 Dulles was grossly misint erpreting the Constitution on several ve ry important points. In fact, his dissertation was an outright assaul t on the basic premises of our c onstitutional system. It would behoove us at this point to see what the Constitution, \"the supreme law of the land,\" has to say about treaties and the treaty power. In the Constitution we find: Article II, Sec. 2: \"[The Presid ent] shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two- thirds of the Senators present concur....\" Article III, Sec. 2: \"The judi cial Power shall extend to all Ca ses, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Trea ties made, or which shall be made, under their Authorit y ....\""},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Article VI: \"This Constitution, a nd the Laws of the United Stat es which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Tr eaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judge s in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in th e Constitution or La ws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\" John F. McManus, writing in The New American, commented on an important distinction regarding the wording of Article VI that is rare ly mentioned. \"It must be carefully noted,\" he observed, \"that, within the body of the Constitution itself, the founders freque ntly referred to the document they had crafted as ‘this’ Constitution. At the close of the above passage, they referred to ‘the’ Constitution, and what they meant was that no state constituti on or state law shall stand above the U.S. Constitution. There is no j ustification for holding that the document empowers the makers of treaties to undo the Constitution itself.\"24 According to Dulles, Moskowitz, and modern S upreme Court interpretati ons, however, Article VI amounts to an unlimited grant of power through which the President and two-thirds of a quorum of the Senate may do virtually anything. President Eisenhower, Secretar y Dulles, and their internationalist cohorts even went so far as to claim that the real danger to th e Constitution came not from an expansive interpretation of the treaty power, but from attempts to explicitly and unequivocally guarantee that \"treaty law\" would not be able to override the Constitution.25 A close examination of the Consti tution’s wording and the \"original intent\" of the framers, however, make abundantly clear that the position espoused by McManus is far more in tune with what was intended in our founding document th an the opinion taken by Dulles, Mo skowitz, et al. James Madison, who was the secretary of the Philad elphia Convention, the prin cipal author of the Constitution, and has j ustly been called \"the Father of the Constitution,\" said of the scope of the treaty power: I do not conceive that power is given to the President and the Senate to dismember the empire, or alienate any great, essential right. I do not think th e whole legislative authority have this power. The exercise of the power must be consis tent with the object of the delegation.26 In 1801, the year he began his presidency, Thomas Jefferson published his aut horitative reference work, A Manual of Parlia mentary Practice , which went through many prin tings and became a standar d handbook used in both the House and Senate. In that book, Jefferson declared of treaty power: 1. It is admitted that it must concern the foreign nation, party to the contract, or it would be a mere nullity res inter alias [sic] acta. 2. By the general power to make treaties, the Constitution must have intended to compre hend only those objects which are usually regulated by treaty, and cannot be otherwise regulated. 3. It must have meant to except out of those the rights reserved to the states; for sure ly the President and Senate cannot do by treaty what the whole government is interdicted from doing in any way.27 This is not only sound legal opinion ; it is plain, common sense. If the Bill of Right s and the whole Constitution were to have any lasting force and meanin g, it could not have been intended that they could b e completely undone by means of treat y.* Or as Jefferson rightly observe d: \"I say the same as to the opinion of those who consider the gr ant of the treaty-making power as boundless. If it is, then we have no Constitution.\"28 Alexander Hamilton, one of the mo st forceful of the Federalists and one who often clashed with"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Jefferson, nevertheless agreed with his distinguished adversary on this importa nt point. Hamilton wrote: The only constitutional exce ption to the power of making treaties is, that it shall not change the Constitution.... On natural principles, a treaty, which should manifestly betray or sacrifice primary in terests of the state, would be null.29 \"A treaty cannot be made,\" Hamilton maintained, \"which alters the C onstitution of the country or which infringes any express exceptions to the power of the Constitution of the United States.\"30 Until recent times, this was also the opinion of th e vast majority of lega l scholars and the federal j udiciary. Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, for in stance, expressed the view commonly held by 19th century jurists when he opined: [T]hough the power is thus general and unrestric ted, it is not to be so construed as to destroy the fundamental laws of the state. A power given by the Constitution cannot be construed to authorize a destruction of ot her powers given in the same instrument.... A treaty to change the organization of the Gove rnment, or to annihilate its sovereignty, to overturn its republican form, or to deprive it of its constitu tional powers, would be void; because it would destroy, what it was designed merely to fulfill, the will of the people.31 Justice Stephen J. Field’s dictum in the 1890 case of Geofroy v. Riggs buttressed Story’s opinion. It stated: That the treaty power of the United States ex tends to all proper subj ects of negotiation between our government and the governments of other nations, is clear .... It would not be contended that it extends so far as to authorize what the Consti tution forbids, or a change in the character of the government or in that of one of the States, or a cessi on of any portion of the territory of the latter , without its consent.32 In New Orleans vs. United States (1836), the Supreme Court held: The government of the United St ates, as was well observed in the argument, is one of limited powers. It can exerci se authority over no subjects ex cept those which have been delegated to it. Congress cannot, by legislation, enlarge the federal jurisdiction, nor can it be enlarged under the treaty-making power .33 [Emphasis added] One of the most dedicated and articulate defenders of this view of the subordi nation of treaties to the Constitution was Frank Holman, past president of the American Bar Association. Beginning in 1948 with his first speech on the danger of \"treaty law\" gi ven at the State Bar of California, he launched a nationwide educational effort to marshal opposition to this dangerous encroachment. \"The doctrine that the treaty power is unlimit ed and omnipotent and may be used to override the Constitution and the Bill of Rights,\" said Holman, \"... is a doctrine of recent origin and largely derived from M issouri vs. H olland .\"34 (Emphasis in original) Concurring with Holman, constituti onal scholar Roger MacB ride maintained that the Supreme Court’s 1920 Missouri decision \"ushered in a new era of treaty jurisprudence\"35 by holding that a treaty does supersede the Constitution. Treat y Tra p s Proliferatin g"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Through the misuse of the treaty-ma king provision, the one-worlders have taken huge strides in their effort to \"turn the founders upside down.\" It is of paramount importa nce, therefore, that Americans exercise special vigilance concerning all treaties. Unfortunately, we find just the opposite to be the case; the American public appears to be totally oblivious to the flood of treaties intended to sweep away ou r constitutional protections. There was no fanfare, no opposition, and scant media coverage, for ex ample, when the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights sailed through the Senate on April 2, 1992 on an unrecorded vote. There was none of the intense, emot ional public debate that attended the Panama Canal Treaty ratification a few years earlier, but the Civil and Po litical Rights Covena nt (hereafter CP Covenant) represents a far greater danger to our constitutional system and to the rights of every American citizen. During hearings on the treaty c onducted by the Senate Committee on Foreign Re lations, Senator Jesse Helms was the only member to re gister opposition. \"Now this Sena tor and every other Member o f Congress has taken an oath of offi ce to protect and defend the Constitu tion of the United States,\" the N orth Carolina solon remi nded his colleagues. \"And that means we should be fully committed to the rights of the individual, which ar e enshrined in our Cons titution. And we should be committed to the p rotection of these individual rights. We cannot keep the co mmitment if we agree to the terms of this covenant.\"36 Why the conflict? Because, said He lms, the \"covenant calls into quest ion the right of freedom of speech, and freedom of the press, and just punishments — they are cl early constitutional, and even the Federal/State structure of our lega l system. Now any agreement that undercuts these rights is an attac k on human rights, not a safe guarding of human rights. This covenant , in sum, is a step backward into authoritarianism....\"37 Serious charges. But they were summarily dismi ssed by the more \"sophisti cated,\" internationally- minded members of the committee as the paranoid ravings of a hopel ess super-nationalis t. The serious flaws in the Covenant, however, are obvious and by no means inconse quential. In wording typical o f that found in the constitutions of communist st ates, the Covenant acknow ledges various rights o f individuals, then negates those ri ghts with all manner of conditions. Article 14, for example, states \"eve ryone shall be entitled to a fa ir and public hearing....\" Sound simila r to the U.S. Constitution’s guarantee \"to a speedy and public trial\"? A h, but the article then declares: \"The Press and the public may be ex cluded from all or part of a tr ial for reasons of morals, public order....\"38 It, in essence, provides legitimacy for secret tr ials, a hallmark of despotism throughout history. The enormous contrast between our Bill of Rights and the UN’s so-c alled \"human rights\" conventions should be evident to anyone willi ng to compare the documents. Article I of the U.S. Bi ll of Rights, fo r example, declares without quali fication, \"Congress shall make no la w respecting an establishment o f religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press....\" By way of contrast, Article 18 of the CP Covenant states, in part, \"Everyone shall ha ve the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.\" But then it goes on to assert: \"... Freedom to manifest one’s religion or belief s may be subject only to such limitati ons as are prescribed by law and are necessary....\"39 Likewise, Article 21 p ur p orts to g uarantee the ri g ht of p eaceful assembl y , but then p ermits the state to"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"limit this right for \"national securi ty or public safety, publ ic order, ... the protect ion of public health o r morals....\"40 What dictator couldn’t drive a tank th rough that opening? So it goes with the UN’s treatment of all rights we take for granted under our Constitution. The Bush Administration, seeking to blunt criticism of these glar ing defects, came up with five reservations, five understandings, four declarations, and numerous explanat ions (filling 18 pages) that it attached to the treaty. Declarati on Number 2 shows the weakness of Mr. Bush’s commitment to rights: \"[I]t is the view of the United States that Stat es Party to the Covenant s hould wherever possible refrain from imposing any restrictions or limitations on the exercise of th e rights recognized and protected by the Covenant, even when such restrictions and limitations are permissibl e under the terms of the Covenant.\"41 Read it again: \"should wherever possible refrai n.\" Translation: \"Pleas e use your dictatorial p owers sparingly — if you can help it.\" As Senator Helms noted: \"Many count ries controlled by totalitarian governments have signed on to this covenant, laughing all the way back to the garage.\" He also said, \"I have no doubt that these countries will not acknowledge our reservati ons, but they will use U.S. rati fication to make false charges o f violations of the covenant. Mark my words, that is precisely what will happen. Meanwhile, they will use the serious weaknesses of this covenant to justify their own cruel regimes.\"42 It is not only foreign dictators who put little store in the power of reservations and declarations. The State Department’s claim, for instance, that its Declaration Number 1 makes the treaty \"non-self- executing\" (that is, it \"will not creat e a cause of private acti on in U.S. courts\") is rejected by many treaty p roponents here in the United States. The Internat ional Human Rights Law Group stated: \"It is not clea r that such a declaration would be binding on the judiciary. Scholars and court decisions support the view that the issue whether a treaty is self-executing or not is one of construction by the courts.\"43 Abraham Katz, president of the United States Council for Intern ational Business, concurred, stating to the Senate committee: There are, however, no precise ru les for determining wh ether a treaty is self executing and, consequently, there is no cert ain method for making this dete rmination. Indeed the courts frequently disagree.... [S]ome federal courts may not feel bound by such a Senate declaration attached to the resolution of ratification and might nevertheless treat the ratification as being self executing....44 The World Court When the U.S. Constitution and the rights of American citizens conflict with treaties and UN covenants, as is likely to happen with increa sing frequency, there are cer tain to be many politicians, \"legal experts,\" and judges who will hold that Amer ican national interests, indivi dual rights, and domestic law must yield to the higher purposes of \"world order\" and \"the rule of law.\" In the interests of expediting this p rocess, Establishment Insiders have been trying for decades to expa nd the jurisdiction and authority o f the International Court of Justi ce (more commonly known as the Worl d Court).45 This makes all the more alarming the recently renewed campaign simultaneously to stre ngthen the Court and entangle the U.S. in a welter of new treaties. Writing in the Summer 1992 issue of the CFR’s Foreign Affairs , Representative Jim Leach (R-IA) declared: \"Since one of the most ef fective antidotes to the irrationalit y of ancient enmit y is the swift"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"j ustice of the law, a turn (or in the case of the United States, return) to the compulsory jurisdiction of the World Court would appear to be one of the most appropriate and achievable objectives of the decades ahead.\" Although the U.S. automatically became a member of the World Court in 1945 wh en the Senate ratified the UN Charter, we were not bound to accept it s compulsory jurisdicti on. The Senate resolution recognizing the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction excepted those \"disputes with regard to matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the United States.\" That was not enough to satisfy many Americans who rightly asked: \"B ut who will define ‘domestic jurisd iction?’\" It was apparent that if the definition were left up to the UN or its World Court to decide, there woul d be very little if any \"domestic jurisdiction.\" To assuage these fears, Senate Foreign Relati ons Committee Chairman Tom Connally (D-TX), who favored the resolution, proposed the a ddition of these eight words: \"a s determined by the United States of America.\" These eight words comprise what is known as the Connally Rese rvation.46 And, as autho r G. Edward Griffin has poi nted out, these words \"are all that stand between us and complete legal subjection to the whims of fifteen or nine or five or even tw o men [of the World Court] whose legal b ackgrounds and personal ideologies ma y be strongly antipathetic to the free world in general and to the United States in particular.\"47 Even that scant protection, however, may soon disappear — b y outright repeal or by \"overriding\" agreements, treaties or court rulings — unless a signi ficant portion of the American public can be roused to a robust, determined opposition to this treachery. The deluge of treaties now in various stages of readiness a nd preparation — regarding the \"environment\" (see Chapter 7), \"children’s rights\" (see Chapter 8), \"peace and disarmament\" (see Chapters 1 and 2), and a host of ot her issues — has the ca pability of utterly de stroying our Republic i f they are approved. But it is not treaties alone that cons titute this threat; the U.S. Depart ment of State includes the following in its \"sources of international la w making\": \"treaties, executive agre ements, legislation, ... testimony and statements before Congressional and international bodies ....\"48 The period of 1990-99 has been declared by the United Nati ons General Assembly to be \"the Un ited Nations Decade of International Law.\"49 As such, it being used to propel additional assaults on national sovereignty. Americans must face up to the real ity that our heritage of freedom under the \"rule of law\" of the Constitution is being replaced piecemeal by the tyranni cal \"rule of men\" under th e Charter of the United N ations. We must decide now , while there is yet time, which future we will choose for ourselves and ou r p osterity. * It is worth noting that the legal status of the United Nations Charter itself is, or should be, very much in question. Speaking before the House of Representatives in 1954, Congressman Usher L. Burdick o f N orth Dakota noted that although rati fied as a treaty, the UN Charter could not le gally be considered as such. Rep. Burdick charged: \"The first move was ma de at San Francisco, wher e many nations met, drew up a charter, and submitted that charter to the Senate for approval as a treat y. This document had none o f the earmarks of a treaty, because th e Supreme Court of the United States has held in many cases that a treaty is an agreement made between nations, to do or not to do par ticular things. In the case of the Charter of the United Nations, it was not an agre ement between nations. It was an agreement made by the agents of several governments, and there is no c ontention from any quarter that the United Nations at that time was a nation with which we could make a treat y , but intended to make it an inte g ral p ower at"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"the first opportunity. How these forces for evil planned to make the United Nations a nation is clea r now, since they propose at this time to build a world government by simply amending the Charter of the United Nations.\" ( Congressional Record , April 28, 1954) Congressman Burdick was standing on firm ground. For as Hamilton poi nted out in essay No. 75 of The F ederalist Papers regarding the power of maki ng treaties: \"Its objects are CONTRACTS with foreign nations which have the force of law, but derive it from the obligations of good fait h. They are not rules p rescribed by the sovereign to the subject, but agreements between sovereign and sovereign. \" (Emphasis added) Notes 1. Thomas Jefferson in letter to Wilson C.

Very few will deny that fact. One need not investigat e very deeply into the organized \"environmental movement,\" however, or examine the \"s cience\" on which it hangs its hat, to realize that its repeated prophesies of apocalyptic doom have far more to do with increasing and centralizing government control over mankind than with protecting man and nature from environmentally harmful p ractices. Over the past two decades, a flood of books, articles, television documen taries, and news broadcasts has given the public such a frighteni ng forecast of ecological catastrophe that far too many individuals now appear willing to give up their free dom for \"solutions\" that seem alwa ys to involve massive increases in government. It is not our purpose here to present the hard, factual evidence assembled by prominent scientific authorities to refute the many fals e claims of the environmental di saster lobby. There are already many excellent volumes that capably e xpose the fraudulent theories about ozone depletion, global warming, p ollution, pesticides, cancer risks, nuclear power, PCBs, asbestos, acid rain, deforestation, carbon dioxide, biodiversity, soil depleti on, etc.2 Rather, we hope to demons trate convincingly that concerns about the environment (some overblown, others comple tely fabricated) are being cynically exploited by influential individuals and organizations whose goal includes building a global tyranny. Central Planning Nightmare The horrifying political, economic, and social consequences wrought by totalitarian government in the former communist world have been so thoroughly exposed over the past several years that there are very few today who will openly defend the Soviet ec onomic model. Meanwhil e, mounting evidence o f unparalleled ecological destructi on in lands formerly under comm unist rule has finally begun to p ersuade even some environmentalists that too much government is as ba d for nature as it is harmful to man.3 It is now considered acceptable in \"politically correct\" circ les to talk of \"market incentives\" and \"market solutions\" to environmenta l problems. But, amazingly, many of those who use thes e terms envision a marketplace heavily or comp letely regulated and cont rolled by government. In other words, they have not really turned away from their gove rnment-is-the-only-answer mentality. Competitive Enterprise Institute pr esident Fred L. Smith was one of several who journeyed to Rio de Janeiro to bring a non-statist perspective to the Earth Summ it. At an \"Earth Summit Alternatives\" conference held during the proceedi ngs, he stated: \"Economic central planning was a utopian dream, but it became a real world nightmare. Today, the international environmen tal establishment seems eager to repeat this experiment in the ecological sphere, incr easing the power of the stat e, restricting individual and economic freedom.\" Th us, Smith warned, despit e the horrendous record of human, economic and environmental destruction left as a legacy by these centrally planned governments, \"the world is moving decisivel y toward central p lannin g for ecolo g ical rather than economic p ur p oses.\"4 But the determined"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"environmentalists in Rio were not interested in these warnings. Decades of Persistent Globalist Planning One of the noteworthy early calls for the creation of a global environmental agency appeared in an advertisement sponsored by the Wo rld Association of World Federa lists (WAWF) in the January- February 1972 issue of The Humanist , published by the American Huma nist Association. It read: World Federalists believe that the environmen tal crisis facing planet earth is a global problem and therefore calls for a \"global\" solution — a worldwide United Nations Environmental Agency with the power to make its decisions stick. WAWF has submitted a proposal for just such an ag ency to be considered at the 1972 U.N. Environmental Conference to be held in Stockholm. That first UN Environmental Conf erence, held in Stockholm, Sweden June 5-16, 1972, proved to be the launching pad for the worldwide campaign to establ ish a UN planetary environmental authority. One result of the conference was the establishment of a United Nations E nvironment Program (UNEP) intended as the overseer of a future monitoring system of the worl d’s environment. The man selected to b e the first executive director of the new agency was Maurice Str ong, a Canadian, who had served as secretary-genera l of the Stockholm event and was at the time a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation. This same Maurice Strong was named 20 years later to serve as secretary-general of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Deve lopment (UNCED), the official name of the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. A millionaire businessman with a pa ssion for socialist, one-wor ld causes, Strong is a radical environmentalist and New Age devotee (see Chapter 12). He is also a major player in such Insider circles as the Club of Rome and th e Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies. In the months leading up to the major event in Ri o, Strong grabbed headlines on several occasions with outlandish rantings against the Unit ed States and the middle class of the industrialized countries. Though a Canadian, Strong maintains his primary residence in th e United States. During on e ill-tempered fit, he declared that \"the United States is clearly the greatest risk\" to the wo rld’s ecological heal th. This was so, he said, because, \"In effect, the Un ited States is commit ting environmental aggression against the rest o f the world.\" Including himself in the indictment, he said, \"We didn’t star t doing this with any mal-intent. But we’ve lost our innocence now.\"5 In an UNCED report issued in A ugust 1991, Strong wrote: \"It is clear that current lifestyles and consumption patterns of th e affluent middle-class ... involving high meat intake , consumption of large amounts of frozen and ‘convenience’ foods, ownership of motor-, numerous electric househol d appliances, home and workplace air-conditioning ... expansive suburban housing ... are not sustainable.\"6 \"A shift is therefore necessary,\" the UNCED chief insisted, \"towards lifestyles ... less geared to ... environmentally damaging consumption patterns....\"7 Of course, when Strong talks about \"damaging consumption patterns,\" he exempt s his own globe-hopping, champagne-and -caviar lifestyle and that o f good friends like David Rockefeller, pi llar of international banking a nd the leading Insider of both the CFR and Trilateral Commission elites.

I have been privileg ed to work closely with the prin cipal author, Jim MacNeill, for ove r two decades,\" wrote the UNCED chief. \"He was one of my advisors when I was secretary general of the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment in 1972. We were both members of the World Commission on Environment and Development and, as s ecretary general, he pl ayed a fundamental role in shaping and writing its landmark report, Our Common Future [a socialist/environmentalist manifesto also known as The Brundtland Report ].\" Moreover, revealed Strong, M acNeill \"is now advising me on the road to Rio.\"8 B eyond Interdependence served as the Trilateral game plan for Rio, and it ha d Strong’s full endorsement. \"This book couldn’t appear at a better time, with the pr eparations for the Earth Summit moving into high gear,\" said Strong. To stress its importance, he said it would help guide \"decisions that will literally determine the fate of the earth.\" According to this head summiteer, the Rio gathering would \"have the political capacity to pr oduce the basic changes needed in our national and international economic agendas and in our institutions of governance....\" In his estimation, \" Beyond Interdependence p rovides the most compelling economic as well as e nvironmental case for su ch reform that I have read.\"9 MacNeill’s \"reform\" prop osals are summed up on page 128 of th e book so enthusias tically endorsed by Strong. MacNeill and his co-authors advocated \"a new global partners hip expressed in a revitalized international system in which an Earth Council, perhaps the Security Council with a broader mandate, maintains the interlocked environmental and economic security of the planet .\" \"The Earth Summit,\" wrote MacNeill and his cohor ts \"will likely be the la st chance for the world, in this century at least, to seriously address and arrest the accelerating environmental threats to economic development, national security, and human survival.\"10 The same globalist-socialist vision was presented in Global Economics and the Environment: Towar d Sustainable Rural Developm ent in the Third World , another Earth Summit guide published just prior to the UNCED confab by the Council on Foreign Rela tions.11 The common apocalyptic theme has been repeated innumerable times in environmental jere miads coming from a bevy of one-worlders ranging from David Rockefeller, Henry Kissinger, and Helmut Kohl to Francois Mitt errand, Willy Brandt, and Mikhail Gorbachev, and even to Ted Turner, Jane Fonda, and Tom Hayden. It’s not possible to study the environmental movement in any depth without repeatedly trippi ng over the recurring connection b etween the socialist/communist le ft and the corporate/banking elit e personified by David Rockefelle r and the organizati ons he has led. A diligent survey of environmentali st activity also leads one to the conclusion that all of the official p reparatory meetings and negotiati ons leading up to the Earth Summ it were really just so much spectacle for public consumption. And the Rio gather ing itself was additional \"consensus\" sideshow to p rovide an aura of planetary \"democracy\" for a progr am that was already worked out in detail by the one-worlders long ago. Consider, for example, Lester R. Brown (CFR), the supposed anti-es tablishment ecofanatic who heads the very influential Worldwatch In stitute, one of the driving forc es behind UNCED. His best-selling 1972 book, World Without Borders , proposed a \"world environmental agency\" because \"[a]rresting the deterioration of the environment does not seem possible within the existing framework of independent nation-states.\"12 His superagency w ould first \"assess the imp act of man’s various interventions in the environment.\"13 But there’s no doubt that the conclusi ons to be reached were already firmly cast in stone. Brown then stated: \"Once the necessary information and analysis is complete, tolerance levels can be established and translated into the necessar y re g ulations of human economic activit y .\"14 His books and"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"statist solutions are hyped by the CFR-dominated media and CFR academics, while the big CFR- controlled foundations shower his th ink tank with millions of dollars. \"Building an environmentally sust ainable future,\" Brown later said of the Earth Summit’s mission, \"requires nothing short of a re volution.\" This would involve \"restructuring the global economy, dramatically changing human reproductive behavior and altering values and li festyles.\"15 At least no one can accuse these guys of thinking small or hiding their ultimate goals! In State of The World 1991 , the annual doomsday report issued by the Worldwatch Institute, Brown p redicted that \"the battle to save the planet will replace the battle over ideology as the organizing theme of the new world order.\"16 And, with \"the end of the ideological conf lict that dominated a generation o f international affairs, a new world order, shaped by a new agenda, will emerge.\" The world’s agenda, he wrote, will \"be more ecological than ideological.\"17 Over and over while presuming to speak for the en tire environmental move ment, Brown indicated its intention to focus on the environmen t as the justification for establ ishing controls over mankind. \"In the new age,\" he asserted, \"diplomacy will be more concer ned with environmenta l security than with military security.\"18 Pushing the Line How prescient! How did Brown know that a few months later the New York Times would be reporting favorably in an editorial (\"Th e New World Army,\" March 6, 1992) that the UN’s \"Security Council recently expanded the concept of threats to peace to include economic , social and ecological instability\"? Of course, it’s not diff icult to seem to be prescient if you are hooked into the Insider party line. Ronald I. Spiers (CFR) was similarly prescient when he stated in the March 13, 1992 New York Times : \"The [United Nations] Trus teeship Council should be changed from a body dealing with the vestiges o f colonialism to one dealing with th e environment, becoming in effect the trustee of the health of the p lanet.\" An earlier purveyor of this line, CFR \"wise man\" George F. Kennan, th e author of our nation’s cold wa r p olicy of containment agains t communism, explained in a Washington Post column appearing on N ovember 12, 1989 that we now live \"in an age where the great en emy is not the Soviet Union but the rapid deterioration of our planet as a supporting structure for civilized life.\"19 Jessica Tuchman Mathews (CFR), vi ce president of the World Resour ces Institute, followed with an article in the July/August 1990 EPA Journal asserting that \"environmental imperatives are changing the concept of national sovereignty,\" a nd \"multipolarity [is] replacing the bipolar U. S.-U.S.S.R. axis around which nations used to array themselves.\" Moreover, sh e wrote, \"it is likely th at international problem- solving in the decades ahead will for the first time depend on collective management, not hegemony. And it is to precisely this form of governance that global environmenta l problems will yield.\" In an opinion column in the New York Times of March 27, 1990, Michael Oppenheimer (CFR) warned darkly: \"Global warm ing, ozone depletion, defore station and overpopulation ar e the four horsemen of a looming 21st century apocalypse.\" He assured readers: \"As the cold war recedes, the environment is becoming the No. 1 internat ional security concern.\" It is vitall y im p ortant to understand that the p articular environmental p roblems bein g addressed are"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"either greatly overblown or non-existent. As we st ated previously, responsible scientists in these fields are increasingly speaking out about th e excessive and fraudulen t claims of the ecoc rats. Yet, the cry fo r increased government goes on and on, emanating from one In sider \"expert\" afte r another and being shoved down the throats of the American people by the Insider-dominated media. Mikhail Gorbachev, who is the darling of new worl d order promoters, has learned the line well. Addressing the 1990 Global Forum in Moscow, he called for \"ecol ogizing\" society and said: \"The ecological crisis we are experienci ng today — from ozone depletion to deforestation and disastrous ai r p ollution — is tragic but convincin g proof that the world we all live in is interrelated and interdependent.\"20 \"This means,\" Gorbachev continued, \"that we need an appropriate international policy in the field o f ecology. Only if we formulate such a policy shall we be able to avert catastr ophe. True, the elaboration of such a policy poses unconventional and difficul t problems that will af fect the sovereignty o f states.\"21 In other words, we’ll all have to get used to the idea of a global EP A under the UN dictating p olicies about spotted owls, wetla nds, auto emissions, hair spray, ba rbecue lighter fluid, and anything else affecting \"the envi ronment.\" Which is virtua lly everybody and everything. This is a theme to which Gorbachev has frequently returned, much to the approbation of the one-world Insiders. One of his greatest fans in this regard is New York Times columnist Flora Lewis (CFR), who has praised him for goi ng \"beyond accepted notions of the limits of national sovereignty and rules o f b ehavior.\" She is thrilled by his \"plan for a globa l code of environmental conduct,\" which \"would have an aspect of world government , because it would provide for the Worl d Court to judge states.\" This, she gushed with obvious delight, \"is a breathtaking idea, beyond the curr ent dreams of ec ology militants.... And it is fitting that the environm ent be the topic for what amounts to global policing .... Even starting the effort would be a giant step for international law .\"22 (Emphasis added) Predictably, John Lawrence Hargr ove (CFR), executive director of the American Society o f International Law, was tickled pink over Gorbache v’s support for compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Just ice. \"Before Gorbachev,\" said Hargrove, \"this woul d have been regarded as astounding.\"23 To key Insider Richard N. Gardner (CFR), Gorbachev’s proposals are \"s olid nuggets of policy that offe r constructive opportunities for the West.\"24 Gardner, co-chairman of a \"Sovi et-American working group on the future of the U.N.,\" is one of those globalists wh o, apparently, have been tutoring Gorbachev, Yeltsin, and other Kremlin \"progressives\" in new world order thinking and etiquette.25 It was Gardner, you may recall, who penned the now famous article, \"T he Hard Road To World Order,\" in the April 1974 issue of Foreign Affairs . One of the boldest calls for wo rld government ever to appear in the CFR’s journal, it calle d for building the \"house of worl d order\" through \"an end run around national sovereignty, eroding it piece by piece.\" Moreover, it set out th e CFR Insider plans for exploiting fears about environmental calamity as a vehicle fo r expanding the UN’s power . In this 1974 article, Gardner wrote: The next few years should see a continued strengthening of the new global and regional agencies charged with protecting the world’s environment . In addition to comprehensive monitoring of the earth’s air, water and soil a nd of the effects of pol lutants on human health, we can look forward to new proce dures to implement the principl e of state responsibility for national actions that have tr ansnational environmental cons equences, probably including some kind of \"interna tional environmental im p act statement\"....

But to the one-worl d corporate statists who plan on running the show, it is a glorious vision of the future. Gardner was not indulging in idle speculation a nd wishful thinking here. As can be seen from currently unfolding events, he was merely reporting on actual developments that he and his fellow world order architects had initiated and were nurturing along. The Report From Iron Mountain There are many pieces of evidence to demonstrate th at the entire environmen talist \"movement\" and all of its phony \"crises\" have been cr eated, promoted, and sustained by th e Insiders for th e singular purpose of conjuring up a credibly terrifyi ng menace to replace the fear of nuc lear holocaust as the impetus fo r world government. Because of space limitations, we will focus on just one unique document and quote from it extensively. But before we do so, it is es sential that we set it up by explaining briefly the Insiders’ New Paradigm Shift. The first try at \"world or der\" came in the form of the League of Nations at the end of World War I. I f only the nations of the world woul d come together in unity and begin the process of surrendering national sovereignty to a world body, went the siren song, the scourge of war would be vanquished. This type of propaganda almost produced its desired effect, but not quite. The United States was protected from armed invasion by ocean mo ats which made armed invasion unlikely. Moreover, the spirit o f nationalism and independe nce still ran strong in Amer ican blood. A majority in the U.S. Senate decided, after all of the debate and wrangli ng, to stay out of the League of Nations. Our nation’s refusal to go along doomed the League from its start. The second try at world order followed World War II, and it culminated in th e creation of the United N ations. The arrival of the atomic bomb and long-range delivery syst ems (bombers, missiles, etc.), together with CFR dominance of the White House and growing CFR influenc e in the media and the Senate,26 provided the Insiders with the combination th ey needed to get the UN Charter ratified. But a UN with no real authority was still just half, or even less than half a lo af. Significant vestiges of national sovereignty still presente d real barriers to full- blown world government. For 40 years, the Insiders relied on fear of \"the bomb\" to keep Americ a tied to the United Nations. If we dared quit the world body, went thei r argument, there would surely be nuclear war with the communists and global annihilation. Coexistence was our best available option, at least until such time as the UN b ecame powerful enough to guar antee its version of peac e. But, even while \"the bomb\" was serving its p urpose well, long-range planning was underway to em ploy the threat of environmental cataclysm in future campaigns to build the world organization into a world government. During the summer of 1963, it appear s that Insiders in th e Kennedy Administration convened a Special Study Group of 15 men who met at a secret facility at Iron Mountai n, New York. Their mission: Come up with alternatives to war that would provide the same social and political \"stabilizing\" function.27 Two and a half years later the group produced its findings. They were not intended for public consumption. One member of the group, however, felt it should be made available for the American p eople. In 1967, therefore, it was published without id entifying any of its au thors under the title, R epor t F rom Iron Mountain on the Possibili ty and Desirability of Peace .28 It proved to be an instant sensation and generated heated public deba te. Was it an authentic report? A brilliant satire? A cruel hoax? Subse q uent events, p lus the release of other g overnment studies ( such as have been discussed in"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"p revious chapters) and the admissions by many of those at th e center of the envi ronmentalist movement concerning their true goals, argue for the report’s authenticity. In addition, professor John Kenneth Galbraith later admitted he was \"a member of the conspiracy\" (the words ar e his) that produced the book.29 The Iron Mountain group found that \"Credi bility, in fact, lies at the hear t of the problem of developing a p olitical substitute for war.\" Such a substitute \"would requi re ‘alternate enemies, ’ some of which might seem ... farfetched in the context of the current war system.\" The pa rticipants considered a number o f general social welfare programs as possible substitutes: healt h, transportation, education, housing, p overty, etc., but were not satisfied with any of them. \"It is more probable, in our judgement,\" they opined, \"that such a threat wi ll have to be invented....\"30 \"When it comes to postulating a cred ible substitute for war capable of directing human behavior patterns in behalf of social organi zation,\" said the researcher s, \"few options suggest themselves. Like its political function, the motivational function of war requires the existence of a genuinely menacing social enemy.\" The \"alternate enemy,\" they contended in the repor t, \"must imply a more immediate, tangible, and directly felt threat of de struction. It must justify the need for taking and payi ng a ‘blood price’ in wide areas of human concer n.\"31 With this in mind, th e group felt, the possible s ubstitute enemies they were considering were insufficient. According to the report, however, \"One exception mi ght be the environmental- pollution model, if the danger to society it posed was genuinely imminent. The fictive models would have to carry the weight of extraordinary conviction, undersco red with a not inconsiderable act ual sacrifice of life....\"32 These considerate experts even determined to provide for the spiritual ne eds of those they were \"helping.\" They believed that \"the construction of an up-to-date mythological or religious structure for this purpose would present difficulties in our era, but must certa inly be considered.\"33 Ecology seemed to be the best bet: It may be ... that gross pollution of the environm ent can eventually replace the possibility of mass destruction by nuclear weapons as the principal apparent th reat to the survival of the species. Poisoning of the air, and of the pr incipal sources of food and water supply, is already well advanced, and at first glance would seem promising in this respect; it constitutes a threat th at can be dealt with only through social organization and political power. But from present indications it will be a generation to a generation and a half before environmental pollution, however severe, will be sufficiently menacing, on a global scale, to offer a possible ba sis for a solution.34 With respect to the time required to create widespread fear of a phony pollution crisis, that estimate seems to have been pretty accurate . The schemers even suggested \"t hat the rate of pollution could be increased selectively for this purpose; in fact, the mere modifying of existing programs for the deterrence of pollution could speed up the process enough to make the threat credible much sooner. But the pollution problem has been so widely publicized in recent years that it seems highly improbable that a program of deliberate environm ental poisoning could be implemen ted in a politically acceptable manner.\"35 \"Economic surrogates for war,\" said the group’s report, \"must meet two principal criteria. They must be ‘wasteful,’ in the common sense of the word, and they must operate outside the normal supply-deman d system. A corollary that should be ob vious is that the magnit ude of the waste must be sufficient to meet the needs of a particular society. An economy as advanced and co mplex as our own requires the planned average annual destruction of not less than 10 percent of gross national product if it is effectively to fulfill its stabilizin g function.\"36"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"With this diabolical thought in mind, the seemingly insane EPA mand ates requiring the expenditure o f billions of dollars on minuscule or non-existent cancer risks, the sacr ificing of thousan ds of jobs an d b usinesses for a variety of \"enda ngered species,\" and all of the other seemingly crazy governmental p olicies begin to make sense. Pressure From Above and Below Much more also begins to make sense. Like th e long-standing symbiotic relationship between the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Fo rd Foundation, Council on Foreign Relations, Exxon, IBM, Procter & Gamble, et al. on one hand, and Friends of the Ea rth, Nature Conservancy, Planned Parenthood, Sierra Club, Greenpeace, Environmental Defe nse Fund, et al. on the other. Pr essure from a bove and pressure from below: the American peopl e caught in a pi ncer attack. At the Rio summit, this strategy wa s clearly discerni ble as the ecofanatics and the corporate collectivists linked arms and called on the United Nations to take charge of pr otecting the world’s atmosphere, forests, oceans, fresh water, coasta l areas, mountainous areas — virtually the entire planet. But that’s not all. The new world order globalists want much more than just posse ssion and control of the material environment. They want possession of your mind and soul as well. Echoing the dire warnings of eco-destruction with which we’ve become fa miliar, the UNCED booklet I n Our Hands: Earth Summit ’92 asserted in its closing paragra ph: \"The world community now faces together greater risks to our common security through our impacts on the environment than from traditional military conflict s with one another.\" Then, with a paga n hubris that would do credit to the Iron Mountain gang, it proclaimed: \"We must now fo rge a new ‘Earth Ethic’ which will inspire all p eoples and nations to join in a new global partnership of North, South, East and West.\"37 Fallout From Rio The full meaning and significance of the Rio summit, hailed as hi story’s largest gathering of worl d leaders, will not become known for months, or even y ears. No one has yet had a chance to read, let alone digest, all of the fine print in the voluminous agreements and docum ents hammered out during its two fractious weeks of negotiations. One thing is certain: What was produced at Rio will be the source o f much future argument, negotiation, lobbying, and legislation. As Maur ice Strong, secr etary-general o f the conference, put it, \"This is a launching pad, not a quick fix.\"38 The leaders of the huge environmental lobbying network in Wa shington, DC fully realize this and are gearing up for sustained warfare over the many issues addressed at the summit. The summit, unfortunately, did produce some \"accomp lishments.\" We list so me (both official and unofficial) that will be around to haunt, harass, and increasingly trouble us in the years ahead: z Agenda 21 , the 800-page blueprint fo r governmental action addressi ng everything from forests to deserts, oceans, rivers, women’s rights, and health care, has set in motion a continuously evolving process of environmental policy formation.39 z A commitment was made to establish a new Co mmission on Sustainable Development to monito r national compliance with the environmenta l targets agreed upon at the summit.40 z This new commission will also review the de velopment assistance contributions from the industrial countries to make sure they provide sufficie nt funds to implement the Agenda 21 p olicies.41"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"z A new International Green Cross organization wa s formed to provide worldwide \"emergency\" environmental assistance. Mikhail Go rbachev was named to lead it.42 z President Bush called for an international conference on global warm ing by January 1, 1993 at which nations are to report on specific plans to reduce greenhouse gases.43 z President Bush pledged to double U.S. aid to inte rnational efforts aimed at the \"protection\" o f forests.44 z The neo-pagan cult of na ture worship, long prevalent in envi ronmental and New Age circles, was formally launched as the new world religion (see Chapter 12). z Environmentalism was elevated to new heights within the real m of international statecraft. New Green World Order One of the major organizational pl ayers (both out front and behind the scenes) at Rio and in the p reparations leading up to th e summit was the Washington- b ased Worldwatch Ins titute. An interview with Lester Brown (CFR), founde r and president of Worldwatch, a ppeared in the June 3rd issue o f Terraviva , a special daily newspaper dist ributed to participants during the Earth Summit. In it, Brown p redicted that \"ecological sustaina bility will become the new organi sing principle, the foundation of the ‘new world order, ’ if you will.\"45 Brown actually admitted that th e new world order he s ought meant giving up nati onal sovereignty. Here is how he put it: One hears from time to time from conservative columnists and ot hers that we, as the United States, don’t want to sign these treaties that would sacr ifice our national sovereignty. But what they seem to overlook is that we’ve al ready lost a great deal of our sovereignty. We can no longer protect the st ratospheric ozone layer over th e United Stat es. We can’t stabilise the U.S. climate w ithout the cooperation of countri es throughout the world. If even one major developing country continues to use CFCs (chl orofluorocarbons), it will eventually deplete the oz one layer. We can’t protect the bi ological diversity of the planet by ourselves. We’ve lost soverei gnty; we’ve lost control.46 What it really gets down to, said Brown, is that \"we can no longer separate the future habitability of the p lanet from the distribution of wealth.\"47 No surprise there. With socialists like Brown advocating the extremes of social engineer ing, redistribution of the wealth is what it always gets dow n to — ultimately. \"But,\" suggested the Terraviva interviewer, \"the current climate he re in the U.S. seems very hostile to foreign aid.\" Acknowledging the dile mma, Brown responded: \"It might take a few more scares to get this country energised.\"48 No doubt the eco-saviors have \"a fe w more scares\" up their sleeves to \"energize\" those of us non-be lievers who value our freedom. The influential Worldwatch Institute study, After the Earth Summit: Th e Future of Environmenta l Governance by Hilary F. French, has this to say on the subject: National sovereignty — the power of a country to control events within its territory — has lost much of its meanin g in toda y ’s world, where borders are routinel y breached b y"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"pollution, international trade, fi nancial flows and ref ugees.... Because all of these forces can affect environmental trends, in ternational treaties and instit utions are proving ever more critical to addressing ecological threats. Na tions are in effect ced ing portions of their sovereignty to the international communit y, and beginning to create a new system of international environmental g overnance as a means of so lving otherwise-unmanageable problems.49 What French then stated has a ve ry strong bearing on what addition al mischief may result from the summit: [T]he past twenty years’ expe rience has yielded some instruct ive lessons in environmental negotiations — which the worl d community can now apply to the far larger challenges looming on the horizon. Paradoxically, one way to make environmental agreements more effective is in some cases to make them less enforceable — and theref ore more palatable to the negotiators who may initially feel threatened by any lo ss of sovereignty. So-called ‘soft law’ — declarations, resolutions, and action plans that nations do not need to formally ratify and are not lega lly binding — can help to create an interna tional consensus, mobilize aid, and lay the groundwork for the negotia tion of binding treaties later .50 [Emphasis added] \" Agenda 21 ,\" said French, \"an action plan on nearly all aspects of sust ainable development expected to emerge from UNCED, would fall in to this category [of so-called ‘soft law’].\"51 She continued he r explanation of how the environm ental treaty process will work: When a binding treaty is necessary, the \"convent ion-protocol\" approac h, which was used in both the transboundary air pollution and the oz one talks, is now the dominant model. Under this approach, a \"framework\" treaty is agreed to first that genera lly does not involve any binding commitment, but represents a political commitment to take action at a later date. It also strengthens the joint research and monitoring programs need ed to build enough scientific consensus and knowle dge to convince countries to eventually commit to specific targets. The framework treaty is then followed by specific protocols on various aspects of the problem.52 Operators like French are not mo aning because they didn’t get ev erything they wanted in the Rio agreements and treaties. They got their feet in the door, and that’s what matters most. New York Times writer William K. Stevens r ecognized this important lesson as well. In the June 14, 1992 Times , he noted that \"blandness can sometimes prove a surprisingly effective bludgeon. The parcel of treaties signed here have been portrayed by disappointed advocates as pitiful gutless creatures with no bite. But they have hidden teeth that will develop in the right ci rcumstances.\" That is why Richard E. Benedick, the former State Department official who helped negotiate the ozone layer treaty, has observed that the Earth Summit \"should not be judged by the immediate results, but by the process it sets in motion.\"53 And the Rio Summit ha s set a great many processes in mo tion. In her aforementioned work, After the E arth Summit , Hilary French noted: \"Event s in Rio also may lay the gr oundwork for a more ambitious reform of the United Nations pr oposed for 1995. An independent gr oup of current and past world leaders including Willy Brandt, Jimm y Carter, V‡clav Havel, Julius Nyerere, and Eduard Shevardhas recommended that a World Summit on Global Governance be held that year — th e fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations.\"54 Pretext for Control"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Every call to action, every solution of fered by the green globalists, always leads to a loss of freedom and more power in government. The final goal is always centralization of th at power in the United Nations. For those truly concerned with pr otecting the environment, that is exactly the wrong direction to be heading. As Dr. Fred Smith has explained and documented with many studies: \"Wherever resources have been privatel y protected, they have done better than their politically managed counterparts — whether we are speaking of elephants in Africa, sa lmon streams in England, or the beaver in Canada. Where such rights have been absent or suppressed, or not creatively extended, th e results have been less fortunate.\"55 The world should not be speeding toward a centrally-p lanned environment. That is precisely what has b een proven so ecologically destru ctive throughout the world. Rather, we should be \"extending property rights to the full array of ecological resources that ha ve been left out in the co ld\"56 and rolling back the socialist controls that are prev enting people from finding solutions through voluntary arrangements and freedom of choice in the open marketplace. It is becoming ever more obvious that the plans of the planet gua rdians and green globalists we have described have virtually nothing to do with saving endangered species , protecting the ozone layer, o r whatever else they are using as cover for their real goal. Instead, their plans have everything to do with forging the chains for a UN-dominated world dictatorship. Notes 1.

Bl iley (R-VA), Se ptember 17, 1990 The United Nations World Summit for Children, he ld in New York during September 1990, was widely heralded as \"the largest gathering ever of world l eaders.\" President Bush, in the midst of his Persian Gulf military buildup, left Washingt on to join more than 70 other he ads of state at the UN for the historic event. The poignant photographs and news clippings of presiden ts and prime ministers embracing adorable tykes while calling on the world to \"save the children\" contrasted sharply with the grim forecasts of war and gave a so fter edge to the President’s almo st daily calls for a new world orde r and a strengthened United Nations. According to UN organize rs, more than a million persons worldwid e participated in candlelight vigils that week.2 In New York, politi cians and entertainment celebriti es jostled with one another fo r television and photo opportunities at the city’s numerous summit programs. Over and over again, summit participants and media pundits parroted the lita ny of statistics compiled by the officials of the Children’s Defense Fund and other self-proclaimed guardians of the world’s children. Beneath all o f these emotional appeals lay an agenda full of ev er-larger and ever-more-co stly socialist programs. Time magazine and its collect ivist chorus of media allies cheer ed the summit’s support for what was termed \"a bold 10-year plan to reduce mortality rates and poverty am ong children and to improve access to immunizations and education.\"3 Noble Sounding Rhetoric But the real summit send-off wa s saved for the United Nations C onvention on the Rights of the Child. The UN has hailed this treaty as \"a landmark in international efforts to strengthen justice, peace, and freedom in the world,\" a nd \"the most complete statement of children’s rights ever made.\"4 UNICEF Director James Grant called the tr eaty \"the Magna Carta fo r children, an instrument of far-reaching significance for the needs of those w ho are humanity’s most vulnerable.\"5 Who could find fault with such lo fty aspirations? Almost no one, it seems. The Convention won world support like no previous tr eaty. According to the UN’s Fact Sheet No. 10, The Rights of the Child : The Convention on the Rights of the Child wa s adopted — unanimous ly — by the United Nations General Assembly on 20 November, 1989.... After its adoption by the General Assemb ly, the Convention was opened for signature on 26 January 1990. Sixty-one countries signed the document on that day — a record first-day response.... The Convention entered into force on 2 Sept ember 1990 — one month after the twentieth State ratified it.... A little ove r seven months separated the opening for signature and the entry into force of the Conventi on; this is a very short period for an international treaty — generally it takes much longer — and it shows the world-wide interest and support for the child Convention. [Em p hasis in ori g inal]"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"A Lone Voice in Congress More truthfully, it shows the ef fectiveness of the worldwide prop aganda campaign orchestrated by internationalists who are wi lling to exploit a natural concern for the plight of children to advance thei r agenda for a new world order. In the days befo re the summit, both Houses of the U.S. Congress hurriedly passed resolutions urging President Bush to sign the conven tion and send it to the Senate fo r ratification before attending the su mmit. Opposition to the Conventio n was virtually nonexistent. Only Representative Thomas J. Bliley (R-VA) rose to urge caution and restraint.6 Bliley did not merely nitpick a bout commas and whereases. His re ading of the document left him convinced that \"the convention represents a potential threat to our form of government.\"7 Was he reading the same document his colleagues were given? More than likely, he was the only member of Congress who act ually did read what the Convention says. During his remarks in the House on September 17, 1990, Bliley asked, \"Will the Convention really solv e the problems our children face? Is it merely an article of good in tentions to make us feel good about ourselves? Or, is it actually a p otential threat to some of our most precious free doms, civil liberties, and our form of government?\"8 The congressman from Virginia re minded his colleagues that no heari ngs had been held on the treaty they were asking the President to si gn. \"I submit,\" said Bliley, \"that th is House has not taken the time to reflect upon the implications of th e Convention and will be in for a tremendous shock when judges around the country start applying the Convent ion as the supreme law of the land.\"9 Bliley continued: \"H ave we determined the impa ct that this Convention wi ll have on our system o f federalism? No. Have we resolved in our minds its inherent conflicts with the U.S. Constitution? I thin k not. Do we realize the gr eat new powers Congress is taking away fr om the sovereign States, as well as giving up itself, to the judiciary?\"10 Dangerous Document The Convention is a lengthy, comp lex document comprised of 54 ar ticles dealing with adoption, education, child labor, child pornogr aphy, child abuse, prenatal and postnatal health care for women, family reunification, and many other issues. Although it is replete with rhetor ic about \"rights\" and \"freedom\" and noble-s ounding appeals for the protec tion of children, from th e standpoint of American constitutional law it is fundam entally flawed. Like the UN Charter and many UN conventions addressing \"rights,\" this Conventi on on the Rights of the Child is ba sed on the philosophy that rights are granted by governments, and it is, th erefore, completely at odds with the Declar ation of Independence, and the Constitution a nd its Bill of Rights. In an op-ed piece appearing in the Washington Times , Bliley’s solitary voice again warned of the dangers presented by the Convention: As written, it places government in a superior position to its citizens by granting these rights to children. What is so bad about that? Such an interpre tation is antithetical to our limitations on government. Most of these \"rights\" are not presently found in our Constitution, but rather, are c onsidered to be among our inal ienable rights endowed by our Creator.11 It can’t be repeated too often that , in the Declaration of Independenc e, our Founding Fath ers asserted the revolutionar y and \"self-evident\" truth that \"men ... are endowed b y their Creator with certain unalienable"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Rights.\" The Founders went on to a ssert, \"to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men.\" Note the logical sequence: 1) God exists; 2) God creates man and endows him with rights; and 3) Man creates government to protect t hose rights. The individual precedes and is superior to government. Our Constitution is not a body of la w to govern the people; it was fo rmulated to govern the government, to make government the servant a nd not the master of the people. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child springs from a tota lly different philosophical foundation. Like the UN Charter a nd the Soviet Constitution, it vi ews rights not as God-given and unalienable, but as government-given and conditional. This view of the origin of rights is completely incompatible with liberty. For, if one accepts the premise that rights come from government, then one must accept the corollary that govern ment is entitled to circumscribe, withhold, or even cancel those rights. This concept of rights was stated by Andrei Vishin sky, Stalin’s chief pros ecutor and chairman o f the Soviet Supreme Court, during debate on the Un iversal Declaration of Human Rights on Decembe r 10, 1948 at the United Nations. Said Vishinsky: \"The rights of hum an beings cannot be considered outside the prerogatives of governme nts, and the very understanding of human rights is a governmental concept.\"12 A typical example of this philos ophy can be found in Article 14, Se ction 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child: \"State s Parties shall respect the right of th e child to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.\" Section 3 then proceeds to neuter that right with a Soviet-sty le clause: \"Freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs may be subject only to such limitations as ar e prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safe ty, order, health or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms o f others.\" Similar words are used re peatedly in the Convention to lega lly wipe out all guarantees for the \"rights\" that are set forth in the document. Article 10 says: \"The right to leav e any country shall be subject only to such restrictions as are p rescribed by law....\" This is the ki nd of pliable legalese beloved by al l tyrants. And it stands in star k contrast to the absolute, unconditional nature of our Bill of Rights. At Odds With Constitution The U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights are directed primarily at limiting th e power and scope of the federal government and secondarily at providing the legal standing for th e people and the states to assert themselves against any encroach ments by the federal gove rnment. The First Ame ndment, for example, states: \"Congress shall make no la w....\" The Convention on the Rights of the Child, on the other hand, supplies opportunity and authority for the United Nations — or th e U.S. government acting under the UN Convention — to enforce its pr ovisions against state and local governments, and even against p arents. Article 13 of the Convention mandate s that the child \"shall have th e right to freedo m of expression,\" including \"freedom to seek, recei ve and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless o f frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of the child’s choice.\" Could this be construed to mean that parents who do not allow th eir child to \"express\" himself by wearing Satanic symbols or obscene T-shirts are violating the child’ s rights? Do children have the \"right\" to speak to their parents in any manner they c hoose? Could school author ities who impose dress codes or who prohibit the printing of obscene, ra cist, or other objectionable material in a school newspaper be prosecuted under the C onvention? Would state laws and lo cal ordinances restricting the access of minors to p orno g ra p h y and \"mature\" literature be struck down?"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Could Article 16’s pr ovisions for the child’s right to privacy be used to secu re abortions for youngsters without parental knowledge or consen t, or to prohibit parents from se arching a child’s room for drugs o r other dangerous or illegal items? What about Article 31’s guarant ee of the child’s right to \"rest an d leisure,\" \"recreational activities,\" a nd \"cultural life and the arts\"? W ould parents who ma ke little Ricky do chores or practice the piano when he says he wants to play baseba ll be liable for prosecution? Might they be hauled before a judge or have their child removed from thei r custody because they didn’t allow him to attend a \"heavy metal\" rock concert? Blank Check fo r Judiciary Are these unfounded, paranoid fears? Hardly. Anyone in the least familiar with similar litigation and court decisions of the past few years knows that cases like these are certain to arise. And then? \"Hundreds of judges will be left to interpret the convention as th ey please,\" warns Re presentative Bliley, \"and will possess all power to supe rsede state laws....\"13 Under the curr ently-prevailing jurisprudence, Article VI of the Constitution is badly misconstrue d to hold that all treaties — regardless of thei r constitutionality — are the \"supr eme law of the land\" (see Chapte r 6). And there are plenty o f revolutionaries in our st ate and federal judiciaries who would le ap at the opportunity to use this UN Convention to launch judicial assaul ts against state and federal laws, state constitutions, and even the U.S. Constitution itself. From the floor of the House of Repr esentatives, Bliley asked his coll eagues: \"Who can explain to me the meaning of Article 24, Sect ion 3 which provides that ‘States pa rties shall take all effective and appropriate measures with a view to abolishing traditional practic es prejudicial to the health o f children.’\"14 \"Here,\" noted Mr. Bliley, \"is a new standard for us to ponder: So mething need not be hazardous or even p ose a risk — it need be only pr ejudicial to be abolished by gove rnment. Who will define what is p rejudicial as this Conve ntion takes effect?\"15 Who indeed, but the very stat e and federal judges who have already run roughshod over the Constitution. These same judges will define what the Convention mean s by \"health\" and by \"traditional p ractices.\" Does \"health\" en compass physical, mental, emot ional, and spiritual well- b eing, as some argue? If so, what about the situation of the conf used teenager who has been convinced by the pro- homosexual \"Project 10\" program at school that he is \"gay\"? If his parents try to convince him otherwise, or take him to their pastor or a psychologist for counse ling, are they engaging in illegal \"traditional practices\" prejudicial to his emotional health? Could re quiring a child to participate in traditional practices, like family pray er and devotions, or to attend chur ch services also be prejudicial? Without doubt, there are many lawy ers who would so argue, and many judges who would so rule. A Socialist Manifesto There are many other pitfalls to be found in the Convention. The treaty recognizes a \"right of the child to education\" (Article 28), and in true Marxist fashion requires every na tion that is a contracting party to \"make primary education com pulsory and available to all.\" Private education is not explicitly outlawed, b ut private schools, like government schools, must teach \"the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations\" and must \"conform to such mi nimum standards as may be laid down by the State.\" (Article 29) Several other articles of this UN Convention would impose ne w, open-ended obligations on national and/or state g overnments. In addition to \"free\" education, the state would also be re q uired to p rovide"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"free child care, health care services , social security, family planning se rvices, prenatal and postnatal care for mothers, and nutrition and housing \"to the maximum ex tent of their available resources.\" (Article 4) This amounts to a whole new social ist manifesto for America. Not onl y would it provide politicians and j udges unprecedented opportunity to reach into the taxpayers’ pockets for all \"available resources,\" but the Convention would fundamentally alter the function of government fr om a protector of rights to a p rovider of services. This would ma ke government a violator of rights, since gove rnment has no wealth of its own and must first take fr om one segment of society (violati ng its rights) to provide for anothe r segment. And gov’s ability and propens ity to violate rights and to cont rol the people it cares for always increase as more and more people become de pendent upon government for goods and services. Look Who Has Signed One hundred thirty-four countries ha ve signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and 85 have ratified it. Although President Bu sh has voiced his support of the C onvention, the United States has not yet signed or ratified the treaty — a situation that \"l iberals,\" internationalists, and Establishment Insiders find intolerable. After all, the ar gument goes, as the world’s leadi ng exemplar of freedom, our nation must show itself to be at least as \"progressive\" regarding children’s rights as Convention signatories China, Zambia, Afghanistan, Albania, Yemen, Cuba, Bulgaria, and Algeria. If we ratify this treat y, we will join the stella r company of ratifiers like the former USSR, Angola, Mongolia, Romania, Nepal, Uga nda, Vietnam, Laos, Zaire, Zimb abwe, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Lebanon, Yugoslavia, and North Korea. Many of these signato ry nations outdo one anot her as the worst child abusers in the history of mankind. Even as their he ads of state signed the pa rchment, their troops and p olice forces were murdering, oppr essing, and otherwise violating the rights of millions of children in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. In an attempt to win pro-life support, the Convention’s preamble fe igns support for \"appropriate legal p rotection, before as well as afte r birth.\" But the preamble is not legally binding, and every effort to include specific language in the treaty protecting th e unborn has been rebuffed. This should surprise no one, since the UN, through its Popul ation Fund, World Health Organi zation, and other agencies and p rograms, is one of the worl d ’s greatest promoters of abortion (see Chapter 9). \"A great many people,\" observes Bl iley, \"would probably be willing to sacrifice major portions of ou r Constitution if the ratification of this document could instantly end poverty and drug abuse, guarantee that not another child would be physically or sexually abused and shut down the pornography industry that has infected the cell of our society, the family. But it will no t, and we will have exchanged ou r history as the oldest constitutiona l government for a new bureaucracy.\"16 Bliley concludes: \"It fina lly becomes clear. Ratificati on is not about children; it is about power.\"17 Like the many other UN treaties (addressi ng the environment, women’s rights, animal rights, minority rights, drug trafficking, etc.), the Convention on the Right s of the Child is about power — the power to undermine and destroy our Constitution, our nati onal sovereignty, and our God-given rights.

In the 1970’s the world will undergo famines — hundreds of millions of people are going to star ve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now. 1 — Paul Ehrlich, The Population Bomb (1968) Central to the issues we are going to have to deal with are: ... the explosive increase in population.... We have been the most successful species ever; we are now a species out of control. 2 — Maurice F. Strong, UNCED Secretary-General Since its inception, the U.N. has advanced a wo rld-wide of population control, scientific human breeding, and Darwinism. 3 — Claire Chambers, The SIECUS Circle: A Humanist Revolution The United Nations Fund for Population Activities and the In ternational Planned Parenthood Federation have the blood of milli ons of innocent babies worldwide on their hands. 4 — Rev. Paul Marx, Founder, Human Life International One of the greatest hoaxe s of the 20th century, now accepted without question by much of the world’s \"educated\" populace, is the fraudulent contention that the earth is terribly overpopulated with humans. So serious is the \"overpopulation cr isis,\" according to prevailing wis dom, that it threatens not only to outstrip food production and all other basic resources, but also to render our planet uninhabitable fo r humans and other animal species because of pol lution. Overpopulation is a crucial tenet underlying much of the collectivist One-World ag enda. According to its theorists, this global \"crisis,\" justifies the most far-reaching government contro ls imaginable: controls over th e economy, the environment, and, o f course, over the most private and inti mate of areas, our reproductive lives. The high oracle of the doctrine of overpopulation for more than two decades — and a leading advocate of totalitarian \"remedy\" for this supposed affliction — has been Paul Ehrlich. Since its publishing debut in 1968, more than 20 million copies of his book The Population Bomb have been sold, making it one o f the best-selling books of all time. It remains on hi gh school and college required reading lists, along with Professor Ehrlich’s newest diatribe, The Population Explosion ,5 a 1990 update of his famous doomsday message of 1968. In th e earlier work he warned: Our position requires that we ta ke immediate action at home and promot e effective action worldwide. We must have population contro l at home, hopefully through a system of incentives and penalties, but by compulsion if voluntary methods fail .... We can no longer afford merely to treat the symptoms of the cancer of population gr owth; the cancer itself must be cut out. 6 [Emphasis added] Although his radically pessimistic predictions of dying oceans and imminent global catastrophes were refuted at the time by many men of science (and the passing years have seen the refutations increase in number ) ,7 the biolo g ist from Stanford Universit y rocketed to stardom as a leadin g s p okesman of the"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"environment/population c ontrol movement. In The Population Bomb , Ehrlich praised abortion as \"a highly effective weapon in the armory of population control,\" and suggested that \"compulsory birth regulation\" through the gove rnment-mandated addition of \"temporar y sterilants to water supplies or staple food\" may become necessary.8 A few months earlier, in the Winter 1968 issue of Stanford Today , he was even more explicit. \"It must b e made clear to our population,\" he sa id, \"that it is socially irresponsible to have large families.\" Then, completely disregarding parental rights, norms of mo rality, and the fact that our constitutional system grants the federal government absolu tely no authority to meddle in such affairs, he called for \"federal laws making instruction in birth-control methods mandatory in all public schools.\"9 Increasing the intensity of his totalitarian demands, he stated, \"If these steps fail to reverse today’s p opulation growth, we shall then b e faced with some form of comp ulsory birth regulation. We might institute a system whereby a temporary sterilant would be added to a staple food or to the water supply . An antidote would have to be taken to permit reproduction.\" 10 (Emphasis added) Sound a bit authoritarian? Well, according to this an ti-population crusader, we’r e facing a deadly serious situation, and the \"operation will require many brutal and tou gh-minded decisions.\"11 Ehrlich’s critical acclaim in th e major media and his phenomenal book sales ushered in a doom boom that has fed, and in turn has been fed by, an ever-expanding prolifera tion of population control p rograms. They are funded by tax dollars funneled through national government agencies, the United N ations, and an international network of private anti-natalist organizations. Of the many ecological j eremiads following in the wake of The Population Bomb , two of the most influential were The Limits to Growth (1972),12 a report produced for the Club of Rome, and the Global 2000 Report to the Presiden t of the United States (1980),13 a federal government publication that gives le gitimacy to the thoughts o f a large assemblage of professional wailers fr om environmental/populat ion control circles. The Limits to Growth has sold over 10 million copies and ha s been translated into more than 30 languages. The prodigious Global 2000 , whose physical size resemble s a New York City telephone b ook, sold over one million copies. Both achieved an aura of im portance with their reliance on sophisticated computer modeling to analyze massive banks of data, factor in va rious assumptions and variables, and then predict the future. Like Ehrlich, these publications predicted a dism al future for both mankind and nature unless governments intervened on a massive scale. As the Club of Rome’s researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reported in The Limits to Growth : \"Entirely new approaches are required to redirect society toward goals of equilibrium rather than growth.\" And, \"joint long-term planning will be necessary on a scale and scope without precedent.\" Th e ultimate goal of this \"supreme effort\" would be \"to organize more equitabl e distribution of wealth and income worldwide.\"14 Karl Marx could not have p hrased it better. And, of course, the social engin eers with their mighty comput ers would show the way. N ot everyone, however, was favorably impressed by their efforts or their results. Scientists and scholars from many disciplines, representi ng a broad cross-secti on of political thought, thoroughly discredited these studies with facts, logic, and sound analysis . Even socialist Gunnar My rdal, certainly no opponent of heavy-handed government, remain ed unconvinced that the celebrat ed MIT researchers had made a worthwhile contribution to our knowle dge of the world, how it works, or what to expect in the future. The Nobel Prize-winning economist said of the Club of Rome’s vaunted \"science\": [T]he use of mathematical e q uations and a hu g e com p uter, which re g isters the alternatives"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"of abstractly conceived polic ies by a \"world simulation mode l,\" may impress the innocent general public but has litt le, if any, scientific validity.

In its letter of tran smittal to the President of the United States, its staff reported, as expected, that the world’s future was indeed bleak: Environmental, resource, and population stress es are intensifying and will increasingly determine the quality of human life on our pl anet. These stresses are already severe enough to deny many millions of people basic needs for food, shelter, health, and jobs, or any hope for betterment. At the same time, the earth’s carrying capacity ... is eroding.17 But a different group of eminent sc ientists and academics, surveyi ng precisely the same horizons, came away with a completely opposite picture of what the future holds. In The Resourceful Earth: A Response to Global 2000 , these experts predicted: Environmental, resource, and population stresse s are diminishing, and with the passage of time will have less influence than now upon the quality of human life on our planet. These stresses have in the past always caused many people to suffer from l ack of food, shelter, health, and jobs, but the trend is toward less rather than more of such suffering. Especially important and noteworthy is th e dramatic trend toward longer and healthier life throughout all the world. Because of increases in knowledge , the earth’s \"carrying capacity\" has been increasing throughout the decades and centuries and millennia to such an extent that the term \"carrying capacity\" ha s by now no useful meaning.18 The authors of The Resourceful Earth marshaled an avalanche of scientif ic evidence to substantiate thei r optimistic projections and to refu te the dire prophesies of the Global 2000 alarmists. Their authoritative refutations received scant media attention, however, and were not successful in offsetting the harmful influence of the doomsday reports or in stanchi ng the seemingly endless su ccession of imitators. What The Resourceful Earth scientists and many other scholars have conclusively demonstrated is that the scientific credibility of overpopulation alarmists is about as reliable as that of Chicken Little. There is no evidence that the earth, or any region of it, is overpopulated. China and I ndia, two countries most often cited as cases of extrem e population density, in reality ha ve population densities similar to Pennsylvania and the United Kingdom, respectively.19 These and other so cialist nations suffer not from overpopulation, but ove rregulation: not too many people, but too many bureaucrats and too much government stifling productivity and progress. We do not have the space here to attempt to dispel the overpopulation my ths that have been so assiduously promoted over the past tw o decades. For those with an inte rest in exploring this important issue, however, there are a number of ex cellent works that deserve attention: The Myth o f Overpopulation by Rousas J. Rushdoony; Grow or Die by James A. Weber; The War Agains t P opulation by Jacqueline Kasun; The Ultimate Resource by Julian Simon; Population Growth: The A dvantages by Colin Clark; Handbook on Population by Robert Sassone; and The Birth Dearth by Ben Wattenber g ."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"The globalists at the Club of Ro me, Council on Foreign Relations, Zero Population Growth, Planned Parenthood, and the United Nations c ontinue to hold to and support th eir doom-and-gloom worldview in the face of overwhelmingl y contrary evidence. Doing so supplies the excuse for their continuing p roposals for global \"crisi s management.\" Thus we have reports like Changing Our Ways (1992) from the Carnegie Endowment’s Nati onal Commission on Amer ica and the New Worl d, claiming population growth \"threatens international stab ility,\" and \"universal ac cess to family planning se rvices ... is the least costly and ... the most pragmatic means to address the issue.\"20 Th e Carnegie Commission charged that \"American leadership has been abse nt on the population crisis for too long,\" even though it admits in the next breath \"the United States remains the largest donor (in 1990, $280 million).\"21 \"Since the 1980s,\" continued the report of this prestigious panel of Es tablishment Inside rs, \"the United States has abandoned the two major in ternational organizations devoted to population control efforts: the International Planned Parenthood Fe deration ... and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).\"22 The Carnegie collectivists were re ferring to the congressional cutoff of funding for these organizations, b eginning in 1985, because of the support they were providing for coercive abortion policies and p rograms in China. But the cutoff of American-suppli ed funds for one UN agency did not kill the UN’s efforts to force population control. The UN Supplies the Funds The barbarity of China’s one-child policy was so repugnant that, as reports came out, even many liberals were repelled. In her book entitled The War Against Population , conservative Professor Jacqueline Kasun supplied a stunning summary of the shocking brutality directed agai nst pregnant women by China’s communist officials: Christopher Wren reported in the New York Times that thousands of Chinese women were being \"rounded up and forced to have abortions.\" He described women \"locked in detention cells or hauled before mass ra llies and harangued into consenti ng to abortions.\" He told of \"vigilantes [who] abducted pre gnant women on the streets and hauled them off, sometimes handcuffed or trussed, to abortion clinics,\" a nd of \"aborted babies which were ... crying when they were born.\" Michele Vink wrote in the Wall Street Journal of women who were \"handcuffed, tied with ropes or pl aced in pig’s baskets\" for their forced trips to the abortion clinics. According to Steven Mosher, the People’s Republic Press was openly speaking of the \"butchering, drowning, and leaving to die of female infants and the maltreating of women who have given birth to girls.\"23 China scholar Steven Mosher, who personally witne ssed the harshness of these policies in the rural Chinese village where he lived and worked on his doctoral studies during 1979-80, noted that U.S. \"tax dollars were providing about 25 percent of the annua l budget for the United Na tions Fund for Population Activities. Monies from UNFPA ’s budget (which ran $136 million in 1985) have aided China’s p opulation control program.\"24 Long after China’s atrocious policie s were brought to light, UNFPA was still supporting the totalitarian measures. In July 1987, for example, the New China News Agency in Beijing reported the praise an UNFPA official had showered on the regime. \"China is actively work ing to set up a model of how social and economic factors can be harnessed in a harmoni ous way,\" he said. \"The government has shown its full commitment to a fa mily planning program that has been internationally acknowledged as one of the most successful efforts in the world today .\"25 (Emphasis added) The Council on Forei g n Relations chose to swallow the line p ut out b y Chinese communist officials and"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"UN bureaucrats rather than believe the independently corroborated stor ies of both Chinese and Western observers. In his article entitled \"The Case for Practical Interna tionalism\" in the Spring 1988 issue o f F oreign Affairs , top CFR strategist Ri chard N. Gardner reiterated earlier calls for programs to meet the \"population challenge\" and asserted: A major challenge to the next pr esident will be to restore U. S. support for the U.N. Fund for Population Activities, which we have cut off over charges that China’s population program uses coercive abortion, someth ing both China and UNFPA deny. The U.S. Agency for International Development (A ID) denied any direct role in supplying funds fo r China’s population program.26 Accordi ng to Jacqueline Kasun, AID may not have done so directly, but \"it was a major contributor to the Internationa l Planned Parenthood Federa tion and the UN Fund fo r Population Activities, both of which supplied funds to the Chinese program. China and the United States also exchanged researchers to study population policy.\"27 But, if the UNFPA received U.S. funds indirectly through other U.S.-funded orga nizations, isn’t it still accurate to state that the citizens of this nation are helping to fund the population control activities of the UN? Also, the denial by Chinese and UNFPA officials that coercive abor tion is being practiced in China is a bald-faced lie. AID officials could hardly back up their disavowal; AID records plainly show the agency’s funding o f IPPF and UNFPA, both of which have been open advocates of coercive population measures. Fo r example, the outspoken president of Planned Parenthood, Alan Guttmach er, who was also a top official of IPPF, bluntly stated in 1969: \"Each country will ha ve to decide its own form of coercion, determining when and how it should be employed.... The means pres ently available are compul sory sterilization and compulsory abortion.\"28 The taxpayer-funded IPPF, says Fr. Pa ul Marx, the founder of Human Life International, \"is the world’s largest purveyor of abortion on dema nd. IPPF’s model of ‘safe mother hood’ is a sterile woman with a dead baby, preferably a baby killed at one of their numerous abortion mills.\"29 Author Claire Chambers, who ha s done extensive research on the history of the population control movement, charged in 1977: \"Since its inception, th e U.N. has advanced a world-wide program o f p opulation control, scientific human breeding, and Da rwinism.\"30 Evidence to support that contention is p lentiful. Jacqueline Kasun made the same point in her The War Against Population : Since 1965 the United States has contributed more to foreign popula tion-control programs than all other countries combined and has pressured other countries and international agencies to back the programs. In addition to more than 2 billion dollars in explicit AID \"population assistance\" appropriations to various countries and international organizations such as the United Nations Fund for Population Ac tivities, the United States has made donations to the World Bank and to United Nations orga nizations — including the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization, UNESCO, UNICEF, and the International Labor Organization — that have been used for population control, with a degree of enthusiasm and dedication equal to that of the AID bureaucracy.31 UN Pushes War on Population From the UN’s very beginning, ke y UN figures such as Brock Ch isholm, Julian Huxley, and Paul Hoffman were p romotin g anti-natalist p olicies.32 The first director g eneral of the United Nations"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) was humanist l eader Julian Huxley, who in 1947 wrote in UNESCO: Its Purpose and Its Philosophy : Thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic [contro lled human breeding] policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible, it will be important for Unesco to see th at the eugenic problem is exam ined with the greatest care, and that the public mind is info rmed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable .33 [Emphasis added] UNESCO’s quarterly journal, Impact of Science on Society , served as a regular platform for anti-natalist p ropaganda. In the fall of 1968, almost the entire i ssue of this publication was devoted to population control themes. The UN’s formal acceptance of the world leadership role for population control can be traced back at least to 1954 when a UN Populati on Commission recommended th at every country should \"have a population policy.\"34 \"Human Rights Day,\" December 11, 1967, proved to be a landmar k date. On that occasion, UN Secretary-General U Thant, Pres ident of the United States Lyndon B. Johnson, and 29 other heads o f state issued a Declaration on Popula tion. \"This Declaration pr oclaimed ‘fertility contro l’ to be a new, so- called basic human right,\" notes author Claire Ch ambers. \"During the same period, various specialized agencies of the U.N. acted in concert with this edict, developing their own corresponding mandates.\"35 That same year saw the establishm ent of the UN Fund for Population Activities by Secr etary-General U Thant, a Marxist, and the subseque nt organization and management of the Fund under the administration of Paul Hoffman (CFR) was another major advance for the population planners. UNFPA, says Professo r Kasun, \"excellently illustrates the labyrinthine fi nancial connections of the world population network.\" She explained: Deriving its income from the United States and other governments, it provides support to numerous \"nongovernmental orga nizations,\" including the Population Council, the Population Action Council, Worldwatch, the Population Crisis Co mmittee and Draper Fund, and the Centre for Population Activities. Th ese organizations in turn make grants to each other and to stil l other organizations.36 On November 12, 1971, the UN P opulation Commission adopted a resolution urging, among othe r things, that all member states: ... cooperate in achieving a subs tantial reduction of the rate of population growth [in the countries where it was needed]. ... ensure that information and education about family planni ng, as well as the means to effectively practice family pla nning, are made available to all individuals by the end of the Second United Nations De velopment Decade [1980].37 This Commission further designate d 1974 as World Population Year, invited all member states to p articipate in the event, and requested the UN Secretary-General, among other things, to: ... study the possibilities of developing a global population strate gy, including population movements, for promoting and co-coordinating population policies in Member States with the ob j ective of achievin g a balance between p o p ulation and other natural resources....38"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"The year 1972 saw the convening of the UN’s Conference on the Hu man Environment, which met in Stockholm, June 5-16. Just prior to the conference, UN Secretary-Gene ral Kurt Waldheim expressed the opinion that the conference’s leaders \"must surely li nk the increasing pollution of the planet with the increasing population of the planet.\" 39 The Stockholm conference urged th at \"special attention be given to population concerns as they relate to th e environment during the 1974 observance of World Population Year.\"40 The population c onference was held in Bucharest, where, notes Professor Kasun, \"The dean of the American activists , John D. Rockefeller III, addresse d the assembled de legates to stress that ‘population planning’ should be incorporated into all plan s for economic development.\" Rockefelle r added: \"Population planning must be a fundamental and integral part of any modern development p rogram, recognized as such by nationa l leadership and supported fully.\"41 The year 1994 will mark the 20th a nniversary of that event. Accord ingly, plans are being laid for a Population Summit in 1994, along the lines of th e 1992 UNCED Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. N ot that population issues were ignor ed at Rio. Far from it. Underlying all of the issues dear to the hearts of \"environmentalists\" is the matter of population, or rather , population control. In spite o f disagreement on many other issues, the one thing that finds the greens in greatest unanimity is the belie f that there are too many people in this world and th at something drastic must be done to address the situation. Many UNCED speakers worked population themes in to their speeches. UNCED chief Maurice Strong deplored the world’s \"explosive increase in population,\" and warne d, \"[w]e have been the most successful species ever; we are now a species out of control.\" He thundered: \"Pop ulation must be stabilized, and rapidly.\"42 Jacques Cousteau, one of the most venerated attractions at the Rio su mmit, issued a dire warning that \"the fuse connected to a demograp hic explosion is already burning.\" At most, he said, humanity has ten years to put it out. Parroting th e new Paul Ehrlich population scar e stories, the famed oceanographe r urged \"drastic, unconventional decisions\" if the worl d is to avoid reaching the \"unacceptable\" and \"absurd figure of 16 billion human beings\" by the year 2070.43 The same theme was echoed by Norw egian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, who is a member o f the Socialist International and chair of the World Commission on Environment and Development; by Mostafa Tolba, executive director of the United Nations Environment Pr ogram; and by many others.44 A genda 21 , one of the main documents to come out of th e UN’s Rio conference, asserts that $4.5 billion p er year is needed for demographic policies in developing countries and says some $7 billion per year is needed until the year 2000 to implement \"int ensive programmes\" necessary for population stabilization.45 What that m eans, in plain English, is that the UN wants a lot more money to expand its p opulation control programs of st erilization, abortion, and universal access to sex education and contraceptives. \"Safe Motherhood\" Scam Much of the UN’s activity in support of its war on population comes from it s World Bank. At the Rio Earth Summit, Bank president Lewis Preston (CFR) pledged to increase greatly his institution’s support for population control programs.46 He had alrea dy begun those efforts earlier in 1992 with the launching of the so-called \"Safe Motherhood Initiative\" that opponent s were denouncing as \"a policy that puts a bounty on the lives of unborn children.\" At the International Safe Motherhood Initiati ve conference held March 9-11, 1992 in Washin g ton DC,"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Preston promised the 120 delegate s from 20 developing countries a doubling of World Bank support fo r anti-population programs.47 Ostensibly initiated to improve the general health needs of women in Thir d World nations, the core of the progr am is population control. The initi ative is a joint project of the World Bank, International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), Family Care International, the U.S. AID-funded Population Counc il, and several other agencies — including the supposedly pro-chil d United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the UN ’s World Health Organi zation (WHO), and UNFPA. According to Jean M. Guilfoyle, di rector of the pro-family, Washington- b ased Population Research Institute, the Safe Motherhood pr ogram involves \"the legalizati on of abortion surgeries and the imposition of restrictive population control policies.\" She noted that there are \"those among the targeted nations who dare to call this ‘economic blackmail wi th genocidal intent.’\"48 In the May/June 1992 issue of Population Research Institute Review , Guilfoyle stated: \"Within the partnership, the World Bank is intended to provide economic compul sion and guaranteed fu nds to carry out the agenda forcefully.\"49 P opulation Research Institute Review reported that, in addition to the Safe Motherhood strategy session held in March 1992 at World Bank headquarters in Washington, there had also been an earlie r conference in January in Guatemal a. At this gathering, a World Ba nk official proposed that Latin American countries make the legali zation of abortion the centerpiece of their maternal and infant health p rograms. Speakers at the conference claimed that large monetary savi ngs would accrue if maternal and child health programs in both the publ ic and the private sect or were oriented towa rd \"safe abortion\" and contraception.50 World Bank officials at the conf erence actually pressure d Latin American gover nments to legalize abortion and make it the cent er of the maternal-infant health progr ams. Mexican officials promptly fell in line. According to Human Life International, World Bank official Anne G. Tinker demanded that governments provide \"safe a bortion\" in all maternal-i nfant health programs. Le gislative changes needed to legalize abortion must be unde rtaken immediately, she told th e gathering.51 Abortion currently is illegal in all Latin American countri es except Uruguay and communist Cuba. World Bank president Preston said the Bank will in tegrate the full \"Safe Motherhood\" agenda into its \"policy dialogue\" with developing c ountries.52 This means that devel oping countries must meet World Bank requirements in the area of population control in order to qualify for Bank loans. By including the \"Safe Motherhood\" agenda in its \" policy dialogue,\" the Bank is extend ing its tremendous financial clout into the political arena of soverei gn nations, compelling those nations to legalize abortion and initiate o r expand heavy-handed population control programs. Human Life International presiden t Father Marx has charged: \"T he bank is misusing its enormous worldwide economic and political clout to ordain a nd bankroll a misanthropic effort to ‘assist humanity’ by destroying pre- b orn human beings, by intro ducing unsafe, intrusive and culturally repugnant, often abortifacient, methods of birth control and by mutilating healthy people with wholesale neutering p rograms.\"53 \"Through such initiatives,\" Father Marx said, \"wom en in the Third World ar e being used for medical experimentation and their offspring are the target of a massive, well- financed eugenics campaign aime d at the poorest and most defenseles s members of the human family.... Here you have an array of some o f the major enemies of unborn children, women and fa milies gathered to di scuss ‘safe motherhood.’\"54 And the leader of those \"major enemies of unborn children, wome n and families\" is the United Nations, su pp orted b y ma j or fundin g from the U.S. g overnment."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Notes 1.

It really is an open question in my mind of wh ether we can cope with thes e chronic problems — problems that you don’t need to solve tomorrow in order to survive — within the context of freedom.... 1 — William D. Ruckelshaus, Business Council for Sustainable Development A Real Mover and Shaker Early in 1990, journalist Daniel Wood was riding along Highway 17 through the arid and sagebrush- filled terrain of southern Colorado. He had just sp ent a week visiting a sprawling ranch where a 60-year- old Canadian millionaire, o il tycoon, environmentalist, UN of ficial, and New Age devotee was constructing a controvers ial global village and ecumenical as hram. Although the tycoon had risen into the rarefied atmosphere of internat ional finance where he dined with Rockefellers and Rothschilds, his name had not yet become a household word as each of theirs had. Soon that would change, as orchestrated world events would thrust him into the international limelight. As the highway through the desert slid by, Wood’s dr iver, the tycoon-environmen talist himself, told him of a novel he had been pl anning to write. It wa s about a group of world le aders who decided the only way to save the world was to ca use the economies of th e industrialized countries to collapse. The j ournalist sat transfixed as his host explained how hi s fictional leaders had formed a secret society and engineered a worldwide financial panic and, ultimately, the economic collapse they sought. While the tycoon drove and talked about the proposed novel, the increasingly astonished reporter took copious notes. His account of that conversation appeared in the May 1990 issue of West magazine: Each year, he [the tycoon] ex plains as background to the telling of the novel’s plot, the World Economic Forum convenes in Davos, Sw itzerland. Over a thous and CEO’s, prime ministers, finance ministers, a nd leading academics gather in February to attend meetings and set economic agendas for the y ear ahead. With this as a settin g, he then sa ys: \"What if a small group of these world leaders were to conc lude that the principa l risk to the earth comes from the actions of the rich countries? And if the world is to survive, those rich countries would have to sign an agreement re ducing their impact on the environment. Will they do it?... The group’s conclusion is ‘no.’ The rich countries w on’t do it. They won’t change. So, in order to save the pl anet, the group decides: Isn’t the only hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizati ons collapse? Isn’t it our responsibility to bring that about?\"2 [Emphasis in original] \"This group of world leaders,\" the driver-tycoon cont inued, \"form a secret so ciety to bring about an economic collapse.\" It was becomi ng obvious to Wood that this unfol ding \"novel\" was a thinly-veiled roman ˆ clef starring the tycoon and his power-elite comrades. The milli onaire storyteller went on: It’s February. They’re all at Davos. These aren ’t terrorists. They’re world leaders . They have positioned themselves in the world’ s commodity and stoc k markets. They’ve engineered, using their access to stock excha nges and computers and gold supplies, a panic. Then, they prevent the world’s stock markets fr om closing. They jam th e gears. They hire mercenaries who hold the rest of the world leaders at Davos as hostages. The markets can’t close .

No, he should not even have been thinking things like that. For some reason, however , the millionair e insider felt compelled to tell the outsider his story, somewhat like Colone l House did when revealing his megalomaniacal nature in Philip Dru: Administrator .3 Wood wrote: \"I sit ther e spellbound. This is not any storyteller talking. This is Maurice Strong. He knows these world leaders. He is, in fact, co-chairman of the Council of the Worl d Economic Forum. He sits at the fulcrum of power.

Before, during, and after th e summit, the Canadian activist made headlines more than once with envir onmental tirades against the life-styles of \"the rich countries\" that sounded uncomfortably similar to th e story line of the \"novel\" he rela ted to Wood. The fact that he was the top executive of the privately owned Dome Petr oleum of Canada, presiden t of Power Corporation o f Canada, and later head of Petro Canada, the giant government oil compa ny, is fairly well known from the many profiles about him appeari ng in the major media. Many of thes e articles mention that he was head of the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environm ent in Stockholm and the first secretary-general of the United Na tions Environmental Program (UNEP).

Strong, it turns out, may also be the planet’s richest eco-warrior. His Colorado ranch sits atop one of the largest aquifers in the world.

The 20th century has seen the crea tion of fractional reserve banking controlled by national central banks in most of the nations of the world.

Three decades later the United States is wracked by internal political and moral problems, inflation, and self doubts. The world’s most powerfu l nation had been defeated by a third- rate country in a wasteful no-w in war. Half of its gold stock had been lost, and it had short- term liabilities to foreigners totalling almost ten times the value of wh at gold it still owned.5 Two years later, surveying the sa me post-war phenomena as had Dr. Sutton, political analyst Dan Smoot asked, \"What earthquake of histor y has occurred?\" To which he answered: \"None. All of it was p lanned.\"6 Betrayal at Bretton Woods The planning had been formulated by the Economic and Finance Group of the Council on Foreign Relations during the early years of the war,7 and the plans were put into effect at the Bretton Woods Conference in July 1944. Sitting as the leader of the conference and th e head of the U.S. delegation was Assistant Secretary of th e Treasury Harry Dexter White, a secret member of a Soviet espionage ring.8 Serving as the technical secretary for the conferen ce was Virginius Frank Coe, a director of monetary research for the Treasury Department. Coe became th e first secretary of the new International Monetary Fund (IMF), a post he held until 1952 when it was revealed in congressional testimony that he was a member of the same communist ring White had joined.9 From 1958, until his death in 1980, Coe lived in Communist China. Working hand-in-hand with communi sts White and Coe were numerous Establishment Insiders among whom was Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr. It was he wh o declared at the time: \"It has b een proved ... that people in the international banking business cannot run successfully foreign exchange markets. It is up to the Governments to do it. We propose to do this if and when the legislative bodies approve Bretton Woods.\"10 The incredible deceit now evident here is that Morg enthau personally represented the very \"international b anking\" establishment he was criti cizing, and the system he was he lping construct would place the world economy more fi rmly in its grasp than ever before. The two primary institutions to come out o f the conference, the Internationa l Monetary Fund and the World Ba nk, have been run by certified members of the Insider banki ng fraternity ever since. Dan Smoot observed in his 1979 article: White’s Bretton Woods Conf erence set policies which our government has followed, without deviation, under all Pres idents, since the end of World War II. These policies were intended to accomplish f our major objectives: (1) Strip the United States of its monetary gold re serve by giving the gold to other nations; (2) Build the industrial capacity of other nations, at our expense, to eliminate American p roductive su p eriorit y ;"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"(3) Take world markets — and much of the American domestic market — away from American producers to stop American domination of world trade; (4) Entwine American affairs with those of other nations until the United States could not have an independent policy, but would become an interdependent link in a worldwide socialist chain.11 The Bretton Woods participan ts, of course, did not stat e their resolves as bluntly or succinctly. It makes little sense to dispute the fact, how ever, that the policies and institutions they established have indeed p roduced the tragic results enumerated by Smoot. Bretton Woods opened th e floodgates of government spending worldwide. As free-market economists warned, it has led to massive growth of government, mountains of debt, and global inflation. At the time the Bretton Woods ag reements were being hammered out, the near-s olitary voice in the major American media opposing the one-world economic scheme and warning of its dire consequences was Henry Hazlitt, then the financial editor of the Wall Street Journal . In one article after another, he soundly refuted the sophistry put forward for the new global ec onomic plan. Unfortunately, his arguments were ignored. Hazlitt was always a st rong opponent of inflation. But, unl ike many others, he employed a prope r definition of the often mis-def ined term. Inflation is an increase in the quantity of currency. Its effect is a lessening of the value of all existi ng currency. When merchant s and others ask for mo re of it in return for their goods and services, they are responding — even if they are unaware of the process that has been forced on them — to the fact that the currency has lost value. That value, stolen from all existing currency through the introduction of more currency, was actually stolen from currency holders by the issuer. In virtually all cases, the issuer is ei ther government or a privately-run central bank. The path to inflation begins with the removal of precious metal ba cking for the currency. Once the requirement for gold or silver in th e issuer’s vault (in this nation, the U.S. Treasur y formerly served this p urpose) is removed, inflation is possible, even inevitable. In his 1984 book, From Bretton Woods to World Inflation , Henry Hazlitt reviewed the tragic worldwide devastation and upheaval that he insisted are ... the consequences of the decisions made by the representatives of the forty-five nations at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, forty years ago. These decision s, and the institutions set up to carry them out, have led us to the presen t world monetary chaos. For the first time in history, every nation is on an inconvertible paper m oney basis. As a result, every nation is inflating, some at an appa lling rate. This has brought economic disruption, chronic unemployment, and anxiety, de stitution, and despair to unt old millions of families.12 Of course there had been inflatio ns before Bretton Woods . But it was at that conference, primarily unde r the leadership of White and Fabian Socialist John Maynard Keyne s of England, that, as Hazlitt noted, \"inflation was institutionalized.\" Many nations are now saddled with impossible debt burdens and oppressive bureaucracies because, cl aims this dean of free market thinkers, \"the IMF, in effect encourages them to continue their socialist and inflationist course.\"13 Hazlitt, who has called the shots correctly during al l of these many years, does not mince words when it comes to solutions. \"The world cannot get back to economic sanity,\" he has warned, \"until the IMF is abolished.... We will not sto p the g rowth of world inflation and world socialism until the institutions and"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"p olicies adopted to promote them have been abolishe d.\"14 Unfortunately, our elected leaders have continued along the course set by communists, so cialists, and globalist Insiders decades ago. Again, we turn to Hazlitt: Yet the supreme irony is that the Bretton Woods institutions that have failed so completely in their announced purpose, and led to only mone tary chaos instead, ar e still there, still operating, still draining the countries with lower inflations to subsidize the higher inflation of others.15 In fact, the internationalist Insiders have stepped up the pace of these suicidal policies. In his Spring 1988 Foreign Affairs article entitled \"The Case for Practical Internationalism,\" CFR strategist Richard N . Gardner stated bluntly: But most of all, the world needs to enlarge the flows of private an d official capital to developing countries in order to stimul ate an adequate level of global growth. A near- doubling of World Bank capital and Internati onal Monetary Fund quotas should be a high priority for American leadership.... [Emphasis added] A World Central Bank Even worse, the one-worlders are working to expand their scheme in order eventually to achieve complete global economic control by transforming th e International Monetary Fund and World Ban k combine into a central Federal Rese rve system for the planet. One of the first in-depth presentations o f this plan to CFR membership came in 1981 with the publication of Collective Management: The Reform of Global Economic Organizations . Written by Miriam Ca mps (CFR) in collaboration with Catherine Gwin (CFR), it was the 21st volume in the Council’s 1980s Project series. Collective Management’s proposals for \"restructuri ng\" United Nations instit utions included designing a new global trade organization to s upersede the General Agreement on Ta riffs and Trade (GATT) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Developmen t (UNCTAD), merging seve ral United Nations aid p rograms in order to create in th eir places a new \"Uni ted Nations Basic Suppor t Program,\" and taking additional steps that would aid in \"t he continuing evolution of the IMF in the direction of a world central bank.\"16 Expanding further on this topic in the Fall 1984 edition of Foreign Affairs , Harvard University Professo r Richard N. Cooper (CFR, TC) proposed \"A Monetary System for the Future\" that would mean the end of America as we know it. He wrote: A new Bretton Woods conference is wholly premature. But it is not premature to begin thinking about how we would like internationa l monetary arrangements to evolve in the remainder of this century. With this in mind, I suggest a radical alternative scheme for the next century: the creation of a common currency for all of the industrial democracies, with a common monetary policy and a jo int Bank of Issue to dete rmine that monetary policy. [Emphasis in original] \"The currency of the Bank of Issue could be prac tically anything,\" the Harvard economist continued. \" ... The key point is that monetary control — the issuan ce of currency and of reserv e credit — would be in the hands of the new Bank of Issue, not in the hands of any national government....\" (Emphasis added) The p roblem, however, is that \"a sin g le currenc y is p ossible onl y if there is in effect a sin g le monetar y"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"p olicy, and a single authority issuing the cu rrency and directing the monetary policy. How can independent states accomplish that ? They need to turn over the dete rmination of monetary policy to a s upranational bod y .\" (Emphasis added) Insider Cooper realized the challenge involved in sell ing this totalitarian idea to the public. \"This one- currency regime is much too radical to envisage in the near future,\" he said. \"But it is not too radical to envisage 25 years from now.... [I]t will require many years of considerat ion before people become accustomed to the idea.\" Getting peopl e in the West, and particularly in the United States, warm to the idea of \"a pooling of monetary sovereignty\" — especially with communist countries — would be difficult. Cooper wrote: First, it is highly doubtful whet her the American public, to ta ke just one example, could ever accept that countries with oppressive autocratic regime s should vote on the monetary policy that would affect monetary conditions in the United States.... For such a bold step to work at all, it presupposes a certa in convergence of political values.... Convergence with Totalitarian Regimes That requisite \"convergence\" is already underway and well-ahead of Professor Cooper’s 25-yea r estimate, thanks to the high-power ed sales job his fellow CFR member s have conducted on behalf of the \"former\" communist states. The Es tablishment policy line has been repeated again and again in the Insiders’ elite journals ( Foreign Affairs , Foreign Policy , World Policy Journal ), as well as in the CFR- dominated popular media. It holds that the United St ates must provide Russia and all the nations of he r former satellite empire with billions of dollars in cr edits and aid to help them make the transition to \"a market economy.\" Writing in the Summer 1990 Foreign Policy , Thomas G. Weiss (CFR) and Me ryl A. Kessler set out the globalist line: As for the economic realm, there is little hope for coope ration between the superpowers until the United States allows the Soviet Un ion to become a full-fledged actor in global economic affairs.... The United States should follow up by s upporting immediate Soviet observer status in the IMF and the World Bank, leading toward full membership.... American interests and the credibility of the Unit ed States as a leader in world affairs would be enhanced by joining the Soviet Union in taking the lead at the United Nations.17 Those steps were adopted in toto by the Bush Administration. The 12 \"r epublics\" of the new Commonwealth of Independent States, the former War saw Pact countries of Eastern Europe, and the three Baltic states have either become members of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund o r are in the process of joining. The IM F is now in the proces s of transferring billi ons of tax dollars from the West to socialist regimes in the East still run by communi sts and former communists. Not surprisingly, these regimes have shown little evidence of any se rious intent to make the leap from collectivist to free- market economies.18 The Insider line, in fact, is that we must slow down the transition of the communi st/socialist countries to free markets. Writing in the Summer 1992 World Policy Journal (published by the World Policy Institute — a CFR-dominated think tank — and the Fabian socialist Ne w School for Social Research), Sherle R. Schwenninger asserted in an article entitled \"The United States in th e New World Order\" that \"the United States should use its wei g ht within the IMF and the World Bank to encoura g e a slowe r"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"transition to an open market economy in East ern Europe and the fo rmer Soviet Union.\" Moreover, said Schwenninger, a senior fellow at th e WPI-NSSR think tank, \"If the industrialized nations gave up their SDRs [special drawing rights] to the developing countries and the former republics of the Soviet Union, these countries would be ab le to borrow more money from the IMF.\" UN Taxing Authority What is even more alarming, howeve r, is Schwenninger’s assertion furt her along in the article that due to \"needs ranging from the global e nvironment to U.N. peacekeeping, we can no longer afford to rely on ‘voluntary’ national contributions....\" As you might expect, in the ne xt breath, he proposes granting taxing authority to the United Nations : \"If international agencies are to have the resources they need to address critical transnational problems , then we will need to move to a system of value-added taxes that would be automatically when goods and services cross national .\" Proposals along these lines are cr opping up everywhere. Complain ing of the UN’s \"present mendicancy,\" in his June 1992 An Agenda for Peace report to the UN Security Council, Secretary- General Boutros-Ghali called for the following: \"the establ ishment of a United Nations Peace Fund\"; \"a levy on international air trav el\"; \"[a]uthorization to the Secretary-General to borrow commercially\"; \"[s] uspending certain financial regulations of the Un ited Nations\"; and \"gen eral tax exemption fo r contributions made to the United Nations.\"19 Boutros-Ghali’s proposals were given a boost in Changing Our Ways , the 1992 report issued by the Carnegie Endowment’s Na tional Commission on America and the New World. The Carnegie report, which was released amid great medi a fanfare, declared: \"Any plausible vision for America’s future role in the world must include a renewe d financial commitment to the Unit ed Nations.\" It referred to the Boutros-Ghali package as a \"bold but pragmatic set of financing propos als,\" and urged \"p olicymakers to study them carefully.\"20 This Carnegie Commission, made up of a panel of 21 promin ent Americans from the fields of politics, b usiness, finance, and higher edu cation, offered many proposals to colle ctivize and internationalize the American economy. This is hardly surprising since all but three of the pane lists are members of the Council on Foreign Relations. Seve ral are also members of the Tr ilateral Commission. The group’s chairman is Winston Lord, a former presiden t of the CFR who is st ill a proud member. Othe r Establishment heavyweights on the panel include: C. Fred Bergste n, director of the Institute fo r International Economics and former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury; Morton Abramowitz, president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace a nd former Assistant Secret ary of State; Barber B. Conable, former president of the World Bank; David Gergen, editor-at-large for U.S. News and Worl d R eport ; and Jessica T. Mathews, vice president of the World Resources Institute and columnist for the Washington Post . The Carnegie panel believes we mu st \"reduce our defense spending,\" but we must also \"[s]trengthen the p eacekeeping capacities of the United Na tions and regional organizations.\"21 Its Changing Our Ways report advocates taxing Americans an additional $1.00 per gallon for \"g asoline ... and ot her petroleum p roducts,\" calls for a \"weight ta x\" on automobiles, and proposes a \"substantial\" tax on \"carbon content.\"22 More and More Power in Government Consonant with the p lans of the one-worlders at the United Nations and environmental extremists"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"everywhere, these CFR elitists propose \"swift ratification of the globa l warming treaty\" and advancement of protocols \"for th e management of greenhouse gases. \" The Carnegie report recommends A genda 21 , the massive program adopted at the UN’s Earth Summit that calls for government regulation and control of virtually every aspect of life in the name of protecting the environment.23 Other Insider-created organizations have come forward with similar proposals. One of the newest groups to enter the chorus is the Busine ss Council for Sustainable Developm ent (BCSD), an international group of globalist business executives. Launched in 1990 by Maurice Strong, it is chaired by Stephan Schmidheiny, chairman of UNOTEC, a Swiss inves tment company. Its U.S. members include William D. Ruckelshaus (CFR), chairman of Browning-Ferris Industries; Fr ank Popoff (CFR), president and CEO of Dow Chemical; and Paul H. O’Neil l, chief executive officer of ALCOA. In a perfectly timed publicity c oup, the BCSD rele ased its 1992 book, Changing Course: A Globa l P erspective on Development and the Environment , just before the opening of the Rio Earth Summit.24 While paying lip service to \"marke t incentives,\" it quickly became apparent that, like the Carnegie p anel’s recommendations, everythi ng offered by the BCSD will increase the size, cost, and power o f government. This Business Council calls for \"[ n]ew forms of cooperation betwee n government, business and society\" to achieve \"sustainable development.\" According to these business leaders, \"t he prices of goods and services must increasingly recognize and reflect the environmental cost s of their production, use, recycling, and disposal.\" This, th ey say \"is best achieved by a s ynthesis of econom ic instruments designed to correct [market] distor tions\" and \"regulatory standards\" to help the market \"give the right signals.\"25 The real philosophy behind the BCSD’s statist nostrums was revealed (most likely unintentionally) by BCSD member William Ruckelshaus, the first head of the U.S. Envi ronmental Protection Agency. Just p rior to the 1992 Earth Summit, he stat ed: \"What I realthink is at stake here globally is the future of free institutions.... It really is an ope n question in my mind of whether we can cope with these chronic p roblems — problems that you don’t need to solve tomorrow in order to survive — within the context o f freedom....\"26 Still more propaganda for UN intervention in a nd control of the world economy came from the influential Club of Rome. Founded in 1968 by Italy’s Au relio Peccei, a former top executive with the Olivetti Company and Fiat Motors, the Club of Rome boasts an elite membership of some 200 members worldwide who have backgrounds in business, scie nce, politics, higher education, and religion. In its celebrated 1991 report, The First Global Revolution , the group called for the implementation o f \"energy accounting,\" which it announced \"is becoming increasi ngly necessary in measuring, fo r example, the carrying capacity of countries for human and animal popul ations.... It is urgent that a Worldwide Campaign of Energy Conservation and Efficiency be launched.\"27 (Emphasis in original) Moreover, the Club of Rome document proposed: It would be appropriate that the scheme be launched by the United Nations in association with the United Nations Environment Progra mme, the World Meteorol ogical Organization and UNESCO. A corollary would be the setting up in each country of an Energy Efficiency Council to supervise the operation on the national scale.28 Because of the \" g lobal nature as well as the seriousness of the environmental th reats,\" the Club called"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"for \"the creation of a UN Environmental Security Council parallel to the existing Security Council on military matters.\" Also, the United Nations \"should convene an inter governmental scientific meeting to p lan a comprehensive World Alternative Energy Project. \"29 Like the Club’s 17 previous reports, The First Global Revolution sees more government as the solution to every real or imagined problem. And because it s members hold that all of mankind’s problems today are global, it only makes sense to fa vor global government. \"The market is ill-adapted to deal with long- term effects,\" says the Club’s report. \"... The system of the market economy countries based on competition is motivated by self-int erest and ultimately on greed.\"30 Echoing the socialist slogans of the environmental left, these gl obe-trotting, champagne-and-caviar- consuming elitists hypocritically stat e: \"Our efforts to create a su stainable world society and economy demands that we diminish the profligate life-styles in the indus trialized countries through a slow-down in consumption....\"31 Appropriately, The First Global Revolution opens with the following excerpt from The Rubayat of Oma r Khayyam: Ah love! Could thou and I with fate conspire, to grasp this sorry scheme of things entire, would not we shatter it to bits and then, remould it nearer to the heart’s desire. Students of political history will recognize this as the same quatrain adopted by the Britain’s Fabian Socialist Society in their \"open conspiracy\" to cr eate a socialist world. This verse was represented p ictorially in the famous stained glass wi ndow at the Beatrice Webb House, a worl d -renowned socialist shrine in Surrey, England. The window shows socialist leaders Si dney Webb and George Bernard Shaw smashing the world with hammers and, above their head s appears the last line of the quatrain, \"remould it nearer to the heart’s desire.\"32 Is it mere coincidence that the so cialist-elitist-internati onalist Club of Rome c hose this favored Fabian verse? Don’t the proposals they and th eir fellow globalists of fer lead inexorably to the creation of an all- p owerful socialist superstate ruled by the United Nations? With each passing day, the words and actions of the CFR, Trilateralist, Club of Rome, World Federalist one-worlders make plain that they intend to shatter fre edom to bits and, then, re mould the world to their collectivist heart’s desire.

[T]he World Bank’s financing of major governmental agricultural restructuring and rese ttlement projects had been the main cause of the famine-deaths of millions, and of the denuding of the environment. — Warren Brookes, syndicated columnist, December 16, 1987 The World Bank is helping Third World gove rnments cripple their economies, maul their environments, and oppress their people. Although the bank started with the highest ideals some 40 years ago, it now consistently does more harm than good for the world’s poorest. 2 — James Bovard, The World Bank vs. the World’s Poor , September 28, 1987 \"The UN has its glaring faults,\" many people readily acknowledge, \"but it also is responsible for so many important humanitarian efforts around the world.\" This vision of selfless UN servants distributing food to famine victims, providing emergency relief to refugees, and immunizing \"Third World\" children against killer diseases is a po werful image that has, no doubt, saved the United Nations from mass defections among its supporters. It is difficult to think ill of an organization in volved in such noble endeavors. Unfortunately, this image too is largely a myth, one of the UN ’s cruelest hoaxes as well as one of its most tightly guarded secrets. This is not to say that no famine victims, refugees, or children have been he lped through UN programs; indeed, many have. Many of these UN aid recipients , however, were actually placed in their dire p redicaments by harmful actions and wrong-headed policies of the UN and its agencies. Moreover, in stark contrast to the portr ait of saintly benevolence bestowed on UN relief programs, the record clearly shows that UN aid personnel, partic ularly at the higher le vels, are guilty of some of the most crass, heartless, and unethical behavior imaginable. Th e UN propagandists have c ynically and persistently exploited the world’s compassion as a protective cove r to advance their sinister global agenda. Before we venture any further down this dangerous path we would do well to examine the real results of the UN’s \"humanitar ian\" programs. Ethiopian \"Relief\" In December 1985, the medical personne l of Doctors Without Borders (M edecins Sans Frontieres) were expelled from Ethiopia. Dr. R ony Brauman, a French physician and director of the international, nonprofit, humanitarian group, de scribed their experience: Armed militiamen burst into our compounds, seized our equipment and menaced our volunteers. Some of our employees were beate n, and our trucks, medicines and food stores confiscated. We left Et hiopia branded as enemies of the revolution. The regime spoke the truth. The atrocities commit ted in the name of Men g istu’s master p lan did make us enemies"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"of the revolution.3 [Emphasis in original] Unfortunately, it took a great d eal more time before the governme nts and press of the Free World decided to declare themselves \"enemies of the revolution.\" The major Western news media \"d iscovered\" the Ethiopian famine in October 1984. Then, for months, the haunting images of masses of starving refugees and vacant-eyed, dying children huddled in pathetic make-shift camps dominated the newspaper front-pages and nightly newscasts. Our hearts were touched, even devastated. How could they not be, in the f ace of such suffering a nd carnage? People responded worldwide with a phenomenal outpouring of financial and material aid. What most of the people of the worl d did not find out until much later wa s that the tragic drama they had been witnessing was not the result of a natural dr ought; it was a planned famine, the result of conscious, inhuman policies of the co mmunist regime of \"President\" Mengist u Haile Mariam. It was an extension of the communist textbook-styl e terror program Me ngistu had unleashed on the populace in 1977. Copying the \"successful\" starvation campaigns employe d by Lenin against the Russian peasants, Stalin against the Ukrainian kulaks, and Mao against the ru ral Chinese, the central government in Addis Ababa initiated forced \"collectivization\" of agricult ure and began massive \"res ettlement\" programs that guaranteed large-scale starvation. The famine had already been in progress for seve ral years and many tens of thousands had already p erished when NBC’s broadcast of October 23, 1984 brought the shocki ng reality of Ethiopia’s anguish into American homes for the first time. But not until May 21, 19 91, when the Soviet- b acked Mengistu regime was overthrown, did it beco me politically acceptable in th e CFR-Establishment media to denounce the brutal polic ies and expose the Marxist central pl anning responsible for the famine. By then, this \"news\" was too late to be of any help in speeding Mengistu’s removal or in averting the agony of his millions of hapless victims. What most Americans — and most people of goodwill the world over w ho contributed generously to the famine relief effort — s till have not been told, however, is that the United Nations and its specialize d agencies bear an enormous sh are of the responsibility for pr omoting and prolonging the Ethiopian nightmare. Soon after seizing power, Colonel Me ngistu did what all Marxist dict ators do: He asked for aid from America and the United Nations \"l ending\" institutions — the World Ba nk and International Monetary Fund. He was met with open arms a nd open wallets, courtesy of the taxpayers of the United States, Western Europe, and other revile d \"capitalist\" countries. \"Bet ween 1978 and 1982,\" Robert W. Lee reported in The New American for March 23, 1992, \"Ethiopia received $1 billion in aid from the West, most of it channelled through the IMF a nd other multilateral lending agencies.\"4 During this time, the aid officials could not have be en unaware of Mengistu’s di abolical record. Did his well-documented atrocities and disastrous, openly-Marxist economic policies endanger his credit- worthiness or raise eyebrows at the UN? To the contrary, these excesses made him a p referred custome r with the World Bank/IMF pinstripes and a hero to an array of UN- b acked petty tyrants throughout the Third World. On October 16, 1984, the UN’s Administrati ve and Budgetary Committee voted 83 to 3 to p rovide $73.5 million in UN funds to Ethiopia. But these funds were not intended for the starving famine victims; the money was specified for improvements on the conference facilities of the UN’s E conomic Commission for Afri ca (ECA) in Addis Ababa! While entire Ethiopian villages and provinces were succumbing to unimaginable privation, the pampered and sanc timonius UN \"humanitarians\" were whinin g that the ECA faci lities were \"wholl y inade q uate\" and \"sorel y \" in need of u pg radin g .

Richard Nygard, U.S. Representative to the UN, not ed that the $73.5 million could have inoculated one million Ethiopian children, built 25,000 wells and pumps for 12.5 milli on people, and fed 125,000 Ethiopian families for a year with enough left over to supply all 1985 cereal im ports for drought-stricken Chad.5 The $73.5 million for improving th e conference facilities, howev er, was a pittance compared to the big-time sums Mengistu customar ily obtained from the World Bank. The World Bank, wrote author/resear cher James Bovard in 1987, \"hel ped to lay the groundwork for the Ethiopian government’s current murd erous resettlement program.\" In The World Bank vs. the World’s P oor, a scorching indictment of bank’s le nding record, published by the Washington DC- b ased Cato Institute, Bovard noted that because of government policies, thousands of Ethi opians \"are being kept in concentration-camp-type facilities, where death rates are re ported to be quite high.\"6 In 1986, human rights groups began to point to UN backing of the murderous re gime. The influential British Economis t \"cited Ethiopia for the worst human rights record in the world.\" Ye t, said Bovard, \"Throughout this p eriod, the bank has provided large amounts of aid to the Mengistu regime.\"7 Other UN agencies and officials pe rformed in the same criminally cal lous manner. Perhaps one of the worst examples involves Edouard Saouma, Director General of the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) since the late 1960s. Accord ing to other FAO officials and the forme r commissioner of the Ethiopian Relief and Rehabi litation agency, Saouma he ld up emergency food aid for 20 days in 1984, at the height of the famine, be cause of a personal dislike for Tessema Negash, an Ethiopian FAO official. Ethiopian Relief and Reha bilitation Commissioner Dawit Wolde-Gi orgis has described his meeting in 1984 with the intractable Saouma: I went [to FAO headquarters in Rome] and trie d to brief [Saouma] on what was going on in Ethiopia.... He interrupted the di scussion and told me that our representative was not a very likeable person ... that it would be very diffic ult for him to co-operate ... as long as we had Tessema Negash as our FAO re presentative.... There I was tr ying to brief a senior UN official about the impending disaster and the number of pe ople dying every day and I was confronted with personal probl ems ... that was sickening.8 This was not the only indictment of UN official Saouma. Throughout the famine years, it is charged, Saouma also carried on a long-runni ng battle with the Director of the UN World Food Program (WFP) over which of them had authorit y over food aid shipments.9 Was Mr . Saouma disciplined, reprimanded, or even investigated as a result of these serious charges? To the contrary, in 1987 he was given anothe r six-year claim on his posh post, along with the usual automatic UN pay raise. Occasionally, embarrassing publicity will result in a m odicum of justice. As, for instance, in the case o f UN High Commissioner for Refugees Jean-Pierre Hock e. Hocke, a Swiss citi zen, resigned in Octobe r 1989 after a scandal erupted over his misuse of tens of thousands of dollars annually for personal expenses from a fund esta blished to educate ref ugees. According to the New York Times , Hocke misappropriated the money from ... a fund set up by Nordic countries for refugee education to pa y for entertainment and first- class air travel, sometimes a board the Concorde, for himsel f and his wife....

Mr. Hocke has never denied this.10 Again and again, the UN’s pious pl atitudes and noble rhetoric prove to be cynical devices exploited by the organization’s professional plutocrats, who are too preocc upied with personal empire- b uilding to be bothered with \"the world’s poo r\" they claim to serve. This point was driven home to Dr. Brauman time after time in Ethiopia. \"Even the famous drought p roved to be something of a false issue,\" he le arned. The physician rec ounted that his group had dispatched a hydrogeologist to the northern Sek’ot’a area, where \"he discovered an enormous deposit o f readily accessible underground water. At relatively low cost — only a small fraction of what was being raised for famine aid — there co uld have been water for everyone.\" 11 But UN officials and government officials weren’t intereste d. Neither were the UN officials interest ed in hearing about the atrocities an d genocidal policies of thei r \"host,\" Colonel Mengist u. Brauman was outraged: I was particularly shocked by th e U.N.’s resident representa tive, an assistant secretary- general installed in Addis, w ho invariably dismissed our prot ests with a few condescending phrases. Even when I told him point-blank that the resettlement program which the West’s aid had made possible wa s killing more Ethiopians than the famine was, he answered, \"I have no reason to believe that these people left the camps agai nst their own free will.\" One day I should like to understand how the U.N.’s highest represen tative in Ethiopia could be unable to see the murderous natu re of these deportations, there by lending a blessing to one of the world’s bloodiest and mo st tyrannical governments.12 Ethiopia is, however, far from bei ng the only victim of the UN’s \"compassion\" and \"largesse.\" Through its myriad agencies and ever-multi plying programs the United Nations and its adjuncts have wreaked havoc world wide; few corners of the globe have escaped their \"benevolence.\" The World Bank, fo r instance, said Bovard in 1987, \"is a major cause of the Tanzanian pe ople’s current misery.\"13 The ban k underwrote the communist regime of former President Juliu s Nyerere, who implemented his ujamaa o r villagization program to ... drive the peasants off their land, burn their huts, load them onto trucks, and take them where the government thought they should live .... with the result th at hunger has increased in Tanzania.... The bank also helped finance the brutal policie s of the Vietnamese government in the late 1970s that contributed to the d eaths of tens of thousands of boat people in the South China Sea.14 After surveying the economic destructiveness of th e World Bank’s policies in many countries, James Bovard concluded: [T]he bank exists largely to maximize the transfer of resources to Third World governments. And by so doing, the bank has grea tly promoted the nati onalization of Third World economies and has increa sed political and bureaucratic control over the lives of the poorest of the poor. Bank officials are now leading a rhetorical crusade in favor of the private se ctor. Yet every time the bank loudly praises the private sector, it silently da mns its own record. More than an y other international inst itution, the bank is res p onsible for the rush to socialism in the"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Third World — the rise of political power over the private sector — and the economic collapse of Africa.15 The Debt Profiteers Likewise, the World Bank’s sister institution, the International M onetary Fund, has been subsidizing the global socialist revolution for decades. Colu mnist Doug Bandow pointed out in March 1992: Six nations — Chile, Egypt, India, Sudan, Turk ey and Yugoslavia — relied or have relied on I.M.F. aid for more than 30 years; 23 nati ons have been borrowers for 20 to 29 years. And 48 have been using fund credit for 10 to 19 years. Since 1957 Egypt has never been off the I.M.F. dol e. Yugoslavia, which got its first loan in 1949, was not a borrower in only th ree of the last 40 years. Bangladesh, Barbados, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Pakistan, Uganda, Zaire and Zamb ia started borrowing in the early 70’s and haven’t stopped.16 Like domestic welfare drones, once these parasites attach themselves to the taxpayers, they never let loose. With the admission in 1992 of virtually all of th e \"former communist\" countries into both the IMF and World Bank, UN offici als and their international welfare lobbyists launched a sustained campaign for massive new infusions of capital (to come primarily from U.S. taxpa yers, of course) that they could lend to the tottering socialist regimes. Bandow warned against succumbi ng to the IMF sirens: [T]he West provided some $44 billion to Ru ssia last year without obvious results. Moreover, once the I.M.F. begins lending to Mosc ow it will be under e normous pressure to maintain its lending, irrespective of Russia’s co mpliance with its condi tions. And the fund’s record suggests that it is likely to give in to such pressure.... For years, foreign money has helped delay th e day of reckoning for many economies. Today the borrowers are le ft with huge debts and low growth. They need economic reform, not more loans. Once reforms are in place, privat e credit and investment will follow naturally.... [I]ncreased lending, whether in th e former Soviet Union or the third world, is only likely to waste more money.17 [Emphasis in original] While these \"development\" and \"r estructuring\" loans further impove rish the so-called Third Worl d p eoples under crushing debt payments, they enrich certain Insider bankers. U.S. Senator Jesse Helms exposed and denounced the shameful racket in 1987 in these words: [I]t is no secret that the inte rnational bankers prof iteer from sovereign state debt. The New York banks have found important profit cente rs in the lending to countries plunged into debt by Socialist regimes.... The New York banks find the profit from the intere st on this sovereign debt to be critical to their balance sheets. Up until very recently, th is has been an essent ially riskless game for the banks because the IMF and the World Bank have stood ready to bail the banks out with our taxpayers’ money.18 To which banks was Senator Helms re ferring?

Thus, in 1987, Worl d Bank President Barber Conable was able to boast: \"The 1986_7 fiscal year, which ended on 30 June, was a success ; our commitments represented $14.2 billion as against $13 billion in the previous year.\"20 (Emphasis in original) At the same time, the Bank’s own Operations Evaluation Department was warni ng that \"the drive to reach lending targets\" is \"potential ly damaging\" and is \"a major cause of poor project performance.\"21 In his important 1989 book, Lords of Poverty: The Power, Prestig e, and Corruption of the Internationa l A id Business , experienced African corresponde nt Graham Hancock reported: It is thus probably not entirely co incidental that, out of a repres entative sample of 189 of its projects audited worldwide, no less than 106 — almost 60 per cent — were found in 1987 either to have \"serious shortc omings\" or to be \"complete fa ilures.\" A similar proportion of these projects — including many j udged in other senses to be \"successes\" — were thought unlikely to be sustainable afte r completion. Furthermore, it is in the poorest countries of the world, and amongst the poorest segments of th e populations of these countries, that the Bank does worst. In sub-Saharan Africa, for exam ple, 75 per cent of all agricultural projects audited were found to have failed.22 Hancock catalogs numerous misguid ed projects of UN \"aid\" programs worldwid e. Among the multitude of fiascos, he found: [S]everal fish-farms in Egypt financed and managed by FA O during the 1980s have been unmitigated disasters: to date more than $50 million has been wasted. The farms owe their existence to a single FAO expert who made a very brief fiel d visit and then proposed the establishment in the delta region \"of deepwater ponds rearing several species of fish.\" [Emphasis in original] Proper field studies would have shown that the area’s soil was not suitable for these grandiose, large- scale schemes. The UN \"experts\" could have learned something from local wisdom. Hancock reported: Meanwhile, not far away, a group of \"un-aided\" smal lholders who had es tablished their own much less ambitious ponds in the wetlands of the Lake Manzalah area were in no need of any expensive high-tech \"solut ions\"; far from having problem s they were successfully harvestin g 27,000 tonnes of fish annuall y at no cost to Western tax- p a y ers.23"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Bankrolling Tyranny, Socialism There is scarcely a tyrant anywhe re in the world who hasn’t bene fited handsomely from UN handouts. Graham Hancock lists many exampl es, including Mobutu Sese Seku of Zaire and Jean-Claude \"Baby Doc\" Duvalier of Haiti. According to the 1987 World Bank Atlas , Zaire was ranked as the eighth poorest country in the world.24 The main reason this is so is dictator Mobutu, whos e brutal police state disc ourages private investment and entrepreneurial activity. Mobutu himself, however, has become one of the richest men in the world, with an estimated personal net wo rth of over $3 billion, which he has stolen from his own people and the taxpayers of the West.25 Since launching this world- class grand larceny spree in 1965, the \"Butcher of Za ire\" has been showere d with UN aid and IMF loans. In the 1986-87 period alone, Mobutu was the recipient of $570 million in new IMF loans, despite having defaulted on previous loans. N ext to Mobutu, Haiti’s Duvaliers we re pikers but still managed to expropriate tens of millions o f dollars of public funds for their pe rsonal use while the vast majority of their subjects lived in abject p overty. All the while, they were developing a hor rible record on human ri ghts that matched the p erformance of some of the worl d ’s more infamous despot s. Graham Hancock noted: Interestingly enough, however, Ha iti was a major recipient of foreign aid throughout the Duvalier era — with the United States, Canada, West Germany and France prominent amongst the bilateral donors and with the Wo rld Bank, FAO, WHO, UNDP, and UNICEF the most notable of the multilat erals. With all these \"assister s\" on the scene, a question has to be asked: Did the ruin of the Haitian poor occur in spite of foreign aid, or because of it? 26 [Emphasis in original] Indeed, the same question ha s to be asked regarding the ruin of scores of countries. The answer is not p leasant. Moreover, when one sees in this ruination a recurring pattern of foreign ai d -caused calamities and crises, always leading to more loss of free dom and ever greater concentration of power in government, and when one observe s the same individuals again and again implementing the same disastrous policies with the same tragic results in one country after another and with these same individuals and instit utions benefiting from the misery they ar e inflicting, then a whole host of questions b eg to be asked. The foremost of which is: Is it po ssible that the UN foreign aid officials and the bankers who have been involved in these re peated and colossal catastrophes ar e so incompetent and incapable o f learning from their numerous mistak es that they continue to make the same blunders out of shee r ignorance? To believe that simple incompetence is responsible for these disaster s is to stretch credulity beyond all reason. These are some of the brightest men in the world, with all the advantages of the best education money can buy. They have armies of a dvisors and technicians — \"the best and the brightest\" — to plot and plan each move they make. They have had, addi tionally, the benefit of the warnings of a host o f independent expert analysts, from all political and ideologi cal stripes, who have repeatedly condemned these programs for the fra udulent schemes they are. One individual who has rese arched this issue very extensively ove r many years and who has argued very trenchantly against multilateral and bilateral \"aid \" programs is British economist Peter T. Bauer. Afte r two decades of critical examination of Third Worl d economies, Lord Bauer, one of the world’s most distin g uished develo p ment economists, concluded:"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The central argument for foreign aid has remain ed that without it Third World countries cannot progress at a reasonable ra te, if at all. But not only is such aid patently not required for development: it has tended to obstruct de velopment more than it has promoted it. External donations have never b een necessary for the developm ent of any society anywhere. Economic achievement depends on personal, cultura l, social and political factors, that is people’s own faculties, motivations and mores, th eir institutions and th e policies of rulers. In short, economic achievement depends on the conduct of people and their governments. It diminishes the people of the Third World to suggest that, although they crave for material progress, unlike the West they cannot achieve it without external doles.27 American philosopher-economist-theologian David Chilton, in Productive Christians in an Age of Guilt- Manipulators , his powerful riposte to Ronald J. Sider’s redistributionist economics, cogently : The government-to-government tran sfer of tax receipts is not conducive to the development of a market-oriented society; i ndeed, it is a denial of it. Mo reover, it positively encourages the growth of statism and the politici zation of life in recipient countries. Foreign aid simply turns the recipients into \"little Soviets.\" ... Like other bureaucracies, multi national aid organiza tions and their staffs have two main goals in life: spend the mone y, and increase the budget (as much as two-thirds of an aid organization’s budget will be spent on \"admin istrative costs\").28 [Emphasis in original] On the left too, we have very devastating criti ques of the aid fiascos by reputable scholars. The September 1987 issue of Brit ain’s Keynesian-socialist Economic Journal , for instance, carried a withering blast at the World Bank authored by three British economis ts: Paul Mosley, John Hudson, and Sara Horrell. After exhaustive st atistical analyses of Bank projects around the globe, they concluded, \"empirically we have found it impo ssible to establish any statistically significant correlation between aid and the growth rate of GN P in developing countries.\" Moreover, the economists said: The apparent inability of de velopment aid over more than 20 years to provide a net increment to overall growth in the Third Worl d must give the donor co mmunity, as it gives us, cause for grave concern. Even \"liberal\" Newsweek (a principal CFR transmission belt) ad mitted in a 1990 survey of foreign aid p rograms that aid ultimately hurts Third World countries because it \"tends to prop up incompetent governments or subsidize economies so th ey can never sta nd on their own.\"29 Perhaps the most damning indictment of the UN’s so -called aid programs has come from author Graham Hancock, who would probably describe himself politically as a libera l. After examining repeated cases of the most destructive and unconscionable policies, he wrote in Lords of Poverty : \"UNICEF, UNHCR, and the World Food Programme et al . do indeed deliver reli ef supplies during emer gencies; the quality, timeliness and relevance of these items, however, as we have se en ... often leave a great deal to be desired.\"30 The totality of the record of these mult ilateral agencies led hi m to the following very negative and bitter conclusion: Of course, the u g l y realit y is that most p oor p eo p le in most p oor countries most of the time"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"never receive or even make contact with aid in any tangible sh ape or form: whether it is present or absent, increased or decreased, are t hus issues that are simply irrelevant to the ways in which they conduct thei r daily lives.

This little, furthermore, is then used thoughtlessly, or malici ously, or irresponsibly by those in power — who have no mandate fr om the poor, who do not consult with them and who are utterly indifferent to their fate. Small wonder, then, that the effects of aid are so often vicious and destructiv e for the most vulnerable me mbers of human society.31 [Emphasis in original] Even if the UN’s aid agencies a nd programs were as wonderfully ef fective as they would have us b elieve, our continued membership i n, and support of, an institution de dicated to our destruction would remain unconscionable. The new globa l superstate rising behind the fa cade of UN beneficence presents a mortal danger to the independence and liberty of people in all lands, regardless of what ever appeals to compassion and claims to charity its public relation s wizards can concoct. We need not jeopardize ou r freedom in order to assist those ar ound the world who are truly in need.

They offer ade quate alternatives for channeling our charity to those in need. In most cases, they do so far more effectively and wi th far lower overhead and corruption than their governmenta l counterparts, either national or interna tional. Private charit able groups must rely on persuasion for their funding; go vernmental agencies — includi ng the UN’s — depend on coercion.

To back up such an unflattering characteriza tion today, they could point to the confusing and combustible melange of tongues, cultures, ideologies, and politics for which the \"house o f p eace\" has become justly famous. The UN, along with its pr ograms and policies, is becoming ever more worthy of comparison to the Tower of Babel, as rampant idolatry and militant paganism thoroughly p ermeate the organization. The United Nations is steadily becoming the cente r of a syncretic new wo rld religion, a weird and diabolical convergence of New Age mysticism, pant heism, aboriginal animis m, atheism, communism, socialism, Luciferian occultism, apostate Chri stianity, Islam, Taoism, Buddhism, and Hinduism. The devotees and apostles of this new faith include th e kind of strange admixtur e of crystal worshipers, astrologers, radical feminists, envi ronmentalists, cabalists, human potentialists, Eastern mystics, pop p sychologists, and \"liberal\" clergym en one would normally tend to asso ciate with the off-beat, sandals- and-beads counterculture of the 1960s.

Go East, Young Man During the 1960s and ’70s, droves of disenchanted intellectuals a nd alienated youth from Europe an d America trekked to India and other points East seeking \"enlightenment ,\" \"wisdom,\" and \"truth\" from an endless array of gurus, swamis, yogi s, and other \"illuminated master s.\" Most never realized as they b egan their search that they were following in the footsteps of one who a century earlier had laid the groundwork for the present cult explosion, and whose wo rk is central to the spiritual character of the United Nations today. That person is Helena PeBlavats ky (1831-1891), widely revered as th e high priestess of the New Age movement, who founded the Theosophical Society in New York in 1875. In her scrapbook for that yea r she wrote: The Christians and scientists mu st be made to respect their I ndian betters.

The Great Serpent of the Garden of Eden and the \"Lord God\" are identical.7 In the Blavatsky scheme of things , Satan is God the Creator, the Savi or, the Father; and Jesus Christ is \"the first born brother of Sa tan.\" She explains it thus: Satan, the Serpent of Genesis, is the real creator and benefa ctor, the Father of Spiritual mankind. For it is he ... who opened the eyes of the automaton (Ada m) created by Jehovah, as alleged.... An adversary to Je hovah ... he still remains in Esot eric Truth the ever loving messenger ... who conferred on us spiritua l instead of physical immortality.8 Blavatsky, who had spent several years in India a nd Tibet, claimed to have experience with astral p rojection and the ability to co mmunicate with the spirit worl d. She claimed to have written I sis Unveiled and her three-volume magnum opus The Secret Doctrine under the direction of the \"Masters o f Wisdom,\" Tibetan holy men who comm unicated telepathically with her in England from the Himalayas. After she passed away in 1891, the ma ntle of leadership for the worl dwide theosophical movement fell to Annie Besant, a militant femini st and a member of the Fabian So cialist Society of England. A close friend of George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, and ot her leading Fabians, Besa nt was well-placed to spread theosophical thought in very in fluential circles. An indefatigable revolutionist and prolific writer, she enthusiastically joined in revolutionary st reet riots and penned numer ous volumes of occultic writings to add to those of Blavatsky. Besant was followed by Alice Bail ey, who together with her husband, Foster Bailey, constructed much of the foundation of what is now known as New Age religion.

The Lucis Trust, established by the Baileys in 1922, c ontinues to serve as the umbrella organization for a profusion o f globalist/New Age/occult organizat ions and programs that are key catalysts of the emerging new world religion. These include the Arcane School, Worl d Goodwill, Triangles, Lucis Publishing, Lucis Productions, Lucis Trust Libraries, and the New Group of World Servers. UN New Age Network According to the Lucis Trust, \"World Goodwill is recognised ... at the Un ited Nations as a Non- governmental Organisation\" and is \"represented at regular briefing sessions at the United Nations in N ew York and Geneva.\"9 The \"regular weekly broa dcasts of talks given at World Goodwill Forum meetings and programs produced by Lucis Productions \" in London and New York are beamed by Radio For Peace International in Engl ish, Spanish, German, and French, on shortwave, to a \"worldwide audience\" from the UN University fo r Peace in Costa Rica. According to spokesmen at the Lucis Trust, all people of good will, whether they realize it or not, belong to the Ne w Group of World Servers (NGWS) who will bring about \"spiri tual unfoldment\" and \"lead humanit y into a new age of peace and p lenty.\"10 \"Humanity is not following a haphazard or unchart ed course — there is a Plan,\" say the Lucis theosophists. And, \"Men of goodwil l who co-operate form part of the New Group of World Servers which is working to implement the Plan.\" The \"Plan\" involves a \"spiri tual Hierarchy of the planet\" and the building of a \"synthetic unity\" that will be ma nifested in an \"inner centre or subjective world government, whose members are respons ible for the spread of those id eals and ideas which have led humanity onwards from age to age.\" The leaders of the New Group of Wo rld Servers \"provide the vision and mould public opinion.\" But there is yet a higher class of adepts. \"Behind these leaders and the co- operating men of goodwill,\" we learn, \"are the Custodians of the Plan, ‘the inner spiritual Government of the Planet.’\"11 According to these possessors of esot eric wisdom, \"People in the world at this time can be divided into four groups\": First the uninformed masses.... They are, ho wever, enough developed to respond to the mental suggestion and control of more advanced people. Second, the middle classes — both higher and lower.... [B]ecause they can read and discuss and are beginning to think, they form th e most powerful element in any nation. Third, the thinkers everywhere.... They are stea dily influencing world affairs — sometimes for good and sometimes for selfish ends. Fourth, the New Group of World Servers. These are the people who are building the new world order.... They own to no creed, save the creed of Brotherhood, based on the One Life. They recognise no authority save that of their own souls.12 [Emphasis added] The \"Enlightened Ones\" Ah, yes. But if one progresses thr ough these circles-within-circles of higher planetary consciousness, one eventually may reach the exalted plane of \"the Hierarchy.\" Examin ing the works of these individuals, we discover:"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Behind this four-fold division of humanity st and those Enlightened Ones whose right and privilege it is to watch over human evolution and to guide the destinies of men. In the West we call them Christ and His disciples.... They are also known as the Agents of God, or the Hierarchy of liberated souls, who seek ceaselessly to aid and help humanity.13 N o doubt you will now rest easier know ing that your \"destiny\" and \"evol ution\" have been entrusted to the providential care of the planet’s \"Enlightened Ones.\" But surely, you ask, no one actually believes this arcane gibberish? W ould that this were true. The N GWS boasts that its follower s \"will be able to swing into activ ity at any moment such a weight o f thought and such a momentous public opinion that they will eventually be in a position definitely to affect world affairs.\"14 To be sure , that represents more an aspirati on than a true representation of thei r p resent level of influence. But one cannot survey the New Age, occult, sa tanist, wicca, and hedoni st phenomena all around us without recognizing that if these tre nds continue, the day will not be far off when occult forces will be able to make good on some of thos e claims. As G. K. Chesterton once observed, \"If man will not believe in God, the danger is not that he will believe in nothing, but that he will believe in anything.\" Messiahs and Megalomaniacs On April 25, 1982, all across th e planet, millions of pairs of eyes bl inked in disbelief at the headlines they saw on full-page advertisem ents in their daily newspapers . \"THE CHRIST IS NOW HERE,\" trumpeted the massive ad camp aign in major newspapers ar ound the world. \"Throughout history,\" p roclaimed the announcement, \"hum anity’s evolution has been guided by a group of enlightened men, the Masters of Wisdom,\" a \"Spiritual Hierarchy\" at the center of which \"sta nds the World Teacher, Lord Maitreya, known by Christians as the Christ.\"15 This same individual, said th e ad, is awaited also by Jews, Moslems, Buddhists, and Hindus, though he is known by these believers respectively as the Messiah, Imam Mahdi, the Fifth Buddha, or Krishna. According to the ad proclamation, \"the Christ\" was at that moment living in the world and would \"within the next two months\" reve al his identity to all mankind. Th e advertising campaign coincided with the beginning of a worldwide speaking tour by one Benjamin Creme, a Br itish theosophist and a spokesman for \"the Christ .\" In various interviews and speeches, Creme expl ained that in speaking o f \"the Christ,\" he did not mean Jesus Christ but the \"Master of Wisdom,\" of whom Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, and others are disciple s. Creme’s messianic campaign wa s coordinated by his New Age religious organization, the Tara Center, from its offices in Lo s Angeles, New York, and London. In his 1980 book, The Reappearance of the Christ and the Mast ers of Wisdom , Creme left no doubt about his spiritual debt to Blavatsky and Bailey. In its pages, he prophesied: When the physical structures of human living are reconstructe d ... the Christ will reveal to man an entirely new aspect of Reality.... The Ancient Myst eries will be restored, the Mystery Schools reopened, and a great expansi on of man’s awareness of himself and his purpose and destiny will become possible.... Eventually a new world religion will be inaugurated, which will be a fusion and synthesis of the approach of the East and th e approach of the West. The Ch rist will bring together, not simply Christianity and Buddhism, but the conc ept of God transcende nt — outside of His creation in man and all creation."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"It will be seen to be possible to hold both a pproaches at the same time, and they will be brought together in a new scie ntific religion based on the My steries; on Initiation; on Invocation.... Gradually, Christianity, Buddhism and other religions will wither away-slowly, as the people die out of them, as th e new religion gains its adhe rents and exponents, and is gradually built by humanity.16 \"Christ\" and the UN According to Creme, \"The new religion will manife st itself through organiza tions like Masonry\"17 and will inaugurate a \"new world order\" to be headed by the United Nations: At the head of several of the governments of the world and in the great world agencies, like the United Nations’ agencies, there will be either a Master or at least a third degree Initiate. So the great international agenci es will be under the direct c ontrol of a high member of the Hierarchy.... The Christ Himself wi ll have a great deal to do — with the release of energies; the work of Initiation, as the Initiator, th e Hierophant, at the first two Initiations; and stimulating and inspiring the form ation of the New World Religion.18 In the Tara Center’s Network News letter of October 1987, New Age de votees were told: \"In the coming years the United Nations is destined to be the world’s main focal poi nt for the practical application o f love, brotherhood, justice and shar ing. We can help bring this about through our support.\" This support is essential because when \"all the impossible solutions have been eliminated, it will become clear that the only answer to our problems is the U.N.\" (Emphasis added) This being the case, a cosmic prayer was offered for the revered institution: May the Peace and the Blessings of the Holy Ones pour fort h over the worlds — rest upon the United Nations, on the work and the workers, protecting, purifying, energizing and strengthening.19 No-Show But Creme’s \"Maitreya — th e Christ\" failed to materialize as pr omised. So it would be reasonable to expect that Creme, his me ssiah, and his UN propaganda were all di scredited and labeled irrelevant. But we do not live in the age of reas onableness. Creme remains a leading light of the vast New Age network, and his occult gospel can be found emanating from numerous UN conference s and programs where the p ower elite of the Club of Rome, Aspen Institute, Council on Fore ign Relations, World Federalists, World Bank, etc. mingle with Ne w Agers of every description. The Rio Earth Summit A prime example of this dangerous lunacy could be found at the J une 1992 UN Earth Summit in Brazil, where both the official United Nations Conference on Envir onment and Development (UNCED) p rogram and the Global Forum \"pe oples summit\" featured a melding of pagan aboriginal rites, eco- b abble, and an ecumenical hodgepodge of spiritual tenets from East and West to form an incoherent universal \"faith.\" In his o p enin g address to the UNCED p lenar y session, Earth Summit Secretar y -General Maurice Stron g"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"directed the world’s attention to the Declaration of the Sacred Earth Gathering, which was part of the p re-Summit ceremonies. \"[T]he change s in behavior and direction calle d for here,\" said Strong, \"must be rooted in our deepest spiritual, moral and ethical values.\"20 Accordi ng to the declaration, the ecological crisis \"transcends all national, religious, cultur al, social, political, a nd economic boundaries.... The responsibility of each human being today is to choose be tween the force of darkness and the force o f light. We must therefore transform our attitudes and values, and adopt a renewed respect for the superio r law of Divine Nature.\"21 Nutty Goings-On Delegates and members of the news media were re ferring to the Rio Decl aration and the 800-page blueprint for governme nt action known as Agenda 21 as \"sacred\" texts. Sena tor Al Gore, who led the U.S. Senate delegation to Rio, reite rated his call for a new spiritual relationship between man and earth. Shirley MacLaine dropped in to lend the nutty ramblings of her psychic spirituality to the conference. A centerpiece of the Global Forum ope ning ceremony was the Viking ship Gaia , named for the Gree k goddess of earth. At the culmination of that program , a group calling itself the \"Sacred Drums of the Earth\" struck up a solemn cadence. The ceremony program said that th e drummers would \"maint ain a continuous heartbeat near the official site of the Earth Summit, as part of a ri tual for the healing of our Earth to be felt by those who are deciding Earth’s fate .\" The Forum ceremony closed, appr opriately, with Jamaican reggae singer Jimmy Cliff performing the song, \"The Rivers of Babylon.\" On the eve of the opening of UNCED, a midnight-to- dawn homage to the \"Fem ale Planet\" was held on Leme Beach. After dancing all night, the worshipers followed a Brazilian tribal high priestess to the water’s edge where they offered fl owers and fruits to \"Iemanje, mae orixa, mother of the powers, queen of the seas,\" and then invoke d the blessings of the sea goddess upon the sum’s deliberations. At the first plenary session, Uri Mari, Israel’s Mi nister of the Environment, issued a New Ten Commandments on Environment a nd Development.22 No one bothere d to ask him what was wrong with the original Ten Commandments . Was the Creator of th is planet somehow negl igent, or so ignorant of environmental concerns, that his original decalogue is ecologically de ficient? As we recall, the first commandment states: \"I am the Lord thy God.... T hou shalt have no other gods before Me.\" That, understandably, makes many environm entalists uncomfortable. \"Thou sh alt not steal,\" and \"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s goods\" can al so be troublesome to those whos e plans call for expropriating the p roperty of others. The Union for Natural Environment Protection, an environmental group based in Sao Leopoldo, Brazil, declared the following about the work of the sum mit: \"A world-wide citize ns’ movement is born around the UN system and will be in the years ahead a central focal point fo r the New World Order which Alice Bailey wrote about many decades ago and which is going to be politically free, socially fair, economically efficient and e nvironmentally sustainable. \"23 That pretty well tie s it all together: the UN, Alice Bailey’s New Age re ligion, the new world orde r, and environmentalism. True, there were also \"Christian\" participants in the summit celebra tions. Ministers from the World Council of Churches and Catholic clerics such as Dom Helder Camarra (known as Brazil’s Re d Archbishop because of hi s blatantly pro-communis t sympathies) could be found amidst the cymbal- clanging Hare Krishnas, diapered swamis, saffron-r obed gurus, and witch doctors in loincloths. But they were there because of thei r affinity for an ecumenical \"spirit\" that promotes an anti-Christian an d s y ncretistic blend of Christianit y and p a g anism."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Bible Out, Lucifer In Many militant environmentalist s make no bones about their animu s toward Christianity. Jose Lutzenberger, former Brazilian Minister of th e Environment, decried the foundation of modern education which he argued was \"based on the Judeo- Christian philosophy of an evil world which needs to be subdued by man.\" He insisted: \"We have to teach our children to dialogue with their world.\" And, \"We need a moral revolution, and should learn from indigenous people who have successfully integrated our species in to the en tire symphony of nature.\"24 This blaming of the biblical world outlook for the world’s environmental problem s and the romanticizing of aboriginal religions and life-styles were rife among the summit ecocrazies. Bible bashing is another practice th at has become common in environm ental circles, and its tone has b ecome increasingly shrill. Tom Hayden, for instance, th at pillar of 1960s spirit ual rectitude, has taken up the crusade by teaching a colleg e course about \"Environment a nd Spirituality.\" \"He wants to convince people,\" reports the Los Angeles Times , \"that Judeo-Christian ethics, which teach that man has the God-given right to ‘subdue’ the Earth, are the r oot of many of today’s environmental problems.\"25 The environmental gospel according to \"We are all Vietcong\" Hayden holds that \"organized religion has either ignored or rationalized th e exploitation of the natural e nvironment for 2,000 years.\" Reverend Tom’s 16-week course is described by the Times as \"a wide-ranging survey of New Age philosophies and Eastern sp irituality.\"26 N ew Age philosopher William Irwi n Thompson is even more empha tic. The former professor o f humanities from MIT and Syracuse University, and founder of the infl uential Lindisfarne Association, has said: We have now a new spirituality, what ha s been called the New Age movement. The planetization of the esoteric has been going on for some ti me.... This is now beginning to influence concepts of politics and community in ecology.... This is the Gaia [Mother Earth] politique ... planetary culture.27 According to this illuminated master, the age of \"t he independent sovereign st ate, with the sovereign individual in his private property [is] over, just as the Christ ian fundamentalist da ys are about to be over.\"28 A former trustee of the As pen Institute for Humanistic Studi es and a member of the advisory council of Planetary Citizens, is no lightweight in the movement. Maurice Strong sits on the board o f directors and serves as director of fi nance of the Lindisfarne Center. Th e Lindisfarne Cent er is located in Man’s historic Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Di vine and its work is \"made possible by grants from the Lilly Endowment, the Rockefeller Brothe rs Fund, and the Rockefeller Foundation.\"29 The Lindisfarne Institute lists among it s faculty members eco-radical Amor y Lovins and Luciferian adept and New Age author David Spangler. So, what great wisdom is imparted at this Rockefel ler-funded institute of higher learning? We can gain some appreciation by reading Mr . Spangler’s books, such as Reflections on the Christ , wherein we find: Lucifer, like Christ, stands at the door of man’s consciousness and knocks. If man says, \"Go away because I do not like what you represent, I am afraid of you,\" Lucifer will play tricks on that fellow. If man says, \"Come in, and I will give to you the tr eat of my love and understanding and I will upl ift you in the light and presence of the Christ, my outflow,\" then Lucifer becomes something else again. He becomes the being who carries that great treat, the ultimate treat, the li g ht of wisdom."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The reason man has come to fear Lucifer is not so much that he represents evil as because he represents experience whic h causes us to grow and to move beyond the levels where we have been.... Lucifer is literally the angel of experience.30 Many Groups, Same Goal Spangler, Thompson, Strong, and a host of other notables (Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, Si r Edmund Hillary, Peter Ustinov, Linus Pauling, Kurt Vonnegut, Leonard Bernstein, John Updike, Isaac Asimov, Pete Seeger) are listed as original endorsers of the world-government -promoting Planetary Citizens. Founded by New Age luminary and former UN consultant Donald Ke ys, and presided over fo r many years by the late Norman Cousins (CFR), the Planetary Citizens organization has marshaled the p restige of many influential world figures to support expansion of UN power and in stitutions. Keys, openly a disciple of Alice Bailey, calls the United Nations \"the nexus of emerging pl anetary values\" and expresses the hope that it will establish a \"planetary manageme nt system.\"31 In order to help speed that day, Planetary Citizens is \"in cons ultative status with the Econo mic and Social Council of the United .\"32 Another original endorser of Planet ary Citizens and its \"H uman Manifesto\" (not to be confused with The H umanist Manifesto ) was Aurelio Peccei, founde r of the Club of Rome. K nown more for its role in launching \"no growth\" environmenta lism in the 1970s, the Club has tu rned increasingly \"spiritual\" in recent years. Its mo st recent report, The First Global Revolution , takes special pains to stress this new interest. \"In these difficult and complex times,\" say the report’s authors, \"we begin to realize that the p ursuit of wisdom is the essentia l challenge that faces humanity.\"33 And where do they go for wisdom? Sprinkled thr oughout the book are numerous quotations from sacred texts, philosophers, poets , psychologists, historians , and sages. Hindus, Buddhi sts, aborigines, Taoists, humanists, even Aztec cannibals are reverently re presented. Their wisdom includes adherence to the Blavatsky mandate holding that monot heism, Christianity, Islam, a nd Judaism are either excluded o r denigrated. Typical of the quotations highlighted in special boxes in the book’s te xt is this \"hymn\" from India p laced alongside a disc ussion about mining: Whatever I dig from thee, Eart h, may that have quick growth again. O purifier, may we not injure thy vitals or thy heart.34 And sounding very much in tune wi th current New Age thou ght is the Club of Rome’s discovery that the \"spiritual and ethical dimension is no longer an object of scorn or indifference; it is perceived as a necessity that should lead to a new humanism .\"35 (Emphasis added) Moreover, we learn: The global society we are headi ng towards cannot emerge unless it drinks from the source of moral and spiritual values which stake out its dynamics. Beyond cultures, religions and philosophies, there is in human beings a thirst for freedom, aspirations to overcome one’s limits, a quest for a beyond that seem s ungraspable and is often unnamed.36 We are witnessing here a very important phenomenon, what the Ne w Agers call a \"paradigm shift.\" After several centuries of warring with religion in general and Christ ianity in particular, \"science\" is now being reconciled with faith. Increasingly, infidel scientists w ho once expressed supreme confidence in \"reeking tube and iron shard\" (as Kipling referred to their t echnological idolatry ) are acknowledging the deficienc y of their \"dust that builds on dust....\" The y seek to su pp l y g ods of their own choosin g . And"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Blavatsky’s gods of the East are in finitely more compatible with th eir plans than th e Judeo-Christian God. Which may explain the Club of Rome’s heavy reliance on the \"spiritual values\" of India, as expressed in the following prayer: May the divine Spirit protect us all; may we work together wi th great energy; may our study be fruitful and thorough; may th ere be no hatred between us.37 Aum, Peace, Peace, Peace, Peac e— Vedic Prayer [3000 B.C.] Temple of Understanding One of the principal channels through which this tilt toward Oriental sp iritualism has been spread is the Temple of Understanding, located at the same Cathedral of St. John the Divine that houses the Lindisfarne Luciferians. Launched in the early 1960s as the \"spiritual c ounterpart of the United N ations,\" its founding sponsors in cluded the following odd assortment of Establishm ent Insiders, socialists, humanists, communist fronters, religious figures, and entertainment celebrities: John D. Rockefeller IV; then-Secre tary of Defense Robert S. McNama ra; Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger; IBM president Thomas J. Watson; Socialis t Party leader Norman Thomas; Eleanor Roosevelt; Time-Life president James A. Linen; homosexual au thor Christopher Isherwood; columnist Max Lerner; and entertainer Jack Benny. The Temple organization, which works closely with the UN Secretariat, the World Council of Churches, and the World Conference on Religion and Peace, is currently aiding and abetting Columbus- b ashers with its sponsorship of the UN’s Year of the I ndigenous People. In 1993, it will be promoting the syncretic \"Interfaith Movement\" with its centennial celebration of the World’s Parliament of Religions. This favor toward Eastern mysticism was given a bi g boost in UN circles durin g the 1970s and ’80s by N ew Age VIP Robert Muller, who served as an assistant secretary- general at the United Nations. Muller, author of the influential book New Genesis: Shaping a Global Spirituality , believes, \"If Christ came b ack to earth, his first visit would be to the United Nations to see if his dream of human oneness and brotherhood had come true. He would be happy to see representatives from all nations.\"38 Of course, when Muller talks about \"Christ,\" he is not spea king in the Christian tr adition, but in that o f Bailey, Creme, and Spangler. Mull er openly supports Crem e and has delivered le ctures at the Lucis Trust’s Arcane School. And in typical an imist fashion, he refers to \"our brethren the animals, our sisters the flowers.\"39 Who Is Maurice Strong? Undoubtedly one of the most influential hands guiding the UN’s unfolding spiritua lity over the past two decades has been that of the grand poobah of envi ronmentalism, Maurice St rong. An article from the May 1990 issue of West magazine40 sheds considerable light on the man who has been reverently dubbed by some \"the custodian of the planet.\" Journalist Da niel Wood’s research for the article include d spending a week with Strong and his wife Hanne at th eir Baca Grande spiritual center in Colorado’s San Luis Valley. While there, he witnessed many strange and troubling things. According to Wood, the Strongs’ goal at \"the Baca,\" as they refer to their compound, \"is nothi ng less than to alter, utterly, the history of the world.\" They see th eir mystic commune serving \"as a model for the way the world should be — and, they say, must be — if humankind is to survive.\" The idea for the stran g e venture at \"the B aca\" took root in 1978, re p orted Wood, \"when a m y sterious"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"man visited Hanne bearing a prophesy of the coming apocalypse. The dr eam grew amid omens that defy belief. It has been nourished by th e Strongs’ friends, such people as Rockefeller, [former Canadian p remier] Trudeau, the Dalai Lama, and Shirley MacLaine.\" Another of the Strongs’ friends, Najeeb Halaby (CFR), former chairman of Pa n American and father of the Queen of Jordan, has built an Islamic ziggurat at the Baca. The first groups to join the Strongs in setting up operations at the desert site were the Aspen Institute and the Lindisfarne Association. Mrs. Strong is a remarkably curious individual. \"H anne knew from earliest childhood,\" said Wood, \"that she was different, that she had my stical abilities.... She could recall past lives.\" On one occasion, Wood recounted: \"Hanne invites me to join her in her daily ritual of singing th e sun down.... She chants he r mantra, an ancient Vedic text, she explains, th at goes back to the da wn of civilization.\" But even more disturbing than Ha nne’s occult mysticis m are Maurice’s spirit ual experiences. Strong allegedly told Wood of a freakish omen he had expe rienced while walking with famed author and public television icon Bill Moyers: \"We’d be en walking, talking, heading back to my parked car. Suddenly, this bush — some sagebrush — erupted in flames in front of us! It just burst into flames.\" Pagan Spiritualism With individuals like these leading the charge, the UN’s pagan spirit ualism will grow ever more blatant. There will be many more documents like the UN report entitled The New International Economic Order: A Spiritual Imperative , which brazenly proclaims: [T]oday a new understanding of sp irituality is emerging which re cognizes that all efforts to uplift humanity are spiritual in nature. Alice Bailey said, \"That is spiritual which lies beyond the point of pr esent achievement....\" ... Given this new understa nding of spirituality, the work of the United Nations can be ... seen within the entire evolutionary unfoldment of humanity. The work of the U.N. is indeed sp iritual and holds profound import for the future of civilization.41 It would seem that predicti ons concerning religion made half a century ago in the Rosicrucian Digest are coming to pass. The June 1941 issue of that occu lt journal carried the following prophesy that, tragically, is being fulf illed before our eyes: What then does the future hold for religion? We predict a mystical-panth eism as the religion of tomorrow. The central doctrine of this religion will be that a Universal Intelligence as a series or concatenations of cau ses, creative and perfect in it s whole, pervades everywhere and everything. One major effect of this religious conversion, the Rosi crucian oracle predicted, is that \"the multiplicity of social states, countries, or nations will cease to be.\" Nations would be replaced by \"the one United World State.\" The occultists are correct in noting that the mystical-panthei sm they advocate will, i f widely accepted, lead to a collectivist world state. And there are far too few Americans who understand the direct cause-and-effect re lationship between the two. Pantheist Connection \"Pantheism is a favorite doctrine of collectivists,\" not es one authority on occult deception, Fathe r Clarence Kelly, \"because ... it of fers a concept of man which, on religious grounds, subordinates the individual to the collective.\"42 Since \"God\" in this belief s y stem is not the transcendent, p ersonal God"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"of the Bible, but an impersonal, immanent force that pervades al l things, then all things — the universe, you, me, the rock, the tree — are \"God.\" In this pagan world view, man is not a special creation of the one, true God, to whom, ultimately, he is accountable. Nor is he endow ed by his Creator with intrinsic, unalienable rights — a nd responsibilities. Thus pantheism \"functions as an effective tool in the subversion of God-centered religion by making religion man-centered, and thereby giving a religious sanction to the doctrines and programs of political collectivism. At the same time, pantheism can be used as a stage in bri nging people from theism to atheistic materialism. In religion, pa ntheism is most often expressed as Naturalism — ‘the doctrine that religious truth is derived fr om nature, not revelation....’\"43 It was just such neo-Paga nism that paved the way for the totali tarian collectivism of the Third Reich. The Nazi high priesthood — Hitler, Himmler, Rahn, Rosenberg, He ss, Feder, Sebot, et al. — were ardent theosophists, and their esoter ic societies (the Thule, Vril, Seek ers of the Grail) were steeped in the same occultism and pantheism so prevalent in today’s New Ag e and environmental movements.44 Hitler’s paganism sought to create a nationalist-so cialist new world order. And even though it was militantly anti-Christian, numerous Christian churches succumbed to the Nazi scheme and most were captured through subversion and accomm odation, not through outright persecution. Today, all people of good will recognize th e diabolically evil nature of the Fuehrer’s failed regime. What is now desperately needed is a widespread recognition of the fact that the neo-pagan, internationalist-socialist new wo rld order being promoted by and through the United Nations is as militantly anti-Christian, as malevolently totalitarian, and as satani cally evil as that jacktyranny of ou r recent past. This time, its headquarters is not in Berlin, but in New York City. Notes 1.

The Single European Act of 1986, agreed to by the 12 member states that year, called for the establis hment of \"an area without internal frontiers, in which the fr ee movement of goods, persons, services, a nd capital is ensure d.\" With progress toward a single market, \" ... European industry will be able to ach ieve greater economies of scale,\" said U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasu ry M. Peter McPherson (CFR). He made this remark in an address in 1988 to the Institute for Interna tional Economics, a group led by fellow one-worlder C. Fred Bergsten (CFR, TC). McPherson continued: The demands of competition wi ll spur technological innovati on and greater productivity. The program can help stimulate growth and em ployment, reduce consumer prices, and raise standards of living throughout Europe. The force that will drive this transformation is opportunity — the oppor tunity to compete in a larger and freer marketplace.1 Economic analyst and former Republican Congressman from Texas Dr. Ron Paul saw the same developments in a completely di fferent light. Long an ardent cham pion of free-market policies, he warned that the movement toward European \"union\" and \"integration\" is a statist sc heme cloaked in free-market rhetoric that is likely to \"produce a m onster.\" \"International statis ts have long dreamed of a world currency and a world central bank,\" wr ote Dr. Paul in the October 1988 issue of The Free Market , published by the Ludwig von Mises In stitute. \"Now it looks as if their dream may come true.\" Ron Paul’s essay, entitled \"The Coming Wo rld Central Bank,\" went on to say: Euro p ean g overnments have tar g eted 1992 for abolishin g individual Euro p ean currencies"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"and replacing them with the Eu ropean Currency Unit, the Ecu. Next they plan to set up a European central bank. The next step is the merger of the Fe deral Reserve, the European central bank and the Bank of Japa n into a one world central bank.... The European central bank (ECB) will be mode led after the Federal Reserve. Like the Fed in 1913, it will have the institutional appearan ce of decentralization, but also like the Fed it will be run by a cartel of big bankers in collusion with politi cians at the expense of the public. Time and events have proven Dr. Pa ul’s assessment, not McPherson’s, to have been co rrect. The much- touted \"free trade/free market reform s\" were merely bait laid out to entice Europeans into the trap o f what is designed eventually to become an all-pow erful, supranational gove rnment. This European regional government would later be merged into a world government under the United Nations. The agreements reached by the leaders of the European Community who met in M aastricht, Netherlands in December 1991 are now taking them down this road. Major concessions of national sovereignty given b y the 12 member states (Belgium, Denmark, France , Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain) to the socialist-dominated European Parliament and to the Eurocrats in Brussels are unde rway. Foremost among these are the commitments to establish a single currency, the ECU, and a European Central Bank. The members also agreed to yield more defense and foreign policy control to th e Western European Union. The Socialist parties, which contro l a majority (260) of the 518 votes in the European Parliament, are certainly not going to promote free- market reforms. Nor are those re forms likely to come from the European Community Commission or the Council of Ministers, the in stitutions holding the EC’s real legislative and executive powers. Those instituti ons have been dominated by socialists such as Commission President Jacques Delors, who is lead ing the push for a European central bank, and by members of David Rockefeller’s world-gove rnment-promoting Trilateral Commission. The EC Trilateralists include such influential Eurocrats as Willy De Clercq, Karl-Hei nz Narjes, Carlo Ripa di Meana, Viscount Etie nne Davignon, Raymond Barre, Rene Foch, Jorge Braga de Macedo, Francisco Lucas Pires, Gaston Thorn, Michael O’ Kennedy, Henri Simonet, Simone Veil, and Edmund Wellenstein. These one-worlders are leading the nations of Western Eu rope — their own nations — not only into surrendering national sove reignty to Brussels, but into me rging with the \"former communist\" regimes of Eastern Europe. A study of the evolution of the European Commun ity reveals ominous para llels with the campaign currently underway for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), signed by President George Bush on August 12, 1992. The EC is the model for this and ot her \"common market\" arrangements for Latin America, Asia, and Africa now being promot ed by CFR Establishment figures and their globalist colleagues. EC Emerges From Shad ows of World War I On November 9, 1988, European heads of state and government gathered in solemn ceremony at the Pantheon in Paris to inter the remains of Jean Monne t, the French internationa list who is often called \"the Father of Europe.\" The cele bration marking the centennial of his birth was the crowning highlight of numerous tributes in honor of the pr incipal architect of the Common Market. Jean Omar Marie Gabriel Monnet wa s born in Cognac, the son of a brandy merchant. In 1910, at the age of 20, he was sent to Canada b y his father to o p en new markets for the famil y business. Hookin g u p with"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"the Hudson Bay Company and the Lazard Brothers banking house, two of the Western Hemisphere’s most eminent Establishment companies, the parve nu Frenchman was given entr ee into high British circles of power and soon became the protege of the Anglo-American Insiders. Thus began the mercurial rise of Jean Monnet, who — though lacking even the equivalent of a high school diploma — was to b ecome a renowned wizard of high fi nance, a political mastermind, and a confidant and advisor to p residents and prime ministers. Through the influence of French Fo reign Minister Etienne Clementel, Monnet gained an exclusive and very lucrative contract for shippi ng vital materiel from Canada to France during World War I. Following that war, he won an appointment to the Allied Supreme Economic Council, was made an advisor to the committee preparing the Treaty of Ve rsailles, and was introduced to that closed group of one-worlders around Colonel House that was prepar ing the way for the creation of the League of Nations. In 1919, he became an international figure at the age of 29 th rough his appointment as de puty secretar y-general o f the League. Monnet, the committed internationa list, also became a steadfast so cialist. Monnet biographers Merry and Serge Bromberger wrot e: \"Behind the scenes he helped to arrange the appointme nt of the French Socialist Albert Thomas as head of the Internati onal Labor Office.\"2 They al so record Monnet’s boast: \"I’ve always voted Socialist, except on one occasi on.\"3 That single exception occurred during the 1965 French presidential election when he publicly supported Jean Lecanuet, a champion of a federated Europe. In 1925, Monnet moved to America to accept a partnership with the Blair Foreign Corporation, a New York bank that had done a bonanza busin ess in the \"war effort.\" From th ere he went on to become vice p resident of Transamerica, the giant San Francisco- b ased holding company that owned Bank o f America. At that time there were many cam paigns underway to create a Unite d States of Europe. In 1923, Count Richard N. Coudenhove - Kalergi of Austri a authored his book Pan Europa ; three years later, he organized his first Pan European C ongress in Vienna.4 By the end of the 1920s, branches of the Pan European Union were operating th roughout the continent and Britain. In How Can Europe Survive , a piercing critique of Coudenhove’s Pan European idea, the eminent free- market economist Hans F. Sennholz obs erved that there is no getting around \"the fact that his plan is a s cheme for the attainment of wholesale socialism in Europe .\"5 (Emphasis in orig inal) Nevertheless, Coudenhove’s plan received the support and patronage of many of Europe’s leading statesmen and men of letters, not to mention that of the Anglo-American Establishment. One of Count Coudenhove’s most important disciples was Aristi de Briand, who between 1909 and 1930 was the Socialist Premier of Fran ce 11 times and Minister of Fore ign Affairs 12 times . In 1930, Briand unveiled a plan for \"European Uni on\" that provided for a regional supranational union within the League of Nations.6 It failed not b ecause of antipathy to the idea but largely because of differences o f opinion among the various socialist and integrationist factions over the best means to accomplish the shared goal. That same year, another important apostle of Coudenhove’s Pan Europa, Sir Winston Churchill, wrote an essay entitled \"The United States of Europe\" aimed at winning support for the idea from the American public. It was publishe d in the February 15, 1930 issue of the Saturday Evenin g P ost , one of America’s most popul ar periodicals at that time. Coudenhove spent the devastating y ears of World War II in the Un ited States propagating his Pan Euro p a idea. \"In seekin g to p ersuade America, once she became a belli g erent, to ado p t Euro p ean unit y"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"as one of her war aims,\" said the Count’s colleague and hagiographer Arnold J. Zurcher in The Struggle to Unite Europe, 1940-1958 , \"Count Coudenhove enlisted the coopera tion of certain leading American citizens whom he had interested in his movement some years prior to his enforced wa rtime sojourn.\"7 These \"leading citizens\" — all Establishment heavywei ghts — were: Nicholas Mu rray Butler, president of both Columbia University and the Carnegie E ndowment for Intern ational Peace; Dr . Stephen Duggan, founder and first president of the International In stitute of Education, a completely CFR-dominate d internationalist propaganda operati on; and William C. Bull itt, alternately U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union and to France. With the help of these high-powered patrons, C oudenhove and Zurcher obtaine d positions at New Yor k University where, for the remainder of the war years, they conducted gr aduate seminars devoted exclusively to the need for Euro pean federation. Their CFR contacts aided them greatly in obtaining favorable media coverage. \"The New York press, for example, wa s wholly sympatheti c,\" wrote Zurcher, \"both major morning dailies, The New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune , having given generous space to reporting the Count ’s occasional public utterances and to the efforts of the New Yor k University seminar on federation.\" 8 With the academic re spectability conferred by the NYU seminars and the popular dissemina tion of their ideas by a frie ndly press, said Zurcher, \"For the first time in the twentieth century, the slogan ‘United States of Eu rope’ had become something more than a label fo r hortatory idealism.\"9 While Coudenhove-Kalergi and his si dekick Zurcher labored among the in telligentsia and the captains of industry in New York, Citizen Monnet was shuttling back and fort h between Washington, Paris, and London on trans-Atlantic diplomat ic missions for French Premier Edouard Daladier, President Roosevelt, Prime Mini ster Churchill, and Genera l de Gaulle. It was Monne t who gave Roosevelt the slogan \"America will be th e great arsenal of democrac y\" that the President woul d later use in one of his fireside chats.10 \"Monnet was above all a public rela tions man,\" claimed biographers Merry and Serge Bromberger. \"He was particularly close to Ha rry Hopkins, Roosevelt’ s right-hand man. Through Hopkins he became the President’s personal advisor on Europe.\"11 The close Roosevelt-Hopkins relati onship has often been compared to the relationshi p between Wilson and House. In each case, there wa s almost total dependence of the president on a mysterious, shadowy advisor. Hopkins, like House, ad mired communism and play ed a key role in fo rmulating many of the p ro-Soviet policies of the Roosevelt Administration that prove d so disastrous for the United States and the Free World. He and Monnet got along . M. Bloch-Morhange, writi ng in the authoritative Information Et Conjectures for March 1957, summed up the French interna’s pro-communist record this way: \"Never in his long career has Jean Monnet a single time criticized the Soviet Union publicly.\" According to th e Brombergers, \"behind the scenes Monnet played an important role in the negotiations that prepar ed the ground for lend-lease,\"12 the operation that funneled to the USSR massive infusions of war materi el and money, even the blueprints and nuclear materials that enable d the Soviets to develop the at omic bomb.13 The lend-lease program was supervised by Harry Hopkins. In 1939 as World War II was about to begin, Clarence Streit, a Rhodes scholar and correspondent for the N ew York Times , authored Union Now .14 In it, he advocated an imme diate political union involving the U.S., Britain, Canada, and other Atlantic \"democracies ,\" and then, finally, world union. The book was lavishly praised in the CFR-dominated press and by 1949 had been translated into several languages, selling more than 300,000 copies. Union Now and Union Now With Britain , published in 1941, gave rise to a sizable Federal Union movement ( which later chan g ed its name to Atlantic Union Comm ittee and still later to the Atlantic"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Council of the United States), th e leadership of which has always been top-heavy with CFR members. During the late 1970s, George Bush sat on the Council’s board of direct ors, along with Henry Kissinger, Winston Lord, and a long line-up of CFR-TC cronies. In 1942, Stre it’s Federal Union proposed the adoption of a joint resolution by Congress favoring immediate union with the aforementioned Atlantic states. The resolution had been written by John Foster Dulles (C FR), who was later to become Eisenhower’s Secretar y of State and a key player in the fo rmation of Monnet’s United Europe.15 One of the most ambitious and visionary schemes of this period was put forth in a book entitled Plan fo r P ermanent Peace by Hans Heymann, a German economist and refugee who held a research an d teaching post at Rutgers Universit y. Funded by the Carneg ie Endowment for International Peace, a p erpetual font of world order schemes, Plan for Permanent Peace asserted: Nations have created international disharmony in the vain belief that harmony in our society can be achieved on a national basis.... This narrow-minded at titude has left us one strong hope, namely, that this fallacious concep t may hold only during a transitional period.... After the debacle [World War II] an internati onal organization will be imperative for the well-being of society as a whole.16 Heymann then detailed his scheme for a global supers tate headed by a Federa l World Authority, a Ban k of Nations (with three branches: the Hemisphere Bank, Europa Bank, and th e Oriental Bank), and a World Army, Navy, and Air Force.17 Plan for Permanent Peace includes several ambitious fold-out maps and diagrams detailing the m onstrous bureaucracy needed to regi ment the hapless citizens of the p roposed planetary union. At the conclusion of World War II, the myriad of organizations, individuals, movements, and p ublications advocating various m odels of global governance all coal esced behind a concerted crusade to insure U.S. adoption of the Un ited Nations Charter. Once that was accomplished, they returned to campaigning for what U.S. national security adviser Walt W. Rostow (CFR) would later term \"an end to nationhood as it has been historical ly defined.\"18 All of these individuals knew that the UN could neve r b ecome a genuine world government as long as member nations retained any vest ige of sovereignty and autonomy. Winston Churchill and his son-in-law, Duncan Sa ndys, led the United Europe Movement, which convened a Congress of Europe at The Hague in May of 1948.19 While world attention was focused on the glittering assembly of curren t and former heads of state — Churchill, LŽon Blum, Alcide de Gasperi, Paul-Henri Spaak, et al. — it was Jean Monnet and the myst erious Polish Socialist, Joseph Retinger, the bon vivant and globe-trotting master of political intrigue, who ran the show.20 One of the accomplishments of The Hague Congress was the a doption of seven Resolutions on Political Union. Resolution number seven stat ed: \"The creation of a Unit ed Europe must be regard ed as an essential step towards the creation of a United World.\" Marshaling a United Socialist Europe On June 5, 1947, General George C. Marshall, then Tr uman’s Secretary of Stat e, delivered a speech at Harvard University detailing the suffering and privation of war-ra vaged Europe and calling for an American response.21 Thus was launched th e European Recovery Program (ERP) — b etter known as the Marshall Plan — a massive fore ign aid program designed to rest ructure Europe along \"cooperative,\" i.e., internationalist and socialist lines. The ERP, however, did not ori g inate with General Marshall, but rather with Jean Monnet and the"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Council on Foreign Relations. The Brombergers noted that prior to the Harvard speech, Marshall sent his assistant H. G. Clayton to confer with Monnet, and that Marshall himsel f conferred at length with Monnet at the Paris Peace Conferen ce.22 Laurence Shoup a nd William Minter, in their study of the CF R entitled Imperial Brain Trust , reported: \"In 1 946-1947 lawyer Charles M. Spofford headed a [CF R study] group, with banker David Rock efeller as secretary, on Recons truction in Western Europe; in 1947-1948 that body was retitled the Marshall Plan.\"23 David Rockefeller would later lead the Chase Manhattan Bank, serve as chairman of the board of the CFR from 1970-1985, launch the Trilateral Commission in 1973, and do everything he could to further the cause of global \"interdependence.\" The immediate problem faced by the Marshall Planners was selling th e idea to Congress. There was considerable opposition to th e scheme, led principally by Senator Robe rt Taft of Ohio, former President Herbert Hoover, and free-market economist and Newsweek commentator Henry Hazl itt. Taft and others argued that the proposed program would force U.S. taxpayers to subsidize the socialist policies o f European governments — na tionalization of industrie s, central planning, wa ge and price controls, excessive taxation, trade restricti ons, burdensome regulation, currency devaluation — just the opposite of what was needed to help Europe recover from the war’s devastation. They argued instead for a p rogram that would unleash pr ivate enterprise to solve Europe’s economic problems. The Establishment responded by organizing an impressi ve assemblage of notab les to campaign for the ERP. \"The leadership of this group,\" said Michael J. Hogan, professor of history at Ohio State University and editor of Diplomatic History , \"came largely fr om academic circles, from the majo r American trade unions, and from such business or ganizations as the Counc il on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Business Advisory Council (BAC), th e Committee for Economic Development (CED) and the National Planning Association (NPA).\"24 Strong promoters of the \"New Deal synthesis,\" members of these gr oups \"accepted the need for greate r economic planning and for Keynesian strategies of fiscal and m onetary management.\" These fou r organizations, said Professor Hogan, \"played an important role in shaping and promoting the ERP,\" and in disarming the opposition.25 \"Duri ng the congressional hearings,\" H ogan wrote in his comprehensive study entitled The Marshall Plan , \"these private leaders joined their government partners in a formidable defense of the ERP.\" Hogan explained: They published briefs on behalf of the program. Their spoke smen testified before the relevant congressional commi ttees. They served on the Pr esident’s Committee on Foreign Aid, or Harriman Committee, and on the Committee for the Marsha ll Plan to Aid European Recovery, a private, nonpartisan organization co mposed of labor, farm, and business leaders who worked closely with government offici als to mobilize support behind the ERP. The result was something like a coordinated campai gn mounted by an interl ocking directorate of public and private figures. Of the nineteen people on the executive board of the Marshall Plan Committee, eight were members of the CF R and two of these eight were also members of the BAC, CED, or NPA. Incl uded in this list were Allen W. Dulles, pr esident of the CFR, and Philip Reed, chairman of the board of General Electric. Former Secretaries of War Henry L. Stimson and Robert P. Patterson, along with former Under Secretary of State Dean Acheson, also served on the executive board.26 However, even with this massive and well-orches trated campaign, the ERP a dvocates did not have it easy. They had originally packaged the plan as a humanitarian oper ation to alleviat e the suffering, starvation, and devastation caused by the war. But C ongress was not so willing to accept that Europe’s economic woes could or should be solved by the American taxpayers. So the Establishmen t one-worlders chan g ed to a different tack: The y said U.S. aid was ur g entl y neede d"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"to protect Western Europe from the threat of communism. \"Pe ople sat up and listened when the Soviet threat was mentioned\" sa id John J. McCloy, the Insiders’ Inside r who was chairman of the CFR from 1953-1970. McCloy, who served as U.S. High Commissioner to Ge rmany after the war, said his assignment there taught him a valuable lesson — that a good way to assure a viewpoint gets noticed is to cast it in terms of resisti ng the spread of Communism.27 The \"chairman of the American es tablishment,\" McCloy, and his gl obalist CFR collea gues would maste r the lesson well. The \"resisting communism\" tactic was de veloped to such a fine degree that virtually any p ro-communist policy could be sold to the American public if the anti-communist label was applied to it. That McCloy’s \"anti-communism\" was a cynical charad e is evident not only from statements like those above, but from the critical role he played in the many decisions a nd policies that proved so helpful to the communists and so harmful to America and the Fr ee World over the course of his half century o f \"public service.\"28 McCloy’s actions had not gone unnot iced by security agencies. Max Holland, contributing editor to The Wilson Quarterly, reported in the Autumn 1991 issue of that journal that the FBI had become concerne d over McCloy’s \"leanings.\" Holland wrote: In a May [1946] memo, FBI head J. Edgar Hoove r warned the Truman Administration of an \"enormous Soviet espionage ri ng in Washington ... with refere nce to atomic energy,\" and identified McCloy along with Dean Acheson a nd Alger Hiss, as worrisome for \"their pro- Soviet leanings.\"29 It was McCloy, who two years earlie r, as Assistant Secretary of War, approved an order permitting Communist Party members to become officers in the U.S. Army. He defe nded identified Communist John Carter Vincent and supported J. Robert Oppenheimer after the sc ientist was denied a top security clearance. It was McCloy who orga nized the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency for President Kennedy and who, together with Soviet c ounterpart Valerian Zorin, drew up the 1961 Freedom From War surrender plan we have cited in previous chapters.30 President Truman also admitted paying lip service to anti-communism in order to win support for his European aid plan. His so-calle d Truman Doctrine — the policy of providing U.S. support to \"democracies\" around the globe supposedly to combat the spread of communi sm — was completely disingenuous. According to authors Walter Isaacson and Evan Thomas, when Secretary of State Marshall expressed concern that the Pr esident’s \"Truman Doctrine\" speech was too anti-communist in tone, \"The reply came back from Truman: without the rhetoric, Congress would not approve the money.\"31 The deception worked, and Congress did indeed appr ove the funding: some $13 billion dollars for the Marshall Plan, and tens of billions more through various other recons truction programs. From the close of World War II through 1953, the United States govern ment poured more than $43 billion into Europe. Professor Hans Sennholz described it as a \"windfall for socialism,\" and in his How Can Europe Survive detailed the myriad of destructive government pr ograms and wasteful stat e-owned monopolies that swallowed up these enormous funds while thwa rting real economic growth and progress. With the ERP, European socialis ts and one-worlders ha d hit on a veritable b onanza, and American Establishment Insiders had hit on a scheme that gave them the leverage they needed to push independent-minded European governme nts in a \"cooperative\" direction. \"American officials interfered with foreign governments which endeavored to abol ish controls and return to sounder principles o f g overnment,\" said Dr. Sennholz. \"American Fai r -Deal officials re p eatedl y exerted p ressure on the"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Belgian and German governments to inflate their national currencies at a greater degr ee and create more credit through simple expansion. Fortunately for th ese nations, their governme nts usually resisted this Fair-Deal pressure.\"32 \"Through American aid,\" said Professor Hogan, \"and pa rticularly through the us e of counterpart funds, Marshall Planners tried to underwrite industrial mode rnization projects, promote Keynesian strategies o f aggregate economic management, [and] ... encourag e progressive tax policie s, low-cost housing p rograms, and other measures of economic and social reform.\"33 Fr om its very inception, the ERP’s main purpose was to destroy the Eu ropean nation-states by merging th em into a regional government. The early planning for the program was carried out by a special ag ency called the State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee (SWNCC) unde r the direction of Ge orge Kennan. One of the concerns of the agency, wrote Hogan, was \" to consider how national sovereignties might be transcended . As Joseph Jones, who attended the meetings , recalled, the State Department’s economic officers encouraged committee members to think of Europe as a whole a nd to administer aid in ways that would foste r economic unification.\"34 (Emphasis added) Of course, not everyone advocating the abolition of Europe’s sove reign governments was so subtle. Some pursued an open frontal approach. On Marc h 21, 1947, before Marshall had made his Harvard speech, Senators William Fulbright and Elbert D. Thomas submitted to Congress the following concurrent resolution: \"Resolved by the Senate (the House of Repr esentatives concurring) that the Congress favors the creation of a United States of Europe.\" The CFR-Insider press sprang forth to champion the incredibly arroga nt Fulbright resolution. According to the March 17, 1947 issue of Life magazine (whose publisher, Henry Luce, was a leading CF R member), \"our policy should be to help the nations of Europe federate as our states federated in 1787.\" \"Europe desperately needs some effective form of political and economic federation,\" wrote Sumne r Welles (CFR) in the Washington Post , owned by CFR member Eugene Meyer. The Christian Science Monitor (long a CFR mouthpiece) advised on April 28, 1947: \"For its part, the U.S. could hardly impose federation on Europe, but it could counsel.... It could mold its lead ing and occupation policies toward upbuilding a single cont inental economy.\" The New York Times , the Establish’s most influential organ, editorialized on April 18, 1947: \"But it is only too true ... that Europe must fe derate or perish.\" The St. L ouis Post Dispatch of March 16, 1947 declared that \"for Eur ope it is a case of join — or die.\"35 Cooler heads among the \"brain trust\" realized, howev er, that any attempt at openly forcing a European federation would stir nationalist re sistance and resentment in Europe , and would rightly be viewed as American imperialism. They had to make it appear that the ca ll for a United States of Europe was coming from \"the people\" of Europe themselves. The most informative account of the role of America’s Insider Establishment in organizing the movement for a United Eur ope can be found in a six- part report about the Co mmon Market appearing in the authoritative H. du B. Reports during 1972 and 1973. Written by ge o-political analyst Hilaire du Berrier, an American who has been publishing his highly respected intelligen ce reports from for more than 30 years, the \"Story of th e Common Market\" series details the intrigues of the American CFR- Atlantic Council-Bilderberger-Tr ilateral Commission combine and it s European accomplices in thei r j oint campaign for a supra-na tional European government. In part five of his series, du Berrier relates a story from the diary of Joseph Retinger that illust rates how the CFR’s agents built the movement fo r European merger. Retinger was seeking more funds fo r the European Movement headed at the time by Belgian Prime Minister Paul-Henri Spaak, who was af fectionately known in Europe as \"Mr. Socialist.\" Du Berrier wrote: Retin g er and Duncan Sand y s, the British Eurocrat, we nt to see John J. McClo y , who in"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"1947 was American High Commissioner to Ge rmany. McCloy, we lear n from Retinger’s diary, embraced the idea at once.

McCloy, Stone and Murphy \"promptl y and unhesitatingly put ample funds at the disposal of Paul Henri Spaak,\" Retinger recorded.36 It was this same Joseph Re tinger who recruited Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands to host the meeting at the Hotel Bilderberg in Oosterbeek, Holla nd in May 1954 that launched the annual secretive Bilderberger conclaves where the international ruli ng elite meet to scheme and palaver. McCloy would become a member of the Bilder berger steering committee.37 The Merger Begins The first concrete step toward the abolition of th e European nation-states was taken in 1951 with the signing of the treaty cr eating the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). \"This was a truly revolutionary organization,\" wrote Professor Carroll Quigley, the Insiders’ own inside historian, \"since it had sovereign powers, including the authority to raise funds outside any existing state’s power.\"38 The ECSC treaty, which went into force in July 1952, merged the coal and steel industries of six countries (West Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) under a single High Authority. Professor Quigley wrot e in his 1966 history of the world, Tragedy and Hope: This \"supranational\" body had the right to control prices, channel investment, raise funds, allocate coal and steel.... It s powers to raise funds for its own use by taxing each ton produced made it independent of governments. Moreover, its decisi ons were binding, and could be reached by majority vote without th e unanimity required in most international organizations of sovereign states.39 The proposal for the ECSC was intr oduced, amidst great fanfare, in May 1950 as the \"Schuman Plan.\" Although Monsieur Monnet, then head of France’s General Planning Commissi on, was the real author of the plan, he thought it expedient to name it for his comrade Robert Sc human, the Socialist French Foreign Minister who late r became Prime Minister.40 The American Insiders leapt to praise the Schuman Plan. John Fost er Dulles called it \"brilliantly creative.\"41 Dean Acheson termed it a \"major contribution toward the resolution of the pressing p olitical and economic problems of Europe.\"42 And President Truman ca lled it \"an act of constructive statesmanship.\"43 The Carnegie Foundation awarded Monnet its Wa teler Peace Prize of two million francs \"in recognition of the intern ational spirit which he had show n in conceiving the Coal and Steel Community....\"44 Monnet, whom columnist Joseph Alsop (CFR) called the \"good, gr ay wizard of Western European union,\"45 was appointed the fi rst president of the powerful new EC SC. Monnet knew full well just how p owerful and revolutionary his new creation wa s. Merry and Serge Bromberger reported in Jean Monne t and the United States of Europe that when Monnet and his \"brain tr ust\" had outlined the basics of the ECSC proposal, they called in legal expert Mauric e Lagrange to take care of the detail work.

The brain trust worked feverish ly from ten o’clock in the mo rning until midnight, without taking Sundays or holidays off, not even Chris tmas day. Even the secretaries and the office boys were infected by the general excitement, by the feeling that th ey were part of a fantastic undertaking.46 The Brombergers, who are ardent ad mirers of Monnet, then admit th e conspiratorial and totalitarian mind-set of their hero: Gradually, it was thought, th e supranational authorities, supervised by the European Council of Ministers at Brusse ls and the Assembly in Stra sbourg, would administer all the activities of the Continent. A day would come when governments would be forced to admit that an integrated Europe was an accomplish ed fact, without their having had a say in the establishment of its underlying pr inciples. All they would have to do was to merge all these autonomous institutions into a single federal administration and then proc laim a United States of Europe.... Actually, the founders of the Coal and Steel Community woul d have to obtain from the various national governments — just ifiably reputed to be incapable of ma king sacrifices for the sake of a federation — a whol e series of concessions in re gard to their sovereign rights until, having been finally stripped, they committed hara-kiri by accepting the merger.47 Realizing that some nations might at some point rebel ag ainst the \"new order,\" the \"good gray wizard\" and his Eurocrats sought to esta blish their own army, which th ey dubbed the European Defense Community (EDC). After clamori ng for national disarm ament, the Eurocrat pacifists were now demanding that an independent ar med forces complete with nuc lear weapons be put under thei r command.48 The EDC treaty was si gned by the six ECSC nations in 1952, but plans for the supranational army fell apart when, after two years of bitter debate, the treaty was rejected by the French Parliament. The next nail in the coffin of European national sovereignty cam e on March 25, 1957 with the signing b y the six ECSC nations of the two Treaties of Rome. These created the European Economic Community (EEC or Common Market ) and the European Atomic Ener gy Community (Euratom), which greatly furthered the process of merging the economic and energy sect ors of the memb er states. (The ECSC, Euratom, and EEC are now collectively refe rred to as the European Community or EC.) \"The EEC Treaty,\" said Ca rroll Quigley, \"with 572 articles over almost 400 pages ... looked forward to eventual political union in Europe, and sought econom ic integration as an essential step on the way.\"49 But the merger architects settled on an approach of patient gradualism; what Richard N. Gardner (CFR) would later call \"an end r un around national sovereignty, eroding it pi ece by piece.\"50 According to the late Professor Quigley, \"This whole process wa s to be achieved by stages over many years.\"51 The next stage involved bringing the rest of Western Europe into the fold. In 1973 the United Kingdom, after more than two decades of resisting, came in, as did Ireland and Denmark. Greece joined in 1981, b ringing the number of me mber states to ten. Spain and Port ugal became the 11th and 12th members in 1986. \"The CFR,\" wrote du Berrier in Januar y 1973, \"saw the Common Market from the first as a re g ional"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"government to which more and mo re nations would be added until the world government which the UN had failed to bring about would be realized. At a favorab le point in the Common Market’s development, America would be brought i n. But the American public had to be softened first and leaders groomed fo r the change-over.\" The CFR spared no expense or effort in aiding its Eu ropean co-conspirators, especially Jean Monnet, to establish their dreamed-of Brav e New World. A very enlightening source on this phenomenon is Inside r Ernst H. van der Beugel, honorary se cretary general of the Bilderbe rger Group, vice chairman of the N etherlands Institute for Forei gn Affairs (a CFR affiliate), Ha rvard lecturer, etc. In his book From Marshall Aid to Atlantic Partnership — which contains a foreword by \"my friend Henry Kissinger\" — Trilateralist-Bilderberger van der Beugel explained: Not only has Monnet been the auctor intellectu alis of many steps on the road to European unification, he has also been a driving force in the execution of existing plans. His most remarkable capacity has been his gr eat influence on the fo rmulation of United States policy towards Europe. He exercised this influence th rough a network of close friends hips and relationships, some of them going back to the pre-war period.52 Explaining further the workings of the Monnet-CFR symbiosis, van der Beugel cited examples of the diplomatic bludgeoning of those officials who balked at administering national \"hara-kiri.\" For instance, he reported how Monnet’s Action Committee, which was \"supported by funds from United States foundations,\" ramrodded the negotia tions for the Rome Treaties: Monnet and his Action Committee were unofficial ly supervising the negotiations and as soon as obstacles appeared, th e United States diplomatic machinery was alerted, mostly through Ambassador Bruce ... w ho had immediate access to th e top echelon of the State Department.... At that time, it was usual that if Monnet thought that a particular count ry made difficulties in the negotiations, the American diplomatic representative in that country approached the Foreign Ministry in order to communicate the opinion of the American Government which, in practically all cases, coincide d with Monnet’s point of view.53 Monnet’s high-level friends, who assisted him in these strong-a rm tactics, included President Eisenhower, John Foster Dulles, John J. McCloy, Davi d Bruce, Averell Harrima n, George Ball, and C. Douglas Dillon.54 Monnet’s diabolical designs are co ming to fruition at a frighteni ng pace. The Single European Act (SEA) and the Maastricht Accords are intended to make political and ec onomic union irreversible. Citizens of the EC countries ar e finding their lives and livelihoods increasingly controlled by Eurocrats in Brussels, even as national gove rnments find their sovereign rights sacrificed under such deliberately vague and ambiguous rubrics as \"cooperation,\" \"union,\" \"integ ration,\" \"convergence,\" and \"harmonization.\" Soon it will be impossible for member states to block policies that are clearly harmful to their national interests. EC Commissioner Willy De Clercq, in a 1987 speech, boasted that the SEA should make it possible for two-thir ds of the EC decisions to be made by a qualified majority, in contrast to the 90 p ercent of decisions that p reviousl y re q uired unanimous consent.55"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"In his prophetic book New Lies for Old , published appropriately in 1984, KGB defector Anatoliy Golitsyn warned of the coming \"false liberalizati on\" in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. This deception, he predicted with uncanny accuracy, would be embraced by the West and would lead to \"a merger between the EEC [European Economic Commun ity, now referred to simply as the European Community, EC] and Comecon,\" the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance of Communist States. Once that occurred, Golitsyn stated, the \"European Pa rliament might become an all-European socialist p arliament with representation from the Soviet Union and Ea stern Europe. ‘Europe fr om the Atlantic to the Urals’ would turn out to be a neutral, socia list Europe.\"56 It is happening as he predicted. This \"Finlandization\" of Europe doe s not seem to bother the new world order ruling elite, however. In 1990 the Council on Foreign Relations and the Royal Institute of Intern ational Affairs jointly published a study entitled The Transformation of Western Europe . Written by RIIA Deput y Director William Wallace, it triumphantly proclaimed: We face, as Pierre Hassner has remarked, \"not the Finlandization of Western Europe which Americans feared, but the Brusse lization of Eastern Europe.\"57 To which the obvious response shoul d be, \"What is the difference?\" Mo re and more, the plans of the CFR-Trilateral-Bilderberg el ite with and become indistinguishable from those of the Kremlin. Stalin’s 1936 official program of the Comm unist International declared: This world dictatorship can be established only when the victory of socialism has been achieved in certain countries or groups of c ountries, when the newly established proletarian republics enter into a federati ve union with the already exis ting proletarian republics ... [and] when these federations of republics have finally grown into a Wo rld Union of Soviet Socialist Republics uniting the whole of mankind under the hege mony of the international proletariat organized as a state.58 Is the Stalin formula essentia lly different from th e globalist vision announced by former German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Ge nscher, one of the most outspoken proponents of full-tilt European unification? Speaking about \"The Future of Eur ope\" in Lisbon, Portugal on July 12, 1991, he declared: \"The road points not backward to the nation-state of the past.... B asically, it is a matter of constructing a world order of peace in which the Un ited Nations must at last play the central role assigned it in its Charter. \"59 (Emphasis added) And there we have a clear admission that the economic and union of European nations is not the final goal of these socialist and internationalist manipulat ors.

Yet the nations of the world conti nue marching forward, st ep by step, into a UN-led global tyranny. Like sleep-walking automatons, oblivious to approaching peril, millions of norma lly intelligent individuals p ass by the danger signs each day without paying the s lightest notice. The worl d ’s peoples seem incapable of comprehending the looming danger, even though it is so plainly evident. Ours is the age of omnipotent govern ment. Because it is, we have had ample exposure to the lessons o f totalitarianism; we have no excuse if we close our eyes and minds to the danger. We can take no refuge b ehind a plea of \"ignorance .\" It has been well observed that th e \"increasing quantit y of government, in all nations, has constituted the grea test tragedy of the twentieth centu ry.\"5 This tragedy, however, is but the manifestation of an even de eper spiritual trage dy: the decreasing quant ity and quality of the Christian faith in all nations. The century now drawing to a clos e has witnessed man’s greatest achie vements in science, engineering, and technological progress. Our monumental advances in medicine , agriculture, communications, transportation, space exploration, a nd virtually every fiel d of learning have far eclipsed the most ambitious hopes of those who live d only a generation ago. So sweep ing and breathtakingly rapid have these advances come that peoples everywhere have been seduced by the \"gospel of progress,\" the beguiling doctrine of sa lvation through the all-powerful cogni tive powers of man. \"Science\" and \"reason,\" this secular faith conte nds, will ultimately tr iumph over religious \"supe rstition\" and then ushe r in a new age of enlightenment, peace, prosperity, and c ontinuous progress. The adherents of this \"new\" faith come in many st ripes. Their \"spiritual\" lineage may be traced to Rousseau, Bacon, Hume, Descartes, Kant, Weishaupt, Marx, Lenin, Asimov, or a myriad of othe r masters. Darwin is certainly one of the leading points of light in this glittering firmament. Charles Darwin was not the ori g inator of the ideas that have led to the abandonment of belief in the"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"existence of objective, transcendent truth. \"But Darwin’s role was to di gnify these ideas with ‘scientific’ b acking and to make them accessible to the average man in terms he could understand,\" observed Jane H. Ingraham. \"His shattering ‘expl anation’ of the evol ution of man from the lower animals through means excluding the supern atural delivered the coup de grace to man’s idea of hi mself as a created being in a world of fixed truth. C onfronted with the ‘scientific pr oof’ of his own animal origin an d nature, Western man, set fr ee at last from God, bega n the long trek through scientific rationalism, environmental determinism, cultur al conditioning, perfectibility of human nature, behaviorism, and secular humanism to today’s inverted morality and totalitarian man.\" 6 The rejection of Divine revelation and the sovereignty of God has resulted in the enth ronement of man’s \"reason\" as the ultimate source o f truth and the apotheosis of the State as the supreme authority. More recently, we have s een defections from the cu lt of science to the cult of nature. But, as was discussed in earlier chapters, this development has involved merely switching from one pagan \"church\" to another, while maintaining the sa me faith in the god of the State. More Deadly Than War The fruits of this \"faith \" have been horrific as totalitarianis m (fascism, nazism, communism, socialism, etc.) and its various wars and revolutions have wr ought death, suffering, an d destruction on a scale undreamt of before. There are few who will argue the point that war is hell, and that a nation should go to great lengths to avoid it. But is war the ultimate evil? Must we be willing to acce pt anything — even tyranny and slavery — in order to avoid war? Before answering, the pe ace-at-any-price advocates would do well to consider the sobering research compiled by Prof essor R. J. Rumme l about the human cost of 20th century totalitarianis m. The results of Dr. Rummel’s exhaustive investigation, published under the title Lethal Politics: Soviet Genoc ide and Mass Murder Since 1917, can be ignored only at the p eril of every living being on this planet. The \"shocking\" (his own word) conclusion of the professo r ’s meticulous research is mi nd-numbing. Rummel found that ... independent of war and othe r kinds of conflict — governme nts probably have murdered 119,400,000 people — Marxist governments about 95,200,000 of them. By comparison, the battle-killed in all foreign and domes tic wars in this century total 35,700,000. These monstrous statistics sharply reoriented my research. For more than thirty years as a political scientist and peace researcher, I had focused my research on the causes and conditions of war, conflict, a nd peace. I had believed that wa r was the greatest killer and that nuclear war would be a global holocaust. Now I have f ound that the total killed by government in cold blood was almo st four times that of war. It was as though a nuclear war had already occurred. 7 [Emphasis in original] The \"Cold War\" body count alone is at least 22.5 million. That’s the num ber of human beings murdered b y the Soviet Communists from th e end of World War II until 1987. To describe this phenomenon o f mass homicide, Dr. Rummel, a profe ssor of political science at the Un iversity of Hawaii, coined the word \"democide,\" which he defined as \"a government’s concentrated, sy stematic, and seri al murder of a large part of its population.\"8 For Soviet democide alone, Rumm el arrived at \"the most proba ble estimate of 61,911,000 murdered.\" This, he pointed out, \"is more than four times the battle dead (15,000,000) for all nations in the Secon d World War. Indeed, it exceeds the total deaths (35,654 ,000) from all this century’ s international, civil, g uerrilla, and liberation wars, includin g the Russian Civil War itself.\"9 ( Em p hasis in ori g inal )"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"For still another quantitative perspective, the pr ofessor reported that \"fro m 1918 to 1953 [the Lenin- Stalin years], the Soviet governme nt executed, slaughtered, starved, beat or tortured to death, o r otherwise killed some 39.5 milli on of its own people.... In China, under Mao Tse-tung, the communist government eliminated ... 45 million people. The number killed in just these two nations is about 84.5 million, or a lethality of 252% more t han both world wars together .\" (Emphasis added) \"Yet,\" asks Rummel, \"have the world community and intellectuals generally shown anything like the same horror o r outrage over these Soviet and Chines e megakillings as has been direct ed at the much less deadly world wars?\"10 These figures, horrendous as they are, do not begin to tell the whole story. Quantitatively, it is very likely that they err on the low si de and, says Rummel, \"may underestimate the tr ue total by 10 percent o r more. Moreover, they do not even include the 1921-1922 Soviet famine and the 1958-1961 Chinese famine, which caused about four mi llion and 27 million deaths, resp ectively.\"11 Those deaths should certainly be included, since they were the direct, intended result of conscious, cold- b looded policies o f the communist regimes. The figures also do not include su icides, which by many accounts occurr ed in very significant numbers due to widespread fear, terror, shock, and despair under Soviet tota litarianism. From a qualitative p erspective, it is impossible for th e raw statistics to convey the i mmeasurable mental, physical, and spiritual agonies suffered by each of those millions of souls who were starve d, tortured, executed, o r otherwise disposed of as if they were nothing more than so much debris.12 Furthermore, says Rummel, \"these figures do not measure the misery among those loved ones left alive, the mothers and fathers, the husbands or wives, or the children, frie nds, and lovers of those killed. No accounting is made of thos e who died of heartbreak, who gave up on life and succumbed to disease o r p rivation, or whose remaining years were full of anguish and bitterness.\"13 All of this horrendous record of annihilation and desolation can be attribut ed, says Rummel, to \" utopia empowered ,\" the \"melding of an idea and power .\" (Emphasis in original) It is the natural and inevitable result of the implementation of Le nin’s brutal dictum: \"The scientif ic concept of dictatorship means nothing else but this: power without limit, resting directly upon force, restrained by no laws, absolutely unrestricted by rules.\"14 Anyone truly committed to the cause of peace must conf ront the terrible realities that are the ineluctable consequences of Lenin’s unrestric ted absolutism. They are: 1) Un restrained government invariably results in the regime waging war against its own people, a development described by G. Edward Griffin as \"more deadly than war [between nations]\"15; and 2) governments not bound by strict constitutional limits and vigilant, moral citizens ar e those most likely to cause wars with other nations. In fact, notes Dr. Rummel: Absolutist governments ... are not only many times deadlier than war, but are themselves the major factor causing war and other forms of violent conflict . They are a major cause of militarism. Indeed, absolutism, not war, is mankind’s deadliest scourge of all.16 Rummel observes that the essential wisdom to be gained from any study of utopian barbarism, empowered and unlimited, is that \" the more freedom in a nation, the fe wer people killed by government. F reedom serves as a brake on a governi ng elite’s power over life and death. \"17 (Emphasis added) An d this salutary freedom is itself, of course, the result of keeping govern ment small and strictly contained. N o one who wants to be free should forget Lord Ac ton’s famous axiom, \"Power tends to corrupt an d absolute p ower corru p ts absolutel y .\" From the Christian p ers p ective, it could more accuratel y be said"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"that power tends further to corrupt man (any man) because of hi s already fallen, sinful, corrupt nature. This unfortunate but unassailable fact about gove rnment power was duly not ed and amply illustrated decades before Rummel’s revelati ons by Harvard University sociol ogist Pitirim A. Sorokin. In 1956 Professor Sorokin publishe d the results of his own survey of the criminality of rulers. His study o f various heads of state, in a selection large enough to constitute a very fair sample, demonstrated that there was an average of one murderer for every four of these rulers! \"In other words,\" said Professo r Sorokin, \"the rulers of the stat es are the most criminal group in a respective population. With a limitation of their power their crimina lity tends to decrease; but it s till remains exceptionally high in all nations.\"18 Commenting on Sorokin’s findings, John Birch Society founder Robert Welch observed: An obvious reason for this is the greater temptation to criminality on the part of those who control or influence the police power of a nation, of which th ey would otherwise stand in more fear. Another is that ambitious men with criminal tendencies naturally gravitate into government because of this ve ry prospect of doing, or he lping to do, the policing over themselves. A third reason is th at so many apologists can always be found, for criminal acts of governments, on the grounds that such act s ultimately contribut e to the public good and that therefore the criminal means ar e justified by the righteous ends.19 Bind Them Down From Mischief The framers of our constitutional system were hardly unaware of these truths. \"Whoever would found a state and make proper laws for the government of it,\" said John Adams, \"must presume that all men are bad by nature.\"20 \"If men were angels,\" concurred James Madison, \"no govern ment would be necessa ry. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administer ed by men over men, the great diffic ulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control th e governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.\"21 The difficulty referred to by these men should be readily appreciated by all who seriously ponder the p erennial problems of governance. Aldous Huxley, who was certainly ne ither a constitutionalist nor a conservative, grasped it well. Sounding remarkably like Adams and many other early Americans, he noted: In actual practice how many great me n have ever fulfilled, or are ever likely to fulfill, the conditions which alone render pow er innocuous to the ruler as well as to the ruled? Obviously, very few. Except by saints, the problem of power is finally insoluble. But since genuine self-government is possi ble only in very small groups, societies on a national or supernational scale will always be ruled by oligarchical minor ities whose members come to power because they have a lust for power.22 Unrestricted \"democracy,\" that m odern political idol, offers no solu tion to the dilemma. For as John Adams again accurately observed, \"We may appeal to every page of history we have hitherto turned over, for proofs irrefragable, that the people, when they have been uncheck ed, have been as unjust, tyrannical, brutal, barbarous and cruel as any ki ng or senate possessed of uncontrollable power.\"23 Adams full y com p rehended the fundament al truth of Geor g e Washin g ton’s maxim, \"Government is not"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"reason; it is not eloquence; it is force! Like fire , it is a dangerous servan t and a fearful master.\"24 In order that it remain the servant and not become the master, it is incumbent upon the citizenry to keep governmental force sm all, fragmented and dece ntralized, allowing it only those powers necessary to p erform its essential functions, a nd scrupulously guarding against th e temptation to rely on government to do for them what they ought to do for themselves. It was this philosophy of strictly limited government that Thomas Jefferson endorsed in his first inaugural address when he stated: [A] wise and frugal Government, which shall restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earn ed. This is the sum of good government....25 The key to effectuating this \"good go vernment\" is, firs t of all, a moral people. A society of moral people who practice self-restraint , respect the rights and pr operty of others, responsibly provide for themselves and their families, and voluntarily pr actice charity toward the truly destitute, have no need for large government. But a moral people must also be a wise peopl e if they are not to fa ll victim to the tyranny of good intentions. For, as Dani el Webster sagely remarked: Good intention will always be pleaded for ev ery assumption of power.... It is hardly too strong to say that the Constitution was made to guard the people agains t the dangers of good intentions. There are men in all ages who m ean to govern well, but they mean to govern. They promise to be good masters, but they mean to be masters.26 Always, the would- b e masters promise to supply this benefit and inaugurate that program, or to solve this problem and provide for that need. But before they can \"give\" to one, they must first take from another. To do so, they must assume more power. They say, \"trust me.\" T homas Jefferson, who would have none of it, warned that \"confidence is everywhe re the parent of despotism.... In questions of powe r let no more be heard of confiden ce in man, but bind hi m down from mischief by the chains of the constitution.\"27 Are these \"first principles\" any less valid today than they were two centuries ago? Has human nature so drastically changed for the better that these warnings should no longe r be heeded? Are the rulers of the nations that make up the United Nations saints an d angels with whom we may confidently entrust unrestrained powers? More than a hundr ed million voices of th e victims of totalitarianism in this century alone cry out from their graves with a thunder ous \"NO! NEVER!\" The recent findings of Professo r Rummel, together with all the recorded history of our world, echo that cry and solemnly warn those who would indulge such vain hopes a nd folly that they are inviting global tyranny and democide of a magnitude never seen before on this planet. Answering UN Cliches But we will place constitution al limits on the United Nati ons or any other world-state system. This is the plea, for instance, of Time magazine’s Editor-at- Large Strobe Talbott (C FR director, TC). His b latant appeal for world government, \"The Birth of the Global Nation,\" appeared in the July 20, 1992 issue of Time . The global government he e nvisions, he claims, \"is not an all-powerful Leviathan o r centralized superstate, but a federati on, a union of separate st ates that allo cate certain pow ers to a central government while retaining many others for themselv es.\" We hear these expl anations and many others like them. Yet who but a fool believes that p romises to limit world authorit y would be ke p t — even i f"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"such commitments were made in good faith by honorable men. Addressing the Virginia Convention in 1788, Madison stated: \"I believe there are more instances of the abridgement of the freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroach ments of those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations.\"28 Jefferson, writing in 1800 about this same concern for our new governme nt, expressed his belief that \"a single consolidated government w ould become the most corrupt gov ernment on the earth.\"29 Twenty- one years later he remarked, \"Our government is now taking so steady a course as to show by what road it will pass to destruction, to wit: by consolidation first, and then corrupt ion, its necessary consequence.\"30 If these men could entertain such pessimistic views of government and perceive the dangers in their day when government was remarkably sm aller, the populace still vigilant, a nd the constitutional chains still firm, how is it possible that th e far greater peril fro m our own ever-growing government and the incalculable dangers of global government unde r the UN create so little apprehension? It is painfully obvious to anyone with eyes to see that abridgements of our fr eedom by gradual and silent encroachments have already proceede d to the point that the federal government has very nearly become our \"fearful master.\" And the consolidation and corruption in Washington have indeed followed the grim course outlined by Je fferson, though he could not possibly have imagined the incredible depravity to which government has sunk in our day. Certainl y there is nothing in our present predicament to contradict this warning expressed by Jefferson: When all government, domestic and foreign, in little as in grea t things, shall be drawn to Washington as the centre of all power, it will render powerless the checks provided of one government on another, and will become as venal and oppressi ve as the government from which we separated.31 If Jefferson’s admonition was vali d concerning our national government — and it was — it must apply infinitely more to a cen tralized global gove rnment. Considering the past and present makeup of the United Nations membership, the b ackground of the communist crimina ls and conspirators who founded the organization, and the to tal lack of fundamental c onstitutional restraints in the UN Charter to protect against encroachment or usurpati on, there can be no excuse whatso ever for any hope that, once vested with increased power, the UN will not abuse it. To restrain growing UN power we must contend against not only the natural tendency toward the accumulation of power in government but also a long-standing, organized conspiracy of powerful forces working to build, piece by pi ece, step by step, an omnipotent global government. The Club of Rome asserts that \"w orld policing will have to be pr ovided under the authority of the United Nations,\"32 and virtually ev ery day brings new proposals from official sources and private groups for UN policing and control of the environment, the economy, industry — essentially every part of the globe and every aspect of our lives. Strobe Talbott’s assura nces notwithstandi ng, UN conventions on ozone depletion, carbon dioxide and biodiversit y, and the massive Agenda 21 program for global ecofascism have the potential all by themselves to turn the UN into \"an all-powerful Leviathan o r centralized superstate.\" The UN is the world’s last best hope for peace.

However, only by some tortured application of Orwellian \"Newspeak\" can the UN be refe rred to as a \"peace\" organization. During the summer of 1945, Ambassador J. Reuben Clark, Jr., one of Am erica’s foremost scholars in the field of international law, prepared an analysis of the UN Charter. His learned appraisal and cogent remarks fly in the face of popul ar platitudes and conventional \"w isdom\" concerning the \"revered\" document. Ambassador Clark’s examin ation led him to conclude that the Charter \"is a war document not a peace document,\" and that it \"i s built to prepare for war, not to promote peace.\" The Ambassado r noted: [T]here is no provision in the Charter itself th at contemplates ending war. It is true the Charter provides for force to bring peace, bu t such use of force is itself war.33 Moreover, said Ambassador Clark, Not only does the Charter Organization not prev ent future wars, but it makes practically certain that we shall have futu re wars, and as to such wars it takes from us the power to declare them, to choose the side on which we shall fight, to determine what forces and military equipment we shall us e in the war, and to control and command our sons who do the fighting.34 The Ambassador’s predictions were s oon borne out — first in Korea and then in Vietnam, the first two wars America fought with UN involve ment and the only two which the Un ited States has ever failed to win.35 Dr. J. B. Matthews, former chie f investigator for the House Comm ittee on Un-American Activities and one of America’s outstandi ng scholars on Marxist-Leninist theory and practice, was but one of many leading Americans who exposed the UN-as-peace-dove myth. Dr. Ma tthews was not one to mince words. \"I challenge the illusion that the UN is an instrument of peace,\" he said. \"I t could not be less of a cruel hoax if it had been organized in Hell for the so le purpose of aiding and abetting the destruction o f the United States.\"36 Senator William Langer (R-ND) , one of only two senators with enough courage and foresight to vote against the UN Charter, said \"I feel from the bo ttom of my heart that the adoption of the Charter ... will mean perpetuating war.\"37 The UN’s monstrous war against the people of Katanga should forever la y to rest any reference to the UN as a peace organization. The UN and its supporters may persist in the charade of calling the UN’s warmaking powers \"peacemaking\" or \"peacekeeping,\" but no sensible person of goodwill should give the slightest credence to such pa tently deceitful abuse of language. We cannot have peace as long as the wo rld is divided into warring countries and armaments continue to proliferate. Only a disarmed world under some world authority offers an answer. Observing that wars are most often between nations, many people mistakenly believe that nationhood itself is the cause of war and ha ve thus fallen for the fallacious argument that an \"end to nationhood\" would mean an end to war. But what are the causes of war? The Apostle James asked this sa me question, \"From whence come wa rs and fightings among you?\" And he answered, \"Come they not here, ev en of your lusts that war in your members? Ye lust, and have not; y e kill and desire to have, and cannot obtain; y e fi g ht and war....\" ( James 4:1-2 ) .

So how can we expect peace to come from tr ansferring our weapons to a global authority? As Professor Rummel’s research so clearly pointed out , our paramount political concern should be with limiting and restraining existing governments. Creati ng an unrestrained global b ureaucratic behemoth goes in the opposite direction, violates every principle of sound government, and virtually guarantees global democide. World government, unless it be led by the Prince of P eace, can offer our world no salvation from the troubles that beset us. Even such a New World Order luminary as Princeton professor Richard A. Fal k (CFR), a leading \"World Peac e Through World Law\" proponent and a member of the World Orde r Models Project, has admitted, \"T here is nothing intrin sic about the idea of world government that p recludes elitism, mass poverty, ecological decay, or even large-scale violence.\"38 Writing in 1955, Frank Chodorov noted: Ten years ago the United Nations was ushered in to the world as the guarantor of peace. It has failed. Despite that obvious fact, there are many whose faith in some sort of Superstate as an instrument of peace is unshaken, and who lay the failure of the UN to the limitations put upon it by the autonomy of its members. That is to say, they believe in peace through coercion; the more coercion, the more peace. History cannot give this faith the slightest support. The gra ndeur that was Rome did not prevent the parts of that empire from coming into conflict wi th one another nor from rising up against the central authority. Even our American coalition of commonwealths came near breaking up in war, and uprisings have al l but disintegrated th e British Empire.39 Still, the cult of statism has continued to grow, a nd, most unfortunately, has converted many believers in the Bible to its cause. They fail to appreciate that statism is not only po litically unwise, but is actually an idolatrous, humanist doctrine completely at odds with Christianity. Concerning this basic and neglected truth, author Douglas R. Groothuis writes: Christian realism demands that no one politic al institution claim total power. Since all people are sinners and imperf ect, political power should be counterbalanced between various institutions and nations. A centralization of power (statism) in a fallen world is even more dangerous than current na tional diversity. To put one’s hope for peace and prosperity into a world government and not God is the sa me idolatry committed by the builders of the tower of Babel (Gen. 11:1-9). The Christian political conscien ce must reject idolatrous inte rnationalism with as much enthusiasm as it rejects a ny idolatrous nationalism.40 The UN will be restricted to using its milita ry forces for \"collect ive security\" and to supervise disarmament. All the assurances of the UN a nd the CFR Establishment notwithsta nding, the fact remains that once we have reached the stage \"where no state would have the military pow er to challenge the progressively strengthened U.N. Peace Force,\" we will, by definition, have es tablished a worldwide military dictatorship. At that point , so-called \"restrictions\" on its use of force will offe r about as much protection as the paper on which they are writt en. As Lord Acton aptl y observed: \"Absolute power and restrictions on its exercise cannot exist to g ether. It is but a new form of the old contest between the s p irit of true"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"freedom and despotism in its most dexterous disguise.\"41 \"Every Communist must grasp the truth, ‘Political pow er grows out of the barr el of a gun,’\" preached Mao Tse-tung. \"Our principle is that the Party commands th e gun ... All things grow out of the barrel o f a gun.\"42 Following Mao’s principle, the UN-new world or der globalists intend to hold all power by commanding all the guns. If they shou ld succeed, it is certai n they would also fo llow Mao’s program o f terror and mass murder. Nations, like individuals must be made accountable to the rule of law. It is not possible to have world peace without world law. Such appeals are \"dangerously mi sleading,\" counseled legal scholar Lyman A. Garber, because they convey \"the thought that law has so me self-enforcing quality. This is not so. No such thing as ‘law’ exists unless there is the combinat ion of a court, plus adequate fo rce.\"43 Which, as former American Bar Association president Frank Holman so logical ly pointed out, \"necessarily adds up to world government.\"44 And again we are confronted with the dangerously insol uble problem of power. Historian Rev. Frederick Copl eston, S.J., has observed: History shows that there never has been a truly world-wide gove rnment. It does not exist, never did exist, and never could have existed. Su‡rez maintained as we have seen, that the existence of a single political community for all men is morall y impossible and that, even if possible, it would be highly inexpe dient. If Aristotle was right, as he was, in saying that it is difficult to govern a very larg e city properly, it would be fa r more difficult to govern a world-State.45 Morally impossible, yes. And certa inly impossible to govern properl y. But the \"world-State\" as an immoral global dictatorship is ra pidly being built. The new world or der advocates can prattle all they want about \"the rule of law,\" but the facts remain that the UN is a completely lawless organization; its charter and its actions are based not on law but on arbitrariness and caprice. And for the UN to become the basis for a fully-functioning worl d government, the \"rule of law\" in America (our constitutional system) and in every other nation must be destroyed. What could we really expect from a world gove rnment? Cutting through th e syrupy platitudes and deceitful propaganda that us ually attend this topic, John F. McManus offered this real istic appraisal in 1979 in his book The Insiders : One: Rather than improve the st andard of living for other na tions, world government will mean a forced redistribution of all wealth and a sharp reduction in the standard of living for Americans. Two: Strict regimentation will become comm onplace, and there will no longer be any freedom of movement, freedom of worship, private property right s, free speech, or the right to publish. Three: World government will mean that this once glorious land of opportunity will become another socialistic night mare where no amount of effort will produce a just reward. Four: World order will be enforc ed by agents of the world government in the same way that a g ents of the Kremlin en force their rule throu g hout Soviet Russia toda y .46"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"For those who insist on the necessity of \"world law,\" consider how the United Nations has repeatedly violated its own charter in opposition to the best inte rests of world peace. Cong ressman Philip Crane (R- IL) made these observations in 1976: According to Article Four of the Charter of the United Nations, \"Membership in the UN is open to all peace-loving states which accept the obligations contained in the present Charter....\" Many now seem willing to forget that communist China was condemned by the United Nations for its aggressive role in Korea. In fact, the UN went to war to protect South Korea against Communist aggression. Now, by stretching the definiti on found in Article Four to include Communist China, the UN has s hown that its own Charter is irrelevant to its real operating procedures. It has now embraced the philosophy of \"universality,\" a phrase not found in the Charter, rather than the concep t of \"peace-loving,\" whic h is specifically set forth. Yet \"universality\" does not cover Taiwa n, which has been expelle d; Rhodesia, against whom an embargo has been declared; or the Republic of South Africa.47 It is a cruel mockery even to speak of world law, world peace, and world government emanating from an organization that welcomes, honor s, and treats as members-in- good-standing the world’s premie r criminals and greatest threats to peace. World federalism merely means extending to the world ar ena the same federal principles that united American colonists. How could any American oppose that? Concerning our own federation, leading fe deralist John Jay had this to say: Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people — a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs....48 Can anything remotely similar be said of the United Nations? Do we have any common ground with p ractitioners of genocide, democi de, and religious and political persecution? Should we unite with sponsors of international terrorism and revolution? The President must have latitude to commit U.S. forces for collective securi ty under the mandate of the UN Charter. It is to defend the Constitution of the United States, not the UN Char ter, that the President (and every other U.S. official) swear s an oath when entering office. The Constitution, not the Charter, is still the \"supreme law of the land.\" The C onstitution specifies that Congre ss alone shall have the power to declare war. Yet, from Korea to Vietnam to the Persian Gulf, our nation has been on an increasingly slippery slope as a result of viol ating this consti tutional provision. In Essay No. 69 of The Federalist Papers , Hamilton carefully explaine d the executive war powers. He said: First . The President will have only the occasiona l command of such part of the militia of the nation as by legislative provision may be cal led into the actual service of the Union. The king of Great Britain and the gove rnor of New York have at al l times the entire command of all the militia within th eir several jurisdictions. In this ar ticle, therefore, the power of the President would be inferior to th at of either the monarch or the g overnor. Second. The"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"President is to be commander-in-chief of the ar my and the navy of the United States. In this respect his authority would be nom inally the same with that of the king of Great Britain, but in substance much inferior to it. It w ould amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the mil itary and naval forces, as firs t general and admiral of the Confederacy; while that of th e British king extends to the declaring of war and to the raising and regulating of fleets and armi es — all which, by th e Constitution under consideration, would appert ain to the legislature.49 [Emphasis in original] This constitutional concept is not difficult to unders tand; the thinking behind it is marvelously simple. Abraham Lincoln summarized it this way: The provision of the Constitution giving the war-making power to Congress was dictated, as I understand it, by the following reasons .... Kings had always been involving and impoverishing their people in wa rs, pretending generally, if not always, that the good of the people was the object. This, our Convention unde rstood to be the most oppressive of all Kingly oppressions; and they resolved to so frame the Constitution that no one man should hold the power of bringing this oppressi on upon us.50 [Emphasis in original] At least the UN provides a forum where the natio ns of the world can co me together to talk and work out their differences. If we had some means of assuri ng that the United Nations would never go beyond that function, it might b e tolerable, but the effectivene ss of such a forum would still be highly dubious. Author G. Edward Griffin offers the following analogy to illustrate the folly of expecting the UN to be a workable platform for dealing with world grievances: Consider what would happen if every time a small spat ar ose between a husband and wife they called the entire neighbor hood together and took turns airi ng their complaints in front of the whole group. Gone would be any chance of reconciliation. Instead of working out their problems, the ugly necessity of savi ng face, proving points, and winning popular sympathy would likely drive th em further apart. Likewise , public debate s in the UN intensify international tensions. By shouting their grievances at each other, countries allow their differences to assume a magnitude they would otherwise neve r have reached. Quiet diplomacy is always more conducive to progress than diplomacy on the stage.51 At the UN, of course, be llicose \"diplomacy on the stage\" has al ways been the order of the day. \"Not only has the United Nations become a travesty and farce as a unified syst em of political world government,\" noted William Henry Chamberlain l ong ago, \"but its meeti ngs and operations have contributed greatly to internati onal disunity, hostility, and bell icosity. Its meetings provide an unprecedented platform and soundi ng board for denunciation, vituperation, and bitter accusations.\"52 Interdependence is a fa ct; a return to isolationism woul d be not only counterproductive, but dangerous. Isolationism is a bogeyman internationalists trot out every time the American people begin to rebel against globalist, interventionist pl otting. The truth is that America ha s never been \"iso lationist\"; as a p eople we have always had a vigorous and extensive involvement with the peoples of other countries. \"The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations,\" wrote President Washington in his farewell address, \"is, in extendin g our commercial relations to have with them as little p olitica l"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"connection as possible. So far as we have already formed engagements let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us stop.\"53 (Empha sis in original) That wise c ounsel remains co mpletely valid today. \"Why quit our own to stand upon foreign grou nd?\" Washington asked. \"W hy, by interweaving ou r destiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and pros perity in the toils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?\" Why indeed? Rather, he said, \"Obser ve good faith and j ustice toward all nations. Cultivate peace and harm ony with all. Religion and morality enjoin this conduct.\"54 His is a true prescription for peace among na tions. It was in this same spirit that the 19th century British statesman Richard Cobden declared: \"Peace will come to this earth when her peoples have as much as possible to do with each other; their governments the least possible.\"55 In foreign relations as in all other areas of public affairs, government involvement beyond what is absolutely necessary was wisely viewed with susp icion and alarm during our republic’s early history. Until the ascendancy of the CFR fo reign policy elitists in our St ate Department, private citizens engaging in real people-t o-people exchange — through commerce, t ourism and educational, charitable and church contacts — were considered far bett er ambassadors of goodwill than were professional diplomats. And they provided far less opportunity for getting Ameri ca involved in foreign quarrels and intrigues. John Quincy Adams’s \"iso lationist\" position commends itself well to our era and offers a philosophical compass to guide us out of much of our current distress. Adams said: America goes not abroad in sear ch of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of al l. She is the champion and vi ndicator only of her own. She will recommend the general cause by the c ountenance of her voice, and the benignant sympathy of her example. She well knows that by once enlisting under other banners than her own, were they even the banners of foreign independen ce, she would involve herself beyond the power of extrication in all the wa rs of interest and intrigue, of individual avarice, envy and ambition, which assume the colors and usurp the standards of freedom. The fundamental maxims of he r policy would insensibly change from liberty to force.56 From Liberty to Force For failing to heed the wise counsel of these founding patrio ts and allowing conspiratorial internationalists to lead us into schemes of global conquest, we have already paid dearly in blood and treasure. However, a far higher pr ice may soon be extracted. Unless sufficient numbers of Americans awaken shortly from their slumber, they will find they have join ed the long list of th is world’s victims who have paid for their lethargy with their libert y, their property, their countries, and their lives. While Americans exult at the \"e nd of the Cold War\" and the s upposed triumph of capitalism ove r communism, America is being transformed (a favorite word of the Insider globalists) before our very eyes into Amerika. The globalists call this transformation convergence : an ex-USSR a nd soon-to-be ex- America will be merged wi th all nations into a new world order UN superstate. Recognizing this phenomenon years ago, historians Will and Ar iel Durant wrote in their 1968 p hilosophical retrospective, The Lessons of History: Socialism in Russia is now rest oring individualistic motives to give its system greater p roductive stimulus....

Americans have already ignored fa r too many danger signals. Far too few p aid heed in the 1950s and ’60s when Norman Dodd warned of the U.S.-Soviet merger plan as it was told to him by one of the planners, Rowan Gaither. The East-West synthesis now underway is not the result of unstoppable, blind, hist orical forces, but the conseque nce of the purposeful, long-range p lanning and actions of evil men. The nation should have come to full attention in December 1987 when Senator Jesse Helms, in a speech before the U.S. Senate, exposed and denounced the CFR-Trilateral plans fo r U.S.-USSR merger. \"A careful examination of what is happe ning behind the scenes,\" he said, \"r eveals that all of these interests are working in concert with the mast ers of the Kremlin in order to crea te what some refer to as a new world order.\" Moreover, said Helms: In the globalist point of view, nation-sta tes and national boundaries do not count for anything. Political philosophies an d political principl es seem to become simply relative. Indeed, even constitutions are irrelevant to the exercise of power. Liberty and tyranny are viewed as neither necessarily good nor evil , and certainly not a component of policy. In this point of view, the activ ities of international financial and industrial forces should be oriented to bringing this one-world design — with a c onvergence of the Soviet and American systems as its centerpiece — into being.58 Americans should also have paid sharp notice near ly a decade ear lier when Senator Barry Goldwate r sounded a similar warn ing. In his 1979 personal and political memoir, With No Apologies, the Arizona senator wrote: In my view the Trilateral Commission represen ts a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power — political, moneta ry, intellectual, and ecclesiastical.... Freedom — spiritual, political , economic — is denied any im portance in the Trilateral construction of th e next century.... What the Trilaterals truly intend is the creati on of a worldwide econom ic power superior to the political governments of th e nation-states involved....

Speaking in Atlanta, Georgia in August 1970, he warned: The United Nations hopes and pl ans — or, more accurately, the Insiders, the Conspiratorial bosses above it, hope and plan for it — to use population controls, ecological or environmental controls, controls over scient ific and technological developments, control over the arms and military strength of indi vidual nations, control over education, control over health, and all the controls it can gradually es tablish under all of the different excuses for international jurisdiction that it can devise. These variegated separate controls are to become components of the graduall y materializing total control th at it expects to achieve by pretense, deception, persuasion, beguilement, and falsehoods, while the enforcement of such controls by brutal force and terror is also getting under way.60 To most Americans at that time , Welch’s alarm probably would have sounded, well, \"alarmist.\" It was too far ahead of the managed news they were accustomed to receiv ing from the Establishment media. That should not be the case today. The \"news\" is just as managed, but those who are not willfully blind can now see the prison walls rising about them on all sides. Many are finally beginning to recognize, as Senator Taft eventually did, that th e UN is a trap. Even s o, many are still reluct ant to grasp consciously that the approaching world order will entail the use of \"brutal force and terror\" — right here in America. Unless we face up to the whole, brutal truth, however, we are deceiving ourselves, and we run the terrible risk of contenting ourselves with inef fectual, half-hearted efforts at resistance. Project Their Track Record We are deceiving ourselves if we think that the Insider globalist s who have consistently supported democidal totalitarian regimes all over this planet will spare Americans from the same gruesome fate already suffered by millions of vi ctims of the New World Order. Consider, for instance, David Rockefeller, current pa triarch of the Rockefelle r empire. For 15 years, he was chairman of the Council on Fo reign Relations (of wh ich he is still a member). He founded and remains honorary chairman of the Trilateral Commissi on. For many years, he was chairman of the board at Chase Manhattan Bank. As the rec ognized \"Chairman of the Establishm ent,\" he is one of the foremost p artisans for world government under the UN. Rockefeller had this to say after visiti ng mass murdere r Mao Tse-tung in 1973: Whatever the price of the Chinese Revolut ion, it has obviously succeeded not only in producing more efficient and dedicated administ ration, but also in fost ering high morale and community of purpose.... The social experiment in China under Chairm an Mao’s leadership is one of the most important and successful in human history.61 Just one chairman to another, righ t?

An abbreviated list of those betrayals would include East ern Europe, China, Cuba, Ir an, Nicaragua, Chile, Katanga, Rhodesia, the Philippines, and South Africa.69 They have supported the mo st brutal terrorist groups and communist \"liberation\" movements worldwide.70 They have sabotaged our cons titutional process by capturing the party machinery of both major parties in order to control the se lection of presiden tial candidates.71 They have subverted our constitutional syst em by fastening on Amer ica Marxist programs like the graduated income tax and the Federal Reserve central banking system.72 They are leading the call fo r a new constitutional convent ion in order to overthrow completely our constitutional order.73 Reversing the Course Throughout the years since its foundi ng in 1958, The John Birch Society carried forth a lonely crusade to warn the American public of the deadly peril to our nation and our liberty from the United Nations. With an eve r -increasin g arsenal of books, p am p hlets, fl y ers, films, filmstri p s, audio ta p es, p etitions,"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"b illboards and other educational materials, Societ y members continued to expose the corrupt, bloody record of the UN megalomaniacs and their sordid New World Order plans for global dictatorship. Gradually, those educational efforts paid off. Public support for the UN declined dramatically. The non- CFR-controlled media became better informed and began to take a more critical look at UN activities. During the late 1970s, members of the Society coll ected over 11 million signa tures on petitions urging Congress to \" Get US out! of the United Nations.\" In the mid 1980s, however, the Establishment me dia commenced an enormous pro-UN propaganda campaign playing off U.S.-Soviet ar ms treaties, Mikhail Gorbachev’s glasnost, alleged global ecological crises, refugee and famine relief, Middle East pea cekeeping, and other high-pro file activities designed not only to rehabilitate the UN’s tarnished image, bu t to make the global menagerie on New York’s East River appear indispensable to ma n’s survival. It worked. Opinion polls began to show increasing support for the United Nations. Then came the Persia n Gulf War. President Geor ge Bush and his fellow globalists magnificently exploited the patriotic fervor it elicited to promote their the UN-New World Order plans. They are sti ll riding high; but that coul d begin to change very ra pidly, as the information in this book becomes more widely known. America’s pro-UN attitude must begin to change very rapidly if we are to have a realistic chance o f averting global tyranny and worldwide democide. Th at will not happen unless significant numbers o f Americans join the fight to \" Get US out! of the United Nations,\" to stop the New World Order, and to p reserve American independence. \"If we wish to be free,\" declared Patrick Henry in a time of simila r p eril, \"if we mean to preserve i nviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contending ... we must fight! I rep eat it, sir, we must fight!\"74 When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle. — Edmund Burke (April 23, 1770) Since 1958, members of The John Bi rch Society have been working to expose the drive for totalitarian world government.

Both the Korean War and Vietnam War were f ought under the auspices of SEATO (the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization) a regi onal alliance under the authority of the United Na tions. SEATO was formed in 1954 under the guiding hand of John Foster Dulles for th e purpose of involving the U.S. militarily in Southeast Asia. The SEATO treaty states: Article 1. The parties undertake, as se t forth in the Charter of the United Nations ... and to refrain in thei r international relations from the thre at or use of force in any manner in consistent with the purposes of the United Nations. Article 4. ... [Military] Measures taken under this paragraph shall be immediately re ported to the Security Council of the United Nations.... In Korea, CFR Insiders allowed th e UN to dictate the \"no-win\" poli cies that guaranteed heavy losses o f our soldiers and, ultimately, defeat. Secretary of Defense Ge orge Marshall admitted that the U.S. \"hot p ursuit\" policy allowing our pilots to pursue attacking enemy aircra ft back into thei r own territory was abandoned because the policy had failed to win UN s upport. Secretary of Stat e Dean Acheson stated: \"There have been resolutions of the General Assemb ly which make clear the course that the General Assembly thinks wise; and the Unite d States is endeavoring to follow the course which has tremendous international support and is not contempl ating taking unilateral steps of its own.\" General Douglas MacArthur, in expl aining the unprecedented and uncons cionable restrictions placed on his military options said: \"I realized for the first time that I had actually been denied the use of my full militar y p ower to safe g uard the lives of m y soldiers and the safet y of m y arm y . To me, it clearl y"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"foreshadowed a future tragic situ ation in Korea, and left me with a sense of inexpressible shock.\" Through the UN, the Communist forces were kept informed of \"allie d\" military plans and operations. General MacArthur stated : \"That there was some leak in in telligence was evident to everyone. [Brigadier General Walton] Walker continually complained to me that his operations were known to the enemy in advance through sources in Washington.\" General Mark Clark said: \"I could not help wondering and worrying whether we were faced with open enemies across the c onference table and hidden enemieswho sat with us in our most secret councils.\" Red Chinese General Lin Piao made this shocking ad mission: \"I would never ha ve made the attack and risked my men and military reputa tion if I had not been assured that Washington would restrain General MacArthur from taking adequate re taliatory measures against my lines of supply and communication.\" He knew the fix was in in Washington.
