In fact, the presidential c andidate with the most royal genes has won every single American election. “This information comes from Burke's Peerage, which is the Bible of aristocratic genealogy, based in London. Every presidential election in America, since and including George Washington in 1789 to Bill Clinton, has been won by the candidate with the most British and French royal genes. Of the 42 presidents to Clinton, 33 have been related to two people: Alfred the Great, King of En gland, and Charlemagne, the most famous monarch of France. So it goes on: 19 of them are related to England's Edward III, who has 2000 blood connections to Princ e Charles. The same goes with the banking families in America. George Bush and Ba rbara Bush are from the same bloodline 3 the Pierce bloodline, which changed its name from Percy, when it crossed the Atlantic. Percy is one of the aristocratic fami lies of Britain, to this day. They were involved in the Gunpowder Plot to blow up Parliament at the time of Guy Fawkes” + Researcher/Author David Icke, “Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center” If America declared its Independence from the European monarchies in 1776, how is it possible tha t every single president has descended from European monarchs? If presidents are democratically elected as we are told, what are the odds that we would always choose members of British and French royal bloodlines to lead us? “The Americas have always been owned and governed b y the same royal families of Britain and Europe that conventional history states as being among those defeated during the wars of so3called ‘Independence.’” +Michael Tsarion, “Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology”"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" “If it really is the Land of the Free and if, as is claimed, anyone really can become the president, you would fairly expect that the 43 pres idents from George Washington to George W. Bush would express that genetic diversity . You're having a laugh. The presidents of the United States are as much a royal dynasty as anything in Europe, from whence their bloodlines came.” +David Icke, “Tales from the Time Loop” Researchers like David Icke, Michael Tsarion, and Fritz Springmeier, along with foundations like the New England Historical Genealogy Society, Burkes Peerage, the Roman Piso Homepage, and other reliable genealogical sources have documented these royal presidential bloodlines. Actually, by branching out far enough on the presidential family tree, the dedicated researcher will find that all 43 presidents share kinship, belonging to the same general ancestry, often calle d the 13 th Illuminati bloodline, the Merovingian line, and/or the Windsor+Bush bloodline. “If you go deeply enough into the genealogical rese arch you will find that ALL the presidents are from this line ...A spokesman for Burk es Peerage, the bible of royal and aristocratic genealogy based in London, has sai d that every presidential election since and including George Washington in 1789 has b een won by the candidate with the most royal genes. Now we can see how and why. U nited States presidents are not chosen by ballot, they are chosen by blood!” +David Icke, “The Windsor+Bush Bloodline” Granted the relationships are sometimes distant 10 th or 15 th cousins, but in a country with hundreds of millions to choose from, this simply cannot be chance or coincidence. Gary Boyd Roberts, a genealogist at the New England Historic Genealogical Society thoroughly traced these connections in his book “Ancestors of American Presidents.” George W. Bush himself is directly related to 16 former U.S. presidents including George Washington, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, James Garfield, Grover Clevela nd, Teddy Roosevelt, William H. Taft, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, and Gerald Ford. Bush is closely related to the king of Albania and has kinship with every member of the British royal family and the House of Windsor.

Th rough the House of Windsor and King Henry III, the Bush’s and Clinton’s are geneti cally related as well. “According to Burke's Peerage, even according to the official genealogy, Bill Clinton is genetically related to the House of Windsor, the present royal family in Britain; to every Scottish monarch; to King Henry III of England; and to Robert I of France.” +David Icke, “Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center” In 2004 George W. Bush ran as a “Republican” against “Democrat” John Forbes Kerry – his 16 th cousin. These cousins, related to the same British and French monarchs, are also secret society brothers in the infamous Skull and Bones fraternity. John Kerry descends from King Henry II of England and Richard the Lionheart, leader of the third Christian crusade in 1189. He also has l inks to royalty in Albania, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Russia, Persia, and France, but st ill not enough royal genes to top George Bush. Earlier in 2000 we see the same story + George W. Bush ran neck and neck with Al Gore; another supposed democrat and co usin of the Bush family. “Al Gore is a descendant of Edward I, Roman Emperor s Louis I, II, and Charles II and is direct descendant of Charlemagne which makes him a distant cousin of Richard Nixon and George W. Bush. So the top “demo cratic” candidates against Bush in 2000 and 2004 were actually his cousins!” +Michael Tsarion, “Where History Ends DVD” “Never in the history of the United States have tw o presidential candidates been as well endowed with royal alliances. There has always been a significant “royal factor,” in those who aspired to the White House, w ith Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, among others, all boasting blue blood links. Al Gore...a descendant of Edward I, he is also a cousin of former U.S. President Richard Nixon, who resigned from the White House in 1974 for his part in the Watergate scandal. However, Al Gore does have direct links to the Holy Roman Empire. He is descendant of Roman Emperors Louis II, Charles II, and Louis I and is therefore also a direct descendant of Charlemagne, the eighth3century Emperor. The problem is that Gor e’s Charlemagne links also make him a cousin of George W.

They can trace their ancestry to E ngland’s King Henry III, who reigned from 1227 to 1273, and US Presidents William Henry and Benjamin Harrison ...Clinton has far more royal blood than Dole and is directly descended from the same bloodline as the House of Windsor, every Scottish monarch, and King Robert I of France. This is why he was the Brotherhood’s choice.” +David Icke, “The Biggest Secret” (191+192) The Windsor+Bush bloodline reaches from the American presidents, back to British/European royalty, and it doesn’t stop there. It continues b ack through Roman emperors, all the way to Babylonian Kings and Egyptian Pharaohs near the beginning of recorded history. From Marie Antoinette and King Louis XVI, the Frenc h line continues back through Louis XV+I, Charles XI+I, Henry IV+I, Philip V+I, R obert II and many other French monarchs. It passes the de Medici family, specific ally Queen Catherine de Medici of France, who supported Columbus’ expedition to the “ New World” along with bloodline Queen Isabella of Castile, King Ferdinand of Spain, and the House of Lorraine. It was also Queen Isabella and King Ferd inand who started the 350 year Spanish Inquisition, which ordered the murder of mi llions who refused to convert to Christianity. And from the House of Lorraine, Duke Godfroi de Bouillon became the first Crusader King of Jerusalem. “Father George and wife Barbara [Bush] are both descendants of Godfroi de Bouillon who, in 1099, le d European noblemen in the successful Crusade to recapture Jerusalem from the Islamic faith and move d into the King’s palace at Temple Mount ...

On and on it goes into country after country. This bloodline connects into every surviving royal family in Europe, including King Ju an Carlos of Spain and the Dutch, Swedish, and Danish royal lines.” +David Icke, “The Windsor+Bush Bloodline” Before the Habsburgs, the House of Lorraine and Cha rlemagne were the Merovingians (Meroveus/Merovee) who originally brou ght the bloodline to France and Northwest Europe. Back in 4 th century Rome the bloodline passed through Emperor Constantine, the first professed Christian emperor who initiated the Roman Empire’s transition into a Christian State and pres ided over the first Council of Nicaea. He was preceded by the Roman Piso family w hom will be discussed later. Before them came Herod the Great of Biblical fame a nd Ptolemy XIV, son of the most well+known Roman emperor Julius Caesar. Caesa r actually married into the bloodline through Cleopatra, the most well+known Eg yptian Queen. A little further down this very same bloodline brings us to Alexande r the Great: “One common link in this bloodline is Philip of Macedonia (3823336BC),who married Olympias, and their son was Alexander the Great (3563 323BC), a tyrant who plundered that key region of Greece, Persia, Syria, Phoenicia, Egypt, Babylon, the former lands of Sumer, and across into India before dying in Babylon at the age of 33. During his rule of Egypt he founded the city of Alexandria , one the greatest centers for esoteric knowledge in the ancient world. Alexander was taught by the Greek philosopher, Aristotle, who in turn was taught by P lato and he by Socrates. The bloodline and the hidden advanced knowledge have al ways gone together.” +David Icke, “The Windsor+Bush Bloodline” Back the bloodline goes past Alexander, past Nebuch adnezzar IV, III and other Kings of Babylon, all the way to ancient African Kings an d Pharaohs of Egypt + Ramesis II, I, Tuthmosis IV, III, II, I, Amenhotep III, II, I a nd many more.

In April 1945 ... the United Nations was founded by the victors of World War II. The United Nations complex was then built in New York City on land donated by John D. Rockefeller. Shortly after the elite estab lished the United Nations as their base in the United States, the newly formed World C ouncil quickly began work on the next phase in their plan: the incremental formation of continental super3states. The first step in their trilateral plan was the creatio n of the European Union. Unifying Europe had been tried many times and was extremely unpopular.

The chief source of social cohesion in the past, I repeat, has been war: the passions that inspire a feeling of unity are hate and fear. These depend upon the existence of an enemy, actual or potential. It seems to that a world government could only be kept in being by force, not by the spontaneous loyalty that now inspires a nation at war.” +Bertrand Russell, “The Impact of Science on Society” (36) “It is possible nowadays for a government to be ver y much more oppressive than any government could be before there was scientific tec hnique. Propaganda makes persuasion easier for the government; public owners hip of halls and paper makes counter3propaganda more difficult; and the effectiv eness of modern armaments makes popular risings impossible. No revolution can succe ed in a modern country unless it has the support of at least a considerable section of the armed forces. But the armed forces can be kept loyal by being given a higher st andard of life than that of the average worker, and this is made easier by every st ep in the degradation of ordinary labour. Thus the very evils of the system help to g ive it stability.

Almost all America’s founding fathers w ere Freemasons, the senate has maintained a Masonic maj ority since its inception, and its influence has only become more pervasive since. To deny the influence secret societies have in worl d affairs is naïve, but the mainstream media seem complicit in their exclusion of any coverage involving them. As shown in the chapter on “Media Manipulation,” this mainstream media black+out is also maintained through secret society membership. The 5 largest multi+media providers controlling 90% of America’s media are bloodline/secret society controlled. For example, the following are just a few of the hundreds of CFR, Trilateral, or Bilderberg owned/managed companies: ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, CNN, AP, Reuters, New York Times, New York Post, Washington Post, Washington T imes, L.A. Times, Wall Street Journal, Newsweek, Business Week, National R eview, Time, Life, Look, Fortune, Reader’s Digest, U.S. News & World Report, Atlantic Monthly, McCall’s, World Review, and Scientific American. Not only are the media CEOs and boards of directors usually secret society members, so are the show hos ts and news anchors!

These corporations, in turn, control essential mine rals, energy, transportation, pharmaceuticals, agricultur e, telecommunications, and entertainment—in other word s, the basics of modern life. They also provide an in ner core of ranking government officials on a revolving door basis. These officials often implement the very pol icies conceived and desired by the societies.

Secret society members are prevale nt at all levels of government, and not just in America, but world+wide. For instance, Saddam Hussein, Yasser Arafat, Mikhail Gorbachov, George Bush and Tony Blair are all 33 rd degree Freemasons.

These are the biggest, most powerful names in politics, all meeting in secret with no minutes, and no media coverage. Our public servants making private policy decisions behind closed doors. This has been the rule, not the exception, for longer than most people realize.

The following quotes show his suspicions and regrets regarding this secret society of banking elites: \"Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men's views confided to me privately. Some of t he biggest men in the United States, in the Field of commerce and manufacture, a re afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they b etter not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.\" +Woodrow Wilson, 1913 \"I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our s ystem of credit is concentrated.

Masonry today has a generally sinister reputation, because the people suspect that this powerful brotherhood has been manipulating and exploiting them. However, the aver age Mason has never been ‘in the know’ and is, therefore, merely a member of a s ocial club. Nevertheless, the higher3ups have indeed had their hand in creation o n this planet on a large scale for a long time ... The Masons are there, perpetually hid den behind the scenes, leaving clues to their existence as a brotherhood, some of which are evident yet still not seen. For example, the biblical Nimrod, the king who buil t the tower of Babel, is considered the first Mason.” +Acharya S., “The Christ Conspiracy” (238+9) Freemasonry is a secret fraternal order that has existed for hundreds, arguably thousands, of years and is now operating in most every country in the world. Masonry promotes itself as a philanthropic club for men of morals and they perpetuate this image through members of the first three “Blue degrees.” 97% of all Masons fall into this category and they are often upstanding citizens, pillars of the community who truly are charitable and benevolent. However, the higher degrees, the inner+circle of World Freemasonry, use the society’s global influence to advance their control. “The ongoing connective tissue between the modern a nd ancient secret societies has been Freemasonry, which existed as a formidable for ce long before certain lodges became ‘Illuminized.’ During the late Middle Ages when any opposition to the Holy Roman Universal (Catholic) church was forced deep u nderground, among the only organized groups able to move freely throughout Eur ope were the guilds of stone masons, who maintained meeting halls or \"lodges\" in every major city. The masons, who traced their own secret knowledge of architectu re and building back to Egypt and beyond, were essential in the construction of E urope's churches and cathedrals. They were the direct descendants of early guilds of masons which existed both in Egypt and Greece and utilized esoteric construction techniques in their craft. These techniques had been passed down through the sects a nd mystery schools and some continue to confound modern builders.” –Jim Marrs, Rule by Secrecy (242+3)"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" Freemasonry evolved over the last thousand years fr om the Knights Templar, and before that traces its roots to ancient Egypt, the Egyptian Mystery Religion and Esoteric Schools. Some believe the original Masons were the builders of the Pyramids or that they hold the secrets of those early master Masons. Freemasonry is not, however, merely a builders and stone+workers guild. Right from the first degree initiates take blood+ oaths, perform occult rituals, and begin learning about a number of arcane subjects delving deeper as they rise in degrees. Some of the subjects studied/practiced include: Astrology, Consciousness, Magic, Tarot, Kabbalah, the Tree of Life, Sacred Geometry, Divination, Scrying, Theosophy, Numerology, Symbology, Alchemy, Hermeticism, the Chakra system, Auras/Energy bodies, Astral Projection/OBEs, Kundalini Yoga, Geomancy, Masonic/Occult History and Philosophy, Metaphysics, Epistemology, Secret Handshakes and Gestures. Masons rise in degrees through a process of rituals and initiations. They read books like Machiavelli’s “The Prince” and Albert Pike’s “ Morals and Dogma” then write essays detailing whether they agree philosophically with people like Pike, Hegel, Machiavelli and others. These essays are then sent in to the Headquarters of International Freemasonry and reviewed by top+level Masons. If the initiate agrees that the few should control the many, and that secr et society rule is virtuous, etc. then he is congratulated and promoted through higher deg rees. If the initiate disagrees that the few should control the many, and holds a genuin ely moral position, then he is congratulated and promoted within his existing bran ch, never to rise above the Blue degrees. Every Mason will disagree with this howev er, because most Blue Lodge Masons genuinely do not know, and high+ranking Maso ns are sworn to secrecy. \"The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portic o of the Temple. Parts of the symbols are displayed there t o the initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false i nterpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them, b ut it is intended that he shall imagine that he understands them. Their true implication is reserved for Adepts, the Princes of Masonry.” –Albert Pike (Sovereign Grand Commander of the Supreme Council of the 33 rd degree and Supreme Pontiff of Universal Freemasonry) “Morals and Dogma” \"Freemasonry is a fraternity within a fraternity 3 an outer organization concealing an inner brotherhood of the elect. ...

It is through this boot+licking pyramid structure that th e few bloodline elite at the top control the many at the bottom. Then by issuing lo rds, knights, and vassals of various degrees along the way to do their bidding, the roya ls essentially control all facets of this world+wide Brotherhood. \"The initiated brother realizes that his so3called symbols and rituals are merely blinds, fabricated by the wise to perpetuate ideas incomprehensible to the average individual.

The vast majority of members look upon their affiliation with Freemasonry as little different from joining the Lion's Club, the Optimists, or the chamber of commerce. And from their standpoint, this is true. Even Masonic literature makes clear that only those initiates who progress beyond thirty3 third3degree status are educated in the group's true goals and secrets.

But the truth is t hat the majority of the founding fathers were high+ranking Masons. “Of the 56 signatories of the American Declaration of Independence, at least 50 were known to be Freemasons and only one known not to be .” +David Icke, “Tales from the Time Loop” “The Supreme Council of the 33rd Degree of the Scot tish Rite of Freemasonry has told the student that 13 of the 39 original signers of the Constitution were Masons ... It is also interesting to note that there were 39 s igners, exactly three times the Masonic number 13.” +Ralph Epperson, “The New World Order” (146) 13 is an important number to the Masons. There are 13 degrees in York+Rite Freemasonry, and there just happened to be 13 origi nal colonies (including New “York”). New York is known as the “Empire State” w ith the “Empire State Building,” but whose Empire? Who’s the Emperor? P erhaps the York Rite Freemasons could tell us? 13 Masons signed the Con stitution along with 26 (13x2) non+Masons making 39 (13x3). There also just happen s to be 39 members of Rockefeller’s Bilderberg inner+circle and 39 floors in Rockefeller’s United Nations building. This will all become more significant in the “Occult Numerology” chapter. Did you know the Statue of Liberty was given to America by French Freemasons? There is another statue just like it in France on an island in the Seine. The character propagated as “Lady Liberty,” supposedly derived from the Roman goddess Libertus, is simply a patriotic pseudonym for the public. Lady Liberty has been known throughout history as Isis of Egypt, Semiramis/Ishtar of Babylon, Athena of Greece, Astarte of Syria, Cybele of Rome, Ashtoreth of Israel, and Diana of Ephesus. She is the Pagan mother Goddess of the Brotherhood, nearly always depicted dressed in robe, wearing a crown of thorns, and carrying the torch of illumination. She is symbolic of both the Moon and “dog+star” Sirius, which is why the English word for God is simply Dog backwards. The “dog days” of summer was coined after Sirius and was believed to be an evil time. J. Brady in “Clavis Calendarium” says the dog days were known as a time “ when the seas boiled, wine turned sour, dogs grew m ad, and all creatures became languid, causing to man burning fe vers, hysterics, and phrensies .”"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"This hot time was associated with hot+headedness.

There could therefore hardly be a m ore evocative 'Templar' or 'Solomonic' date than 4 July 3 evocative, that is, of the aspiration to build Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem. The reader will also be aware, of course, that 4 July is Independence Day in the US, commemorating the signature of the Declaration of Independence and converting the date forever into a powerful talisman that spells out 'Independence' and 'Freedom\" for the New World and, now by and large, for a new world order. ” +Graham Hancock and Robert Buaval, “Talisman” (470) The symbol for the U.S. dollar is $, sometimes with one or two vertical lines. The “S” and “I” have no thing to do with “dollars” and everything to do with “ISIS.” The Egyptian Goddess of the Moon and Sirius was “ISIS” and this is the most common name for her use d by the Brotherhood. The dollar sign is actually an occult talisman to this Illuminati Goddess. This is why both the Statue of Liberty/Isis and her dollars are both the same color green. The ancient roots of the word Moon were “mon” and “min” which is why we have “money” made at the “mint.” The very idea of money and symbolic currency comes from ancient secret societies. “Silver was connected with the moon and therefore with the Goddesses of the moon, the most famous of which was and is ISIS. So her name became the symbol of money. We find this today in the cleverly camouflaged motif 3 $3 which is nothing more than t he sigil for the name of I3S3I3S, but fused together in an ingenious manner.” +Michael Tsarion, “Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology” "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"During the 1790s French Freemason Pierre L’Enfant d esigned the street plan and architectural layout of Washington D.C. to include many occult talismans. If you see D.C. from an aerial view, you may be shocked to find things like an iron cross (used by Hitler), the Star of David, an upside down (satanic) pentagram pointing to the White House, and even a pyramid with a huge owl sitting atop at the Capitol building. The Egyptian hieroglyph for the Illuminati Goddess Isis/Sirius is a star, an oval, and an obelisk all drawn together. In Washington D.C. the re just happens to be the Washington Monument obelisk, the Oval office, and a pentagram encoded in the streets/architecture. “The Egyptian hierogram for the star Sirius consis ts of three shapes: a five3pointed star, an oval, and an obelisk. Amazingly, this is j ust what we find in stone in Washington D.C. The entire city is dedicated astromantically to the star Sirius and its occult deities.

According to legend, after Osiris had been sliced into pieces by his rival, Set, the Queen Isis found all the pieces except his willy. An obelisk claimed to come from Alexandria in Egypt stands in Central Park, New York, and its twin was erected in the 19th century, during the reign of Queen Victoria, on the former T emplar lands alongside the River Thames not far from the Houses of Parliament. It is known as Cleopatra’s Needle and originally stood in On (Heliopolis), the Egyptian C ity of the Sun, from at least 1500 BC, before it was moved to Alexandria... A sphinx h as been placed on either side at its London location. Another Egyptian obelisk which was built in Luxor 3,200 years ago now stands in the Place de Concorde in Paris, less than a minute’s drive from the scene of Diana’s crash. On the other side of the cr ash scene is the Eiffel Tower, another gigantic obelisk in disguise. The Washingto n Monument in Washington DC is a colossal obelisk. The dome (from a Greek word mea ning Place of the Gods) draws in and harnesses energy, as does the pyramid.” +David Icke, “The Biggest Secret” (354) They also keep the secrets of ancient ley lines and continue building along them. For instance the cities of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington D.C. are all on a perfect diagonal that continues down to Teohitican and all the way up to Stonehenge, Troy, and Baalbak.

I remem ber climbing some stone steps inside a big obelisk near Hebden Bridge in England and feeling enormous male sexual energy all around me. I wondered what on Earth was happening until I remembered where I was ... inside a male penis in effect. What a symbol is built to represent is the energy it will generate, because symbols are a physical manifestation of the thoughts which create them. These guys don’t put their symbols everywhere just for fun. They do it because it helps to resonate the energy field to the vibrational frequency they want. In turn, this affects the thoughts and feelings of the people.” +David Icke, “The Biggest Secret” (136) “The extraordinary truth is that the very existence of the Washington Monument is intimately linked with the Egyptian star, Sirius th e Sihor, which the ancients represented in their sacred hieroglyphics as an obe lisk as well as a star. How is it possible that this most important star of the ancie nt world should find itself, as it were, resurrected in the architecture of the United States. ...in the course of that day, when the cornerstone of the Washington Monument was laid, the Sun would have passed over Sirius ...

Although a survey of the foundation charts used in the early phase of the bu ilding of Washington, D.C. reveals the importance of astrology, and, indeed, confirms beyond doubt that astrology played an important role in the early Masonic rites, the rationale of astrology was rarely discussed openly, even in Masonic documents. Knowledge of the stars 3 insofar as they were understood in Masonic circles 3 was preserved as secrets best left to those with specialist knowledge of such things.” +David Ovason, “Secret Architecture of our Nation’s Capital” (124) August 7, 1880 at precisely 10:59am the cornerstone of the Washington Monument obelisk was laid just as the Sun passed over Sirius. The day the foundation stone for the White House was laid, around noon the Moon entered the same 23rd degree of Virgo as t he Dragon’s Head node. On the morning of September 18 th , 1793, the Sun was also passing through this degre e of Virgo when the Capitol building was founded. When the Library of Congress was founded the Sun and Saturn were in conjunction in V irgo. And when the Scottish Rite Freemason “House of the Temple” cornerstone wa s laid on October 18 th , 1911, the Moon and Venus were conjunct in Virgo. “The chances of the correspondence being mere coincidence are so remote that we must assume that whoever was directing the planning of Washington, D.C., not only had a considerable knowledge of astrology, but had a vested interest in emphasizing the role of the sign Virgo ... Time and time again we shall see that a knowledge of the stars played an important part in every stage of the creative phase s in the construction of the city.” +David Ovason, “Secret Architecture of our Nation’s Capital” (65+6 ) The White House, Capitol building, and Washington Monument form the “Federal Triangle” which mirrors on the ground, Arcturus, Spica, and Regulus in the sky – three stars that bracket Virgo.

According to the 19th century Freemason, Ross Parsons, ‘The Assumption of the Virgin Mary is fixed on the 15th of August, because at that time the Sun is so entirely in the constellation of Virgo that the stars of which it i s composed are rendered invisible in the bright effulgency of his rays.’” +David Ovason, “Secret Architecture of our Nation’s Capital” “Man has always felt the need to dominate and nowhere and at no time is the desire more prevalent than in this modern era. If it were not so, why all the need for secret societies? If we are ruled by an open system run by democraticall y elected officials, why the need for a secret Masoni c order in every village, town and city across the Un ited States? How is it that Freemasonry can operate so openly and yet keep its secrets so well hidden?” + John Coleman, “Conspirators Hierarchy” There are many secret sayings, handshakes, and gestures used by Masons both to recognize one another in public as well as to communicate specifi c information. For instance, there are many mudras (hand+gestures) commonly used by Masons posing for portraits/photos. A common one is known as “the Hidden Hand” whereby the right hand is placed partially or fully within one’s shirt/jacket. Maso nic kings, presidents, prime ministers, and media personalities have been photographed posing the Hidden Hand. Another common one is “the Claw,” rig ht hand at chest bending all knuckles into a claw. “At his trial for conspiracy to commit homicide, Satanist rebel Charles Manson was observed giving a variety of Masonic hand signs, including the Masonic sign of distress.

The thumb can be stuck out or clasped in; both are used, and have been by Satanists for centuries. Recently, this along with many other Masonic hand+s igns have been leaked into popular culture and given different exoteric meanin gs to the mislead public. For example the Devil Horns with thumb out is often use d to say “I love you.” “The sign often is confused with the deaf's signing of the phrase, ‘I love you.’ While at first this appears an odd resemblance, we register an ‘ahh, I get it!’ emotion when we discover that the person who invented, or created, the hand sign system for the deaf, Helen Keller, was herself an occultist and Theosophist. Did Keller purposely design the deaf's ‘I love you’ sign to be such a remarkable imitation of the classic sign of Satan? Was Keller saying, basically, ‘I love you, Devil’?” +Texe Marrs, “Codex Magica” (120) If you listen to Heavy Metal music, the Devil Horns are called “Metal Horns” and the whole audience makes the mudra.

But, UT or Metal Horns cannot account for the scores of world political/media figures who have been photographed making this Satanic gesture (also notice the mischievous looks on their faces): Most every member of the Bush family, both Georges, Laura, Barbara, and the daughters too, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan, Dan Quayle, Jon Edwards, Prince William, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Iranian President Ahmadinajad, Israeli Prime Minister Yasser Arafat, and many others have all"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"been photographed making this sign.

From the very first degree the initiate takes blood+oaths never to divulge the secrets of Freemasonry under penalty of death. They swear never to betray their brothers or the organization, never to tell police about Brotherhood crimes, and never to convict any fellow Mason as guilty if serving as a juror. “The initiate into the order's beginning or First Degree of the Blue Lodge pledged to ‘binding myself under no less penalty than to have my throat cut across, my tongue torn out by the roots, and my body buried in the rough sands of the sea at low water mark, where the tide ebbs and flows twice in 24 hours.’ The penalties in high er degrees grew progressively more gruesome.” +Jim Marrs, “Rule by Secrecy” (218) “Second degree Masons recite the following heinous oath: ...binding myself under no less penalty than that of having my breast torn ope n, my heart plucked out, and placed on the highest pinnacle of the temple there to be devoured by the vultures of the air, should I ever knowingly violate the Fellow Craft obligation. The third degree oath proclaims: ... binding myself under no less penalty than that of having my body severed in two, my bowels taken from thence and burned to ashes, the ashes scattered before the four winds of heaven , that no more remembrance might be had of so vile and wicked a wretch as I would be, should I ever, knowingly, violate this my Master Mason's obligation.

And the bloodlines of the Illuminati go back to peo ple who at one time lived in Babylon and Egypt.” 3 Fritz Springmeier, “Bloodlines of the Illuminati” Like the Masons, the “Illuminati,” their concepts, and esoteric knowledge traces back thousands of years to the Egy ptian Mystery Schools/Religion. However this order was f irst publicly identified in 1776, the same year America signed the Declaration of Independence. On May 1 st , 1776, “Mayday,” Adam Weishaupt, professor of Law at Ingolstadt Univ ersity, officially formed the Bavarian Illuminati. “The bloodlines, and the Illuminati secret society network through which they manipulate, has been the force b ehind many of the major Empires of history. In ancient ti mes Sumer and Babylon were both headquarters for the 'Illuminati' in the land now c alled Iraq, and Egypt was extremely important to them also. It was the accounts, texts and artifacts from Sumer and Babylon that were burned or looted from Iraqi museu ms in the wake of the American and British invasion. After Babylon, the Illuminati bloodline network moved its headquarters to Rome and it was during this time th at we had the Roman Empire and the creation of the Roman Church or institutionaliz ed Christianity. The Roman Catholic Church structure' controlled by the Jesuit secret society remains at the heart of Illuminati operations. The 'operational' headqua rters moved into northern Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire and for a period it was based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. This was when the Dutch began to build their empire through the Dutch East India Company and they settled South Africa. I n 1688, William of Orange, one of the bloodlines, invaded England from the Netherland s and took the throne as William III in 1689. William ruled jointly with Queen Mary and then by himself after her death in 169l. In that year William signed the charter th at created the Bank of England, and the global banking system began to emerge. Banking and manufactured debt has always been one of the main vehicles used by the bl oodlines to control humanity."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"From this time the bloodlines and their Illuminati secret society network moved their centre of operation to London and what followed, of course, was the 'great' and enormous British Empire. This was not the Empire of the 'British' in truth, but that of the Illuminati bloodlines based in Britain. This e xpansion of the British and other European empires to all parts of the world exported the bloodlines to every continent, including, most importantly today, North America.” +David Icke, “Tales from the Time Loop” Adam Weishaupt’s Illuminati was designed to be an organization so elusive, so secretive as to hide its membership within other secret societies. Weishaupt wrote in his journal that Freemasonry was in fact the organization most fit for infiltration by the Illuminati: “The great strength of our Order lies in its concealment; let it never appear in any place in its own name, but always covered by another name, and another occupation. None is fitter than the three lower degrees of Free Masonry; the public is accustomed to it, expects little from it, and therefore takes little notice of it. Next to this, the form of a learned or literary society is best suited to our p urpose, and had Free Masonry not existed, this cover would have been employed; and i t may be much more than a cover, it may be a powerful engine in our hands. By establ ishing reading societies, and subscription libraries, and taking these under our direction, and supplying them through our labors, we may turn the public mind whi ch way we will. In like manner we must try to obtain an influence in the military academies (this may be of mighty consequence) the printing3houses, booksellers’ shop s, chapters, and in short in all offices which have any effect, either in forming, o r in managing, or even in directing the mind of man: painting and engraving are highly worth our care.” + Adam Weishaupt, founder of the Bavarian Illuminati, 1776 (from John Robinson’s “Proofs of a Conspiracy”) Weishaupt himself showed little respect for the Bro therhood of Freemasonry and mocked its structure in his journals. He knew, jus t as the bloodlines atop the global secret society pyramid know, that the whole hierarc hical structure of passing formal “degrees” is an unnecessary process. If the point is to learn occult subjects and become “Illumined,” there is no need for degrees, n o need to slowly reveal secrets, no need for the rituals, rewards, and regalia. “Of all the means I know to lead men, the most effe ctual is a concealed mystery. The hankering of the mind is irresistible; and if once a man has taken it into his head that there is a mystery in a thing, it is impossible to get it out, either by argument or experience. And then, we can so change notions by m erely changing a word. What more contemptible than fanaticism; but call it enth usiasm; then add the little word noble, and you may lead him over the world ... For their sakes, and to rivet still faster their own fetters, they engage in the most corrupti ng of all employments 3 and for what? 3 To learn something more of an order, of whi ch every degree explodes the doctrine of a former one.

After investigating the order, Robison dec lined the invitation and published a book which offered his conclusions instead called “ Proofs of a Conspiracy Against all the Religions and Governments of Europe, Carried on in the Secret Meetings of Free Masons, Illuminati and Reading Societies:” “In short, I have found that the covert of a Mason Lodge had been employed in every country for venting and propagating sentiments in religion and politics that could not have circulated in public without exposing the author to great danger. I found, that this impunity had gradually encouraged men of licentious principles to become more bold, and to teach doctrines subversive of all our notions of morality 3 of all our confidence in the moral gover nment of the universe 3 of all our hopes of improvement in a future state of existence 3 and of all satisfaction and contentment with our present life, so long as we li ve in a state of civil subordination.

It became increasingly obvious to the “good guys” of European Freemasonry that even more drasti c measures would have to be taken against the Illuminati. In 1794 the Duke of Brunswick, the Grand Master of German Freemasonry wrote a letter to his brethren r ecommending the dissolution of the entire organization, due to the fact that it ha d been infiltrated was being manipulated by unseen hands. “I have been convinced that we, as an Order, have c ome under the power of some very evil occult Order, profoundly versed in scienc e, both occult and otherwise, though not infallible, their methods being black ma gic, that is to say, electro3magnetic power, hypnotism, and powerful suggestion.

It is called Bohemian Grove, 75 miles north of San Francisco in California, near the hamlet of Monte R io alongside the Russian River in Sonoma County. I went to the area in 1997 to have a look around and when I told the hotel receptionist where I was going she warned me to be very careful because some people who had been to investigate had never been s een again.” +David Icke, “The Biggest Secret” (327) Bohemian Grove is a 2,700 acre forest retreat for the elite.

The business of banking was set up in the year 1099. An income tax form is a 1099. Who decided on that? Think about it.” +Jordan Maxwell, “Matrix of Power” When a country centralizes banking, it concentrates an enormous amount wealth into a single institution, works mainly to make the rich richer, and opens the government to control from foreign interests. As B ill Clinton’s mentor Dr. Carroll Quigley wrote: \"The powers of financial capitalism had another far 3reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of finan cial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and t he economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudal ist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements, arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences. The apex of the system wa s the Bank for International Settlements in Basle, Switzerland; a private bank o wned and controlled by the worlds' central banks which were themselves private corpora tions. The growth of financial capitalism made possible a centralization of world economic control and use of this power for the direct benefit of financiers and the indirect injury of all other economic groups.\" With institutions like IMF and World Bank along with new Union currencies like the EU Euro and the new “Amero” further consolidating and centralizing the world’s banking/currency, the amount of global influence these international bankers have on world economies and politics is extraordinary. Their method of control is just like a loan+shark or the mafia. Firstly to qualify for loans, desperate nations are forced into pawning mi nes, railways, forests, power or water companies. Then to pay off the loans nations are forced to do things like ignore environmental laws, lower wages/cut back on educati on or health care, and privatize/sell off their resources to crooked corpo rations like Enron and Exxon."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Whenever these poor countries cannot pay off the lo ans, the “generous” international bankers simply give new, higher+interest loans to p ay off the old ones, further indebting/enslaving the nation. As Mayer Amschel R othschild said, \"Let me issue and control a nation’s money and I care not who wri tes the laws.” More recently, Richard McKenna, former President of Midlands Bank of England said, “Those that create and issue the money and credit direct the po licies of government and hold in their hands the destiny of the people.” “It is a well known fact that international bankers have financed nations to fight against each other. Where do you think the countrie s get their money to buy tanks, guns, uniforms, etc., to arm their nation for war? They borrow from international bankers. International bankers have financed both s ides of countries at war with each other. They don't care who wins, because while the nations are borrowing huge amounts of money to kill each other, international bankers make huge amounts on money from the interest charges that they make each nation pay. They also have the power to control the outcome of the war by simply c utting off the flow of money they lend. So, under the threat of war, international b ankers have used their power to gain or increase control over governments. By keeping a nation in debt they are in a position to demand a voice in the government affair s of the nation. Another goal which they have already achieved is to control all the world's monetary systems.” +Alex Christopher, “Pandora’s Box – The Ultimate Un seen Hand Behind the New World Order,” (146) \"I sincerely believe that banking establishments ar e more dangerous than standing armies ... If the American people ever allow the private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflati on, the banks and the corporations that grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquere d .” +Thomas Jefferson Despite Jefferson’s warnings, in 1791 Alexander Ham ilton, the Secretary of the Treasury, pushed a Congressional charter through to create the First Bank of the United States which stood for 20 years until 1811 w hen President James Madison and Vice President George Clinton refused to sign/renew the charter. Madison said, “History records that the money changers have used every form of abuse, intrigue, deceit, and violent means possible to maintain thei r control over governments by controlling the money and its issuance.” Strangely enough, only 5 years later, still under Madison’s Presidency, in 1816 he signed the c harter for the second national bank. Such hypocritical action raised suspicion of bribe or blackmail at work behind the scenes. In 1828 Andrew Jackson said in a speech addressing the central bankers , “You are a den of vipers and thieves. I intend to rout you out and by the Eternal God, I will rout you out ... if people only understood the rank injustice of the money and banking system, there would be a revolution by morning.” As President for the next 8 years Jackson worked to abolish the federal charter of the Second Bank of the U.S. In 1835 an attempt was made on his life. The"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"would be assassin, Richard Lawrence, pointed two pi stols at Jackson, pulled the triggers, and miraculously both misfired. Jackson immediately proceeded to beat Lawrence with his cane. Lawrence would later tell police he wanted to kill Jackson because “money would be more plenty” for him and that he “could not rise until the President fell.” He said the American government owed him a large sum of money, but Andrew Jackson was preventing him from receivin g it. This is most definitely a reference to Andrew Jackson’s struggles with the Ce ntral Bank, which was the obvious motivation for such an attempt on his life. In 1836 Jackson succeeded in abolishing the second national bank, stating, “The bold effort the present bank had made to control the government are but premonitions of the fate that await the American people should they be deluded into a perpetuation of this institution or the establishment of another like it.” Fortunately we were not deluded into the perpetuation of that second national bank, but unfortunately, we were tricked into the establishment of another much worse than it. From 1837 – 1863 was a period of free banking in Am erica during which only state+ chartered banks existed and the values of silver an d gold were very stable. In 1863 the Rothschild interests had succeeded in forcing a bill through Congress via their insider Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase. He pas sed the National Banking Act, once again creating a federally chartered central b ank, one with the power to print and issue paper money. At the time President Abraham L incoln fought against the central bankers and said: “The money power preys upon the nation in time of p eace and conspires against it in times of adversity. It is more despotic than monarchy, more insolent than autocracy, more selfish than bureaucr acy. I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me, and causes me to tremble for the safety of our country.

On November 22 nd , 1910, seven of the richest men in the world met a t J.P. Morgan’s personal island retreat off the coast of Georgia ca lled “Jekyll Island.” The 7 men were Frank A. Vanderlip, Abraham Piatt Andrew, Henr y P. Davidson, Charles D. Norton, Benjamin Strong, Paul Moritz Warburg, and N elson W. Aldrich. Behind these men stood the banking/investment interests of the Rockefellers, Rothschilds, Schiffs, Morgans, and Warburgs. The 7 Jekyll Islan d conspirators met for 7 days and planned a series of radical banking reforms necessa ry to create the Federal Reserve. When the media learned about the Jekyll Island meet ings, the bankers all claimed they were out duck hunting. Later in life, however, con spirator and president of NY National City Bank, Frank A. Vanderlip admitted oth erwise when he wrote: \"There was an occasion near the close of 1910, when I was as secretive, indeed, as furtive as any conspirator ... I do not feel it is any exagger ation to speak of our secret expedition to Jekyll Island as the occasion of the actual conception of what eventually became the Federal Reserve System.\" Woodrow Wilson had said of the earlier three financial crises that, \"All this trouble could be averted if we appointed a committee of six or seven public spirited .men like J. P. Morgan to handle the affairs of our country.\" And that is exactly what happened. \"So the American people, who had suffered through t he American Revolution, the War of 1812, the battles between Andrew Jackson and the Second Bank of the United States, the Civil War, the previous panics of 1873 and 1893, and now the Panic of 1907, were finally conditioned to the point of acce pting the solution offered by those who had caused all of these events: the internation al bankers. That solution was a central bank.” +Ralph Epperson “These men concluded not to have one central bank i n the United States, but several and they agreed that no one was to utter the words ‘central’ or ‘bank.’ Most important, they decided that this creation would be made to look like an official agency of the U.S. government.” +Jim Marrs, “Rule by Secrecy” (73) They called it the Federal Reserve, but it is neith er federal nor a reserve. It is about as federal as Federal Express, and as much a reserve a s American Indian reservations.

In his will Rhodes devoted his entire fortune to the creation of the Round Table g roups, the purpose of which would ultimately be to form a world government, or as he said in the will, “To and for the establishment, promotion and development of a Secre t Society, the true aim and object whereof shall be for the extension of Britis h rule throughout the world.” Cecil Rhodes strong desire for world government was epito mized in his statement, “I would annex the planets if I could.” “In the middle 1890’s Rhodes had a personal income of at least a million pounds sterling a year which he spent so freely for mysterious purposes that he was usually overdrawn on his account ... Cecil Rhodes’ commitment to a conspiracy to establish World Government was set down in a series of wills described by Frank Aydelotte in his book American Rhodes Scholarships.” +Dr. Carroll Quigley, “Tragedy and Hope” Frank Aydelotte in his book “American Rhodes Scholarships” wrote, “In 1888 Rhodes made his third will ... leaving everything to Lord Rothschild (his financier in mining enterprises), with an accompanying letter en closing ‘the written matter discussed between us’ ...

In 1953 the Iranian coup classified as Operation AJ AX was the CIA’s first successful overthrow of a foreign government. In 1951 Iran Pa rliament and Prime Minister Dr. Mohammed Mosaddeq voted for nationalizing their oil industry which upset western oil barons like the Rockefellers. On April 4 th , 1953, CIA director Allen Dulles transferred $1 million to Iranian General Fazlollah Zahedi to be used “ in any way that would bring about the fall of Mosaddeq .” Coup leaders first planted anti+Mosaddeq propaganda throughout the Iranian press, held demon strations, and bribed officials. Then they began committing terror attacks to blame on Mosaddeq hoping to bring public sentiment away from their hero. They machin e+gunned civilians, bombed mosques, and then passed out pamphlets saying, “ Up with Mosaddeq, up with Communism, down with Allah. ” Zahedi’s coup took place between August 15 th and 19 th after which the CIA sent $5 million more for helpi ng their new government consolidate power. Soon America controlled half of Iran’s oil production and American weapons merchants moved in making almost $ 20 billion off Iran in the next 20 years. “In 1953 the Central Intelligence Agency working in tandem with MI6 overthrew the democratically3elected leader of Iran Dr. Mohammed Mosaddeq. Mosaddeq had been educated in the west, was pro3America, and had driven communist forces out of the north of his country shortly after being electe d in 1951. Mosaddeq then nationalized the oil fields and denied British Petr oleum a monopoly. The CIA’s own history department at cia.gov details how U.S. and British intelligence agents carried out terror attacks and then subsequently blamed the m on Mosaddeq ... The provocations included propaganda, demonstrations, b ribery, agents of influence, and false flag operations. They bombed the home of a p rominent religious leader and blamed it on Moseddeq. They attacked mosques, mach ine3gunned crowds, and then handed out thousands of handbills claiming that Mos eddeq had done it ... Dr. Mohammed Moseddeq, who was incarcerated for the dur ation of his life, fared better than any of his ministers who were executed just da ys after the successful coup for crimes that MI6 and the CIA had committed.” +Alex Jones, “Terrorstorm” DVD In 1954 the CIA performed its second coup d’etat ov erthrow of a foreign democracy; this time it was Guatemala, whose popular leader Ja cobo Arbenz Guzman, had"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"recently nationalized 1.5 million acres of land for the peasants.

First, globa list interests are threatened by a popular or democratic ally elected foreign leader; leaders who help their popu lations nationalize foreign+owned industries, protect worke rs, redistribute wealth/land and other such actions lov ed by the lower and middle+class majority, hated by the s uper+ rich minority. Next, the CIA identifies and co+ope rates with opposition militia groups within the country, promising them political power in trade for American business freedom. Then they are hired, trained and funded t o overthrow the current administration through propaganda, rigged elections , blackmail, infiltration/disruption of opposition parties, intimidation, torture, econo mic sabotage, death squads and assassinations. Eventually the CIA+backed militia group stages a coup and installs their corporate sympathizer+dictator and the former leaders are propagated as having been radicals or communists and the rest of the wor ld is taught to shrug and view American imperialism as necessary world policing. The CIA has now evolved this whole racket into a careful science which they teac h at the infamous “School of the Americas.” They also publish books like “The Freed om Fighter’s Manual” and “The Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual” teachi ng methods of torture, blackmail, interrogation, propaganda and sabotage t o foreign military officials. Starting in 1954 the CIA ran operations attempting to overthrow the communist North Vietnamese government, while supporting the Ngo Din h Diem regime in South Vietnam. From 1957+1973 the CIA conducted what has been termed “The Secret War” in Laos during which they carried out almost o ne coup per year in an effort to overthrow their democracy. After several unsuccess ful attempts, the US began a bombing campaign, dropping more explosives and plan ting more landmines on Laos during this Secret War than during all of World War II. Untold thousands died and a quarter of the Laotian people became refugees often living in caves. Right up to the present, Laotians are killed/maimed almost daily fr om unexploded landmines. In 1959 the US helped install “Papa Doc” Duvalier, the Haitian dictator whose factions killed over 100,000. In 1961 CIA Operation Mongoos e attempted and failed to overthrow Fidel Castro. Also in 1961 the CIA assass inated the Dominican Republic’s leader Rafael Trujillo, assassinated Zaire’s democr atically+elected Patrice Lumumba, and staged a coup against Ecuador’s President Jose Velasco, after which US President JFK fired CIA director Allen Dulles.

With the help of the Pa kistani ISI (Inter+Services Intelligence), billions of dollars were given to cr eate this Islamic army. Selig Harrison from the Woodrow Wilson International Cent re for Scholars stated, “The CIA made a historic mistake in encouraging Islamic groups from all over the world to come to Afghanistan. The US provided $3 billion [n ow many more billion] for building up these Islamic groups, and it accepted P akistan’s demand that they should decide how this money should be spent ...

The word “Al Qaeda” itself literally translates to “the database.” Not only did the CIA create the Taliban and Al+Qaeda, they continued funding them right up to the 9/11 attacks blamed on them. For example, four mon ths prior to 9/11, in May, 2001, Colin Powell gave another $43 million in aid to the Taliban. “Not even the corporate US media could whitewash th ese facts and so explained it away by alleging that US officials had sought coope ration from Pakistan because it was the original backer of the Taliban, the hard3li ne Islamic leadership of Afghanistan accused by Washington of harboring Bin Laden. Then the so called ‘missing link’ came when it was revealed that the h ead of the ISI was the principal financier of the 9/11 hijackers ... Pakistan and the ISI is the go between of the global terror explosion. Pakistan's military3intelligence apparatus, which literally created and sponsored the Taliban and Al Qaeda, is directly upheld and funded by the CIA. These facts are not even in dispute, neither in the media nor in government.

Some parents saw these people in their bomb squad uniforms as they dropped their children off at the day care centre at the Murrah Building, children they would never see alive again. Eventually, after months of denial by the FBI and other government agencies, the Sheriff’s Department had to admit that the bomb squad had been there.” +David Icke, “Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center” (153+4) After months of meticulous independent investigation, Glenn and Kathy Wilburn got the Sheriff’s Department to actually admit what they already knew from multiple, consistent eyewitness testimonies: a government bomb+squad had been at the Murrah federal building that very m orning! Emergency radio transmission transcripts from that morning also pro ve that many policemen and firefighters witnessed BATF at the scene. Oklahoma lawyer Daniel J. Adomitis was interviewed saying, “ There was this fairly large truck with a trailer be hind it. It had a shield on the side of the door that said ‘bomb disp osal’ or ‘bomb squad’ below it. And I really found that interesting. You know, I’d never seen anything like that in person. ” “Do you realize what you have just read? The gover nment had multiple surveillance cameras ... the cameras also show the BATF agents hid ing out right down the street, preparing to pounce on the operation and declare th emselves the heroes, the saviors ... From A to Z, there are federal fingerprints all o ver the Oklahoma City Bombing, and the government is doing everything it can to su ppress the truth. Bill Clinton is the servant of the New World Order, whose approval rati ng exploded after the attack. His attack dog, the Butcher of Waco, Janet Reno was ver y happy to blame everything on Christians, conservatives, and gun owners. It was h er excuse to expand federal control over local police and to merge the military with the police in new giant anti3 terrorism training programs.” +Alex Jones, “911 Descent into Tyranny” "},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Another strange “coincidence” to note is that just two years earlier in 1993, Martin Keating, the brother of Oklahoma’s Governor, Frank Keating, wrote a novel called “The Final Jihad.” In his book, a man named Tom Mc Veigh bombs an Oklahoma City federal building! Linda Cavanaugh, from NBC’s Oklahoma affiliate KFOR, even reported on this oddity: “The News Channel has learned of another strange development. Apparently, before the bombing, Gover nor Frank Keating’s brother, Martin, had been working on a novel about a terrori st bombing in Oklahoma City. Stranger still, one of the characters in the novel was named Thomas McVeigh.” Also adding to the mystery, Martin Keating dedicated his book to “the Knights of the Secret Circle.” Could he be referring to the Knigh ts of the Milner+Rhodes Round Table secret societies? “The US government hired the same company to carry away the remains of the Oklahoma City bombing and the World Trade Center 3 the company is ironically named Controlled Demolitions.” +David Icke, “Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center” (152) “The handling of the World Trade Center rubble almost mirrors that of the Oklahoma City Alfred P.

After eyewitnesses reported several explosions and original newscasts detailed the recovery of second and third explosive devices, the government declared that there was just one bomb and the remains of the building were professionally demolished by Controlled Demolitions Inc., the same company th at was first on the scene to cart away the WTC rubble. Debris of the federal building was then carted off to a private landfill and guarded 24 hours a day by Wackenhut pr ivate security. Nothing to hide there then, eh? The FEMA team that investigated wh y the towers collapsed was headed by Dr. W. Gene Corley, the same individual t he government called upon to whitewash the Waco fire enquiry and the Oklahoma Ci ty bombing.” +Paul Joseph Watson, Order Out of Chaos (100+1) 9/11 The official story of what happened on 9/11, backed by both the Bush administration and the Kean Commission’s “investigation” is as fol lows: On September 11 th , 2001, 19 Al+Qaeda terrorists, under the direction of Osam a bin Laden, hijacked 4 commercial airliners, flew 2 into the World Trade C enter towers, 1 into the Pentagon, and crashed the last in Shankesville, Pennsylvania after a passenger revolt onboard. The 2 Trade Center towers burned for 56 and 103 min utes respectively before collapsing symmetrically at near free+fall speed in to their own footprint. Another building not hit by a plane, the 47+story World Tra de Center 7 building, also collapsed at free+fall speed many hours later allegedly due t o internal fires and structural"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"damage from falling debris. While on the surface t his explanation for the 9/11 events may seem plausible, it does not stand up to critical scrutiny. To begin with, if the official story is true, World Trade Center buildings 1, 2, and 7 all made history on 9/11 by being the first and only steel+framed build ings ever to collapse from fire or a plane crash. Steel + framed buildings have burned for up to 28 hours, gutting the entire interiors, but still not collaps ed. The Empire State building was hit by a B+25 and never collapsed. Hundreds of architects and engineers at www.ae911truth.org and WTC designer/architect Minoura Yamasaki himself have expressed repeatedly that the World Trade Center buildings were specifically built to withstand an airplane collision of that magnitude. There even used to be an information sign at the top assuring visitors of just that. And since the buildings stood strong for a good hour after impact, it is safe to say the collapses were not caused by the plane crashes. The official story states that fires from burning jet fuel weakened the buildings’ steel beams until they gave way and collapsed. In the past, all over the world steel buildings have burned uncontrollably for over 20 hours, completely decimating every floor and not collapsed. Not once in history had one fallen from fire, until 9/1 1 when WTC buildings 1, 2, and 7 supposedly all did. The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NI ST) reports that the temperatures of jet fuel fires do not exceed 1800 degrees Fahrenheit and steel does not b egin to melt until 2800 degrees. This means they would have us believe jet fuel fires burning 1000 degrees belo w steel’s melting point, for only 56 and 103 minutes, on only 8 and 5 floors respectively, was enough to bri ng down the twin towers. Even giving them the benefit of the doubt, assuming that jet fuel fires did somehow weaken the steel frames enough to bring down the buildings how is it possible that they collapsed at the speed of gravity? The official story is that fire induced structural failure caused each floor to collapse and pancake on top of one another . This “pancake theory,” however, is seriously at odds with Newton’s gravitational th eory. \"In order for a floor to fall, hundreds of joints h ad to break almost simultaneously on 236 exterior columns and 47 core columns ... For a 1, 3003foot building, ten seconds is almost free3fall speed. But if each floor produ ced just a little resistance, so that breaking through each one took a half second, the c ollapse of all those floors 3 80 or 95 of them 3 would have taken 40 to 47 seconds. Can we really believe that the upper"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"part of the buildings encountered virtually no resi stance from the lower parts? The problem would be even worse in relation to the Nort h Tower, at least if Hufschmid is right to say that it fell in eight seconds, which w ould be exactly free3fall speed ‘How,’ he asks, ‘could the debris crush 100 steel and conc rete floors while falling as fast as objects fall through air?’” +David Icke, “Alice in Wonderland and the World T rade Center” News footage, firefighters, ground+zero workers and other witnesses reported molten metal flowing out of windows preceding the collapse, and huge pools collected in the basement area remaining in molten form for over 5 weeks. For fire to produce molten steel, it absolutely must be over 2800 degrees Fahrenheit, and jet fuel burns at 1000 degrees cooler than that. What can account for this? Professor Steven Jones, a physics professor at BYU points out that thermite combustion is a process used in controlled demolitions which produces high temperature molten metal. In his paper, “Why Indeed did the WTC Buildings Collapse” Jones wrote, “molten metal was repeatedly observed and formally reported in the rubble piles of the WT C Towers and WTC 7, metal that looked like molten steel or perhaps iron ... I mainta in that these observations are consistent with the use of high3temperature cutter3 charges such as thermite, HDX or RDX or some combination thereof, routinely used to melt/cut/demolish steel .” Diagonal blast cuts on support columns have been photographed as well. Demolitions experts say these 45 degree cuts are typical so the building can easily “walk” or slide down and collapse. The idea that explosive charges were placed inside the building is supported by literally hundreds of eyewitnesses, seismic recordings, video footage, and Isaac Newton. Firefighters and scores of witnesses on CNN, ABC, NBC, and CBS all talked about bombs going off that day, but once Osama bin Laden had been blamed, it was never again addressed by the mainstream media or the Kean Commission. Teresa Ve liz, for one, was working on the 47 th floor of the North Tower when Flight 11 hit. She was quoted saying, “ there were explosions going off everywhere. I was convin ced that there were bombs planted all over the place and someone was sitting at a control panel pushing detonator buttons. There was another explosion, an d another, I didn’t know where to run. ” Live on ABC as one of the towers came down, Pete r Jennings commented, “ Anybody who has ever watched a building being demol ished on purpose knows that if you’re going to do this you have to get at the u nder infrastructure of a building and bring it down .” After building 7 came down, Dan Rather live on CBS News said, “ For the third time today, it’s reminiscent of those pictures we’ve all seen too much"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"on television before when a building was deliberate ly destroyed by well placed dynamite to knock it down .” One of the firefighters up in the second tower, Louie Cacchioli, told “People Weekly” that “ I was taking firefighters up in the elevator to the 24 th floor to get in position to evacuate workers. On the last trip up a bomb went off. We think there were bombs set in the building .” William Rodriguez, a janitor in Sub+level 1 of the World Trade Center testified to bombs exploding in the basement several seconds before the planes even hit the buildings! His testimony was completely ignored by the 9/11 Commission report. Also seismographic data from a nearby observatory s howed two spikes of 2.1 and 2.3 Richter at the instant the collapses began. This t oo indicates explosive charges, because if the towers simply “pancaked” down, the s eismographic spikes would happen when the massive debris hit the ground, not at the start of the collapse. In all, the number of people claiming to see, hear, detect, or suspect bombs in the buildings is staggering. Add to this the visual evidence fro m footage of the collapse, in which Demolitions experts have pointed out “squibs” chara cteristic of controlled implosions. Squibs are charges that go off early below the line of detonation as the buildings are coming down. If you play the twin towers’ collapse s in slow+motion you will notice dozens of squibs blowing out the sides ahead of tim e. Another massive piece of evidence omitted from all mention by the Kean Commission, was the third building that collapsed on 9/11 + WTC 7. This 47+story building housed offices of the CIA, DOD, IRS, and the Secret Service, as well as Rudy Giuliani’s emergency bunker, and a large SEC database of over 3000 files on pending Wall Street investigations. At 5:20pm, building 7 symmetrically collapsed into its own foo tprint in 6 seconds flat. This building was not hit by a plane, suffered only mino r structural damage, and had isolated fires on a few floors. Also, Demolitions experts have identified building 7’s characteristic “kink” just before it was brought do wn. A kink is where the building begins to fold inwards after the central support be ams are blown. Standard procedure for implosions, they pull the middle infrastructure first and let the floors fold into one another, instead of dangerously blowing debris outw ards. Added to this, in September 2002, WTC complex owner Larry Silverstein accidentally admitted in an interview, “ I remember getting a call from the Fire Department commander, telling me they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire. I said, ‘We’ve had such terrible loss of life, maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it’. And they made that decision to pull and we watched the building collapse .” Since letting this slip in the interview Silver stein has tried to explain away his statement saying he meant “pull the firefighter s out,” not “pull the building down.” But the fact of the matter is he said “pull it” a common demolitions term, not “pull (them) out” referring to firefighters. Later on in the same documentary, preceding the controlled demolition of WTC building 6, a cleanup worker even says,"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"“we’re getting ready to pull building six.” It is typical jargon when implodin g a building. In another interesting twist, the British BBC news actually reported on the collapse of building 7 at 4:57pm – 23 minutes before it happened! As the journalist is talking about building 7’s demise, it can be seen still standing over her left shoulder. CNN also had a similar report an hour before WTC 7 came down saying “ we are getting information now that one of the other buildings; bu ilding 7 ... has either collapsed or is collapsing .” Anyone else curious where CNN and the BBC are g etting their information? A few miles away in Arlington, Virginia, the offici al story states that American Airlines flight 77 was hijacked and crashed into th e side of the Pentagon at 9:38am. In the minutes preceding, the plane allegedly perfo rmed a highly technical 330 degree banking turn descending 7000 ft. in 3 minutes at ov er 500mph. Many pilots have gone on the record stating that this is absolutely impossible, like commercial and Air Force pilot Russ Wittenburg who told Wing TV, “[Flight 77] could not possibly have flown at those speeds which they said it did withou t going into a high speed stall. The airplane won’t go that fast when you start pulling those high G maneuvers. That plane would have fallen out of the sky .” Assuming a hijacker really did pull off this impossible maneuver, by doing so, he stupidly took the plane away from important sections housing the Joint Chiefs and Donald Rumsfe ld’s office, to a recently renovated, unimportant part of the Pentagon. As news teams arrived on the scene, early footage of the Pentagon shows no skid+marks on the lawn, no bodies, no blood, no significant pieces of wreckage + just a small, smoldering 20 foot hole in the wall. After reports of secondary explosions and the roof collapsing, the h ole widened marginally, but even then remained far too small to account for a 155 ft . long, 44 ft. high, 124 ft. wide, 100 ton Boeing 757. Small plane scraps were found insi de and on the lawn, but most were small enough to be carried off by hand. There were no titanium engines, no indestructible landing gear, no major wing pieces, fuselage, or tail sections anywhere to be found. There were no bodies or blood anywher e either, yet supposedly forensics"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"specialists were able to positively identify 184 of the 187 passengers through DNA work. 80 CCTV cameras were watching the point of impact at the Pentagon, including security cameras at the nearby hotel and gas station, but employees said FBI agents came within minutes to confiscate their tape s. All 80 tapes have been withheld from public view for “national security reasons,” s ave 5 frames they released that show the explosion but no plane. The official story states that the 4 th plane, flight 93 went down in Shanksville, Pennsylvania after a passenger revolt onboard. Wit nesses in Shanksville estimated the hole was about 20 ft. long by 15 ft. wide. The y said on FOX News there was really no smoke, no fire, no airplane wreckage, no titanium engines, indestructible landing gear, body/wing/tail sections, and again no blood or bodies. Wally Miller, the Somerset county coroner on the scene said, “ it looked like somebody just dropped a bunch of metal out of the sky ... like someone took a scrap truck, dug a 10 ft. ditch and dumped trash into it ... I stopped being a coroner after about 20 minutes because there were no bodies there. ” This was the second time in history that a commerci al plane full of passengers crashed and obliterated into nothingness, all wreckage and bodies disappearing. The first time was earlier that morning at the Pentagon. The official government excuse for allowing the att acks to take place was ignorance. National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice said, “ I don’t think anybody could have predicted that these people would take an airplane and slam it into the World Trade Center .” President Bush said his first reaction upon seeing a plane hit the tower was, “ that’s some bad pilot .” Bush was busy with an elementary school photo+op that morning; even when his advisor told him of the second plane hitting the towers, he sat reading “My Pet Goat” for another 8 minutes. “The president reportedly told the school's principal that ‘a commercial plane has hit the World Trade Center and we're going to go ahead and ... do the reading thing"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"anyway.’ Critics find this incredible. If the hija ckings were unanticipated occurrences, as claimed, with one of the hijacked a irplanes having already completed its terrorist mission, the country was suffering th e worst terrorist attack of its history.

Take a look at this timeli ne of events leading up to 9/11 and decide for yourself. To begin with, most people are unaware that the Bush and bin Laden families have been close friends and colleagues for a long time. Back in 1976 Osama’s older brother Salim bin Laden invested $50,000 in George. W. Bush’s budding Arbusto Energy Company. They met through fellow CIA employee and Bush family friend Jim Bath who handled all the bin Laden family’s American investments. By the late 1970’s the Bush’s and bin Laden’s already owned oil companies and airports together. Larry Klayman, President of Judicial Watch, among others has confirmed that the Bush family also vacations with the bin Ladens and usually stays at their home when they are in Saudi Arabia. “How many know that the Bush family and the Bin Lad en family have long been extremely close? Or that the former head of the fa mily construction business, Salem bin Laden, brother of Osama, was an investor in Pre sident Bush's first oil company? Or that an investor in a later Bush company was Kha lid bin Mahfouz, an associate of Bin Laden, who was named by the US State Department during the Clinton administration as a funder of the al3Qaeda terroris t network? Or that al3Qaeda was funded into existence by the CIA during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan? Or that the 'al3Qaeda' tunnel systems in Afghanistan were b uilt by Bin Laden Construction with CIA money funneled through Pakistan military i ntelligence, the ISI, which is the CIA branch in Pakistan?” +David Icke, “Tales from the Time Loop” Since the late 1980’s the Bush’s and bin Laden’s ha ve also worked together in the Carlyle Group, Washington DC’s largest private equi ty firm, which deals in the industries of Aerospace/Defense, Automotive, Consum er/Retail, Energy/Power,"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Healthcare, Real Estate, Technology, Telecommunicat ions/Media and Transportation. In 1998 and 2000 George Bush Sr. traveled to Saudi Arabia on behalf of the Carlyle Group and met with the bin Laden family. Then on t he morning of September 11 th , as the planes were heading for the towers, George Bush Sr. actually sat in the Washington Ritz+ Carlton hotel at a Carlyle Group meeting with Osama’s brother, Shafig bin Laden! The London Observer reported on this 6/22/02: “ On 11 September, while Al3 Qaeda's planes slammed into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the Carlyle Group hosted a conference at a Washington hotel. Among the guests of honor was a v alued investor: Shafig bin Laden, brother to Osama. \" The Wall Street Journal later called for Bush Sr . to resign from Carlyle Group. He never did, but for fear of bad publicity, the bin Laden family formally sold their investments back to the firm in October, 2001. They went on national TV calling Osama the black sheep of the fa mily, effectively disowned and washed their hands of responsibility for him. Nowa days Bin Laden Construction still builds most United States military bases in the Mid dle East, North Africa, and Central Asia, including the bases in Iraq. “The Carlyle Group also has very close links with the bin Laden family, who have been both clients and investors. Father Bush has been a paid consultant to the Bin Laden Group. Reports in the Wall Street Journal say these Carlyle investments have been earning the Bin Laden family some 40% a year on their money since 1995.” + David Icke, “Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center” (83) “The Carlyle Group is the biggest defense contractor on the planet and the ma jority owners are the Bush family and the bin Laden family.

Back in 1979 The CIA paid Osama to recruit and train Al+Qaeda fighters. When Bush became CIA director in the 1980’s they re cruited Osama, Al+Qaeda, and the Taliban in Afghanistan to run their opium trade . Everything changed however on Dec. 4 th , 1997, when American oil barons proposed the Afgha nistan oil line to the Taliban who turned it down after demanding too larg e a share. A BBC headline from that day read, “Representatives of the Taliban are in Texas Visiting the Headquarters of Unicol.” The proposed pipeline was to be built by Halliburton, who’s CEO at the time was none other than Dick Cheney. Shortly afte r this the media began labeling the Taliban as terrorists. In 1999 NORAD performed exercises in which hijacked airliners were used as weapons to crash into targets, one of which being t he World Trade Center. A USA Today article from March 18 th , 2004 read, “ In the two years before the Sept. 11 attacks, the North American Aerospace Defense Comma nd conducted exercises simulating what the White House says was unimaginab le at the time: hijacked airliners used as weapons to crash into targets and cause mass casualties. One of the imagined targets was the World Trade Center .” In September of 2000, Rebuilding America’s Defenses was published by Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, Jeb Bush, and others from the Proje ct for a New American Century team. In it they said regarding their plans for the middle+east that “ the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, a bsent some catastrophic and catalyzing event 3 like a new Pearl Harbor .” On October 24, 2000, MASCAL was a Pentagon training exercise that simulated a Boeing 757 crashing into the building. Back in 198 9, Charles Burlingame, an Ex+ Navy F+4 pilot who worked at the Pentagon for 17 ye ars, also participated in an earlier version of MASCAL crashing simulated planes into the Pentagon. Burlingame retired from the Navy into a job at American Airlin es. Twelve years later on 9/11 it was none other than Charles Burlingame’s Boeing 757 AA flight 77 that was supposedly hijacked and crashed into the Pentagon.

This was reported in Los Ange les Times, the London Times, WorldNet daily, the Village Voice and other mainstr eam sources. “The truth is that the Central Intelligence Agency, controlled by Wall Street, has been grooming Bin Laden and his family over the last fif ty years to carry out dangerous projects in the Middle East, Central Asia, and Nort h Africa.

This confirms that these officials knew both the lo cations of the imminent attack and the method of using jetliners as bombs.” +Paul Joseph Watson, “Order Out of Chaos” (87) Not only did a group of top Pentagon officials canc el their 9/11 flights, Mayor Willie Brown, Author Salmon Rushdie, and Attorney General John Ashcroft all said they were specifically warned not to fly. None of them will divulge sources, but Brown said he was warned by an unspecified federal agency , Rushdie was temporarily banned by the FAA, and Ashcroft cited an FBI threat assessment saying he had been advised to travel only by private jet for the remai nder of his term. During a CBS interview with Dan Rather, Tom Kennedy , a spokesman for FEMA’s “National Urban Search and Rescue Team” let it slip that they were sent out to New York City on September 10 th ! Tom Kennedy said to Dan Rather, “ We're currently one of the first teams that was deployed to support the city of New York in this disaster. We arrived on late Monday night and went right into action on Tuesday morning .” “The National Security Agency intercepted two messa ges on September 10th indicating a significant event was to take place th e next day. The messages were in Arabic and stated, ‘tomorrow is zero hour’ and ‘ the match begins tomorrow.’ The majority of communication took place between Kh alid Shaikh, one of the chief 9/11 planners, and Mohammed Atta, the lead hi jacker. NSA intercepts also detected multiple phone calls from Abu Zubaida, bin Laden's chief of operations, to the United States. Over thirty messages in all h ad been received by the NSA from May to September, indicating an imminent attac k.” +Paul Joseph Watson, “Order Out of Chaos” (87) Unbelievably, with all these warnings, relationship s, covert ops, and examples of foreknowledge, the Bush administration claimed (and continues to claim) complete ignorance regarding the 9/11 attacks. On that very morning, once again NORAD and the FAA were running suspicious drills. Operation Vigilant Guardian and Northern Vigilance moved NY/DC fighter planes hundreds of mi les away where they performed training exercises involving hijacked pla nes! British MP and Blair cabinet minister Michael Meacher in the London Guardian sai d, “The first hijacking was suspected at not later than 8:20am, and the last hi jacked aircraft crashed in Pennsylvania at 10:06am. Not a single fighter plan e was scrambled to investigate"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"from the US Andrews air force base, just 10 miles f rom Washington DC, until after the third plane had hit the Pentagon at 9:38am. Wh y not?” The FAA and NORAD essentially stood down that morning. Any other day , when planes go off course, fast+ movers are scrambled within 10 minutes to liaison. That is standard procedure and had already happened 67 times in 2001 alone. Why w as 9/11 any different? When giving evidence to the 9/11 Congressional Comm ission, Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta stated that Dick Chene y knew of the plane heading for the Pentagon, but purposely ordered the stand down: “ There was a young man who had come in and said to the vice president, ‘the pl ane is 50 miles out, the plane is 30 miles out,’ and when it got down to ‘the plane is 1 0 miles out ,’ the young man also said to the vice president, ‘do the orders still st and?” And the vice president turned and whipped his neck around and said, “of course th e orders still stand. Have you heard anything to the contrary?’ Well, at the time I didn’t know what all that meant. ” Norman Mineta’s testimony was completely ignored by the Kean Commission report. Former White House counter+terrorism expert Richard Clarke told Vanity Fair that on the days following 9/11, when all commercial flight s were down, the Bush administration allowed at least four private flight s with about 140 Saudis, including over 20 members of the bin Laden family to escape t he US without being interviewed or interrogated by the FBI. Not long after, it cam e out that many of the supposed hijackers were/are still alive. “As is now well known, at least eight of the Septem ber 11 ‘suicide hijackers' either died before the event or are actually still alive. This isn't some kind of Internet conspiracy theory; it's been reported in mainstream media across the world. Furthermore, four of the five named Flight 11 hijac kers are still alive and could not have been on the plane that hit the north tower. Be side the fact that according to their flight school instructors they could barely fly a C essna, never mind a Boeing 767.” + Paul Joseph Watson, Order Out of Chaos (98) It has been confirmed that 7 of the alleged hijacke rs are still alive and well. Another one had died already in 2000. The Bush administrat ion and Kean report have nothing to say on this matter. On top of this, September 1 5 th , 2001 it came out in Newsweek that 5 of the, “Alleged Hijackers May Have Trained at US Bases.” Shortly after, the Pensacola News Journal confirmed that 3 of the hija ckers were trained at the Pensacola NAS in 1999. In the following months it got out that the CIA had been tracking 2 of the hijackers for 4 years and had act ually helped getting visas for all 19. “It emerged in May of 2002 that the Central Intelli gence Agency had officers and assets shadowing two of the hijackers. Newsweek ran the headline, ‘The Hijackers We Let Escape,’ reporting the fact that the CIA follow ed these two men into Malaysia where they had a meeting with senior leaders of the Al3Qaeda in 2000. The CIA flew out of Los Angeles closely tracking Al3Qaeda3Pakist ani Intelligence useful idiots Nawaf Alhazmi and Khalid Almihdhar. Both men attend ed what the FBI called an Al3 Qaeda summit. The American people were shocked to l earn that the CIA had been following the hijackers for four years.

Inside it, investigators say they found the Quran, a video on how to fly commercial planes, and a fuel+consumption indicator. The night before he also accidentally l eft a Quran in a Florida strip club. Then another Quran and Arabic flight manuals were f ound in his rental car. Why didn’t he take a taxi? If he was such an Islamic e xtremist, about to take his life for his religion, why was he at a strip club? And why did he bring his Quran inside? It also came out that that Mohammad Atta was wired $100,000 by the CIA through the ISI. “One of the biggest smoking guns to indicate that t he terrorist attack was an inside job is the CIA’s direct connection with the hijackers via Pakistan ISI Director General Mahmoud Ahmad. General Mahmoud Ahm ad instructed Ahmad Umar Sheikh to hotwire $100,000 to the 9/11 lead hi jacker, Mohammad Atta. On September 11th, Ahmad was a guest of former clan destine CIA officer and CFR member Rep. Porter Goss and Skull and Bones/CFR member Senator Bob Graham. Since September 4th, he had met with top br ass at the CIA, the Pentagon and the White House, including Colin Powel l, Richard Armitage, Joseph Biden and George Tenet.” +Paul Joseph Watson, “Order Out of Chaos” (93) In a statement issued to Al Jazeera just days after the 9/11 attacks, Osama bin Laden said, “ The US government has consistently blamed me for be ing behind every [attack]. I would like to assure the world that I did not plan the recent attacks, which seem to have been planned by people for personal reasons. ” Weeks later Japanese, Chinese, and Indian news reports all confirmed Osama’s death, but then on December 14 th , 2001, the US government came out with “The Bin Laden Confession Tapes,” starring someone whom we are told is Osama bin Laden, yet looks and acts nothing like him. His beard changes color, his skin darkens and his face fattens. He is actually seen signing a paper with his right hand, even though Osama bin Laden is left handed. He claims responsibility for the 9/11 attacks and said he did so because he “hates o ur freedom.” This fake Osama is still alive and well hiding in the caves of sheeple ’s minds world+wide. “Now President Bush is seeking to restrict Capitol Hill probes. He had Dick Cheney call six separate congressional committees and thre aten them, telling them not to investigate September 11 (Washington Post, January 30, 2002, “Bush Seeks to Restrict Hill Probes of Sept. 11”).” +Alex Jones, “911 Descent into Tyranny” It took 9 days until an investigation was ordered i nto the Pearl Harbor attack.

Only $14 million was allocated for the 9/11 Commiss ion. Is this the kind of effort shown by a government in support of a thorough investigation into these attacks? Once the governm ent finally agreed to an “investigation,” Bush originally appointed war crim inal Henry Kissinger of all people to lead the commission! This alone should have bee n a red flag as to how “investigative” the commission whitewash would be. Kissinger quickly stepped down due to public pressure and CFR member Thomas K ean took his place. In June 2002, Lt. Col. Steve Butler, the Dean of th e Defense Language School in Monterey, California, claiming he was forced to tra in lead hijacker Mohammad Atta, wrote a letter to the editor of the “Monterey Heral d.” He also wrote regarding Bush’s prior knowledge and motive for the attack, stating, \"Of course Bush knew about the impending attacks on America. He did nothing to war n the American people because he needed this war on terrorism. His daddy had Sadd am and he needed Osama.” He said that the 9/11 events were engineered to work t he American people into a frenzy which would in turn allow the Bush administration to further its political goals. After making that statement he was suspended from duty and motions were made to court marshal him under Article 88. “Why would the globalists in control of our intelligence community orchestrate such terror? Right after the attacks, Bush’s approval rating went from forty3five percent to ninety3plus percent. The U.S.A. Patriot Act, which effectively eviscerated the Bill of Rights and the Constitution, was passed, radically expanding the scope of the already colossal police state complex.

Revisionists reject that theory, at least as a suff icient account of what happened, maintaining that the attacks cannot be satisfactori ly explained without postulating conspiracy by officials of the US government, at le ast in allowing the attacks to succeed. The choice, accordingly, is simply between (some version of) the received conspiracy theory and (some version of) the revisio nist conspiracy theory.” +David Icke, Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Cente r They are beyond the scope of this book, but suffice to say the “official” versions of many recent events have been far from the reality.

Newspapers present the officia l establishment position of each days’ events, but this is often not the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. President Dwight Eisenhower’s speech+writer Wilson Bryan Key wrote a book called “The Age of Manipulation” all about his experience writing presidential speeches: \"For thirty3six sleepless hours, three writers turn ed out draft after draft, reviewed by a White House deputy press secretary who offered te rse comments like, 'Much too specific!' 'Ease up on factual references!' and 'Ta ke it back and fuzz it up!' 'Fuzz it up,' we discovered eventually, meant avoid all clea r, factual statements about anything more specific than the time of day ... The speech was endlessly discussed for likely audience reactions, belief and attitude rein forcements, and implied meanings ... Would anyone take the empty rhetoric seriously?

They lie by giving uneven and incomplete coverage. Most news articles accurately report the event, but due to li mited space cannot report on the history of each situation. Th is creates a quasi+informed populous that is constantly strung a long with each day’s events; people who feel informed, but re main confused and unable to piece together the conspirat orial control manipulating their minds daily. Another method of manipulation is the old Hegelian Dialectic – control/create both the proper thesis and antithesis to get the desired synthesis result. In the corporate sphere there is Coke/Pepsi, McDonalds/Burger King etc. creating the false dichotomies, the illusions of choice. In the political sphere the bloodlines/societies put membe rs on both sides to control the spectrum. In the media i t is no different. Both parties have long used the media to build the perception of opposing positions on key issues, meanwhile building consensus on other non+ debated issues critical to social change. This is v erified in the Congressional Record for 1917, when Congressman Callawayx reported that: \"In March, 1915, the J.P. Morgan interests, the ste el, shipbuilding, and powder interest, and their subsid iary organizations, got together 12 men high up in the n ewspaper world and employed them to select the most influential newspapers in t he United States and sufficient number of them to control generally the policy of t he daily press ...They found it was only necessary to purchase the control of 25 of the greatest papers.

David Icke calls them “opposames.” For instance, they say the far left i s communism, and the far right is fascism, both meaning dictatorial government contro l. Then through this false thesis/antithesis they promote the synthesis: socialist democracy, a perceived middle ground, which in reality is just another system of dictatorial government control. Where is anarchy on such a scale? Where is a constitutional republic, as America is supposed to be, on that scale? There is no place for non+establishment ideas when the establishment creates false dichotomies that the public perceive as polar opposites. They suppress dissent through omission and promote both sides of the coin they own. “Every day on television stations all over the wor ld, journalists and correspondents give their viewers the official version of the even t they are reporting. ‘White House sources say this..., the Prime Minister says that.. ., the FBI say the other...’ In all my time in journalism I cannot recall a single conversation in a newsroom that didn’t reflect the official version of life and the world.

We are governed, our mind’s are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested largely by men we have never heard of ... we are dominated by a relatively small number of persons who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind and who harness social forces and contrive new ways to bind and guide the world ... It remains a fact in almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by this relatively small number of persons... As civilization has become more complex, and as the ne ed for invisible government has been increasingly demonstrated, the technical means have been invented and developed by which opinion may be regimented.” “I know the secret of making the average American believe anything I want him to.

Ross, “Social Control,” 1901 “Each year the child is coming to belong more to the State and less and less to the parent.” +Ellwood Cubberley, “Conceptions of Education” 1909 Before 1852 American education consisted of one+ room school houses, independent teachers, and students of all ages attending of their own free wi ll. Curriculums and funding came directly from local communities without a federalized bureaucracy ruling over every facet like today. From 1852+1918 things changed as the government began pushing to enforce compulsory schooling laws all across Americ a. These were coupled with new “child labor laws” in an effort to take children of f the farms from under their family’s tutelage and force them into indoctrination camps u nder the government’s tutelage. These laws were met with strenuous opposition at ev ery turn by the US population and unless there was an incredibly well+backed agen da to make sure such laws passed, they would not have. If it was simply a ma tter of what the people in individual states really wanted, child labor and co mpulsory schooling issues would have been dropped as soon as they were raised. “ At first the laws were optional ... later the law was made state3wide but the compulsory period was short (ten to twelve weeks) a nd the age limits low, nine to twelve years. After this, struggle came to extend t he time, often little by little...to"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"extend the age limits downward to eight and seven a nd upwards to fourteen, fifteen or sixteen; to make the law apply to children attendin g private and parochial schools, and to require cooperation from such schools for th e proper handling of cases; to institute state supervision of local enforcement; t o connect school attendance enforcement with the child3labor legislation of the State through a system of working permits.” +Ellwood Cubberley, “Public Education in the United States” 1919/34 Once federalized mandatory schooling was employed c ountrywide, the compulsory attendance of 9+12 year olds, 10+12 weeks a year, w as incrementally lengthened to the point that nowadays 4 year olds are entering pre+sc hools and 26 year old doctors are still being indoctrinated. Ironically the longer s tudents remain in their respective institutions, the more respect they are generally g iven in their field. Thus our “experts” in Medicine, Science, Technology, Philoso phy, Economics, Politics etc. are generally those who have received the most governme nt indoctrination. “Since 1900, and due more to the activity of person s concerned with social legislation and those interested in improving the moral welfare of children than to educators themselves, there has been a general revision of th e compulsory education laws of our States and the enactment of much new child3welfare ... and anti3child3labor legislation ... These laws have brought into the sc hools not only the truant and the incorrigible, who under former conditions either le ft early or were expelled, but also many children ... who have no aptitude for book lea rning and many children of inferior mental qualities who do not profit by ordi nary classroom procedures ...Our schools have come to contain many children who ... become a nuisance in the school and tend to demoralize school procedure.” +Ellwood Cubberley, “Public Education in the United States” 1919/34 At the turn of the 20 th century Cubberley spoke of how children mechanical ly minded, without aptitude for book learning, or of inferior mental capacities, “ become a nuisance in the school and tend to demoralize schoo l procedure .” At the turn of the 21 st century, Bush continues pushing the idea of “No Ch ild Left Behind,” the complete opposite, which expands special+ed at the expense of gifted and talented programs, promotes “outcome+based education” (an at rocious educational philosophy now being promoted), and furthers state control of your children. If you believe in the myth of a benevolent nanny+state that looks out for your best interests from cradle to grave, “No Child Left Behind” might fit well into y our philosophy, but for independent individuals, lovers of freedom, this is the final step in government mind+ control. “In 1909 a factory inspector did an informal survey of 500 working children in 20 factories.

The leading establishment voice was (1889 +1906) US Commissioner of Education William Torrey Harris. Listen to Harris’ words from his 1906, “The Philosophy of Education”: “ Ninety3nine [students] out of a hundred are automat a, careful to walk in prescribed paths, careful to fol low the prescribed custom. This is not an accident but the result of substantial educa tion, which, scientifically defined, is the subsumption of the individual .” Is this a sane “Philosophy of Education” by anyone’s standards? This is the man who gave Ameri ca scientifically age+graded classrooms to replace the long successful practice of mixed+age school houses. In “The Philosophy of Education,” Harris wrote his vis ion of the perfect classroom: “ The great purpose of school can be realized better in d ark, airless, ugly places ... It is to master the physical self, to transcend the beauty o f nature. School should develop the power to withdraw from the external world. ” The first federalized education board was the 1870 founded NEA (National Education Administration) which quickly announced that countr y+wide school science courses must be restructured to teach “evolution” as fact, not theory. Having gained a fair amount of pull in the NEA, in 1903, John. D. Rockef eller created the GEB (General Education Board) in an effort toward “this goal of social control.” Later, in 1923 he would also create the International Education Board providing over $20 million to promote education abroad. The Rockefeller, Carnegi e and Ford groups have often funded (and thus steered) American education more s o even than the government. “Reading through the papers of the Rockefeller Foun dation’s General Education Board 3 an endowment rivaled in school policy influ ence in the first half of the twentieth century only by Andrew Carnegie’s various philanthropies 3 seven curious elements force themselves on the careful reader: 1) There appears a clear intention to mold people through schooling. 2) There is a clear intention to eliminate tradition and scholarship. 3) The net effect of various proje cts is to create a strong class system verging on caste. 4) There is a clear intention to reduce mass critical intelligence while supporting infinite specialization. 5) There is clear intention to weaken parental influence. 6) There is clear intention to overthrow accepted custom. 7) There is striking congruency between the cumulative purposes of GEB projects and the utopian precepts of the oddball religious sect, onc e known as Perfectionism, a secular religion aimed at making the perfection of human na ture, not salvation or happiness, the purpose of existence. The agenda of philanthrop y, which had so much to do with the schools we got, turns out to contain an intense ly political component.” +John Taylor Gatto, “The Underground History of American Education” (201) “One would assume that, since the Rockefellers are thought of as capitalists, they would have used their fortune to foster the philoso phy of individual liberty. But, just the opposite is true. We have been unable to find a single project in the history of the Rockefeller foundations which promotes free enterpr ise ... almost all of the Rockefeller grants have been used directly or indir ectly to promote economic and social collectivism, i.e., Socialism3Fascism.” +Gary Allen, “The Rockefeller File” “Philanthropy is the essential element in the makin g of Rockefeller power.

Notice any trends? Any doubt regarding the Rockefe ller’s intent in starting the GEB should be clarified in John D’s own mission stateme nt: “In our dreams, people yield themselves with perfec t docility to our molding hands. The present education conventions of intellectual a nd character education fade from their minds, and, unhampered by tradition, we work our own good will upon a grateful and responsive folk. We shall not try to m ake these people, or any of their children, into philosophers, or men of science. We have not to raise up from them authors, educators, poets or men of letters. We sha ll not search for great artists, painters, musicians nor lawyers, doctors, preachers , politicians, statesmen – of whom we have an ample supply. The task is simple. We wil l organize children and teach them in a perfect way the things their fathers and mothers are doing in an imperfect way.” +John D. Rockefeller, General Education Board (19 06) This is not a man looking out for the best interest of students. You can get a good sense of his demeanor from statements like “ yield themselves with perfect docility to our molding hands ” and talking about creating a “perfect system” of state education better than imperfect parental education. Martin L uther King Jr., for one, disagrees with John. D. Rockefeller saying: “ The group consisting of mother, father and child is the main educational agency of mankind.” Who do you agree with? Prior to WWI, in a speech to American businessmen, President Woodrow Wilson admitted similar goals as the Rockefellers: “ We want one class to have a liberal education. We want another class, a very much large r class of necessity, to forgo the privilege of a liberal education and fit themselves to perform specific difficult manual tasks .” In 1931, Paul Mantoux, in his foreword to “Inte rnational Understanding” wrote, “And the builder of this new world must be educatio n.... Plainly, the first step in the case of each country is to train an elite to think, feel, and act internationally.” In 1932, continuing their effort to change the phil osophical goals of American education, the Rockefeller/Carnegie dominated NEA c reated the EPC (Educational Policies Commission). Years later the EPC put toge ther its book “Education for All American Youth” which outlined federal programs for health, education and welfare to be combined under one giant bureaucracy. It out lined pre+school programs, sex education classes, and the removal of local control over educational issues “ without seeming to do so .” A 1934 NEA report advised, “ A dying laissez3faire must be completely destroyed and all of us, including the ‘ owners’, must be subjected to a"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"large degree of social control. ” So these education “experts” actually speak of themselves as “owners” and worry about falling unde r “ a large degree of (the) social control ” which they themselves implement. “ The thesis I venture to submit to you is as follows : That during the past forty or fifty years those who are responsible for education have progressively removed from the curriculum of studies the Western culture which pro duced the modern democratic state; That the schools and colleges have, therefor e, been sending out into the world men who no longer understand the creative principle of the society in which they must live; That deprived of their cultural tradition, th e newly educated Western men no longer possess in the form and substance of their o wn minds and spirits and ideas, the premises, the rationale, the logic, the method, the values of the deposited wisdom which are the genius of the development of Western civilization; That the prevailing education is destined, if it continues, to destroy Western civilization and is in fact destroying it.

But I believe the indictment is j ustified and here is a prima facie case for entering this indictment .” +Walter Lippmann, at the Association for the Advancement of Science, December 29 th , 1940 In 1942, the Institute of Pacific Relations publish ed “Post War Worlds.” In it P.E.

At the very heart of all the agencies which will assure the coming of world government must stand the school, the teacher, and the organized profession. \" The next year in 1947 The American Education Fellowship, organized by establishment mi nion John Dewey (of the “Dewey decimal system”) called for the, \" establishment of a genuine world order, an order in which national sovereignty is subordinate to world authority .\" In October, 1947, NEA Associate Secretary William Carr wrote in the NEA Journal that teachers should, \" teach about the various proposals that have been ma de for the strengthening of the United Nations and the establishment of a wo rld citizenship and world government. \" “It was natural businessmen should devote themselve s to something besides business; that they should seek to influence the enactment an d administration of laws, national and international, and that they should try to cont rol education.” +Max Otto, “Science and the Moral Life,” 1949 Elitist Committee of 300 philosopher, Bertrand Russ ell, in his 1951 book “The Impact of Science on Society,” wrote, “ Education should aim at destroying free will so tha t after pupils are thus schooled they will be incapab le throughout the rest of their lives of thinking or acting otherwise than as their schoo l masters would have wished....

When the techn ique has been perfected, every government that has been in charge of education for more than one generation will be able to control its subjects securely without the n eed of armies or policemen.” In 1953, Carroll Reece, Tennessee Congressman and C hairman of the RNC (Republican National Committee) along with research director Norman Dodd, and lawyer Rene Wormser, performed the first and only i n+depth investigation into the activities of the Rockefeller, Carnegie, and Ford f oundations and their effect on American education. Rene Wormser wrote that the Re ece investigation, “ leads one to the conclusion that there was, indeed, something in the nature of an actual conspiracy among certain leading educators in the United State s to bring about socialism through the use of our school systems. ” They discovered that the Rockefeller foundation was the primary culprit behind the NEA’s rapidly changing policies and the teaching of socialism in America’s schools/univ ersities. Wormser continued, “ A very powerful complex of foundations and allied org anizations has developed over the years to exercise a high degree of control over edu cation. Part of this complex, and ultimately responsible for it, are the Rockefeller and Carnegie groups. ” During a personal meeting, President Rowan Gaither of the Ford Foundation told Reece Committee research director Norman Dodd that, “ all of us here at the policy making level of the foundation have at one time or another served in the OSS [pre3 cursor to the CIA] or the European Economic Adminis tration, operating under directives from the White House. We operate under t hose same directives ... The substance under which we operate is that we shall u se our grant making power to so alter life in the United States that we can be comf ortably merged with the Soviet Union. ” As their meeting turned from civil to threatenin g, Gaither warned Dodd, “ If you proceed with the investigation as you have outl ined, you will be killed .” “This was the situation in the 1950s when the Reece Committee briefly investigated. The Rockefeller3Carnegie groups have continued basi cally unopposed for the next 40 years in controlling education. One of the educatio nal book producers is Grolier, Inc. Avery Rockefeller, Jr. sits on Grolier, Inc. board meetings. Another interesting board member is Theodore WaIler who is the director of Gr olier, Inc. He was a member of the International Book Committee of UNESCO.” –Fritz Springmeier, “Bloodlines of the Illuminati” In the mid+sixties the Education Department produce d a document called “Designing Education” which advised each state to “ lose its independent identity as well as its authority,” in order to “ form a partnership with the federal government .” Another important document at the time was Benjamin Bloom’s “Taxonomy of Educational Objectives” which was used as “ a tool to classify the ways individuals are to act, think, or feel as the result of some unit of instru ction. ” Using B.F. Skinner’s operant conditioning and other new behavioral psychology mo dels, American education shifted focus toward emotional/outcome+based learni ng, so+called “values clarification” and “sensitivity training.” As noted by Ph.D. Superintendent of South St. Paul, Minnesota schools, Ray I. Powell, in 1975 , “ It’s all brainwashing!” In 1981, the NEA published the Special Committee on Instructional Technology Report, which as usual, addressed the public/childr en as lumps of clay to be molded to"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"suit their will: “ In its coming involvement with a technology of inst ruction, the profession will be faced again with the challenge o f leadership – by example and by effective communication – the challenge of convinci ng the public that education is much more than treating students like so many Pavlo vian dogs, to be conditioned and programmed into docile acceptance of a do3it3yourse lf blueprint of the Good Life .” Through “outcome+based” learning and other sophisti cated standardized mind+control methods which continue being refined to present day, our government schools are perpetually preparing a new workforce for job specialization. “Outcome3based education, because it concentrates on the ‘end product’ of its process, can be said to restrict the student’s mental functioning ... Success in an outcome3based environment is restricted to performing prescribed tasks to the point of automaticity. The functions of memory and creativity are not used, nor are they considered necessary to succeed in an OBE program or any program that uses Skinnerian mastery learning or direct instruction. Predictability is the bottom li ne for OBE, limiting the student to only those responses which are prescribed. When trained by OBE methodology, the student cannot fail unless he employs creativity and produces an unpredicted resp onse. In an OBE environment, he can believe only that which is acceptable. The most predictable outcome, over time, is frustration 3 and ultimately, low achievement and b ehavior problems.” +Charlotte Iserbyt, “Deliberate Dumbing Down of America” (322) “Schools at present are the occupation of children; children have become employees, pensioners of the government at an early age. But g overnment jobs are frequently not really jobs at all—that certainly is the case in th e matter of being a schoolchild. There is nothing or very little to do in school, but one thing is demanded—that children must attend, condemned to hours of desperation, pretendi ng to do a job that doesn’t exist.

Iserbyt h as long been an appreciated voice of opposition to outcome+based education and Skinnerian methodology. She recently compiled a mammoth, informative expose on the devolution of American education called “The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America.” She explains how, “An alien collectivist (socialist) philosophy, much of which came from Europe, crashed onto the shores of our nation, bringing with it radical changes in economics,"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"politics, and education, funded 3 surprisingly enou gh 3 by several wealthy American families and their tax3exempt foundations.

The training field for these grotesque human qualit ies is the classroom. Schools train individuals to respond as a mass. Boys and girls are drilled in being bored, frightened, envious, emotionally needy, and generally incomplete. A successful mass production economy requires such a clientele. A small business, small farm economy like that of the Amish requires individual competence, thoughtfulness, compassion, and universal participation; our own requires a managed mass of leveled, spiritless, anxious, familyless, friendless, godless, and obedient people who believe the difference between Cheers and Seinfeld is a subject worth arguing about. An executive director of the National Education Association announced that his organization expected ‘to accomplish by education what dictators in Europe are seeking to do by compulsion and force.’ You can’t get much clearer than that. WWII drove the project underground, but hardl y retarded its momentum. Following cessation of global hostilities, school b ecame a major domestic battleground for the scientific rationalization of social affairs through compulsory indoctrination.” It is very important for both governments and corpo rations that schools constantly churn out unquestioning, uninformed sheeple crushed of creativity and individuality, who are emotionally needy, respond in group+think p atterns, and find their only reprieve in materialism/advertising.

It wasn’t made for the benefit of kids and families as those individuals and institutions would define their own needs. School is the first impression children get of organized s ociety; like most first impressions, it is the lasting one.

Modern schools create uniformity, whi le suppressing skepticism and creativity. They over+develop competitive spirit w hile undermining compassion and curiosity. They promote cliques, gangs, small grou p mentalities, and “small+picture” thinkers. Grading and testing procedures hinder “b ig+picture” understanding of any subject and force students to focus on more simple, gradable aspects. True education and mastery of the subjects at hand are not encoura ged or even feasible. Students are merely required to memorize trivial information lik e names, dates, places, events etc. just long enough to regurgitate for standardized mu ltiple+choice tests. Then after examination, the trivial info stored in their short +term memory disappears along with their superficial understandings of each subject. “ We are students of words; we are shut up in schools , and colleges, and recitation rooms, for ten or fifteen years, and come out at la st with a bag of wind, a memory of words, and do not know a thing.” –Ralph Waldo Emerson “That erroneous assumption is to the effect that th e aim of public education is to fill the young of the species with knowledge and awaken their intelligence, and so make them fit to discharge the duties of citizenship in an enlightened and independent manner.

The le ft brain is the area which deals with the physical world view, ‘rational’ thought and all that can be seen, touched, heard and smelled. The right brain is our intuition and o ur connection with higher dimensions. This is where you find the artist and c reativity, inspired by our uniqueness of thought and expression. The education system and its offshoots, like the media and science, are designed to speak to the lef t brain and to switch off right brain thinking. This is why spending on the arts in schoo ls is being cut back all over the world and rigid, left brain programs imposed. ‘Educ ation’ fills the left brain with information, much of which is untrue and inaccurate , and it demands that this is stored and then regurgitated on the exam paper. If you do this like a robot you pass. If, however, you filter the information through the right brain and say ‘Hey, this is piece of shit’, you won’t pass even though you will be telling the truth. Isn’t education just wonderful?” +David Icke, “The Biggest Secret” (481+2) It has been demonstrated if you read the brain+wave s of a typical American, left+brain neurons are constantly more active than right.

Luis Pasteur, shortly before he died, stated that he was possibly mistaken about his germ theory. He said that germs and viruses might be the result of the disease instead of the cause. The way this could be explained is that the body overlo ads on toxic build3up and produces symptoms of stress, then necessary bacteria or viru ses move in to scavenge the toxins, creating an abundance of these in the system, and l eaving a super toxic waste by3 product behind, which the body has a difficult time expelling. Therefore the presence of the virus or high bacteria count is a result of the disease and not the cause. A couple of very important things to realize when con sidering this possibility are: 1. A person does not need to be exposed to another indiv idual to come down with a cold. People living in small communities with no outside exposure can come down with colds and disease. 2. People with no disease can sl eep with people and exchange bodily fluids with people with HIV and not be infec ted. Considering these facts further weakens the Germ Theory of Disease.

And Litton Industries was given over $5 billion in military co ntracts during the first term of the Nixon administration, $10 million of which went tow ards the development of AIDS3 like viruses.” +Dr. Len Horowitz in a speech before the Citizens Against Legal Loopholes Rally, The Capitol Mall, 1996 During his speech at the Capitol Mall and in his bo ok “Emerging Viruses: AIDS and Ebola”, Harvard graduate, Dr. Len Horowitz exposed how Henry Kissinger, the Rockefellers, and other NWO minions funded and created AIDS, Ebola, and other viruses a s bioweapons to suit their depopulation agenda. “You will learn that Dr. Robert Gallo, the famous NCI molecular biologist, pardoned by President Clinton last year for scientific fraud and miscondu ct, and credited with the discovery of the AIDS virus, set about to develop immune system ravaging, AIDS3like viruses, along with other Litton Bionetics researchers. You will learn that they took monkey viruses that were humanly benign, recombined them w ith DNA, RNA, and enzymes from other animal viruses that caused leukemias, ly mphomas, and sarcomas, and then to get them to jump species, they cultured these ne w mutant viruses in human white blood cells in some studies, and human fetal tissue cells in other studies, to produce immune3system3destroying, cancer3causing viruses th at could enter humans and produce virtually identical effects to what the AID S virus is currently doing in people around the world ... In the end, the research questio n I asked, ‘Did these viruses, AIDS and Ebola, evolve naturally, were they acciden tally produced, or were they intentionally created and deployed?’ I conclude, un questionably, they are not natural. I leave you the reader, and concerned citizens of A merica and the world, to decide whether it was a horrible accident or treacherous c overt population control experiment.” +Dr. Len Horowitz in a speech before the Citizens Against Legal Loopholes Rally, The Capitol Mall, 1996 “I suddenly realized how easy it was to access info rmation I assumed would be classified.

Before he left, I asked how I might locate the docu ments I had just learned about. He told me they were on mic rofilm two floors up. Within a couple of hours, I had retr ieved and read them all. Apparently, several researchers thr oughout the world 3 Dr. John Seale from London, Dr. Manuel Servin in Mexico, and Dr. Jacobo Segal from Berlin 3 had a lleged what Strecker had. The Russian report even cited a West German company named OTRAG for having conducted green monkey virus experiments in Zaire that had al legedly led to the development of ‘a mutant virus that woul d be a human killer.’” +Dr. Len Horowitz, “Emerging Viruses: AIDS and Ebola” (61) Dr. Robert Strecker was one of the first to publish peer reviewed work regarding the origin of the AIDS virus. He found that there are no genetic markers in the AIDS virus typical of the primate, and that it simply ca nnot thrive in monkeys. He found that AIDS was non+existent in Africa before 1975 an d yet supposedly resulted from a 1940s monkey bite. Even if it had, he showed how t he resulting epidemic would have occurred in the 1960s, not the late 70s. Also if g reen monkeys were responsible for AIDS, the Pygmies of rural Africa should have many more AIDS cases than the urban populations, but the opposite is true. Strecker filed a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain documents showing that the US Department of Defense appropriated $10 million in 1969 to studying immune+system+destroying agents to be used for germ warfare. It was just shortly after this that the World Health Organization (WHO) began experimenting with a lymphotrophic virus, produced in cows, to use on humans. They found, as Strecker did, that AIDS thrives in cows and cow carcasses and Bovine Lymphotrophic Virus (BLV) is very similar to HIV. “Literature provided by The Strecker Groups urged readers to: ‘PLEASE WAKE UP! In 1969 ... [the] United States Defense Department requested and got $10 million to make the AIDS viru s in labs as a political/ethnic weapon to be used mainly against Blacks. The feasib ility program and labs were to have been completed by 197431975; the virus between 197431979. The World Health Organization started to inject AIDS3laced smallpox vaccine into over 100 million Africans (population reduction) in 1977. And over 2 000 young white male homosexuals (Trojan horse) in 1978 with the hepatit is B vaccine through the Centers for Disease Control/New York Blood Center.’ Collin, in his review, added: ‘Strecker remarks that it would be relatively easy to implant such viruses in the cow carcasses"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"used to produce the smallpox vaccine. When the smal lpox vaccine sera were recovered from the animal carcasses, animallymphotr ophic viruses could be carried or mutated or incorporated in the vaccine ... the epi demiology of multiple ‘contaminated’ smallpox vaccines given in the early 1970s would provide exactly the right timetable for such a widespread AIDS epidemic in Africa today.\" +Dr. Len Horowitz, “Emerging Viruses: AIDS and Ebola” (17) The original story propagated by the mass media was that AIDS was introduced to the human population by African green monkeys. Suppose dly an African was bitten or had sex with a monkey, then brought it into the US gay population. In an interview with Robert Strecker, Len Horowitz asked, “ But what about the green monkey theory 3 the theory that a green monkey bit an African or someone had sex with an ape?” To which Dr. Strecker replied, “That's just nonsense. . . . Green monkeys are abou t the size of chickens. So the idea of a human having sex with a female monkey the size of a chicken is, of course, absurd. In addition, the th eory that a transmission occurred through biting, of course, is always said to be clo se to impossible. If you look at the CDC and everybody else, they say that biting is not an easy way to spread these diseases except in the case of the purported green monkey which is suddenly the way it was spread.” (98) In 1977 WHO launched a major smallpox vaccine campa ign in Africa which began the rapid spread of AIDS there. Then in 1978 the C enter for Disease Control (CDC) targeted 2000 gay men, ones who specifically had mu ltiple sexual partners, and gave them laced hepatitis B vaccines. The shots, manufa ctured by Merck, were administered in New York, San Francisco, Los Angele s, St. Louis, Houston, and Chicago + the same 6 US cities with the highest inc idence rates and death rates from AIDS. Continuing with Dr. Horowitz and Dr. Strecker’s int erview, they shed some light on the motive behind this scam. Strecker posits that the reason for intentionally infecting gays was because little would be done about it: “ If you look in the world, what percentage of the world's AIDS cases are heterosexu als? Over 90 percent ... It's only in this country that you have this strange, unexpla ined predominance of homosexuals ... Just think about this. Suppose you put this virus in the heterosexuals or kids. What kind of response would have occurred compared to th e response that did occur? ” (109+10) Beyond all this, it has been repeatedly shown that 1). HIV does not even lead to AIDS, 2). AIDS is actually a forced amalgamation of 30 different immune ailments into one misnomer, and 3). The drug “AZT” administe red to HIV/AIDS patients actually further suppresses the immune system! “In the case of AIDS, I showed that HIV was never p roved to cause anything. I also showed that AIDS was not one thing. AIDS was in tru th a variety of states of immune suppression brought about, in different groups and, ultimately, different individuals by a large number of DIFFERENT causes ... In this res earch you are about to read, which took place between 1986 and 1988, I also real ized that AIDS was a perfect cover story for a covert targeting of populations, from gay men in NYC to Africans in Uganda. Because, if you labeled them with AIDS, alr eady a kind of hypnotic death sentence, and then you treated them with highly tox ic drugs like AZT, and you also, in"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"effect, concealed what was really making them sick, you had DEPOPULATION ON THE MARCH.” +Jon Rappoport, “AIDS Inc. Scandal of the Century ” (1) A colleague of Robert Gallo, the AIDS “discoverer,” molecular biologist Peter Duesberg, has a very different perspective from his associates. In Spin Magazine January 1988, Duesberg told reporter Celia Farber t hat, \" Scientists researching AIDS are much less inclined to ask scrutinizing question s about the etiology (cause) of AIDS when they have invested huge sums of money in companies that make money on the hypothesis that HIV is the AIDS virus. William Haseltine and Max Essex, for example, who are two of the top five AIDS researche rs in the country, have millions in stocks in a company they founded that has developed and will sell AIDS kits that test for HIV. How could they be objective? Gallo stands to make a lot of money from patent rights on the virus. His entire reputation d epends on this virus. If HIV is not the cause of AIDS, there's nothing left for Gallo. \" In an interview with author Jon Rappoport, Peter Duesberg continued describing the facts of life in medical research: “ You have to be at NIH to see how they think. They're very, very concerned with the next research step. The step that comes after what they've just discovered. You could remind them that the kind of virus they're studying, HIV, just doesn 't really qualify to cause a disease like AIDS, and th ey would understand what you were saying, and they might even agree with you, as far as general principles were concerned. But then they'd turn around and go right back to working on what they were doing before they talked to you ... It's very hard to talk to a person who has a contract with a drug company in his pocket. How do you know that he's telling you the truth? Times have changed. Thi s is high stakes science, financially .” (40+41) “ I continued to find chemicals that could produce AI DS symptoms. But I also came across other factors which could cause these sympto ms. Like chemicals, they had nothing to do with the fabled HIV virus. The most i mportant one was starvation, long3 term chronic malnutrition. It can occur on one leve l among junkies, it can occur on an entirely different scale among people of the Thi rd World. Malnutrition is recognized as the single largest source of immune3s uppression in the world. The current definitions of AIDS in the Third World now accept, by and large, three symptoms as central to AIDS: weight3loss of 10% or more (wasting away), chronic diarrhea, and chronic fever. These are also signs o f chronic malnutrition. Diarrhea, through bringing on severe dehydration, is traditio nally one of three largest killers in the world. This is nothing new. The reason these th ree symptoms are being used as front3line indicators of AIDS involves widespread l ack of lab testing facilities in Third World countries. Doctors are meant to use these ind icators to do fast, on3the3spot diagnoses of AIDS. In such a situation, numbers of AIDS cases will skyrocket, and a hidden equality will be established between AIDS an d hunger. But the ‘disease’ is hunger, not AIDS. ” +Jon Rappoport, “AIDS Inc. Scandal of the Centur y” (17+18) "},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Millions upon millions of Africans have been and co ntinue being misdiagnosed and given AZT when they need food. On top of this, mos t of the hunger and poverty in Africa today was stirred up and created by western nations. Hunger and poverty are not natural states of being, even for so+called “th ird world” nations. In fact when first world charity organizations “help” poorer countries with food and medication, the long+term result always hurts the populations and h elps western corporate/pharmacratic imperialism. Even food dona tions have eventual damaging effects. Farmers and others essential to local eco nomies find it easier to stand in lines getting free food handed to them than it is to work the land. That is until the donations stop coming in or move to a different loc ation; by that time the villagers are dependent on their regular food deliveries, local p ower structures change to reflect this, and food/food distribution is used as a weapo n by western power brokers. “The truth is, AIDS is not a single illness, it is an international operation, a business, a bureaucracy. It is, in the Third World, a way of substituting harmful medical drugs for what is needed: food. With AIDS, an attempt is being made to reduce varieties of suffering and political conflict and starvation and chemical abuse to a single entity. Since that viral entity, HIV, is sensational and fr ightening, it satisfies the desire not to think, not to learn, not to find out what is happen ing in a world of troubles. It is also easier to dump corrosive medical drugs and pesticid es on the Third World than to face up to their widening toxic effect on people. E asier to call their symptoms AIDS. What happens when you try to paint a portrait of an area said to have AIDS, and you find, instead, a combination of drugs, pesticides, starvation, older diseases, and other environmental factors, all capable of causing immun osuppression, all capable of producing the symptoms of what is called AIDS? What happens is, if you want to satisfy your medical peers, if you want to win rese arch grant monies, you overlook the anomalies and say it's all AIDS. If you don't, you admit the picture is diverse and confused. You face facts. You lose grants.” +Jon Rappoport, “AIDS Inc. Scandal of the Century” (19+20) AZT, the HIV/AIDS medication, was approved by the F DA in record time, granted a treatment/recommendation in less than five days and full pharmaceutical licensing in less than six months. AZT specifically damages bon e marrow, the site where raw materials for immune cells are manufactured. Thus they are prescribing an immune+ suppressant to treat immune+system problems. Essen tially, if you didn’t have AIDS before taking AZT, you’re going to have it shortly thereafter. In his interview with Jon Rappoport, Peter Duesberg said AZT “ is hell for the bone marrow... It kills normal cells quite, quite extens ively ... AZT is a poison. It is cytotoxic. I think that giving it to people with AI DS is highly irresponsible... the drug is only going to hurt you ... And now they are giving it to people with no symptoms. It's supposed to prevent HIV from replicating, yet they can find no evidence that HIV is replicating in the first place. ” (42+3) “Kary Mullis, the winner of the Nobel Prize in chem istry for his invention of the PCR process that amplifies gene3fragments has come to Duesberg's defense.

For example, the dove symbolizes peace to most people, but to the Il luminati bloodlines it represents their goddess, Queen Semiramis [Isis]. The lighted torch means freedom and liberty to the population, but to the Illuminati it is the very symbol of their agenda and control. The Nazis reversed the ancient symbol of t he swastika to symbolize the negative and Satanists have reversed the pentagram to point downwards for the same reason.

On his grave in Arlington Cemetery they lighted an “eternal flame” which still burns to this day. Over the Pont de L’Alma tunnel in Paris where Princess Diana was murdered after crashing into the 13 th pillar, the Illuminati erected a huge golden torch/flame sitting atop a black pentag ram. On the island where Diana lies buried was placed yet another depiction of the Illuminati flame. “The Brotherhood is telling us that they killed Kennedy and Diana, but unless you understand their symbolic language, you don’t know.” +David Icke, “The Biggest Secret” (352) At ground+zero of the World Trade Center shortly after 9/11 they lit another “eternal flame” for the victims. Overlooking the fallen World Trade Center buildings in New York Harbor stands the Freemasonic Statue of Liberty also holding up the Illuminati to rch. Another few blocks away in Rockefeller Center, the Rockefellers erected a huge golden statue of Prometheus carrying the lighted torch. This Illuminati symbol is found on the dime, the D.

The French word for dove is still colombe. This is why a man who si gned his name ‘Colon’ is known to official history as ‘Columbus’. He was bearing the branch of the dove into the Americas in 1492 and was given this symbolic name r elating to the Illuminati goddess.” –David Icke, “Tales from the Time Loop” “The symbols of the three main political parties in the United Kingdom which serve the structure headed by the Queen are the lig hted torch (Conservatives), the red rose (Labor) and the dove (Liberal Democrats)!

One symbolic interpretation of the pyramid is the human sitting in a cross+legged meditative position. The meditator’s knees/buttock s are the four bottom points and the head is the top point.

Why does “ every heart ring true for the red, white, and blue?” What about the gold+fringed flag used by the military, hung at all courts, schools, and government buildings? It all has to do with the British Maritime Admiralty Law of Flags. “This is also known as British Maritime (military) Law and this is why the American flag always has a gold fringe when displayed in the courts of the United States. You find the same in government buildings and federally funded schools. The gold fr inge is a legal symbol indicating that the court is sitting under British Maritime La w and the Uniform Commercial Code 3 military and merchant law not common or cons titutional law, under the Admiralty Law of Flags, the flag displayed gives no tice of the law under which the ship (in this case the court) is regulated.

Through a legal looph ole the royals have created, US citizens are considered property of the queen under British Maritime law. Since we are born of our mother’s water, from her “birth can al,” we are thereby a maritime product, a “shipped” commodity.

No other hospital a reas are called wards. Prisons have wards and wardens. The United States Corporation came about just after the civil war. The Act of 1871 was passed by congress creating a separate form of government for DC, essentially turning it into a corporation. It was decided that employees would be called “citizens.” So when you say in court or on paper, that you are a citizen of the United States, you are not a free American, but an employe e of US Inc.

As I have been writing for many ye ars, the power that controls America is based in Britain and Europe because that is where the power is located that owns the United States Corporation. By the way , if you think it is strange that a court on dry land could be administered under Marit ime Law, look at US Code, Title 18 B 7. It says that Admiralty Jurisdiction is appl icable in the following locations: (1) the high seas; (2) any American ship; (3) any lands reserved or acquired for the use of the United States, and under the exclusive or co ncurrent jurisdiction thereof, or any place purchased or otherwise acquired by the Un ited States by consent of the legislature of the state. In other words, mainland America. All this is founded on Roman law because the Illuminati have been playing this same game throughout the centuries wherever they have gone. The major politi cians know that this is how things are and so do the government administrators, judges , lawyers and insider 'journalists'. Those who realize what is happening and ask the court for the name of the true creditor or recipients of the fines impose d by the 'legal system' are always refused this information by the judge.

When something comes “out of the blue” does that mean “out of nowhere” or could it mean from Masonry? Much of Hip+Hop culture (including the name Hip+Hop with the twin HH symbolism) comes from Masonry as well, i.e. notice Will Smith in “HitcH,” his hands on the twin H’s in the poster). When gang members roll up one pant leg to symbolize their crew, this tradition comes from the Masonic first degree ritual. Initia tes must roll up their pant+leg for undisclosed reasons while being blind+folded and le d around by a noose. All the so+ called gang signs are Masonic mudras, such as the W est side and East side gang sings. Names like Crips and Bloods may well have come from “the Hood,” but the recurring Death theme screams Freemasonry. It’s none other than the Grim Reaper who wears a “Hood.” Calling each other G no doubt comes from the Freemasonic G, and what is a G+angst+er but a G in angst, flashing signs, rolling up pant legs, and calling friends Dogs and Bitches?

He was formerly CEO of Rocawear and refers to himself as a Rockafella. In his 1996 song “D’Evils,” Jay+Z has lyrics like “ Illuminati want my mind, soul, and my body ,” and “ Secret society trying to keep their eye one me. ” His significant other Beyonce is often photographed wearing a skull and crossbones b elt buckle. House of Pain says in their 1992 song Jump Around, “ Do you know about the Masons and their nation? To the 33 rd degree, you know that’s me .” So when Hip+Hop group “The Coup” (as in military coup), creates a June 2001 album cover showing the World Trade Center towers being demolished, is it just coincidence? Masons didn't just create Blues and Hip+Hop; they also created \"Rock\" and Roll. Why would anyone but a Mason choose this name? Tavistock Institutue exports the Rolling Stones and the Beatles were cal led \"the British invasion\" (Notice Lennon gives the El Diablo sign and they sing Ob+La+ Di, Ob+La+Da = Oh El Diablo). The Rolling Stones s ang Little Queen, Like a Rolling Stone, You Got Me Rocking, If You Can’t Rock Me, It’s Only Rock and Roll, Let it Rock, Reelin’ and Rockin’, and Rocks Off. The band Queen sang We Will Rock You, Stone Cold Crazy, Rock it, Rollin’ Over, Hammer to Fall, Killer Queen, and Bohemian (Grove) Rhapsody. Simon and Garfunkel bluntly sang I am a Rock and She Loves me Like a Rock. B.B. King sang My Heart Beats Like a Hammer, Rock Me Baby, and You’re Still a Square (as in Mason’s compass and square). Bob Dylan sang Rocks and Gravel, Like a Rolling Stone, and Get Your Rocks Off! Black Sabbath sang Stonehenge, The Sabbath Stones, Rock n’ Roll Doctor, and The Hand that Rock s the Cradle. The Stone Roses sang Made of Stone and Elephant Stone. Rocks, Stones and Hammers are a few of the more obvious symbols used constantly by the Stone Masons. Masons have their drinks “on the rocks” and catch you “between a rock and a hard place.” You’re just “a stone’s throw away” and “kill two birds with one stone.” Masonry is a fraternal organization with secrets passed from fathers onto sons, hence “a chip off the old block.” The old block is the father Master Mason and the chip is th e son apprentice+level.

Ja mes Cameron and Walt Disney (Touchstone) are/were 33 rd degree. Many big directors like Jerry Bruckheimer, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, and Tim Burton repeatedly show Masonic imagery in their films. Paramount, Tri+Star, Columbia, Orion, Icon, Lion’s Gate, DreamWorks, and 20 th Century Fox all have Masonic/occult symbolism in their logos. The found er of Paramount, Hollywood’s very first director, was a M ason. “Between a rock and a hard place” is one of many Masonic phrases said in “The Rock” with 33 rd degree Mason Sean Connery who played a character named Mason. Nicholas Cage played alongside Connery in The Rock and later Cage starred in National Treasur e, another movie also about Masonry. His father in th e movie was Jon Voigt. In real life, Jon Voigt is th e father of Angelina Jolie who in real life is a memb er of the CFR and the UN – two Masonic/Illuminati creations. In the movie Tomb Raider 2, however, Jolie plays a role in which she defeats the Illumin ati featuring a scene at the capstone of a pyramid.

Wynn Westcott, “The Occult Power of Numbers” (15) The numbers 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 33 and all multiples of them have esoteric meaning to the Brotherhood and are used in a variety of ways.

Is it an arrogant calling+card to share/show with other secr et society initiates? Are they lucky numbers? Or do the numerals themselves contain som e more mystical quality? All of the above. “These number codes have even deeper meanings than the more obvious ones of days, months, and the zodiac. Numbers also represent vibr ational frequencies. Every frequency resonates to a certain number, color and sound. Some frequencies, represented by numbers, colors and sounds, are part icularly powerful. Symbols also represent frequencies and they affect the subconsci ous without the person realizing it is happening. This is another reason why certain sy mbols are seen in secret societies, national flags, company logos, advertising and so o n.” +David Icke, “The Biggest Secret” (83) 5 Why is the highest military rank a 5+star general, who wears 5, 5+pointed gold stars? Why do Sheriffs wear a 6+pointed gold star? What d o these occult amulets/symbols have to do with protecting the country? “In Kritias, Plato wrote that the numbers 5 and 6 were sacred in Atlantis, where they were encoded in architecture, art, and ceremonial life ‘to honor th e odd and even days.’ The Atlanteans’ choice of these numerals reflects their holistic religion, the ‘Nav el of the World,’ whose adherents strove for spiritual synthesis and balance. The number 5 represents the male principle of conscious outward action, while 6 stands for female intuitive receptivity.” +Frank Joseph, “The Atlantis Encyclopedia” (206) The Atlantis significance will become more importan t later on, but for now suffice to say 5 represents the male principle of outward acti on. Ancient cultures all over the world shared the belief that the Sun represented th e male principle while the Moon represented the female. So a “soldier,” or Sun war rior, wearing 5, 5+pointed golden stars most certainly resonates strongly the male pr inciple/energy. Modern occultists believe 5 to be the Number of Dea th. The greatest intensification of any number is its triplicate, making 555 literal ly \"Highest Death.” Could this be why the highest military rank (5+star generals) wea r 5, 5+pointed stars on their uniform?

Both the notorious Illuminists John D. Rockefeller and Amschel Bauer Rothschild had 5 sons. Massachusetts governor and 2008 presid ential candidate Mormon Mitt Romney also has 5 sons. Again if 5 is the male en ergy of outward action, then 5 sons/suns is the highest resonator of that principl e. It is also interesting that so many of the corporate pre+planned boy/girl bands, bands created by corporations, not by the musicians themselves, such as the Spice Girls, Pussy Cat Dolls, New Kids on the Block , Backstreet Boys, and N’Sync all have 5 band members and each member represents/acts/dresses in a certain un ique way – the bad boy, the pretty boy, the prep, the hippie , etc. The whole idea seems to follow an occult/zodiacal agend a, using personality types to sell products. “In ancient and modern occultism the “E” is very important because it represents the fifth essence or the quintessence ...

Later in the chapter on Astrotheology it will be shown how these 12s relate to the 12 signs of the zodiac, the 12 mo nths of the year, the 12 hours of day and 12 hours of night. We also have 12 days of Chr istmas, 12 grades in school, 12 step+programs, 12 jurors, 12 notes before the octav e, 12 eggs in a dozen, 12 inches in a foot, Majestic+12, and 12 years of childhood befo re the “teens” and the Jewish Barmitsfa at 13. “A common theme in all mystery school traditions is of 12 disciples, knights or followers surrounding a deity. The number 12 is a code, among other things, for the 12 months of the year and the houses of the zodiac through which symbolically travels the Sun, the ‘god’, symbolized as 13. This is the ‘sacred 12 and one’ as some people describe it and it is one major reason why the numbers 12 and 13 keep recurring. Thus you have the 12 tribes of Israel, 12 princes of Ishmael, 12 disciples or followers of Jesus, Buddha, Osiris and Quetzalcoatl.

There are only 12 months in the Gregorian sun calendar but there are 13 months in the lunar calendar. 13 represents the moon and the female energy, the essence of which has long been silenced by the Illuminati and religious Sun/Son worship. This is why 13 is propagated in popular+ culture as being an unlucky number. It is meant to be unlucky for you, not for the initiated elites who understand its mystical qualit ies. In the Old Testament, the number 13 takes on the co nnotation of revolution and rebellion. Genesis 14+4 reads, “Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and the thirteenth year they rebelled.” \"Hence every occurrence of the number thirteen, and likewise of every multiple of it, stamps that with which it stands in connection with rebellion, apostasy, defection, corruption, disintegration, revolution, or some kindred idea.\" +E.W.

First, there are exactly 33 turns in a complete seq uence of human DNA. This biological fact was likely known by the ancients, w hom as will later be shown, were far more advanced scientifically/technologically th an portrayed in the Rockefeller textbooks and Rothschild media. The second signifi cant 33 is the number of vertebrae in the human spine. In ancient Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini serpent+energy is said to rise from the root chakra, coiling up and around the spine until illuminating the crown chakra of spiritual enlightenment. This may sound like bogus Eastern mysticism until this sacred number 33 shows parallels in the world of Western o ccult studies. The ancient Hebrew/Kabalistic “Tree of Life” contains 33 permut ations of consciousness + 22 paths, 10 known/drawn sephiroth, and an 11 th hidden sephiroth left undrawn in most renditions. Just as the Kundalini serpent coils up the 33 vertebrae of the spine, the Tree of Life is often drawn with a serpent coiling up and around, showing the path to take towards Kether, the crown (chakra). "},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"“The Paths represent the successive stages of the u nfolding of cosmic realization in human consciousness; in old pictures a serpent is o ften depicted as twined about the boughs of the Tree. This is the serpent Nechushtan ‘who holdeth his tail in his mouth,’ the symbol of wisdom and initiation. The coils of this serpent, when correctly arranged upon the Tree, cross each of the Paths in succession and seem to indicate the order in which they should be numbered. Witb the help of this glyph, then, it is a simple matter to arrange all the tables of symbols in their correct positions upon the Tree, granted that the symbols are given in their correct order in the tables. In certain modern books which rank as authorities upon the subject the correct order is not given, the writers apparently holding that this should not be revealed to the uninitiated. But as this order is given correctly in certain older books, and, for the matter of that, in the Bible itself and the Qabalistic literature, there seems to me no point in deliberately misleading students with spurious information.” +Dion Fortune, “The Mystical Qabbalah” (25+6) \"A symbol for the limbic system and the kundalini e nergy, the lizard, also represents the cyclical movement of energy through the univers e and the space/time continuum: birth3death3rebirth ad infinitum.\" +Aurum Solis “Many people regard Kundalini as a new age fad. No thing could be further from the truth. Kundalini can be considered the oldest know n science. In previous ages, people raised Kundalini under the guidance of teach ers and in controlled circumstances, preserving what they learned as an e soteric knowledge. But we have entered a period of time in which the esoteric becomes exoteric.” +Genevieve Lewis Paulson, “Kundalini and the Chakras” (7) The serpent wound around the tree that talks with Eve in Genesis references this process of spiritual illumination. The ancient caduceus symbol of Hermes/Mercury/Thoth, now used by the western pharmaceutical industry, also symbolizes this process. Two intertwining snakes (which look exactly like our 33 sequence double+helix DNA) climb a straight, vertical pole (which looks like our 33 vertebrae spine) and end at the “circle of light” crown chakra which has sprouted wings.

The origin of this symbology goes back to the ancient Atlantean myth, pre+cursor to the Genesis story. At the center of Atlas’ garden was the great Tree of Life, just as in the Garden of Eden. This tree produced unique golden apples of immortality, reserved only for the most purified and holy beings. Atlas’ 7 daughters were known as “the Hesperides” and their main duty was tending and defending the Tree of Life. Assisting them in its protection was a familiar friend coiled around the tree. “To assist the Hesperides in its protection, a serp ent called Ladon entwined about the bough ... The Hesperides are sometimes given as seven in number. As such, they may correspond to the seven major chakras, or metaphysi cal energy centers that, collectively, comprise the human personality. So to o, the Tree of Life symbolizes the spinal column, along wh ich the chakras are arranged. This interpretation suggests that kundalini yoga originated in Atlantis, from which i t spread around the world. Indeed, the Tree of Life is a the me frequently encountered in many European and Asian traditions of Atlantis and Lemuria, respectively.” +Frank Joseph, “The Atlantis Encyclopedia” (121) Thus it would seem that the secret of 33, the secre t held by 33 rd degree Freemasons is one regarding spiritual consciousness, one that dates back to ancient Egypt and Atlantis. The Masonic symbol of a pillar holding u p the Earth no doubt relates to this Atlantean mythos, in which Atlas held the world on his shoulders. In the dictionary, one definition of “Atlas” is the anatomical term fo r the first cervical vertebra which supports the head. This means the 33 rd vertebra from the bottom (as the serpent travels), the very vertebra which supports our heads/minds, is actually called “Atlas.” So the Atlas vertebra holds up the world (our minds). Atlas has 7 daughters (chakras) who guard the Tree of Life (spinal column) and its golden apples of immortality (???). This mystery will be further explored in the “Atlantis” chapter.

The Illuminati elite use it to this day to symbolize key phenomena and mark significant events. The mysterious letter X seems to take on a wide and varied life of its own, with or without the secret aid of the elite sponsorship” +Texe Marrs, “Codex Magica” (205) The meanings of 666 are many and varied. 6x6 = 36, and when added together, every number from 1+36 (1+2+3+ ... 36) = 666. Creation was in 6 days. Man and the serpent were created on day 6. Man labors 6 days o nly, and has 6 names in the Bible: Adah, Ish, Enosh, Gehver, Anthropos, and Anar. 6x6 x600 = 21,600 which is the number of nautical miles around the Earth. Plato s aid in Kritias that 6 was a sacred number in Atlantis and represented the female intui tive/receptive moon power. The triplicate of any number in numerology is the highe st intensification, so 666 means strongest female/moon energy. If Jesus Christ is t he Sun/Son 555, then their Antichrist would be the Moon/Daughter 666. Also 6x 6x60 = 2160, the precise number of years to pass through one sign of the zod iacal procession of the equinoxes. This 25,920+year, 360+degree cycle, Plato’s “Great Year” is the long backwards wobble Earth takes through the signs of the zodiac. We move 1 degree every 72 years, so each sign of 30 degrees takes 2160 years to pass through. This knowledge well+understood by the ancients is all contained in the Bible, but has been covered up and kept hidden over time by the priests and papacy . The later chapter “Astrotheology” will explain how Pagan “Sun” worshi p has been propagated as Christian “Son” worship. 7/7/7 The numbers 7, 77, and 777 are considered lucky by both the Brotherhood and the general public.

If Cai n shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.” +Genesis, 4:23+4 Here we have the biblical root of this sacred number. The biblical Lamech was a descendant of Cain, father of Tubal+Cain, ancestor of Hiram Abiff, the first murderer, and an important Masonic hero. Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, “If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.” This resonates 7, 11, and 77 because Lamech’s revenge of 77 is 11 times Cain’s 7. US Highway 77 is the site of many interesting happe nstances that mark the “revenge of Lamech” theme as well. JFK was assassinated in Dallas near Highway 77. The Masonic Grand Lodge of Oklahoma in Guthrie is along US 77. Timothy McVeigh rented a Ryder truck on 77 and was taken to a count ry jail along 77 after his arrest. Both the Waco massacre and Oklahoma City bombing we re on Highway 77. Not only that, they both occurred the same day: April 19 th , 1993 for Waco, April 19 th , 1995 for Oklahoma City, then on April 19 th , 2004 was the Chicago Sears tower bombing attempt. Exactly 444 days after Sears Tower, on 7/ 7/2005 (2+5 = 7 which makes 777) were the London underground bombings. 777 + 444 = 11:11, a very well+known mystical number, which like 7 and 77 is associated with the revenge of Lamech.

Dr. NO was the first 007 movie starring 33 rd degree Mason Sean Connery who also starred in Zardoz (as in the Wi+Zard of OZ). Boein g made a 707 plane and still continues the 7x7 line of planes today. When you sleep and “get some Z’s” you’re also getting some 77s. The word Zoo, meaning a place where animals are caged and observed, interestingly resonates 77. Also the word Zodiac encodes not only Oz (77) but a much deeper numerological secret. If you change the letter order of Zodiac t o Cadoiz, an interesting numerological “coincidence” is revealed: C=3, A=1, D=4, O=15, I=9, Z=26. 3.1415926 + The first 8 digits of Pi are encoded in Zodiac. Another more occult interpretation of 77 is 7x7 = 49. Many Buddhists believe, as written in the Tibetan Book of the Dead, that the soul takes 49 days between death and rebirth in the reincarnation process. Friends or family are suppo sed to read the Book of the Dead to the recently deceased for 4 9 days. Amazingly, it is also 49 days from conception when an embryo undergoes major changes to become a fetus. At 49 days, two very important things happen: (1) the new ly formed pineal gland produces a giant spurt of DMT and (2) the gender of the baby i s decided. Could this be the moment of reincarnation? Rene Descartes and many o thers believed the pineal gland, the eye in the pyramid, to be the seat of the soul, where the immaterial soul interac ts with the material body. The pineal gland is the only asymme trical organ in our heads, lying at the perfect geometric center of the brain. Every night our pineal glands produce small amounts of DMT tripping us out into various dream+ states (getting some Zs). The only other times this entheogen is naturally released is at the moment of death and the moment of Tibetan Buddhist rebirth, 49 days later. There is a movie called Ladder 49 and a band Br5+49. Bob Dylan, a suspected Mason, sang a song called “Days of 49” with lyrics like, “how oft’times I repine (like the “pine”+al gland and “re”incarnation) for the days of old when we dug up gold in the days of"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"49.” Dylan was also featured in “Oz” Magazine and sang “7 Curses,” “7 Days,” and “Death is Not the End.” The Masonic Rolling “Stones” wrote “Highway 49” singing, “Out on the Highway 49 I have walked till I am dead” again resonating this theme. The band “Stiff Little Fingers” wrote a song called “Gate 49” singing, “I find that doorway in my mind when I want to be with you I just walk through gate 49.” Their only other song with a number is “Johnny 7.” The “77s” sing a song called “Sevens” beginning, “Did you know my eyes were blue? The day we met my heart was too. Now you say the color’s changed. You’re staring do wn a darker shade.” Their only other songs with colors are all the same: Blue Sky, Dave’s Blues, Perfect Blues, and Wild Blue. Do you see pattern developing? Blank 7 7 sings Spirit of ’77. Other bands include Attaque 7 7, Linea 77, Breed 77, Kolapso 77, Charta 77, Resistance 77. Nada Surf sings “Blizzard of ‘77” with lyrics about “tripping in 7+11” as in a DMT tr ip, perhaps? Ozzy Osbourne sang the album “Blizzard of Ozz” and changed the S in Osbourne to a Z like Ozbourne. Hence we can say that “Os” also resonates the “Oz/77” theme as well. This is affirmed in the TV series “L+OS+T” which has an episode named “Enter 77” and Oz+resonant “The Man Behind the Curtain” about a man (Ben) who claims he arrived on the island via hot air balloon, just like the Wizard of Oz. There were 48 survivors of the crash plus Claire’s baby or the French woman makes 49. Also in the Episode “Numbers” we see the countdown just as it hits 49. When the show starts the word “Lost” floats toward the viewer cutting off the L and T leaving just the OS. “Lost” is full of occult numerology, symbology, and myths worthy of its own chapter. J.J. Abrams, the writer of Lost is now writing the movie Star Trek “Lost” Frontier.

Similarly, in “Return to Oz” Dorothy wears a headband with a Z inside an O right over her third+eye point once again showing this occult secret. Actually this is only kept secret from westerners, Hindu women wearing Bindi’s on their forehead’s are well aware of their spiritual significance in relation to the third+eye. The actress Robin Tunney is used repeatedly by the Masons in Hollywood to resonate this OZ theme. Three times in her movie career she has played characters named “Zoe” which is of course, OZ backwards. In the movie “Cherish” Tunney plays a character named Zoe and the movie poster has a series of O’s rippling out from her foot. In the poster for the movie “Zodiac” notice how the line goes through the O and right up to Robin Tunnney’s name. She is also in the HBO+OZ+resonating “Prison Break” series. OSmium is the 76 th element. If you want to take these synchronicities to the limit, then it’s quite interesting to note that Lee Harvey OS+wald was killed by CIA agent Jack Ruby, like Ruby Slippe rs from OZ. The precursor to the CIA was called the OSS and Marylin Manson (MM) sings the song (KK) King+ Kill 33 all about Lee Harvey OSwald. How deep does the rabbit hole go? “The famous Christian hero, St Bernard, defined God as ‘length, width, height and depth’ because he understood the effect of geometry and numbers on the energy fields. Pythagoras also stated that: ‘number is all’. The power of pattern, numbers, geometry and proportion, are some of the ‘great mysteries’ that have been denied the mass of the people.” +David Icke, “The Biggest Secret” (110) The Pentagon’s ground+breaking ceremony was on Sept. 11 th , 1941, exactly 60 years to the day Flight 77 crashed into it.

This is a very clear hoof print of the Clandestine Luciferian Masons (CLuMs) who had sabotaged both ai rliners. TWA 800 and Swiss Air 111: the time between them is 111 weeks, or 777 days.

Most of us take the 73day w eek for granted and assume it is a natural cycle. In actual fact, it is not a fixed cy cle at all, and scientists have struggled for years to explain why this tradition should have originated. Theologians would claim that the answer lies in the Biblical seven da ys of creation, but the origin of the Biblical ‘days’ is almost certainly the seven table ts on which the Enuma Elish was written. This is evident from the contrast between the first six Babylonian tablets describing Marduk’s acts of creation and the sevent h tablet which is dedicated to a general exaltation of the god (and thus a parallel to the Biblical seventh day when God rested) ... But what is the ultimate origin of the sacred number ‘7’? Why did the Babylonians write their creation epic on seven tabl ets? Whilst the seven stars of the Pleiades may ultimately be significant, Zecharia Si tchin has put forward a very interesting alternative theory, based on a literal acceptance of the ancient texts. Having already identified the association of twelve gods with twelve planets, he was intrigued by continual references to the god Enlil, known as the Chief God of the Earth, but also somewhat cryptically as ‘Lord of 7’ . This gave Sitchin the idea that Earth was somehow the seventh planet, and he quickl y realized that Earth was indeed the seventh planet encountered by the gods as they traveled from Nibiru into the heart of the Solar System.” +Alan F.

On 9/11/01 when tragedy struck, Americans were sent into a state of emergency over supposed Islamic “terrorists.” This 911 association with tragedy and danger is not new, nor is it mere coincidence. “The Templars were recognized at Clermont in 1118. 1+1+1+8= 11.

Jus t as in the sky Sirius (Isis) stands beside the 3 stars of Orion’s (Osirus’) Belt, on th e ground Isis (the Statue of Liberty) stands beside 3 collapsing towers. The three buildings that collapsed, buildings 1, 2 and 7, perfectly replicate in size and distance both the 3 pyramids at Giza and the 3 stars in Orion’s Belt. WTC buildings 1 and 2 were very tall with a shorter building 7 off to the side. Similarly, there are 2 large pyra mids at Giza and a smaller pyramid off to the side. Not to mention, before being dest royed on 9/11 there actually stood a huge model of the 3 Giza pyramids at the base of th e World Trade Center. The Giza pyramids themselves were modeled after Orion’s Belt which consists of 2 bright stars and another slightly less bright one off to the sid e. The ancient Egyptians associated Orion’s Belt with the God Osirus, the husband of Is is/Sirius. Their son is our sun, Horus, the Egyptian Jesus. \"For instance, this is why the tracing board portrays the three pillars as all being of different heights, with two larger pillars in the foreground and a much smaller one behind.

Canine, Latin for dog, was shortened by the Masons/Hollywood to K+9 in Doctor Who and Rin Tin Tin K+9 Cop. NASA even has a Mars rover called K+9. Since K is the 11 th letter of the alphabet, K+9 is numerically 119 or 911. Before 1679 the constellation Columba (the Dove) occupied the same space as (was one with) Canis Major/Sirius. Since then the two constellations have drifted apart, but symbolically the Illuminati still associate the Dove with Sirius/Isis/Mary. The Columbine “blazing star” flower, Colombe meaning Dove, is a 5 +petaled flower. In ancient Egypt the hieroglyph for Sirius included a 5+pointe d star. In the U.S. District of “Columbia” the Masons built numerous 5+pointed star pentagrams into the roads/architecture. Is it not coincidental how the 5+sided Pentagon building would be attacked on 9/11, the same day it began construction 60 years prior? And is it not interesting how the numbers 911 and 5 relate back to Sirius the K+9, and Sirius the Columbine 5+ pointed blazing star? Moving over to Hollywood’s many Masonic productions, we find the 9/11 attacks alluded to in several films long before 2001! In 20 th Century Fox’s 1988 film Die Hard the first lines are spoken on a plane about how to get over t he fear of flying. One guy says what he has done for 9 years and Bruce Willis says what he has been doing for 11 years. So here we have 911, on a plane, talking ab out fears of flying, from a Masonic production company. In the first Die Hard, John Mc Clane (Bruce Willis) takes on 12 terrorists in a tower; in the second movie it’s ter rorists at an airport. Isn’t it interesting how in the 1988 movie we have John McCl ane afraid of flying, terrorists, towers, 9/11, and now in 2008 we have John McCain o n a presidential fear campaign revolving around terrorists, towers, and 9/11? In 1998 we also have Bruce Willis saving the world in Masonic Disney/Touchstone’s Arm ageddon. Toward the end of the movie there is a countdown which passes 9:11 mi nutes just as the camera pans past. In another 1998 Disney/Touchstone film, Enem y of the State, a politician played by Jon Voight has his birthday on September 11 th .

Many delineations of time have astronomical significance which seems sensible. The Sun and Earth’s interaction gives us a yearly cycle, the Moon’s lunation pattern give us monthly cycle, the constant rising and falling o f Sun and Moon gives us a daily cycle, and the Moon’s affect on tides gives us a na tural quarter day cycle as the tides come in and out.

The worst part is that we have been so indoctrinated into the week (weak) system that every little facet of modern society from schools, to paychecks, to TV programs, are irreversibly locked in. “‘Blue Monday, how I hate blue Monday,’ is how the old Fats Domino song began. Why is that? Because, of course, that is the first day of the five day work week. Fats Domino must have had some clue abou t time killing us, otherwise it wouldn’t have to be blue Monday.

The s even3day week is an imperial infliction. Circannual holidays are imper ial flag3posts. Mechanical time is an imperial installation. The m erchant workday is an imperial offering. Greenwich Mean Time is an im perial sanction.” +Buried Inside, Chronoclast (V. Time as Imperialism) The word \"calendar\" comes from the Roman/Latin, \"ca lends,” which was the name of the account book, the book recording monthly debts and bills to be paid. The first day of each month in the early Christian “Julian” calen dar was called “calends” and that was when you had to paid your bills and debts. A q uick look at the calendar will present some oddities even to the casual observer. September means seven, but is the ninth month; October means eight but is the tenth m onth and so on. March is named for Mars, the Roman God of War, and July and August are named after Roman Emperors Julius and Augustus Caesar. The calendar we use is called the “Gregorian” after Pope Gregory XIII. “Yes, before it was known as the Gregorian calendar , it was called the Julian 3 after Julius himself. Turns out the Romans had a very fau lty calendar of only ten months. And Julius, wanting a way to make a permanent chang e from republic to empire, with himself as the first emperor, decided to change the calendar. So to make the change during the year 46345 BC, Julius had to have a year 445 days long. Understandably that was known as the ‘year of confusion.’ Julius d idn’t live beyond the ‘ides of March’ of the year 45 BC when he was assassinated f or what he had done. But the empire prevailed. Julius was followed by Augustus C aesar who made a further change in the calendar. He saw that Julius had cha nged the name of the month ‘Quintilius’ to Julius (July), so Augustus changed the next month ‘Sextilius’ to Augustus (August). Not only that, Sextilius only ha d 30 days, while Julius had 31 days. Augustus wanted to make his renamed month, A ugust, as long as Julius’ month. So what did he do? He took the 29th day off Februar y, already the shortest month, and added it to his month. That is why August, like July has 31 days, and February only 28. So that is how the calendar began. Despoti c motives, imperial pretensions and confusion. The Christians began using the Julia n calendar around 321 AD, when they added the seven day week to it. The seven day week was borrowed from the Hebrew lunar calendar. The Jews borrowed the seven day week from the Babylonians. The seven day week never correlates pe rfectly any of the months except when February 1 might fall on a Sunday, then there will be four perfect seven day weeks in one month.” +Jose Arguelles, “Stopping Time” (17)"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":" The Moon goes around the Earth 13 times in one year . 13 x 28 = 364 +1 day equals 365 days, one solar year.

They are in sync with it. But in 1572 Pope Gregory announced that a new calendar was to be introduced, the Gregorian Calendar, and it was impl emented in October 1582. It was another Brotherhood scam and the Gregorian Calendar became the fixed standard time for the planet.

Therefore the effect s of a crooked time on the mind may be far more subtle, yet far worse than the effects of a crooked space on the senses. We could all develop a crooked mind without even knowi ng it. Wouldn’t a crooked mind see the world in a crooked way and create problems for itself without knowing it?

The measure of the Moon from new Moon to"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"new Moon is called the synodic cycle and is 29.5 da ys in length. However the sidereal lunar cycle which measures the Moon from where it r eappears in the same place in the sky is only 27.1 days in length. So 28 days, al ready encoded into women’s biological cycles, is the average lunar cycle. Thi s is not coincidence either, proven by “luminescent ovulation cycle adjustment,” the paten ted process whereby using on sleeping women a series of lights mirroring light c ycles of the Moon their ovulation cycles change (Patent 6497718). Ovulation is about 14 days (half cycle) before Menstruation. So in ancient times women the entire world over would usually have menstruation aligned with the new Moon and ovulatio n aligned with the full Moon. It has been shown that 20% more people are admitted in to hospitals and mental health facilities during full Moons. Could humans be sexu ally frustrated due to unnatural misalignments in women’s biological cycles? Is thi s why lonely dogs howl for companionship during the full Moon? Ancient societ ies would often hold mon +thly fertility cere+mon +ies in honor of the Moon/femininity but nowadays t hose who worship the Moon/Lunar cycles are called luna+tics, mon+sters and nuts. Those who measure time by the Sun/solar calendars find sol+ac e. The etymology again points towards our “illumined” ma+sters and their Sun wors hip. Most girls feel embarrassed or at least inconvenien ced by their onset of womanhood. First periods are accompanied by tampons, pads, tea sing schoolboys and warnings or horror stories from other older women. Zaire tribe s’ people, Native Americans, and other “primitive” cultures honor their women’s firs t periods with puberty ceremonies. They believe each woman has incredible powers as a spiritual being and the gift of life is an important event. During her first perio d each girl is isolated from the tribe and taken by female relatives and friends to a spec ial “Moon hut” to be taught about sexuality and childbearing. She is taught arts and crafts, stories are shared and wisdom is passed down. After her period of isolati on she is welcomed back with a big feast in her honor. In the ancient world it wa s believed that women had amazing powers of healing and creativity during menstruatio n so they should not be wasted on everyday tasks. Menstruation was a time women spen t meditating and spiritual searching. The ancient Mayan calendar is slightly even more accurate than the Gregorian calendar we use today. They calculated the moon’s orbit of the Earth incredibly precisely (29.528395 days to our current 29.530588 day measurement). They could accurately predict solar and lunar eclipses and had amazing knowledge of astrology and the stars. Archeologist Eric Thompson asks, “ What mental quirks led the Maya intelligentsia to chart the heavens, yet fail to grasp the principle of the wheel; to visualize eternity, as no other semi3civilized people has ever done, yet ignore the short step from"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"corbelled to true arch; to count in millions, yet n ever to learn to weigh a sack of corn?” The Mayan calendar measures cycles of expanding con sciousness and completing one’s purposes in life. Gauging the passing days l ike this changes the way one thinks of life. Modern societies tend to see time as a ti cking time bomb till they die, a clockwork of standardized gears cranking until they get older, rusty, useless and stop turning. The Mayans, like early Christians, believ ed in reincarnation which fits with their calendar. They believed all of life was a sp iritual evolution and an expanding of consciousness/purpose so each day correlates as suc h. For instance, as I write this, today is the second day of the new “Jaguar Moon of Intention” (each Moon has a spirit animal and purpose). Today’s Tzolkien is “S kywalker” the 13 th , which means “Explore Space, Wakefulness, the Aspiration to Unit e Heaven and Earth.” Today’s Power is “Activation, today’s Action is “Bonding”, and today’s Essence is “Service.” Each day also has a color, a chakra, and a symbol a s well. Now, this may sound odd or appear as some new age foolishness, but this is the method of time keeping used all over the ancient world. To associate the nature of time with the evolution of consciousness seems to me a much evolved outlook. The Maya knew about the 25,9 20 year precession of the equinoxes in which the Earth wobbles slightly for 2 160 years past each constellation of the zodiac. They even perfectly calculated the end date of this precession as December 21 st , 2012 when we will be passing through galactic cen ter which they referred to as the Dark Rift. “The Christians set sail westward and ‘discovered’ the New World. In a place called Yucatan, they discovered another people, the Maya. These Mayans also had a calendar, ‘a heathen’ device that was more accurate than the Julian calendar!

Interestingly enough, ten years later in 1572, there was a new po pe. He named himself Gregory XIII and declared that his first act as pope would be to correct the Julian calendar. Ten years later, 1582. Pope Gregory XIII had achiev ed his aim. If you went to bed on the evening of October 5, 1582, when you woke up it was October 16 3 and not October 6.

Perhaps the occult meaning of “discovery” coincides with Columbus’ occult knowledge of exactly where he was going. Perhaps the word dis+cover, means just that: “to take the lid off something that has been covered up.” “The Phoenicians were not confined to the Mediterranean and the Middle East. They landed in Britain around 3,000 BC and unmistakable Phoenician artifacts have been found in Brazil, as well as possible Egyptian remains in the Grand Canyon in America. The Phoenicians landed in the Americas thousands of years before the manufactured ‘photo opportunity’ better known as the journey of Christopher Columbus. The reason that the native legends of the Americas speak of tall ‘white gods’ coming from the sea bringing advanced knowledge is because that is precisely what happened, if you forget the gods bit.” +David Icke, “The Biggest Secret” (63) When critics objected saying Columbus’ mission was impossible, he often countered those objections saying he “ might discover some very beneficial island or conti nent about 750 leagues to the west .” At this point the ships would be able to re+sto ck on food/supplies and continue on towards Asia. Then l ow and behold Columbus discovered a “very beneficial continent” precisely 750 leagues to the west. “In the agreements signed on April 17th, 1492, (The Capitulo) and on April 30th, 1492, (The Titulo) the strange fact is that more at tention is given to the rulership and jurisdiction of problematical lands that might be d iscovered en route than to a division of spoils from wealthy Asia.” +Alex Christopher, “Pandora’s Box – The Ultimate Unseen Hand Behind the New World Order,” ( 42) In Scotland's Knights Templar Rosslyn Chapel, there are clear depictions of corn and aloe cactus found on the archways and ceiling.

They do not bear arms, and do not know them , for I showed them a sword, they took it by the edge and cut themselves out of ignorance. They have no iron. Their spears are made of cane ... They would make fin e servants ... With fifty men we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we want.” (Howard Zinn’s “A People’s History of the United States”) From the very outset Columbus was writing about con quering and enslaving the natives. Meanwhile the Arawaks, brought gifts, pre pared food, and traded everything they owned. Columbus wrote that the natives “are so naïve and so free with their possessions that no one who has not witnessed them would believe it. When you ask for something they have, they never say no. To the contrary, they offer to share with anyone.” He also wrote, “I believe that they would easily be made Christian s, because it seemed to me that they had no religion.” The European settlers took a free society without possessions, property, currency, hi erarchy or written religion and replaced it with today’s America – the world’s shin ing beacon of selfish materialism, where every square inch of land/water/airspace is p ublicly or privately owned, taxed, and governed through a corrupt hierarchical system of laws and regulations where Mother Nature’s gifts are treated as personal posse ssions to be bought, sold, owned and defended. Howard Zinn, in “A People’s History of the United S tates” continues: “Columbus wrote: ‘As soon as I arrived in the Indies, on the first Island which I found, I took some of the natives by force in order that they mig ht learn and might give me information of whatever there is in these parts.’ The information that Columbus wanted most was: Where is the gold? ... His second ex pedition was given seventeen ships and more than twelve hundred men. The aim wa s clear: slaves and gold ... They went from island to island in the Caribbean, t aking Indians as captives ... roaming the island in gangs looking for gold, takin g women and children as slaves for sex and labor.” “It was his [Columbus’] avowed aim to ‘convert the heathen Indians to our Holy Faith’ that warranted the enslaving and exporting of thousands of Native Americans. That"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"such treatment resulted in complete genocide did no t matter as much as that these natives had been given the opportunity of everlasti ng life through their exposure to Christianity. The same sort of thinking also gave Westerners license to rape women. In his own words, Columbus described how he himself ‘took [his] pleasure’ with a native woman after whipping her ‘soundly’ with a pi ece of rope.” +Helen Ellerbe, “The Dark Side of Christian History” (86+88) By 1496 the settlers were responsible for 3+4 milli on native American deaths. We are not talking about some guy who accidentally bumped into America looking for a spice+trade route to India, but that’s what the sta ndardized textbooks continue to tell our children. Columbus, the conquistadors, the Pir ates, and many pilgrims were hostile and ruthless groups of settlers who were co llectively responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of natives. Howard Zinn contin ues: “ the Spaniards thought nothing of knifing Indians by tens and twenties and of cutting slices off them to test the sharpness of their blades ... Las Cases says, ‘from 1 494 to 1508 over three million people had perished from war, slavery, and the mine s. Who in future generations will believe this? I myself writing it as a knowledgeab le eyewitness can hardly believe it.’” Bartolome De Las Cases was a catholic priest who witnessed the atrocities being committed in the name of God and wrote prolifically denouncing his fellow countrymen. Bartolome De Las Casas sailed to the “New World” in 1502 and recorded many of the things he saw in his book, “The Devastation of the Indies”: “With my own eyes I saw Spaniards cut off the nose, hands and ears of India ns, male and female, without provocation, merely because it pleased them to do i t ... Likewise, I saw how they summoned the caciques and the chief rulers to come, assuring them safety, and when they peacefully came, they were taken captive and b urned ... (The Spaniards) took babies from their mothers’ breasts, grabbing them b y the feet and smashing their heads against rocks ... They built a long gibbet, low enough for the toes to touch the ground and prevent strangling, and hanged thirteen at a time in honor of Christ Our Savior and the twelve Apostles ... Then, straw was wr apped around their torn bodies and they were burned alive ... When the Spaniards had collected a great deal of gold from the Indians, they shut them up in three big ho uses, crowding in as many as they could, then set fire to the houses, burning alive a ll that were in them, yet those Indians hand given no cause nor made any resistance ...They w ould cut an Indian’s hands and leave them dangling by a shred of skin ... they w ould test their swords and their manly strength on captured Indians and place bets o n the slicing off of heads or cutting of bodies in half with one blow.”"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":" On every island Columbus ‘discovered’ he planted a cross, claiming ownership for his Spanish Catholic patrons. He read declarations of God+given right to the native’s land in a language they couldn’t understand: “ I certify to you that, with the help of God, we shall powerfully enter in your country and shall ma ke war against you ... and shall subject you to the yoke and obedience of the Church ... and shall do you all mischief that we can, as to vassals who do not obey and refu se to receive their lord and resist and contradict him. ” (D. Stannard, “American Holocaust”) Perhaps you can understand why the word “cretin” de rives from “Christian.” Native American chief Hatuey was captured and burned alive by the Christians. As he was being tied down, a Franciscan friar urged Hatuey to take Jesus into his heart so that he may go to heaven and not hell. The chief replied t hat if heaven was where Christians went, he would rather go to hell. “Christopher Columbus is a symbol, not of a man, bu t of imperialism.

The Brotherhood (not ice it’s not the “Sisterhood”) was well aware of the patriarchal/fraternal reverence i n the Bible and has always used it to suppress the feminine. The Bible follows primarily male figures, allows only male priests, calls God a “He,” and defines Him as the F ather, Son, and Holy Spirit. There is little room for worship of the feminine Moon ene rgy in a religion devoted entirely to the Son/Sun. As you will see, the fact that all major religions in the world today (Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism) are fo cused on the male aspect and suppress the feminine, is not a coincidence.

He spent the rest of his life using Christianity as a tool t o achieve political domination. One day during a bat tle at Milvian Bridge, Constantine claimed to have seen a vision that converted him to Christianity. He said he saw in the sky a picture of the cross and the words \" In this sign thou shalt conquer .\" In reality he worshipped the Greek god Apollo and Sol Invictus, never converted to Christianity, and remained Pontifex Maximus of the Pagan Church until the day he died! He did, however, use Christianity and the sign of the cross to conquer his enemies, just as h is alleged vision suggested. In a book called, “The Heretics,” Walter Nigg wrote: “ Constantine, who treated religious questions solely from a political point of view, assured unan imity by banishing all the bishops who would not sign the ne w profession of faith. In this way unity was achieved ... Not a single bishop said a sin gle word against this monstrous thing .” “Anyway, as one persecution ended another was soon to begin, as the Roman Church persecuted, burned and tortured anyone who refused to believe in the Christian faith, or even their version of the faith. Tens of million s of people have died in the name of the so3called ‘Prince of Peace’.

After the Council of Nicea, per the murderous Constantine’s orders, the Christians turned up the heat on censorship, leading to the centuries3long orgy that obliterated millions of texts.

In 410 Emperor Honorius continued the policy decreeing: “Let all who act contrary to the sacred laws know t hat their creeping in their heretical superstition to worship at the most remote oracle is punishable by exile and blood, should they again be tempted to assemble at such places for criminal activities.” For decades, Pagan temples within the Empire were b urned and destroyed. A 386 written protest to the Roman government of Christia n pillaging remains, stating: “If they [the Christians] hear of a place with some thing worth raping away, they immediately claim that someone is making sacrifices there and committing abominations, and pay the place a visit—you can see them scurrying there, these guardians of good order (for that is what they call themselves), these brigands, if brigands is not too mild a word; for brigands at least try to conceal what they have done: if you call them brigands, they are outraged, but these people, on the contrary, show pride in their exploits ... they believe they deserve rewards!” +Helen Ellerbe, “The Dark Side of Christian History” (28) Even after the destruction of most temples, Rome’s non+Christians continued to practice their pagan religions and hold strong to t heir beliefs.

Needless to say th e plague spelled disaster for the Roman Empire, but not for Christian imperialism. “The plague had quite different impact upon Christi anity. People flocked to the Church in terror. The Church explained that the pl ague was an act of God, and disease a punishment for the sin of not obeying Chu rch authority. The Church branded Justinian a heretic. It declared the field of Greek and Roman medicine, useless in fighting the plague, to be heresy. Whil e the plague assured the downfall of the Roman Empire, it strengthened the Christian chu rch. After the plague, the Church dominated the formal discipline of medicine. The most common medical practice between the sixth and sixteenth centuries used for every malady became ‘bleeding.’ Christian monks taught that bleeding a person would prevent toxic imbalances, prevent sexual desire, and restore the humors. By the sixteenth century this practice would kill tens of thousands each yea r. Yet, when a person died during blood3letting, it was only lamented that treatment had not been started sooner and performed more aggressively.” +Helen Ellerbe, “The Dark Side of Christian Histo ry” (42) Following the wake of the plague and the fall of th e Roman Empire was the rise of the Christian Church. Following the rise of the Christ ian Church was the decline of most every other facet of society. “The Church had devastating impact upon society. As the Church assumed leadership, activity in the fields of medicine, tec hnology, science, education, history, art and commerce all but collapsed. Europe entered the Dark Ages. Although the Church amassed immense wealth during these centurie s, most of what defines civilization disappeared ... Technology disappeared a s the Church became the most cohesive power in Western society. The extensive aq ueduct and plumbing systems vanished. Orthodox Christians taught that all aspec ts of the flesh should be reviled and therefore discouraged washing as much as possib le. Toilets and indoor plumbing disappeared. Disease became commonplace as sanitati on and hygiene deteriorated. For hundreds of years, towns and villages were deci mated by epidemics. Roman central heating systems were also abandoned. As on e historian writes: ‘From about A.D. 500 onward, it was thought no hardship to lie on the floor at night, or on a hard bench above low drafts, damp earth and rats. To be indoors was luxury enough. Nor was it distasteful to sleep huddled closely togethe r in company, for warmth was valued above privacy.’ The vast network of roads t hat had enabled transportation and communication also fell into neglect and would remain so until almost the nineteenth century. The losses in science were mon umental. In some cases the Christian church's burning of books and repression of intellectual pursuit set humanity back as much as two millennia in its scien tific understanding ... History was rewritten to become a verification of Christian bel iefs.

Patrimonial properties, the Church3held lands that were free an d clear of taxes or military obligation to the king, made up between one3quarter and one3third of western Europe. In addition to patrimony, bishops often held territ ories in feudal tenure, obliging them like any count or baron to provide the king with so ldiers when called. The Church made money by collecting revenues from imperial rul ers, by confiscating property as the result of court judgments, by selling the remis sion of sins (called ‘indulgences’), by selling ecclesiastical offices (called ‘simony’) , and sometimes by simply taking land by force... The Church, now enormously wealthy, interested itself more in collecting money than in relating to its members. T he medieval Church's preoccupation with riches was such that its ten com mandments were said to have been reduced to one: ‘Bring hither the money.’ Pri ests were selected more on the basis of their money than upon any other virtue. A huge disparity developed not only between the clergy and the laity but also between ranks of the clergy.” + Helen Ellerbe, “The Dark Side of Christian History” (51+57) From 1095+1291 the seven Christian Crusades were a series of religious/military conflicts fought against Muslims, Pagans, Mongols, Cathars, Hussites + any and all political enemies of the Popes. The Crusades recaptured Jerusalem and the Holy Land from Muslim rule and the furthered the Christian churches dominance in Europe. Following the Crusades came the Church Inquisition which lasted from the 13 th all the way up to the 19 th century, killing countless millions in its path. The driving ideology behind the Christian Inquisition was simple: convert or die. Pope Gregory IX in 1231 declared that all her etics be burned to death, citing the Gospel of John 15:6 as justification for the Inquis ition’s brutal ideology: \" If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned. \" “ In 1231 Pope Gregory IX established the Inquisition as a separate tribunal, independent of bishops and prelates. Its administra tors, the inquisitors, were to be answerable only to the Pope. Its inquisitional law replaced the common law tradition of ‘innocent until proven guilty’ with ‘guilty unti l proven innocent.’ Despite an ostensible trial, inquisitional procedure left no p ossibility for the suspected to prove his or her innocence; the process resulted in the c ondemnation of anyone even suspected of heresy. The accused was denied the ri ght of counsel. No particulars"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"were given as to the time or place of the suspected heresies, or to what kind of heresies were suspected. A suspected friendship wit h a convicted heretic was also a crime, yet no information was given as to which her etic the accused was to have ‘adored.’ The names of the accusing witnesses were kept secret. One's only recourse was an appeal to the Pope in Rome which was so futi le as to be farcical. The friar Bernard Delicieux declared that: if St. Peter and St. Paul were accused of 'a doring' heretics and were prosecuted after the fashion of t he Inquisition, there would be no defense open for them. ” +Helen Ellerbe, “The Dark Side of Christian Hist ory” (78) Inquisitors were chosen primarily based on how vigo rously they prosecuted heretics. They were prosecutor, judge, and sometimes executio ner rolled into one with no checks or balances from any other power. Inquisito rs had their own spies, messengers, and assistants who answered only to the m, and they answered only to the Pope. In 1244 the Council of Narbonne decreed that no heretic’s wife be spared because of her husband (and vice+versa), no sentenc e mitigated due to sickness, young or old age, and that every sentence include flagell ation. Through sanction from Pope Innocent IV, from 1252 all the way until 1917, using torture to extract confessions was a legal option for the church. Inquisitors dressed in black robes with black cowls over their heads and used many gruesome machines/methods to coerce confessions like the rack, water boarding, and slow roasting while covered in lard. “Inquisitors grew very rich. They received bribes and annual fines from the wealthy who paid to escape accusation. The Inquisition would claim all the money and property of alleged heretics. As there was little chance of the accused being proven innocent, there was no need to wait for conviction to confiscate his or her property. Unlike Roman law that reserved a portion of property for the convicted's nearest h eirs, canon and inquisitional law left nothing. Pope Innocent III had explained that God punished children for the sins of their parents. So unless children had come forth spontaneously to denounce their parents, they were left penniless. Inquisitors even accused the dead of heresy, sometimes as much as seventy years after their deat h. They exhumed and burned the alleged heretic's bones and then confiscated all pr operty from the heirs. Inquisitors rarely shared the money collected with the Episcopa l courts, the civil government, or spent it building churches as planned. One histori an writes how the inquisitor was often able to ‘seize everything for himself, not ev en sending a share to the officials of the Inquisition at Rome.’ Inquisitors were relucta nt to pay for even the cost of feeding their victims, encouraging the families or the comm unity to pay such costs.” +Helen Ellerbe, “The Dark Side of Christian History” (80) Countless millions in Europe were tortured and kill ed for believing or practicing a religion other than Christianity.

Christianity’s ideology of a vengeful, controlling, Father+like, singular God provided the perfect spiritual propaganda to militarily conq uer those who refused to convert. After the St. Bartholomew’s Day massacre killing 10 ,000 in 1572, Pope Gregory XIII wrote to Charles IX, “ We rejoice with you that with the help of God you h ave relieved the world of these wretched heretics .” The Inquisitor Francisco Pena said in 1578, “ We must remember that the main purpose of the trial and execution is not to save the soul of the accused but to achieve the public good and put fear into others. ” The Inquisition was still active in some places as late as 1834. During and after the Inquisition, the Reformation Wars resulted in thousands of Christians killing Christians and the witch hunts condemned many innocent Pagan women to death. This is why the “Holy” Vatican stood by and the Pope did nothing to pacify World Wars I and II. This is why the Vatican helped give Nazi scientists American passports after the war. Beneath a veil of benevolence, the Vatican is not only complicit but one of the driving forces behind the global conspir acy. “The dark side of Christian history has been and co ntinues to be about the domination and control of spirituality and human fr eedom. Orthodox Christians built an organization that from its inception encouraged not freedom and self3 determination, but obedience and conformity. To tha t end, any means were justified. Grounded in the belief in a singular, authoritarian and punishing God, orthodox Christians created a church that demanded singular authority and punished those who disobeyed. During the Dark Ages, civilization collapsed as the Church took control of education, science, medicine, technology and the arts. Crusaders marched into the Middle East killing and destroying in the name of the one Christian God. The Inquisition established a precedent in the Middle A ges for the systematic policing and terrorization of society. The Protestant and Cathol ic Counter Reformation sparked wars where Christians slaughtered other Christians, each convinced that theirs was the one and only true path. And the holocaust of th e witch hunts plumbed the depths of horror as it eradicated countless women and men as well as the belief in earth3 based divinity.” +Helen Ellerbe, “The Dark Side of Christian History ” (185+6) “From the very beginning of our quest to unravel th e Christ conspiracy, we encounter suspicious territory, as we look back in time and d iscover that the real foundation of Christianity appears nothing like the image provide d by the clergy and mainstream authorities. Indeed, far more rosy and cheerful tha n the reality is the picture painted by the vested interests as to the origins of the Ch ristian religion: To wit, a miracle3 making founder and pious, inspired apostles who fai thfully and infallibly recorded his words and deeds shortly after his advent, and then went about promulgating the faith"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"with great gusto and success in ‘saving souls.’ Con trary to this popular delusion, the reality is that, in addition to the enormous amount of bloodshed which accompanied its foundation, Christianity’s history is rife with forgery and fraud. So rampant is this treachery and chicanery that any serious researcher must immediately begin to wonder about the story itself. In truth, the Christ ian tale has always been as difficult to swallow as the myths and fables of other culture s; yet countless people have been able to overlook the rational mind and to willingly believe it, even though they may equally as easily dismiss the nearly identical stor ies of these other cultures.” + Acharya S., “The Christ Conspiracy” (21) “The clergy converted the simple teachings of Jesus into an engine for enslaving the world and adulterated by artificial constructions i nto a contrivance to filch wealth and power to themselves...these clergy, in fact, cons titute the real Anti3Christ.” + Thomas Jefferson “The Christian church is an encyclopedia of prehistoric cults .” +Fredrick Nietzsche The beginnings of Christian history were almost nothing like the picture propagated by the priesthood. Christianity actually began as an amalgamation of many ancient beliefs and originally branched off from Gnosticism. Gnosticism was and is a school of religious existentialism that seeks intuitive understanding of God through attaining Gnosis, or “knowledge of the Divine within.” “The Gnostics claimed to have an intuitive understanding of the mysteries of God and Earth. It was an understanding that resulted from rigorous training, initiation, and intuitive e xperiences, not simply intellectual study. The church found Gnostics particularly dange rous, for they disdained the need for a hierarchy of priestly officials to interpret the word of God. Far from dangerous heretics, these passive Christians claimed to be th e keepers of secret knowledge as indicated by the Gnostic papyrus books discovered a t Nag Hammadi in 1945. It was this discovery which first afforded any view of Gno sticism other than the damning rhetoric of the church ...Gnostics seek to know the ‘ secrets’ of God, looking for answers within the sacred texts of whatever religio n they accept. They seek the understanding of existence through interpretation o f what they perceive as deeper meaning within the symbology of religious literatur e ... Gnosticism flourished until declared a heresy by a council of bishops of the Ro man church in A.D. 325. Gnosticism was an integral part of the Ancient Myst eries since both involved the belief that only personal inner enlightenment could bring understanding.” +Jim Marrs, “Rule by Secrecy” (346+7) Constantine publicly outlawed Gnosticism in 325AD a nd since then the Brotherhood has privately kept its secrets only for the initiat ed few. In Freemasonry, Gnosticism is the third “G” after God and Geometry represented by their symbolic “G” within the compass/square. According to the Masonic philosoph er Manly P. Hall, \" This"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"knowledge of how man's manifold constitution could be most quickly and most completely regenerated to the point of spiritual il lumination constituted the secret, or esoteric, doctrine of antiquity .\" The Gnostics were the original Christians and they were fervently anti+material, believing in “Christ Consciousness” and the Kingdom of God within. The Gnostics focused on attaining “gnosis” or spiritual knowledg e. They refuted claims of blasphemy from the orthodoxy, stating they were the blasphemers. They said the orthodoxy did “not know who Christ is” and read the Bible, especially Genesis too literally, missing the deeper meaning. Orthodox Christians insisted that Jesus Christ was an historical personage who came in the flesh, had 12 apostles, performed miracles, died on the cross, and was resurrected. The Gnostics insisted that their Christ could never take human form. “Christianity began as Gnosticism, refaced with falsehoods concerning a series of facts alleged to have been historical, but which are demonstrably mythical. By which I do not mean mythical as exaggerations or perversions of historic truth, but belonging to the pre3extant Mythos ... It is obvious that the Roman Church remain ed Gnostic at the beginning of the second century, and for some time afterwards. M arcion, the great Gnostic, did not separate from it until about the year 136 A.D. Tati an did not break with it until long after that. In each case the cause of quarrel was t he same. They left the Church that was setting up the fraud of Historic Christianity.” +Gerald Massey, “Gnostic and Historic Christianity” “So Gnosticism was around long before so3called Ort hodox Christianity. The conspirators used the word ‘Docetism’ to refer to t hose who refused to believe in the incarnation of Jesus. The earliest Gnostic3Christi ans were not even aware of claims that the Christ incarnated in Jesus.” +Acharya S., “The Christ Conspiracy” (48) Unbeknownst to the Gnostics (the original Christian s), so+called Orthodox Christians like Pliny, the Roman Piso family and others began to propagate the idea that Jesus Christ was a real person. Soon under Roman law the greatest heresy became the unacceptance of Jesus as being a historical figure. Bishop and patriarch of Alexandria, St. Athanasius wrote, “ should we understand sacred writ according to the"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"letter, we should fall into the most enormous blasp hemies .” In other words, it is a most enormous sin to read the Bible literally! “The Docetae sects, for example, are supposed to ha ve held that the transactions of the gospel narrative did occur, but in a phantasmag oria of unreality. This, however, is but a false mode of describing the posi tion of those who denied that the Christ could be incarnated and become human to suff er and die upon the cross. The Christians who report the beliefs of the Gnostics, Docetae, and others, always assume the actual history and then try to explain the non3 human interpretation as an heretical denial of the alleged facts. But the doce tic interpretation was first, was prehistorical.” +Gerald Massey, “Gnostic and Historic Christianit y” Exactly what “phantasmagoria of unreality” these Do cetae were referring to will be further explored in the Magic Mushroom chapter. Th e Brotherhood created the term “Docetism” to pigeon+hole Gnostics and Pagan practi tioners inside the kingdom. The Old Testament stories had long existed all over the ancient world but were understood to be metaphorical. For instance the Bible’s first man was “Adam,” while in Egypt “Atum” was the first man, in Babylon he was “Adamu, ” in India he was “Adima” and he was always warned against eating the fruit of im mortality from the Tree of Life. Like the Bible’s “Eve,” in Tahiti, the first woman “Ivi,” was made from the first man’s bones. Like the Bible’s Cain and Abel, the T onga creation story says “the son of the first man killed his brother.” “The Hindu version of the first couple was of Adima and Heva, hundreds if not thousands of years before the Hebraic version, as has been firmly pointed out by Hindus to Christian missionaries for centuries.” +Acharya S., “The Christ Conspiracy” (131) Just like the Tower of Babel, there is a site in Fiji where Fijians claim to have built a tower to the moon to see if it was inhabited. Other versions of the Tower of Babel story are found the world over from Mexico to India. The creation myth as known to the Marquesans in Polynesia mirrors the Biblical version with a serpent, Tree of Life, the fall, and everything. The Polynesians have been cut off from the rest of the world for over 12,000 years, yet their story is almost identical.

In the Grecian myt h, Hercules is said to have been swallowed by a whale and laid for three days i n his entrails before emerging. Do these remind you of Jonah and the whale? Did yo u know Sumerian tablets speak of E.DIN as “The Abode of the Righteous Ones” just as the Bible’s Garden of Eden? King Sargon of Sumeria was said to have been set ad rift in a basket down a river by his mother 4500 years ago. This is the same story the Bible tells about Moses, but unbeknownst to most Christians, the same goes for M ises in Syria, Minos in Crete, Manou in India, and many more. “‘Mises’ is found in Syria, where he was pulled out of a basket floating in a river. Mises also had tablets of stone upon which l aws were written, and a rod with which he did miracles, including parting waters and leading his army across the sea. In addition, ‘Manes the lawgiver’ took the stage in Egypt, and ‘Minos’ was the Cretan reformer. Jacolliot traces the original Moses to the Indian Manou: ‘This name of Manou, or Manes . . . is not a substantive, applying to an individual man; its Sanskrit signification is the man, par excellence, the legislator. It is a title aspired t o by all the leaders of men in antiquity.’” + Acharya S., “The Christ Conspiracy” (169) “There is no historical evidence for the existence of a man called Moses except in the texts produced by the Levites and other writings and opinions stimulated by those texts ... the official background to ‘Moses’ and his name have no historical basis. Nothing was known ab out the ‘Moses’ story, or the ‘plagues’ inflicted upon the Egyptians, until the L evites of Babylon wrote Exodus centuries after it was supposed to have happened. A ll the animals of Egypt were killed three times according to the story! What did they d o, die and immediately remanifest? There was no murder of the first born of Egypt and so the Feast of the Passover has no historical basis, it was created as a result of a story invented by the Levites. Their references to the lamb’s blood on the doors is code for the ancient symbolism of the lamb. There is no official book in Hebrew which mak es any mention of the Pentateuch (the laws of Moses) before the Levites went to Baby lon. As for the Israelites being captive in Egypt, even Deuteronomy describes them a s ‘strangers’, not slaves, in this period. So where did the name Moses come from? Eve ry initiated person who attained the highest rank in the Egyptian mystery s chools was called a Muse, Mose or ... Moses. Manetho, the Egyptian historian of the third century BC, quoted by the Jewish historian, Josephus, says that he was a prie st at Heliopolis or ON (Place of the Sun), and that afterwards he took the name of M osheh or Moses. The word Moses means: he who has been taken away, he who has been put out from the waters, who has been made a missionary, an ambassador, an apost le. The Chief Priest in the Egyptian temples was called EOVE or EOVA, hence the emergence of the name Jehovah, and the Hebrew language is really the sacr ed language of the Egyptian mystery schools.” +David Icke, “The Biggest Secret” (83+4) "},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Long before the Christian era the Greek god Dionysu s was said to turn water into wine as well.

Vishnu, Wittoba, and A donis were all crucified saviors stabbed in the side as well. Christ, meaning “the anointed one” was a term applied to Attis, Adonis, Tammuz, Osiris, Krishna and many oth er pre+Christian gods. Even the name “Christ” is a variation on KRST (Horus, The An ointed One) or Krishna (commonly spelt “Christna” or “Christos” in Bengali ) thousands of years before Jesus supposedly walked the Earth. “The word Kristo and its derivations, Krst, Krist, Kristo, Khyst, and Krish3na, all appeared in every ancient religious system and showed the original Kristo con cept was believed to be the personal and invisible media tor and guide between God and everything spiritual in m an.

The purpose of this council was to unify the various competing cul ts under one universal or ‘catholic’ church, which, of course, would be controlled by Co nstantine and Rome. As noted, Rome claimed the ultimate authority because it purp orted to be founded upon the ‘rock of Peter.’ Thus, the statue of Jupiter in Rom e was converted into ‘St. Peter,’ whose phony bones were subsequently installed in th e Vatican. In a typical religion3 making move, the gods of these other cults were sub jugated under the new god and changed into ‘apostles’ and ‘saints’ ... As stated, i t is maintained that during the Nicene Council the names Jesus and Christ were put together for the first time in the phrase ‘Jesus Christ’ or ‘Christ Jesus,’ uniting tw o of the major factions, with Jesus representing the Hesus of the Druids, Joshua/Jesus of the Israelites, Horus/Iusa of the Egyptians and IES/Iesios of the Dionysians/Samothra cians, and Christ representing the Krishna/Christos of India, the Anointed of the Jews and KRST of Egypt, among others.

In “The First Apology of Justin,” he argues that Christianity should be a ccepted because it is already so similar to existing religions. “When we say that he, Jesus Christ, our teacher, wa s produced without sexual union, was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascende d into heaven, we propound nothing different from what you believe regarding t he sons of Jupiter.” +Justin Martyr, “The First Apology of Justin” Entire volumes have been written by Christians comparing Christianity with other Pagan religions.

He also admits Christianity teaches the same things as poets and p hilosophers citing Plato, Menander, Sibyl, Hystaspes, and Stoics. Since its inception Christianity never claimed to be historical, biographical, or even original. “The doctrine of the divinity of Jesus is made a convenient cover for absurdity.” + US President John Adams “It has served us well, this myth of Christ.” + Pope Leo X “This whole affair of which we speak and preach, and which is called Gospel, has no reference at all to any person that ever existed, or events that ever occurred upon earth” + Rev.

From our research into ancient spirituality it has become obvious that we must fundamentally revise our understanding of Christian origins in th e most shocking of ways. Our conclusion, supported by a considerable body of evi dence in our book, The Jesus Mysteries, is that Christianity was not a new revel ation. It was a continuation of Paganism by another name. The gospel story of Jesus is not the biography of an historical Messiah. It is a Jewish reworking of anc ient Pagan myths of the dying and resurrecting Godman Osiris3 Dionysus, which had bee n popular for centuries throughout the ancient Mediterranean.” + Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy, “The Original Jesus” Characters are often interchangeable within the Bib le itself. Joseph in the Old Testament is analogous to Jesus in the New Testamen t. Joseph was born of a miracle birth, had 12 brothers, one of whom, Judah, suggest s the sale of Joseph for 20 gold pieces. Jesus was born of a miracle birth, had 12 disciples, one of whom, Judas, who suggests the sale of Jesus for 30 gold pieces. The y both began their work at 30. Are we to believe these are literal people living remar kable, coincidental, analogous existences? Or are they personifications, symbols, metaphors representing the ancients’ wealth of astrological knowledge? “Jews do not accept Jesus as the Christ or the Mess iah. They were the ones in the Middle East; it was their country, their language a nd their book. If they don't accept the story, there must be a reason why.” +Jordan Maxwell, “Matrix of Power” “Nay, not only are there no proofs of the twelve tr ibes of Israel having ever existed, but Herodotus, the most accurate of historians, who was in Assyria when Ezra"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"flourished, never mentions the Israelites at all...Ho w is this possible?” +Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, The Secret Doctrine, vol . 3 “It is quite exciting, incidentally, to know that t he Genesis account of the creation of mankind through its first parentage in Adam and Eve bears the marks of derivation from the primary Egyptian symbolic depiction.” –Alvin Boyd Kuhn, “Ultimate Canon of Knowledge” Genesis was an ancient sidereal myth taught to Nile temple initiates The very word Genesis means “Genes of Isis,” Isis being the Egypt ian version of Mary. The word “Bible” comes from “Buka” reeds used to make papyru s (paper) which grew on the banks of the Nile in Egypt. Another name for Buka was Biblos and this is where we get Book and Bible. The similarities between the C hristian and Egyptian religions are practically endless: The incarnate trinity of Osiris, Horus and Ra, are the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit of Christianity. The carnate trinity Seb, Isis+Meri, and Horus are analogous to Joseph , Mary, and Jesus. Isis and Mary were both virgin mothers commanded to take their sons to Egypt for safety. Seb and Joseph were both carpenters. Seb was the custo dian of the mummified dead and Joseph of Arimathea was the keeper of the Corpus Ch risti. Horus was born in Annu, the place of bread; Jesus was born in Bethlehem, th e house of bread. Horus is the gracious child, one of five brethren, brother of Se t the betrayer; Jesus is the child full of grace, one of five brothers including Judas the betrayer. Anna came with S’men who held Horus in his arms; Anna the prophetess cam e with Simeon who held Jesus in his arms. Anup the baptizer was the precursor o f Horus, John the Baptist was the forerunner of Jesus. Horus and Jesus were both bap tized at age 30; both called the good Shepard, walked on water and cured the blind. Seven Hathors minister to Horus; seven women minister to Jesus. Horus ascend s to heaven from Bakhu, the Mount of the olive tree; Jesus ascends to heaven fr om Mount Olivet. Horus was the word+made+flesh who giveth light by means of his ow n body and Jesus the word+ made+flesh was the light of the world. Set and Horus were enemies like Satan and Jesus.

On and on it goes; the similarities between the Egyptian and Christian religions are endless: Baptism, afterlife, judgment, virgin birt h, resurrection, crucifixion, ark of the covenant, circumcision, saviors, communion, flood, Easter, Christmas, Passover. “Egyptian culture was highly influential in the cre ation of Judaism and Christianity, both of which carnalized and historicized much of t he mythos and ritual in their scriptures. Indeed, many scholars have insisted tha t the Bible is entirely Egyptian ...The entire Christian bible, creation legend, desce nt into and exodus from Egypt, ark and flood allegory, Israelite history, Hebrew proph ecy and poetry, Gospels, Epistles and Revelation imagery, all are now proven to have been the transmission of ancient Egypt’s scrolls and papyri into the hands of later generations.” +Acharya S., “The Christ Conspiracy” (266) “In reality, Christianity was the product of a multinational cabal composed of members of a variety of brotherhoods, secret societies and mystery schools, and was designed to empower and enrich such individuals and to unify their empire. To do so, these conspirators took myriad myths and rituals of virtually all the known cultures and combined them into one, producing a godman to beat them all.” +Acharya S., “The Christ Conspiracy” (289+90) Christianity, like almost every known religion befo re it, originally maintained the doctrine of an immortal soul that reincarnates thro ugh many lifetimes and bodies.

The council decided, without the attendance of the Pope, that: ‘If anyon e assert the fabulous preexistence of souls and shall submit to the monstrous doctrine that follows from it, let him be... excommunicated’. The ‘monstrous doctrine’ was that we live forever on an eternal journey of evolution through experience and we are all responsible for our actions in this physical life or a future one. An acceptance o f reincarnation took away the power of the heaven or hell mob to frighten people into doing as they, sorry, ‘God’, said. The knowledge continued to be sucked from the public domain. After Constantine the Great, came other emperors who influenced the course of the fast emerging Christian creed ... Anyone who strayed even marginally from the official beliefs was brutally executed and their documents destroyed – exactly the Nimrod doctrine of Babylon. This is not just a bunch of power crazed psychopaths, ad3libbing their way through this grotesque slaughter, it was a coldly calculated plan to rule by terror ... they wanted to create a mental and emotional prison cell, outside of which it was fatal to tread.” +David Icke, “The Biggest Secret” (117) “Orthodox Christians also thought the theory of rei ncarnation minimized the role of Jesus Christ, downplayed the necessity for salvatio n in this lifetime, and diminished the unique nature of Christ's resurrection. A perso n's salvation, in orthodox eyes, depends not upon self3determination and free will, as Origen's theories suggest, but only upon embracing Jesus Christ. Furthermore, if a person could choose to reunite with God in any one of many lifetimes, then there w ould be little fear of eternal damnation 3 and fear was deemed essential by the or thodox. Origen's idea that the soul is separable from the body also seemed to dimi nish the extraordinary nature of Christ's resurrection. The miracle of Christ's resu rrection was understood to offer the possibility of overcoming physical death. If, howev er, each soul periodically overcomes death by separating from one body and ent ering into another, then Jesus's feat would not have been unique ... Although Origen d ied in 284, debate over his theories continued until 553 when he was officially anathematized, or cursed, by the Second Council of Constantinople.

Priests replaced your immortal soul’s journey with the notion of heaven/hell and an omniscient decider God who judges your life’s merit. If and only if you accept Jesus as your personal savior may you ascend to heaven. Otherwise you will be damned to hell’s eternal pits of fire with all the other heathens and heretics. “And what goes for Christianity goes for the rest of them, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism and all the rest. These religions were created by the same force to achieve the same effect and, therefore, the savior3 god myths throughout the ancient world have an identical game plan: 1 You are born with original sin and so you are an unworthy piece of shit from the day you arrive on the planet. 2 You can only be saved by believing in the ‘Savior’ and that means doing what the priesthood tell you to do . 3 If you don’t do that, you will be condemned to the bowels of hell forever ...

This is never more so than with the major religions. They all have inner and o uter levels of knowledge. The inner level carries the secrets going back to the ancient Mystery schools of places like Sumer, Babylon and Egypt. These include the secrets of the bloodline and only the chosen few are initiated into this awareness. The o uter level is where the secrets are hidden in code and allegory and sold, with a deity, to the masses as the 'truth'. The New Testament Gospel stories are based on the initi ation ceremonies and esoteric secrets 3 including astrology and Sun worship 3 tha t were performed and communicated in the Mystery schools. But they are p resented as a literal story to fool the people. The religions, not least Christianity, Judaism and Islam (all spawned from the same source) are carriers of the secrets (inner) and controllers of the people by hiding the secrets with allegedly 'literal' stories (outer). The same basic 'Jesus' tale of the Son of God who died for humanity was told around the world thousands of years before Christianity.” +David Icke, “Tales from the Time Loop” There are actually in total 15 pre+Christian Gods had traits and stories exactly like Jesus Christ. For example, In 900 BC Krishna was born of a virgin with a star in the East signaling his coming. A tyrant slaughtered thousands of infa nts trying to kill the new born king. He was a teacher in the temple and a healer who performed miracles, was crucified between two thieves and resurrected from death. Around the same time period in Greece lived the God Attis, born of a vir gin on December 25 th . He was martyred on a crucifix, died for 3 days and was res urrected. Mithra was a Persian God circa 1200 BC who was born of a virgin on Decem ber 25 th , traveled around with 12 disciples, performed miracles, died for 3 days a nd was resurrected. He was called the truth, the light, and was worshipped on Sunday. The very same basic storyline that came out of Constantine’s Council of Nicea in 325 AD already existed for thousands of years. “Christianity resembled certain elements of Roman b elief, particularly the worship of Mithra, or Mithraism. As ‘Protector of the Empire, ’ Mithra was closely tied to the sun gods, Helios and Apollo. Mithra's birthday on D ecember 25, close to the winter solstice, became Jesus's birthday.

The fathers of Chris tianity explained the remarkable similarities of Mithraism as the work of the devil, declaring the much older legends of Mithraism to be an insidious imitation of the one t rue faith.” 3 Helen Ellerbe, “The Dark Side of Christian History” (22+3) “Everything Christians believe about Jesus, the Romans and Persians believed about Mithra. Sunday was the sacred day for Mithraists because he was a Sun God and they called this The Lord’s Day ... The writer, H. G. Wells, pointed out that many of the phrases used by Paul for Jesus were the same as those used by the followers of Mithra. The Liturgy of Mithra is the Liturgy of Jesus. When Paul says: ‘They drank from the spiritual rock and that rock was Christ’ (I Corinthians 10:4), he was using exactly the same words found in the scriptures of Mithra. Only the names were ch anged. In the Gospels, Peter became the Christian ‘rock’ on whom the new church would be built. The Vatican Hill in Rome was said to be sacred to Peter, but th is place was also claimed, much earlier, to be sacred to Mithra and many Mithric re mains have been found there!” + David Icke, “The Biggest Secret” (108+9) All the following pre+Christian deities shared the myth of a virgin birth on December 25 th , crucifixion and resurrection: Chrishna of Hindost and, Budha Sakia of India, Salivahana of Bermuda, Zulis and Osiris of Egypt, O din of the Scandinavians, Crite of Chaldea, Zoroaster and Mithra of Persia, Baal an d Taut of Phoenecia, Indra of Tibet, Bali of Afghanistan, Jao of Nepal, Wittoba o f the Bilingonese, Thammuz of Syria, Atys of Phrygia, Xamolxis of Thrace, Zoar of the Bonzes, Adad of Assyria, Deva Tat and Sammonocadam of Siam, Alcides of Thebe s, Mikado of the Sintoos, Beddru of Japan, Hesus, Eros, and Bremrillah of the Druids, Thor of the Gauls, Cadmus of Greece, Hill and Feta of the Mandaites, G entaut and Quexalcote of Mexico, Universal Monarch of the Sibyls, Ischy of t he island of Formosa, Divine Teacher of Plato, Holy One of Xaca, Fohi and Tien o f China, Adonis of Greece, Prometheus of Caucasus, and Ixion and Quirinus of R ome.

That is how they described the Eastern savior god known as Virishna 1,200 years before Jesus is claimed to have been born.” +David Icke, “The Biggest Secret” (89) Why do the same stories, dates, numbers, and symbol s show up repeatedly in religious myths and texts all across the ancient wo rld? “This is related to the winter solstice or midwinte r festival when the Sun is at the least powerful point in its cycle in the northern hemisph ere. They said that on the solstice, our December 21/22nd, the Sun had 'died'. Three day s later 3 the 25th 3 they said the Sun was born or born again. Thus we have a long lin e of Sun gods given the 'birthday' of December 25th. The Jesus of the Gospels is a symbol of the Sun and the stories include a host of other Mystery school knowledge and esoteric concepts.” +David Icke, “Tales from the Time Loop” “For three days, December 22 nd , 23 rd , and 24 th , the Sun rises on the exact same latitudinal (declinations) degree. This is the only time in the year that the Sun actually stops i ts movement northward or Southward in our sky. On the morning of December 2 5 th the Sun moves one degree northward beginning its annual journey back to us i n the Northern Hemisphere, ultimately bringing our spring. Anything steadily moving all year long that suddenly stops moving for three days was considered to have died. Therefore, God’s Sun who was dead for three days, moves one3degree northward on December 25 th and is symbolically born again!” +Jordan Maxwell, www.jordanmaxwell.com Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, is the star in the East. On Dec. 24 th it aligns with the three brightest stars in Orion’s belt whic h are called (and have been called since ancient times) the “three kings.” The three kings line up perfectly with Sirius pointing to the exact spot in which the Sun will ri se the next morning. The larger constellation in which this takes place was known t o the ancients as the “manger” or the “cradle” which is visible just before dawn on D ec. 25 th . So the three kings or three magi effectually “follow” the star in the Eas t to the manger, the birthplace of God’s Sun at the Winter Solstice. “Easter” also de rives from the Eastern Star Sirius. The three gifts of the magi are Frankincense, Myrrh , and Gold. Frankincense is an amber resin that was burned at solar temples, Myrrh was known as “tears of the Sun,” and Gold too long represented the Sun in the ancien t world. The recurrent “virgin” theme represents the constel lation Virgo, which is Latin for virgin. “The ancient glyph for Virgo looks like an M which explains the M names of “virgin mothers” like Jesus’ mother Mary, Adonis’ m other Myrra, Buddha’s mother Maya, and Horus’ mother Isis+Meri .

After steadily traveling downward since the last solstice, the Sun stops movement at the Southern Cr ux for 3 days then rises again + the Son dies on the cross and after 3 days is resur rected. “No people of the ancient world believed the Sun to be God. That belongs in the disinformation file. In point of fact, every ancient culture and nation on Earth have all used t he Sun as the most logically appropriate symbol to represent the glory of the unseen Creator of the heavens. Here it is i mportant to remember two points. First, with the exception of Japan, the ancient world mythologies always understood the Sun to be masculine in qualities, and the moon feminine. Sec ond, the English language is derived from the German. In th e Germanic, the word Sun is spelled Sonne (Son). The two words can (and have b een) used interchangeably ... Ancient man saw in his male offspring his own image and likeness, and his own existence as a father was proved by the person of h is son. Thus, it was assumed that God’s Sun was but a visible representative of the u nseen Creator in heaven. So it was said, ‘when you have seen the Son, you have seen th e Father.’ Said another way is ‘The Father is glorified in His Son’ ... The ancient peoples reasoned that no one on Earth could ever lay claim of ownership to the Sun. Such a magnificent heavenly body must belong to the unseen Creator of the unive rse. It became, figuratively speaking, not man’s but God’s Sun. It was only a s hort hop and skip to the understanding that God’s Sun was ‘The Light of the World’ ... Logically even if man himself dies, as long as the Sun comes up each day, life on Earth will continue forever. Therefore, it was said in the ancient tex ts that everlasting life was ‘the gift’ that the Father gives through his Sun.” +Jordan Maxwell, www.jordanmaxwell.com To ancient man the most dangerous, feared enemy was the unknown darkness of night, thereby making the Sun, the light, heaven’s gift to the world. Without its light we cannot see, without its warmth we cannot move, w ithout its energy our food cannot grow. Our very lives depend on the energy e mitting from the Sun, making it our life and savior. God so loves the world that h e has given his only begotten Sun so that we may have ever+lasting life. That is why in Deut 4:24 and Heb 12:29 God is “consuming fire in heaven.” The Prince of Darkness is the Dark Evil, the D+evil , Devil. God is the Good; God’s Sun is the Light of the World, and the Prince of Pe ace. The Peace he brings is Solace – Solace again from the word Solar, meaning Sun. I n the Egyptian personification, the Prince of Darkness was known as “Set” and the S un was known as “Horus.” So every night at Sun+Set the Dark Prince overtakes th e world. But every morning the Sun is born again at Sun Rise, Horus is risen on th e Horizon. This is where we get the word “Hero,” the cheer “Hooray!” and also why an in terpretation of the zodiac is a Horo+scope. “At daybreak this wonderful newborn child, God’s Su n is Born Again, Horus is Risen. Even today when the Sun comes up we see it on the ‘ Horus3Risen’ or ‘Horizon.’ His"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"life was also divided into 12 parts or steps across Heaven each day: 12 Horus = 12 Hours. This is the origin of the modern 12 Step Pr ogram. Horus is the (new3born) Sun, or the Bringer of the Light. In Latin, Light Bringer is Lucis, or Lucifer, or Luke ... God’s Sun brought His wonderful light to the worl d, and distributed it over 12 months. So it was said, God’s Sun had 12 companion s, or helpers, that assisted His life3saving work. So it was, God’s Sun had 12 apos tles (or months) that followed Him religiously through His life. Incidentally, now yo u know why the American jury system has 12 jurors who help bring the truth to li ght, with the ‘Light of Truth’ ... Keep in mind God’s Sun symbolically represented the light of truth, but was condemned by His enemies who could not endure the l ight of truth in their life. When we are confronted with the harsh realities of life, the light of truth, which we do not wish to face, and which runs counter to our views, such truth is judged in your mind, or judged in the temple area of your brain, and put to death in your head! Therefore God’s Sun –The Truth and The Light – is put to deat h at Golgotha, or Place of the Skull, located somewhere between your ears! This p utting to death of the light of truth in your mind is always accompanied by two thi eves: Regret for the past and Fear of the future. And of course God’s Sun goes t o His death wearing a corona – Latin for Crown of Thorns.” –Jordan Maxwell, www.jordanmaxwell.com So your “temples” or at the Golgatha (which means Place of the Skull), God’s Sun, the light of truth, is judged and crucified along with the two thieves of past and future. The Sun’s corona, the plasma atmosphere around the Sun, is then allegorically used as the Son’s (Latin translation) Crown of Thorns. Cultures all over the ancient world kept track of time and seasons based on the movement of the Sun. They invented circular sundials and sun calen dars which recorded daily and yearly time (lunar calendars recorded months). Thi s method of circular solar+based time keeping was used by the ancient Mexicans, Maya ns, Incas, Aztecs, Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Egyptians, Celtics, Aryans and more. (JM.com) Out of these circular, pictorial Sun calendars developed the Hol y cross. The Sun is portrayed on a cross – a circle with perpendicular lines intersect ing in the middle, the horizontal axis representing the Spring and Autumn Equinoxes, the v ertical axis representing the Summer and Winter Solstices. This is the reason yo u often see a circle around Christian, Celtic, ancient and modern crosses. “Since the Earth experienced 4 different seasons, all the same and equal (in time) each year, the round Sun calendar was divided into 4 equal parts. This is also why we ha ve, in the Bible, only 4 Gospels. Of this point, there can be no doubt. The 4 Gospels r epresent the 4 seasons which collectively tell the entire story of the life of G od’s Sun. Matthew, Mark, Luke, John"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"are Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. This is why the famous painting of ‘The Last Supper’ pictures the 12 followers of the Sun i n four groups (of three) the seasons!” +Jordan Maxwell, (http://www.jordanmaxwell.com/articles/astrotheolog y/astromain5a.html ) The Book of Mark is the Book of Mars. The planet/a rchetype Mars is the ruler of Aries which makes the Book of Mark, in zodiacal ter ms, the Book of Aries. The word “arise” comes from Aries, as it is the first h ouse of the zodiac where the sun arises during the spring equinox/Easter. Aries mon th is April which comes from the Latin “aperio,” meaning to open or begin. Just as Aries is the first zodiacal sign, April was (and still is in many cultures) the first month of the calendar year. To the ancients, the spring equinox was a more appropriate calendrical beginning because it is when the day+time hours officially overtake the night+time hours. The Sun is resurrected, its light triumphs over darkness, and Gaia begins to bloom again. The Book of Luke is the Book of Leo. Luke is Latin for Lucius meaning Light and the House of Light is Leo the Lion. Lions are used the world over to symbolize the Sun and its rays which resemble the lion’s yellow f ace and flowing mane. Christ (the other Sun symbol) is often called the “Lion of Juda ea.” “In Celtic Ireland the name Leo was Lugh, another s olar hero and mystic. In Wales he was Llew, to the Romans Lugus, to the Sumerians Lughal. Its not the same dude on walkabout, it’s the Astrological sign of Leo. In th e Christian iconography we have one of the Evangelists represented by a Lion. In th e Nativity scenes we see 4 animals around the cradle of the Son/Sun king. One of these is also a Lion. Christians probably believe that there was one in the area and just happened to wander into the inn to take a peek at sleeping Jesus. Good thing it wasn’t very hungry.” +Michael Tsarion, Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology The Book of Matthew or Matt is actually Maat, the E gyptian Goddess. Maat is almost always symbolized blindfolded holding the Sc ales of Justice which relates astrologically to Libra. Libra was the last sign o fficially added to the zodiac, which is why Matt was the last of the 12 to join. He is als o symbolized by the Eagle in Christian iconography because Aquila the Eagle is t he closest animal constellation to Libra. “Maat is pronounced Mayat. She is the Mahat of the Brahmins, the Meath of the Celts, the Tiamat of the Skalds, the Maia of the Ro mans and the Mara of the pagans. Now in the Bible, we read that Matthew was the disc iple that the other 11 did not want to accept. The reason for this was that he was a tax3collector, (perfidious company in any age). However behind all the hyperbo le, we have a secret concealed. The symbol of the tax3collectors has always been th e scales or balances. This is because they did not only want currency, but they t ook grain and livestock also, and their lackeys would carry large scales around. It i s the same today in rural, eastern communities.” +Michael Tsarion, Astrotheology and Sidereal Myth ology Finally, the Book of John is the Book of Aquarius. John is for January which is the month corresponding to Aquarius. The symbol for Aq uarius is a man carrying/pouring a pitcher of water which is why we have Baptism and John the Baptist. John’s death by beheading is another astr ological allegory whereby on"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"August 29 th , John’s (Aquarius’) head/star moves just above the horizon, while the rest of his body/constellation remains below the horizon . At exactly this time, on dusk August 29 th , the sun sets in Leo (the kingly sign representing Herod) and so Herod beheads John. “John comes from Jahan or Jahn, which comes from th e earlier Ionnes, Oannes (the Fish god). Jahan or Jahn gives us other names, like Jane, Joan, Janus and even Jasus or Jesus. It eventually gives us the word Jahnuary or January ... During January (Aquarius), the Nile waters were the purist, so the Egyptians would collect it for use in telestic rites. The sign of Aquarius became asso ciated with baptism, cleansing and purification by water. This was borrowed by the Isr aelites and finds its way into the Christian traditions. So now we see the gospels cl early detailed as signs of the zodiac. The sun3king must pass through these signs . They are his ‘chroniclers’ (‘chron’ means time specifically relating to the ro und of the zodiac). They are his measurers, his ‘Apostles’ (‘post’ means demarcation post, a colure of the zodiac). They are his ‘Disciples’ (‘disc’ means round circle , as is the zodiac).” +Michael Tsarion, Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology “The Christian religion is a parody on the worship of the Sun, in which they put a man whom they call Christ, in the place of the Sun, and pay him the same adoration which was originally paid to the Sun.” +Thomas Paine Why do the chronological events describing the supp osed life of Jesus Christ in the New Testament run perfectly parallel to the ancient allegorical understanding of the Sun’s journey through the houses of the zodiac? J ohn 14:2 says that in the Father’s house there are many rooms or many mansions; 12 to be more precise – the 12 houses or rooms of the zodiac. There are also 72 extra+zo diacal constellations known as the paranatellons. This is why Jesus is said to have o fficially had 12 servants with 72 others that also carried the message. The 72 angel s on Jacob’s ladder and the 72 nations in Genesis also relate to these 72 decans, 1 for every 5 degrees of the zodiac. It serendipitously takes 72 years to move 1 degree through the zodiacal precession of the equinoxes. Hence Confucious (6 th century BC + China) had 72 initiated disciples and Set (ancient Egypt) had 72 accomplices in the death of Osiris. “According to legend, Jesus was born in a stable between a horse and a goat, symbols of Sagittarius and Capricorn. He was baptized in Aquarius, the Water3Bearer. _He chose his first disciples, fishermen, in Pisces, the sign of the fishes. _He became the Good Shepherd a nd the Lamb in Aries, the Ram. _Jesus told the parables of the sowing and tilling of the fields in Taurus, the Bull. _In Cancer, ‘the celestial Se a of Galilee,’ he calmed the storm and waters, spoke of backsliders (the Crab), and rode the ass and foal i n triumph into the City of Peace, Jerusalem. _Jesus was the Lion in Leo. _In Libra, Christ was the true vine in the Ga rden of Gethsemane, the ‘wine press,’ as this is the time o f the grape harvest. _Jesus was betrayed by Judas, the"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"‘backbiter,’ or Scorpio. _In Sagittarius, Jesus w as wounded in the side by the Centaur, or centurion.” +Acharya S., “The Christ Conspiracy” (115+6) Luke 22:10 reads: “Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you bearing a pitc her of water ... follow him into the house where he entereth in.” This is the symbol of Aquarius – a man bearin g a pitcher of water, the end of the age of Pisces. Pi sces, our current age, is symbolized by 2 fish. This is why Jesus befriends 2 fishermen when he begins his mini stry. In Matt 4:19 Jesus says to Peter, “I will make you fishers of men.” In Matt 1 4:17 Jesus feeds them with fish saying “We only have five loaves of bread and 2 fis h.” Virgo (the House of Bread) is the fifth sign of the zodiac, giving us five loaves of Virgo and 2 Piscean fish. The Piscean dual+fish symbol is found in many old Chris tian churches and artwork. This is also why we have the Jesus+fish symbol seen on e very born+again Christian’s bumper. The word Nun is Hebrew for fish, and if yo u look closely, turned horizontally, the Pope’s headdress is actually a big fish+head. “The Christian Mythos coincided with the Age of Pisces. This is the reason why there is much in the way of water symbolism in the New Testament. There is the mention of Baptism, the fact that the disciples were mostly fishermen. Then there is the walking on the water, the washing the feet of the disciples, t he feeding of the five thousand with two fish, etc,. The Christians still use the symbol of the fish to symbolize Jesus. The letters of the word Jesus Christ the Savior of the World, in Latin, give the word for fish. The Pope wears the \"Ring of the Fisherman,\" a nd the Pope's headdress is a fish head, from the side. The early Christians were call ed the \"Little Fishes.\" In the Old Testament we read about the prophet Jonah being swa llowed by the whale or the great fish. All the imagery of the chapters and ver ses of the New Testament can be related to the Precessional phenomena, as that is w hat it was composed for in the first place. It was never meant to be a biography.” +Michael Tsarion, “Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology” The Precession of the Equinoxes is a 25,920 year cy cle the Earth goes through and corresponds with the twelve signs of the zodiac. E ach sign or “age” spans 2160 years. We are currently in the Piscean age, transitioning into the Aquarian. The fact that knowledge of a 25,920 year astrological precession was known to ancient peoples spanning from South America to India suggests both advanced civilization and worldwide travel/communication in prehistoric times .

Before the Age of Pisces was the Age of Aries (symb olized by the ram) which is related in the Bible as ending just at the time of Jesus (2160 BC – 0 AD). The Hyksos Pharaohs and priests of Egypt were called the “good shepherds” and their “flocks” were the stars, of which they had great knowledge. Christ is also known as the good shepherd, often depicted carrying a lamb, and there is always a lamb in the nativity scene. Lamb’s blood was smeared on all the doors, meaning the doors to the houses of the zodiac. The sheep/shepherd analogy is also astrological in origin; In fact the genus/species classification for sheep is Ovis Arie s . “Is it a coincidence that Yahweh, God of Old Testam ent Israel, provided a ram as a substitute for Abraham’s offered sacrifice of his s on Isaac? Is it likewise coincidental that rams, in one context or another, are referred to in almost every book of the Old Testament (entirely composed during the age of Arie s) but not a single book of the New Testament? And is it an accident that the adve nt of the Age of Aries, shortly before the beginning of the second millennium BC, w as accompanied in Ancient Egypt by an upsurge in the worship of the god Amon whose symbol was a ram with curled horns?” +Graham Hancock, Fingerprints of the Gods Before the Age of Aries was the Age of Taurus (symb olized by the bull) which spanned from 4320 – 2160 BC ending around the time of Moses. Moses, the new Aries/ram figurehead, represented in Michelangelo’s “Moses” with horns, comes down from Mt. Sinai furious to see everyone worshipping a golden Taurus/calf. In the Bible, Moses is the lawgiver, bringing God’s Ten Commandments down from Mount Sinai. In Egypt, Mises carried stone tablets with the laws of God written on them. In India it was Manou and in Crete it was Minos sent to Mount Dicta where Zeus gave him the sacred laws. The exact same story existed in many cultures of the ancient world with Ten Commandments themselves all taken directly out of the Egyptian Book of the Dead. In Persian mythology their Aries age hero, Mithra, slays the Taurus bull. And it was also during this precessional epoch that the Bull+cult of Minoan Crete flourished. (Graham Hancock, Fingerprints of the Gods) Before the Age of Taurus was the Age of Gemini (sym bolized by the twins) which spanned from 6480 – 4320 BC. The transitional peri od between Gemini and Taur us is where we get the mythological creature, half+bul l half+man, the Minotaur. The labyrinth he guards also relates to astrology and t he zodiac.

The religious iconography flows with as trology because those who propagate it still secretly worship the sun. “The early Church fathers prohibited astrology and the Great Council of Toledo banned it forever. Nevertheless six hundred years l ater the dates of the Pope's coronation were determined by the zodiac, the churc h hierarchy employed their own astrologers; and signs of the zodiac appeared all o ver Church furnishings, tiles, doorways, manuscripts and baptismal fonts. The 'Church' was sure that the study of astrology would undermine its religion if people thought that the sun, the moon, the stars, the signs of the zodiac and the planets, hold life and death at their own pleasure ... and that they rule and govern both the bodies and souls of man. In this scenario the planets and stars should be adored and worshiped as gods, which they are of course. Astrology survives in our western culture because Christianity embraced it with one hand, while conde mning it as a devilish art on the other.” +Michael Tsarion, “Astrotheology and Sidereal Myt hology” One needs look no further than the etymology of Chr istian words to dis+cover the Astrotheological origins. Disc+iples and A+post+le s have been explained as astrological terms. Pastor comes from Pa+stor, Pa meaning great or father, Stor or Aster meaning Star. Thus Pastor means the Great St ar or the Father Star, our Sun God. Minister and Ministry come from Min and Aster. Min was the common ancient term and root of Moon whereas Aster, Stir, Stor all relate to Star. Thus Minister is Moon+ Star. Monastery, monk, and month have the same origin. This is also where we get “Minute.” “It is a title that derives from the lunar and stellar cults. This explains why there is a minute hand on a watch. The three hands of a watch relate to the three planets associated with time. The slow hand is the hour hand, meaning Horus, the sun.

The word Amen used at the end of prayer by Christians, Muslims, Hindus and Jews come s from the Pharaoh Amenhotep and the Egyptian God Amen+Ra. Amen was known as “t he hidden one” in Egyptian beliefs and could change into other Gods like Osiri s and Set at will. Through the solar, lunar, and stellar cults Amen+Ra has found h is way into the prayers of billions. As Jordan Maxwell often points out, by ending a pra yer with Amen, you are essentially saying “let it be hidden, let it remain unseen.” Amen’s consort was called Ament, which is where we get the New and Old Test+A ment. The obelisk is one symbolic representative of Amen+Ra, found at the Va tican, Washington DC, London, and many other places around the world. The word Vatican comes from Vaticinia which means “ place of divinations” or “place of the sorcerers.” The Vatican actually funds and controls every astronomical telescope and observatory in the world and all find ings run through the Vatican before both the public and the scientific communities. Mass derives from the Egyptian Mes, an annual sacred cake ritually baked with Nile riverbank clay. Yule shares roots with the word Wheel, and a Yule log at Winter Solst ice represents the full+turn of the zodiacal wheel. The Roman title/name Julius derived from Yule which explains why Julius Caesar was crowned under the God Jupiter at the Winter Solstice. The word Arch in Arch Bishop and Arch Deacon refers to the Sun’s Arch across the sky.

The Cardinals surround the Pope as the cardinal points surround the sun. The sun casts its rays on the Houses as it passes, turning them crimson.

How is it that this information, so widely known in ancient times, is almost completely hidden from the masses today? The answer is that it has been deliberately suppressed, so that the masses would never realize the connection between their cherished gods and the celestial bodies. As demonstrated by Paine, the Masons have known very well the true meaning and importance of astrology, which was considered a sacred science ... Astrology and astrotheology were not only known i n the ancient world but have constituted an enormous portion of human civilizati on. Time and again, massive edifices around the globe have been built that are encapsulations of the heavenly story, serving as stellar ‘computers.’ But this ast rotheological Masonry was corrupted, as the power mongering historicizers dro ve its true meaning and religion underground in a vicious quest to subjugate the wor ld and acquire its wealth.” + Acharya S., “The Christ Conspiracy” (244+5) “Imagine the power you would have to advance an Age nda and manipulate the human race if you knew the cycles of energy from th e Sun and other planets and how they were likely to affect human consciousness.

Jesus, Santa, Mithra and the Magic Mushroom Have you ever wondered why on Christmas we cut down /carry evergreen trees inside our houses, decorate them with fancy ornaments, and place presents underneath them? So, why do people bring Pine trees into their house s at the Winter Solstice, placing brightly colored (Red and White) packages under the ir boughs, as gifts to show their love for each other and as representations of the l ove of God and the gift of his Sons life? It is because, underneath the Pine bough is t he exact location where one would find this ‘Most Sacred’ Substance, the Amanita musc aria, in the wild.” –James Arthur, “Mushrooms and Mankind” (8) The Amanita muscaria is the red and white magic mus hroom that grows almost exclusively beneath Pine trees. One of the active substances in the hallucinogenic mushroom is DMT, an entheogen naturally produced in the brain’s pineal gland. The pinecone+shaped pine +al gland is an organ that produces the same DMT fo und in the pine tree fungus, Amanita muscaria."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":" “The Pine tree is one of the well3known central rel ics of Christmas. Under this tree is where those who are deemed good find their reward i n the form of a present. A big red and white rounded mushroom grows under the very tree we are to look under on Christmas morning to find our gift.” –James Arthur, “Mushrooms and Mankind” (6) Green, red, and white as Christmas colors comes from the evergreen tree and the red and white mushrooms underneath. The word Christmas originally comes from the Egyptian KRST (oiled/anointed one) and Mes, the sacred cakes annually made/ingested by the Egyptians. This Eucharist was originally made from Amanita muscaria or was the mushroom itself. The tradition existed all over the ancient world, but most of the iconography/symbology recognized today comes from pre+Christian Northern Europe. “The very name, ‘Christmas’ is a holiday name composed of the words, ‘Christ’ (meaning ‘one who is anointed with the Magical Substance’) and ‘Mass’ (a special religious service/ceremony of the sacramental ingestion of the Eucharist, the ‘Body of Christ’). In the Catholic tradition, this substance (Body/Soma) has been replaced by the doctrine of ‘Trans3substantiation’, whereby in a magical ceremo ny the Priests claim the ability to transform a ‘cracker/round3wafer’ into the literal ‘Body of Christ’; ie, a substitute or placebo.” +James Arthur, “Mushrooms and Mankind” (9+10) “Although most people see Christmas as a Christian holiday, most of the symbols and icons we associate with Christmas celebrations are actually derived from the shamanistic traditions of the tribal peopl es of pre3Christian Northern Europe. The sacred mushroom of these people was the red and white amanita muscaria mushroom ... These peoples lived in dwellings made of birch and reindeer hide, calle d ‘yurts.’ Somewhat similar to a teepee, the yurt's central smoke hole is often also used as an entranc e. After gathering the mushrooms from under the sacred trees where they appeared, the shamans would fill their sacks and return home. Climbing down the chimney3entrances, they would share out the mushroom's gifts with those within ... Santa also dresses like a mushroom gatherer. When it was time to go out and harvest the magical mushrooms, the an cient shamans would dress much like Santa, wearing red and white fur3trimmed coats and long black boots.” +Dana Larsen, “The Psychedelic Secrets of Santa Claus” Ca nnabis Culture, Marijuana Magazine, Dec 18 th , 2003"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":" To this day Siberian shamans dress in ceremonial re d and white fur+trimmed jackets to gather the magic mushrooms. First they pick and place the mushrooms to partially dry on nearby pine boughs which prepares them for i ngestion and makes the load lighter. This is why we decorate our Christmas tre es with ornaments and bulbs, because the gatherers would always adorn trees with drying mushrooms. Next the shaman collects his red and white presents in a sac k and proceeds to travel from house to house delivering them. During Siberian winters, the snow piles up past the doors of their yurts (huts), so the red and white clad shaman must climb down the smoke+hole (chimney) to deliver the presents in his sack. Finally the appreciative villagers string the mushrooms up or put them in stockings hung affront the fire to dry. When they awake in the morning, their presents from under the pine tree are all dried and ready to eat. “The amanita mushroom needs to be dried before bein g consumed; the drying process reduces the mushroom's toxicity while incre asing its potency. The shaman would guide the group in stringing the mushrooms an d hanging them around the hearth3fire to dry. This tradition is echoed in the modern stringing of popcorn and other items.” +Dana Larsen, “The Psychedelic Secrets of Santa C laus” Cannabis Culture, Marijuana Magazine, Dec 18 th , 2003 “The ancient shamanic use of Amanita muscaria in Si beria is well documented. Despite governmental oppression against its use, th ere are still many who refuse to accept the authorized state religion, and continue the shamanic traditions in secret. Just as the Siberian shaman (commonly dressing in r ed and white) would enter through the opening in the roof of a home where a r itual was to be done, Santa Claus also arrives on the roof and enters through the chimney. Just as the shamans would gather the mushrooms in bags which they would bring with them when performing a ceremony, Santa Claus also (on the Holy Day) brings presents in a bag.” +James Arthur, “Mushrooms and Mankind” (10) Siberian reindeer also enjoy eating amanita mushrooms and thus are often used as a lure by the deer+herding natives. Since one of the hallucinatory experiences often felt on psychedelic mushrooms is that of flying, Santa’s flying reindeer most likely derive from this. “Reindeer were the sacred animals of these semi3nom adic people, as the reindeer provided food, shelter, clothing and other necessit ies. Reindeer are also fond of eating the amanita mushrooms; they will seek them o ut, and then prance about while"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"under their influence ... The effects of the amanita mushroom usually include sensations of size distortion and flying. The feeli ng of flying could account for the legends of flying reindeer, and legends of shamanic journeys included stories of winged reindeer, transporting their riders up to th e highest branches of the World Tree.” +Dana Larsen, “The Psychedelic Secrets of Santa Claus” Cannabis Culture, Marijuana Magazine, Dec 18 th , 2003 The flying reindeer, sleigh, and the entire Santa Claus mythology originates from Siberia where Saint Nicholas, the patron Saint of children, is a supplanter to the indigenous Shamans. “Saint Nicholas, known as the ‘Patron Saint of Children,’ is the most revered saint in Russia, second only to the apostles. He is the Russian Orthodox Church's supplanter to the native people's highly respected local Shaman. A Shaman is a holy man that is well acquainted with a form of spirituality that incorporates plant entheogens which facilitate the NDE (Near Death Experience), or ‘out of body’ experience. Saint Nic holas may not have been a shaman, yet the symbolism on, and coloring of his r obes could lend to speculation.” –James Arthur, “Mushrooms and Mankind” (10) “One of the side effects of eating amanita mushroom s is that the skin and facial features take on a flushed, ruddy glow. This is why Santa is always shown with glowing red cheeks and nose. Even Santa's jolly ‘Ho , ho, ho!’ is the euphoric laugh of one who has indulged in the magic fungus.” +Dana Larsen, “The Psychedelic Secrets of Santa Claus” Cannabis Culture, Marijuana Magazin e, Dec 18 th , 2003 Could this by why Rudolph’s nose is red? In an interesting play on words, another name for a large, capped mushroom is a “toadstool.” So if Santa is a mushroom, and a mushroom is a stool, when children sit on Santa’s leg, they are sitting on a “toed” stool. Santa's famous magical journey, where his sleigh takes him around the whole planet in a single night, is developed from the ‘heavenly chariot’ used by the gods from whom Santa and other shamanic figures are descended. The chariot of Odin , Thor and even the Egyptian god Osiris is now known as the Big Dipper, which ci rcles around the North Star in a 243hour period. In different versions of the ancie nt story, the chariot was pulled by reindeer or horses. As the animals grow exhausted, their mingled spit and blood falls"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"to the ground, forming the amanita mushrooms.” +Dana Larsen, “The Psychedelic Secrets of Santa Claus” Cannabis Culture, Marijuana Magazine, Dec 18 th , 2003 “It is fairly common knowledge that the Weihnachtsmann (St. Nick) was an amalgamation of older Germanic/Norse gods such as Thor, Donner, Odin and Wotan. What's missing here is just as Sant a flies through the skies in his sleigh, Odin (as wel l as the rest) rode through the sky in his chariot, which is depicted in the stars by ‘The Big Dipper’. The Big Dipper is the chariot of Odin & Wotan, Thor, King Arthur, and even Osiris (of Egypt). The chariot tha t circles the North Star in a 24 hour period is thus also known as the sleigh of Santa Claus because it circl es his mythological home, the North Pole. It is no sur prise that Nordic/Germanic gods have connection to mushrooms in their mythology. As Thor throws his mushroom3shaped hammer to the ground, mighty thunde rs and lightning cracks cause the real mushroom(s) to appear. As the horses pulli ng Odin through the sky in his chariot become over3exerted, their blood3mingled sp it falls to the ground and causes the Amanita mushrooms to grow at those exact points .” –James Arthur, “Mushrooms and Mankind” (10+11) Probably the first Santa was Osiris in ancient Egyp t who rode his flying chariot to/from the North Pole, was born on December 25 th , and celebrated by putting presents underneath an evergreen tree. “Not only did Osiris ride the sky in a chariot, bu t after his death Isis found that an evergreen (Cedar ) had grown overnight from a dead stump to full3 sized; which was understood as a sign of Osiris' rebirth and immortality. Interestingly, the traditional birth of Osiris is the 25th of December . The 25th of December was also celebrated annually by putting presents around the Cedar tree. This tradition is at least five thousand years old. The birth of Horus to the goddess3virgin3mother, Isis, is perhaps the eldest representation of the goddess/so n mythology, yet it is impossible to know this or the real age of the Astro3theological3Virgo3giving3birt h3 to3the3child/god/star mythology for sure. However i t is the oldest source I have found.” –James Arthur, “Mushrooms and Mankind” (11) Santa, an anagram for Satan, dresses in red, keeps lists of naughty/nice children, and seems to steal Christmas from Jesus. But if understood in its original mushroom context, Santa’ s not a conniving, omniscient, list+ keeper. He’s an Entheogen + a plant or substance w hich is said to “generate the God within.” The word Entheogen breaks down, En for in side, Theo for God, and Gen for generate – generate the God inside. If you have ev er taken an Entheogen (i.e."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Psilocybin, DMT, Peyote, Ayahuasca), then you are a lready aware of the spiritual or even religious experiences associated with them. As anyone who has tried them knows, and most anyone who hasn’t fiercely denies, these Entheogens put us directly in contact with that spark of the divine within our selves. They allow access to higher consciousness and open our third+eyes; The outer ma terial world dissolves and the “five” senses return to a state of one sense, one c onsciousness. “First hand understanding is through the ingestion of the holy substances, of which there has been so much written, that this brief exp ose' merely scratches the surface of. It is this direct communal contact which is truly t he means whereby a human being can experience his true spiritual nature. One must take very seriously his /her own spirituality, for this is that which we truly are. As I stated in the opening sentence, ‘This experience is of extremely great value’. So m uch so, that I feel it necessary to the evolutionary process of each and every individu al, and inevitably to all of mankind.” +James Arthur, “Mushrooms and Mankind” (26) If you have mischief, wickedness, or secrecy in you, then entheogens will take you down into the depths of your own hell. But if you have kindness, love, and truth within you, entheogens will raise you up into the heights of that heaven. When people of a poor disposition or in a negative mood eat magic mushrooms they usually have a “bad trip” and experience frightening or depressing hallucinations. When people of a good disposition or in a positive mood eat mushrooms they usually have a great trip and experience hours of uncontrollable laughter and a loving, close feeling with everyone around. Just like at Christmas Santa keeps lists of children who are naughty and nice, at East er only good kids get to eat the colored eggs. This is likely because good kids on mushrooms are hilarious and lots of fun, whereas naughty kids on mushrooms guarantee a bad trip for everyone, so they get coal at Christmas and no eggs at Easter. “Santa Claus is an all3knowing icon that reads the hearts and intentions of everyone on the planet. Ea ch child is told the story of the round3man (who wears red and white) and his associates; reindeer, little peo ple and Mrs. Claus. They are also told the story of a miraculous worldwide flight in a sleigh which resul ts in presents being delivered under a tree. Yet when a c hild reaches the age of reasoning he is informed that th is story is all a fabrication. This revelation is deva stating upon the psyche of a young mind. It is also at this time that the child is often comforted and pacified from the shock by very strong reinforcement that the religio us systems which the parents or guardians profess are indeed factual. And an attemp t is made to incorporate the"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"respective religious traditions into the holiday as the REAL meaning for the celebration.” –James Arthur, “Mushrooms and Mankind” (6) Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny have both been upr ooted from their original positions. They began as mythological mushroom hero es understood in a spiritual context by both children and adults. Now their lit eral meaning has been suppressed, and a fake image has been corporatized by Coke, Cad bury and others. The effect this has had is to turn mythological heroes into fantasi es and lies. It was not meant for children to discover as they are coming of age that parents, family, and friends have lied to them about Santa and the Easter Bunny. It was meant for them to discover deeper meanings behind the mythologies such as the ancient Astrotheological understanding of the heavens, the knowledge of the zodiacal precession, and seasonal cycles like solstices and equinoxes. The whole complexity of the modern Christmas mythos is an unexplainable mess without the magic mushroom, the story is completely unintelligible. “Some psychologists have discussed the ‘cognitive dissonance’ which occurs when children are encouraged to believe in the literal existence of Santa Claus, only to have their parents' lie reveal ed when they are older. By so deceiving our children we rob them of a richer heritage ... Many people in the modern world have rejected Christmas as being too commercial, claiming that this ritual of giving is actually a celebration of materialism and greed. Ye t the true spirit of this winter festival lies not in the exchange of plastic toys, but in celebrating a gift from the earth: the fruiting top of a magical mushroom, and the revelatory experiences it can provide. Instead of perpetuating outdated and confusing holiday myths, it might be more fulfillin g to return to the original source of these seasonal celebrations. How about getting back to basics and enjoying some magical mushrooms with your loved ones this solstic e? What better gift can a family share than a little piece of love and enlightenment ?” +Dana Larsen, “The Psychedelic Secrets of Santa Claus” Cannabis Culture, Marijuana Magazine, Dec 18 th , 2003 The Easter egg hunt is another activity inexplicable without mushrooms. The current understanding is that the Easter bunny lays multi+colored eggs in or around every house for children to hunt for and collect in Easter baskets. But since when do rabbits lay eggs? Why are they colorful/spotted eggs? And why are they hidden for us to hunt and collect in baskets? Of course rabbits don’t lay eggs, but in ancient myth, the spring/fertility goddess Eostre and the Germanic Ostara are both said to have saved a bird whose wings had frozen during the winter by tu rning it into a rabbit. Since the"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"rabbit had once been a bird, it could still lay egg s, and that egg+laying hare became our Easter bunny. In the earlier Babylonian versio n Ishtar comes from the Moon in a giant egg. “The 'Christian' festival of Easter comes from the same source. Easter comes from the Babylonian goddess, Ishtar, (Semiramis again) and i t celebrated her son, Tammuz, who was, wait for it, the ‘only begotten son of the Moon goddess and Sun God’ 3 Nimrod and Semiramis. The ‘Easter’ (Ishtar) eggs and the ‘Easter bunny’ also come from Babylon. Queen Semiramis said she came from th e Moon in a giant egg and this became known as the Is htar egg. Tammuz was said to be very fond of rabbits and so we have the Easter bunny. Oh yes, and they also ate \"sacred cakes\" with a T on the top 3 the origin of our hot cross buns. The T is a major symb ol of Freemasonry because of its associations with Babylo n and Tammuz. The Christian wafer used in Catholic ceremo nies comes from the Egyptian ta3en3aah – the sacrificial bread of the Moon. Christians think the bread symbolizes the 'body of Jesus' when they are really involved in a ritual about the Egyptian Moon god.” + David Icke, “Tales from the Time Loop” In the ancient Egyptian mythos, Isis is fleeing fro m an enemy while in the form of a phoenix when she changes int o a hare to escape down a rabbit hole. Rabbits and birds have for ages been associated with spring/fertility, but less kno wn is their association with the magic mushroom. The red and w hite Amanita Muscaria has long been symbolized by the ph oenix, and the brown Amanita Panthera symbolized by the ha re. “The Phoenix: From the ashes (spores) the egg appears. Then comes the upturned cap resembling a gold and red colored bird (the gills as feathers). Then the heat (sun) burns the mushroom and it dissolves, once again leaving only ashes (spores), and finally repeating the whole cycle ... The Phoenix3 bird mythology is another piece of mushroom folklore. As the fetus is generated in the furnace of the uterus, so the mushroom, that ‘evil ferment of the soil’, as Nicander (second century BC) calls it, is created, a womb within a womb, as it were. Like the fabulous Phoenix, the mushroom is self3generated and regenerated, bursting forth from the volva, only to die as quickly and then apparently miraculously to reappear, a resurrection of its own self.” +"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"James Arthur, “Mushrooms and Mankind” (13 & 56) As the baby head of an Amanita Muscaria pops out of the ground, it pushes the pine needles aside forming a tiny circular wall that looks just like a birds nest. When there are many mushrooms close together, their heads budding through the pine needles look like little eggs in a fallen nest. Unlike bird’s eggs, however, these ones are spotted, colorful, and magical. Once the baby mushrooms are plucked out of the ground, the remaining dirt/needles look like a rabbit+hole, again repeating the bird into bunny symbolism. So families/children walked through the forests in early Spring with Easter baskets to hunt for and collect these magic mushrooms. During the A.D. times, there has been a Germanic/Christian Easter tradition of feasting on colored eggs after a long fast at lent, but the B.C . origins of Easter celebration again come from Egypt, where the “eggs” were well+known t o be not eggs, but budding baby mushrooms. “There are a number of hieroglyphic depictions of plants (many of which are psychedelic) on walls and within texts throughout Egypt. This is to be expect ed, yet this goes undetected or dismissed by most who a re studying Egypt and its religious writings ... The pil lars that are at every temple in Egypt are shaped like g iant mushrooms. These are shaped like the Amanita some are shaped like Psilocybe. Others look like tree fu ngus and are decorated with pictures of an incredible variety of plants.” +James Arthur, “Mushrooms and Mankind” (44 & 53) In Egypt countless pillars are shaped like huge mushrooms with tall stems, umbrella caps, and mushroom engravings all up, down, and around them. In the Egyptian Book of the Dead they are called “t he food of the gods,” or “celestial food” and “the flesh of the gods.” In Egyptian temples there are many pictures of gods/neters feeding humans the “ankh” cross/circle symbol which is said to represent the water of life and immortality. This also suggests the mushroom as it has been called “the Elixir of Immortality” and “the Fountain of Youth.” Pictures of winged Babylonian and Sumerian gods are shown feeding pinecones to humans. Could these"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"be reference to the pinecone+shaped pineal gland? At the Vatican there is suspiciously a gigantic statue of a pinecone in the Vatican “Court of the Pinecone.” On the Pope’s staff there is also a pinecone depicted right at the height of his third+eye/pineal gland. Ancient Sumerian gods were always depicted feeding men pinecones, just as the Egyptian gods were so often depicted feeding men the “ankh.” Because of their seedless growth/germination patter n, mushrooms were considered “virgin+births” by the ancients. They believed the mushrooms arose from dew, the divine fluid that magically appears at dawn. They also correctly believed the Amanita to be the “fruit of the tree” and referred to them as such. “The mushroom caps are the fruit of the larger mycelium beneath the soil which exists in a symbiotic relationship with the roots of the tree. To ancient people, these mushrooms were literally ‘the fruit of the tree.’ Ancient peoples were amazed at how these magical mushrooms sprang from the earth without any visible seed. They considered this \"virgin birth\" to have been the result of the morning dew, which was seen as the semen of the deity. The silver tinsel we drape onto our modern Christmas tree represents this divine fluid. ” +Dana Larsen, “The Psychedelic Secrets of Santa Claus” Cannabis Culture, Marijuana Magazine, Dec 18 th , 2003 “Serpents” is an anagram for “Presents” like those found under the Christmas tree. At Christmas we string lights coiling up and around the tree, like the Serpent on the Tree of Life which gives us the light of knowledge. A Christian also “Repents” for his sins which is curiously another anagram for Present and Serpent. “The actual mushroom ‘plant’ is the underground ‘mycelium’ or ‘mycorrhizae’, which is directly attached to the tree roots; the mushroom itself is only the fruit3body of the mycelium. The mushroom is literally the Fruit of the Tree. They grow in a mycorrhizal (not parasitic) relationship with the tree.

Even people that think they know, usually have no knowledge of these mushroom connections. The true symbolic meaning transcends dogmatic etymological and historical evidence, by revealing itself in the totally obvious iconography and historically associated myths and traditions.” +James Arthur, “Mushrooms and Mankind” (13) Here is just a partial list of the many terms/associations related to magic mushrooms. Soma was/is the Hindu plant+god and Greek for “body.” Ambrosia was Greek for “food of the gods.” The Egyptian Book of the Dead calls it “food of the gods” and “celestial food,” as well as “flesh of the gods.” It is Amrita, the Buddhist magical sacrament and Haoma, the Islamic sacrament. It’s been called the Bread of Life and the Loaf of Bliss, the Golden Fleece, the Cosmic Egg, the Easter Egg, the Small White Stone, the Philosophers Stone, the Swor d in the Stone, the Phoenix, the pillar/phallus of Osiris, the Djed pillar, the One Eyed Howler, the Eye of Horus, and the Djed+Eye (pronounced Jedi), The World Tree (many cultures thought the mushroom was the creator of the world), the Fly+ Agaric, the Fountain of Living Waters (since the mushroom is alive, 90% water, and fountain+shaped), and the Hammer of Thor. “The Mushroom itself has very interesting features that resemble, and have been related to Gold, Flesh, Blo od (and blood vessels), Phallus, Vulva, Fire, Saucer, Cup, as well as a disc or orb. The mushroom has been, anthropomorph ically, personified as a Man, a God, something of extraterr estrial origins, and a Plant God, SOMA, who was mediator be tween Mankind and the God/Gods/Goddesses, in the ancient Hindu religious books known as ‘The Vedas.’” +James Arthur, “Mushrooms and Mankind” (59) The psilocybin mushroom has properties similar to t hat of the amanita and has also been worshipped/mythologiz ed throughout history. Unlike the amanita, fruit of t he tree, psilocybin grows from the dung of a cow. In India cows are worshipped (hence “holy cow”) for many reasons , but especially for their holy shit/holy crap. The ancient Egyptians revered Mother Hathor, the heavenly cow whose body was the firmament and who daily gave bir th to Horus+Ra, her Golden Calf. In South East Asia t he"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"elephant is revered over other animals, like the co w in India, because magic mushrooms grow in elephant dung as well (hence Dumb o the flying elephant). Psilocybin mushrooms turn a dark blue when bruised or dried and so are usually depicted as such. This is why Pikanadt, the Hindu elephant man god, is blue and rules the realms of art and creativity. Other Hindu gods are also blue like Vishnu who is depicted with serpents around his head looking much like a mushroom. Krishna is blue too usually shown with a cow to his side. The Cartoon “Smurfs” are blue like psilocybin, they all wear liberty cap hats, and live in amanita muscaria houses! There have been many mythological mushroom heroes k nown throughout history. Perseus was an ancient mushroom hero, founder and K ing of the city+state of Mycenae (Mushroom City). Perseus flew around on wi nged sandals making “Perseia” a magical herb, grow wherever he dropped the chape of his scabbard. Wherever Perseus dropped his cap, “myces,” mushroom s would sprout underneath. Libertus is another mushroom hero whose depiction c an be found atop the US Capitol building of all places. Libertus wears a Liberty C ap (or Phrygian Cap) which is shaped like and named after the Liberty Cap mushroom. This is where we get the idea of a “thinking cap” because when you ingest the cap you are teleported into an introspective, wondrous experience. The Phrygian/Liberty Cap was worn by Masonic revolutionaries during the French and American revolutions as well as by Perseus, Mithra, Santa, Elves, and the Smurfs. It is also worn as a “night cap,” a double entendre which nowadays means having a alcoholic beverage before bed. The original idea of a night cap, however, was when Mithraic/Mystery school initiates would eat a large mushroom cap then lay in hot tubs and astrally project out o f body. Another mushroom hero was King Arthur of Camelot. Arthur pulled the Sword from the Stone, founded the Knights of the Round Table and made the Quest for the Holy Grail. All three of these legends actually refer to stages of the mushroom. The mushroom begins like an egg or a small white stone which pushes and wiggles upwards like a snake. This is the Sword in the Stone stage (Sword is “S+word,” snakes/serpents, in the stone). Then the mushroom cap opens up and flattens out making a per fect circle like a round table top"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"+ the Round Table stage. Lastly the edges of the m ushroom upturn collecting the mushroom juices and dew, the drinkable “blood of the gods.” This is called the Holy Grail stage and looks/acts just like a cup. “In its infant (button) state, the muscaria resemb les a small white stone. The pulling of the sword from the stone (a symbol of wielding the power), is another Arthurian legend connecting the mushroom to the myth. The quest for the Grail itself is the quest for the knowledge of the mushroom. The Parcival myth depicts paths (traditions), which are to be explored (but not adhered to), in order to complete the quest. This quest is described in the myths as a journey into the forest (the world) and finding paths (systems) which one may follow, for a time, but ultimately one must blaze his/her own trail in order to truly reach the final goal, the Holy Grail (the discovery and usage of the mushroom). The search for the Holy Grail is a mythology that has become, through adaptation, a part of the story of the Crucifixion. Some of the s tories incorporate a cup which was used to catch some of the flowing blood of Jesus as he died on the cross. This cup, like many other relics, was thereby thought to possess m agical powers. Historically, the mushroom has been the container for the juice of the ‘elixir of immortality’, or the ‘blood of God’, in many myths. The final shape of the muscaria, with its inverted cap, is the reason that the cup/fountain/grail symbology is used in the stories. King Arthur, as a child, gained his rightful place as King by pulling the sword from the stone. This is symbolic for wielding the power of the mushroom. The stone is a metaphor for the mushr oom, and pulling the sword from it is symbolic of being able to crack the code and possess the power of the magical plant. After Arthur took ill (in his later years) h e was told that he must seek and find the Holy Grail to r enew his strength and re3acquire his power.” +James Arthur, “Mushrooms and Mankind” (14+15) The Kundalini serpent (explained in detail later) i s said to remain coiled three and a half times around the root chakra. Once awakened the serpent energy climbs up from the root/stone and around the spine, the Tree of Life. This process is analogous to the growth of a mushroom which begins looking like a stone then wriggles upward like a snake. The root chakra serp ent energy rises to the crown chakra which is usually symbolized by an eagle or other majestic bird.

This is also why Egyptian Pharaoh’s head+dresses had snakes/birds coming out from the third+eye poin t. “Transforming out of the button/egg infantile state , the mushroom's appearance becomes more like that of a snake. Once the mushroo m has fully grown, decayed, and dissolved it leaves behind a hole. This is due to i t's pushing the Pine needles or earth outward, as it expands. Around the hole is a white powdery substance, actually the many spores it left behind. This hole resembles a snake's hole, or lair, which is another reasoning for the mushroom's being symbolized as a snake. Most certainly, the depiction of the snake, in the garden of Eden, which revealed to humans secret knowledge that the fruit of the tree would make them as god, is a grand myth regarding this association.” +James Arthur, “Mushrooms and Mankind” (55) “The prime example of the relation between the serpent and the mushroom is, of course, in the Garden of Eden story of the Old Testament. The cunning reptile prevails upon Eve and her husband to eat of the tree, whose fruit ‘made them as gods, knowing good and evil’ (Gen 3:4). The whole Eden story is mushroom3b ased mythology, not least in the identity of the ‘tree’ as the sacred fungus, as we shall see. Even as late as the thirteenth3century some recollection of the old tra dition was known among Christians, to judge from a fresco painted on the w all of a ruined church in Plaincourault in France. There the Amanita muscari a is gloriously portrayed, entwined with a serpent, whilst Eve stands by holdi ng her belly.” +John Allegro, “The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross” (48) This is why Medusa’s serpent hair turns men to ston e. This is why Mithra, the ancient mushroom hero is depicted rising from a stone entwined in snakes. Mithra, one of the 15 pre+Christian gods with exact ly the same story as Jesus, was undeniably a mushroom god. Just as Christians take communion, Mithraic initiates ate mushroom sacraments as part of their worship. Just as Christians line up in Church to receive the body and blood of Christ, so did initia tes in the Mithraeum line up to receive the body and blood of Mithra. “Mithra initiates would partake of a Sacred Meal in their ceremonies, invoking The Out Of Body experience. An ritually designed sacramental, Shama nistic, and communal Gnosis. The Mithraic temples of worship, known as Mithraeum , are designed like few other temples on earth. Typically inside the place of wor ship would be rows of bathtubs"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"(tubs) along the two side walls, or lined in two pa rallel rows from the rear wall to the front of the main room. Providing places where many initiates could lie down during ceremonies. The tubs were tools in the mechanics of producing a communal experience. The purpose being, the joining together of the minds of the participants with the universal mind. The next phase being, to exit the planet (physical realm) in a spiritual flight to the heavens (stars). This is a bold expectation to perceive, let alone one you can convince someone they have had, especially if after the ceremony they have not. Filled with salt water these tubs would become instant sensory3 deprivation3tanks. Much like those depicted in the movie ‘Altered States’ ... The religion of Mithra centered around the initiate's a bility to communally, astral3travel. Of course the out3of3body experience was facilitate d through the eating of the sacred meal. After consumption, the initiates could traver se the galaxies, witnessing, as the ancient Egyptians, first hand, the reality that the spirit of the human being is not restricted to the physical universe, or the physical body for that matter. This is the true revelation of the immortality of the soul, or at least the realization of such. This concept is so similar to the Egyptian initiatory rites that it is solid evidence some of the hidden traditions of the ancients did migrate into later incarnations of various religious orders.” +James Arthur, “Mushrooms and Mankind” (56+58) The Bible talks about sacred “Manna” that the Israelites ate in the desert. Many clues are given as to just what Manna is. The Bible says Manna was a small round edible object that appeared on the ground after dew had fallen. If the Manna was left out in the Sun too long it would breed worms and stink. Exodus 16:14 reads, “ And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground. ” Exodus 16:20 continues, “... some of them left of it till the morning, and it bred worms, and stank .” The small, round, edible objects which when left in the Sun rot, breed worms, and stink ar e none other than mushrooms. “Manna was thought of as being produced miraculousl y (IE: birth without seed). This is a perfect botanical description of a mushroom. B irth without seed (miraculous) is due to spores being microscopic and not visible to the naked eye. Jesus describes the Mannas in detail in the book of John. In this story Jesus attempts to make clear; of manna, there are two different ones/kinds. He descr ibes the manna that he is giving the disciples (last supper) as the Manna that besto ws immortality. His statement,"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"unless you have eaten his flesh/body (Soma/Manna), and drink of his blood (Soma Juice), you have no life in you, takes on a whole n ew meaning in light of this discovery. The Manna is directly associated with t he fruit of the Tree of Life in the 2nd chapter of the book of Revelation. It is the reward for those who overcome (the lies of the world). The ‘Fruit of the Tree’, the ‘Hidden Manna’ and the ‘Small White Stone’ are spoken of separately, but in the same context. All of thes e are symbols for the Amanita muscaria.” +James Arthur, “Mushrooms and Mankind” (16+17) John 6:31+41 reads, “ Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat. Then Jesus said unto them, verily verily I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven ... Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life ... The Jews then murmured at him, because he sa id, I am the bread that came down from heaven .” Priests and pastors vehemently deny that “the true bread, the bread from heaven” is a mushroom, but have a difficult time explaining it a s literal bread. Bread is not a small, round thing found dew+covered in the wildern ess. Nor does it contain any of the mystical properties bestowed upon it. This is undeniably a reference to the magic mushroom. “The concept of the literal ingestion of the body of God is highly downplayed by religious scholars of today. The body (soma) being a fleshy Mushroom is much more palatable than trying to stomach cannibalism or the transformation of ordinary substances. Many questions should be asked about this cosmopolitan idea of the ‘Sacramental Substance’. Unfortunately, the religious experts shun the notion, insisting that the entire idea is nothing more than symbolic. A symbol points at something else, not us ually at another symbology. The Catholic church, in the early 1100's, decided to ha ve the final word on this subject by establishing (under Emperor/Pope Innocent III) the ‘Doctrine of Trans3 Substantiation’. This is whereby, the Priests, by t heir assumed holy power, claim to be able to say some magical words, and turn ordinary b read into the literal ‘Body of God’. This event is one of the biggest evil decepti ons of all time, is an undermining of the basic esoteric aspects of the religion, and is, arguably, the most horrible and damning event to ever happen to Christendom, and as such the entire human race. Jesus clearly describes the Manna that he calls his body in the book of John."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"Repeatedly describing the ‘Thing/Manna’ as a substa nce hidden from the world, but revealed to his disciples. Understanding the last s upper story becomes as simplistic as it gets, if you know how to decipher the event. Ada mantly; Jesus says, ‘Take and eat, This is my Body.’” +James Arthur, “Mushrooms and Mankind” (18) John 6:53+6 reads, “ Then Jesus said unto them, Verily verily I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the son of man, and drink his bloo d, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eterna l life; and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him .” Jesus says this is my body, this is my blood, and lest ye drink/eat of this you have no life in you! These are strong words, thus it is important to realize that the substances Jesus referred to are not communion wafers and grape wine. The amanita had l ong before Christianity been known as “the flesh of the gods” and “the blood of the gods” and this is what is meant. “This is saying pretty clearly that the eating and drinking is physical. My body is flesh indeed, and my blood is drink indeed, and the added statement that when you eat, it is inside of you leaves little room for debate that th is is a substance, not a phantom symbol alone. For those who choose to debate this I ask that they show me their substance because according to Jesus' words unless you eat and drink of ‘It’ you have no life in you. By the way, do I really need to mention that this is not some strange reference to Cannibalism? I sure hope not, if you still think this, read on. Somewhere, some of this must convince you that he is not saying to take a bite out of his arm, or any other piece of his actual anatomy ... In my opinion, the magical act of ‘Trans3Substantiation’ has no merit. The statement that Jesus makes ‘Unless you eat and drink you have no life in you’ would seem to condemn the replacement of whatever the real thing is with a pl acebo (substitute).” +James Arthur, “Mushrooms and Mankind” (29+30) Shiva the Hindu god is a hermaphrodite with one tes ticle, a penis, vagina, and one breast. This is another personification of the mus hroom just like Mithra. The first"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"stage of the mushroom is considered male as it look s like a penis. Then the stem pushes the ball/uterus/breast up out of the egg. A s the arms of the mushroom cap open to the sides, it’s as though the female aspect opens from the male “rib.” Jesus, like Krishna, Dionysus, and the other mushroom gods, stands with legs together, wears a crown of thorns, and a sash on his waist while being crucified. His legs together with arms outstretched on the cross make the same “T” shape as the mushroom during its optimum Round Table stage. The sash worn by Jesus is the ruffle found halfway up the stem of all amanitas, and Jesus’ thorny crown is the thorny mushroom top. The reason Jesus is crucified and tells us to eat his body is that the mushroom must die for us to eat it. “The fact that the mushrooms must be dried before consumption is another euphemism of the god needing to die, or sacrifice himself, to save mankind through atonement (at3one3ment) ... It can be argued that if you trace all of the gods back through time it may be possible to find the original. This original resides in the myths of the gods themselves, as those aspects that remain t he same. ‘Take and eat, this is my body’ is the central theme. All of the ancient god myths contain some sort of a sacramental food, and anthropomorphically this food becomes, at some point, a personification of the god itself.” +James Arthur, “Mushrooms and Mankind” (12 & 53) Jesus dies for your sins. Sin was originally an ar chery term meaning “to miss the mark.” The mushroom dies so you may eat it, and th e introspective experiences it brings washes away your sins. You understand how y ou’ve “missed the mark” in life. This is the original meaning, but the Church has pe rverted this idea into a guilt mechanism, scaring people with hell and trapping th em in confession booths. While on the cross, Jesus is stabbed in the rib and his blood comes out and is collected in the Holy Grail. This idea of a “side wounded sa vior” was a common theme among pre+Christian gods. The Vatican and Templars have promoted the idea that the Shroud of Turin, the Spear of Longinus/Destiny, and the Holy Grail are actual artifacts, but in fact they are all occult symbolis m from ancient mushroom mythologies. Proverbs 5:15 reads “ drink water from your own cistern, drink water from your own well .” John 7:37+8 says, “ Jesus stood and cried saying, If any man thirst, le t him come unto me, and drink. He shall believeth on me as the scripture hath said, out of his body shall flow rivers of living water .” Jesus is said to have turned water into wine and speaks of drinking water from him and from your own well/cistern. What does all this mean? "},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":" “The active ingredients of the amanita mushrooms are not metabolized by the body, and so they remain active in the urine. In fact, it is safer to drink the urine of one who has consumed the mushrooms than to eat the mushrooms directly, as many of the toxic compounds are processed and eliminated on the first pass through the body. It was common practice among ancient people to recycle the potent effects of the mushroom by drinking each other's urine. The amanita's ingredients can remain potent even after six passes through the human body. Some scholars argue that this is the origin of the phrase ‘to get pissed,’ a s this urine3drinking activity preceded alcohol by thousands of years. Often the urine of tripped3out reindeer would be consumed for its psychedelic effects. This effect goes the other way too, as reindeer also enjoy the urine of a human, especially one who has consumed the mushrooms. In fact, reindeer will seek out human urine to drink, and some [Siberian] tribesmen carry sealskin containers of their own collected piss, which they use to attract stray reindeer back into the herd.” +Dana Larsen, “The Psychedelic Secrets of Santa Claus” Cannabis Cultur e, Marijuana Magazine, Dec 18 th , 2003 Is this why you often see stone water fountains wit h little boys urinating into upturned levels looking like mushrooms? Jesus is often depicted holding up a white flag wit h a red cross on it, the symbol of the Knights Templar/Masons. Do the red and white flag of Jesus and clothing of the Knights Templar refer to the amanita muscaria? John Allegro, Oxford graduate and world’s leading philologist, was commissioned to translate the Qumran Dead Sea Scrolls. But after his book “The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross” released and he died, the Catholic Church quickly bought the copyright and buried it; one Vatican insider quoted saying it would never again see the light of day. It is currently sparsely available in e+book format but has been out of print for years (Meanwhile Dan Brown is shaking hands with the Pope and “Da Vinci Code” is a best selling book and movie). “[John] Allegro linguistically linked the SOMA (Greek=Body), the Manna (Sumerian = Mushroom), (of which there are two kinds), the names Jesus, James, and John, the Fruit of the tree of Knowledge, and the"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"symbol of the cross, to the Amanita muscaria, by st ating that all of these names and terms (and others) were synonyms and wordplay for t he hidden identity of the mushroom.

Although he did stretch the boundaries (at le ast twice) of some established scholarship, the proof is in the pudding (so to spe ak) and most of his associations are beyond repute.” +James Arthur, “Mushrooms and Mankind” (16) “The Dead Sea Scrolls, found in caves near Qumran i n 1947, have offered a greater insight into their [Essenes] lifestyle and beliefs, despite suppression by the authorities who wish to maintain the official versi on of history. The scrolls were hidden from the Romans during the ill3fated Judean revolt around 70 AD. Some 500 Hebrew and Aramaic manuscripts were found, which in cluded texts from the Old Testament, among them a complete draft of the Book of Isaiah, centuries older than the one in the Bible. There were scores of document s relating to the Essene customs and organization. The scrolls confirm that the Esse nes were fanatics who followed to the letter the Levite inventions in the Old Testame nt texts. Anyone who didn’t do the same was their enemy and they fiercely opposed the Roman occupation ... The Essenes had a detailed understanding of drugs, incl uding the hallucinogenic variety, which were used in mystery school initiations and f or entering other states of consciousness. The properties of the ‘sacred mushro oms’ or ‘Holy Plant’ were so much part of life in the secret brotherhood that th e Jewish high priest wore a mushroom cap to acknowledge their importance. They had special rituals for their preparation and use. The mushroom, too, was given s on of God’ connotations (what wasn’t?) and it was connected to the Sun cycle. The mushrooms were picked with great reverence before sunrise and many symbols of this ritual can be found in the Bible and far older texts. Again, the use of the sacred mushroom and other drugs, and the secret knowledge of their properties, can be traced back to the earliest days of Sumer.” –David Icke, “The Biggest Secret” (95+ 6) John Allegro shows how the Bible, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the etymology of various Mesopotamian languages all have mushroom and sexual puns/terms interwoven. This is due to the prominence in the pre+Christian world of mushroom and fertility cults. Hebrew, Greek, and Aramaic, the languages of the Bible, all ultimately derive from ancient Sumerian, where many original meanings had been long lost. For instance, the god s of the Greeks and Hebrews, Zeus and Yahweh (Jehovah ) have names derived from Sumerian words meaning “seed of life” and “juice of fecundity.” The name Herod, as in King Herod, “ardeola” in Latin, serves as a word play on the Semitic “ardilia” which means “mushroom.” The name Jesus, in Hebrew “yehoshiia” comes from the Sumerian “JA U ShiJ A” which means “semen which sav es, restores, heals.” This is comparable to the fertility god Dionysus, whose cul t emblem was an erect phallus, and whose Sumerian name “IA+U+Nu+ShUSh” also means “semen, seed that saves.” "},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"“Under that again there lie the basic conceptions o f the mushroom cult. Here is the real stuff of the mystery3fertility philosophy. For example, to find their parables of the Kingdom, the writers make comparisons with objects and activities which, at the surface level of understanding, are often really ab surd, besides being self3 contradictory about the manner and form of the King dom’s coming. The passage that likens the Kingdom to a mustard seed, for example, and then speaks of birds nesting in the branches of the grown plant (Matt 13:31f., e tc.), has driven the biblical naturalists to distraction looking for a mustard ‘t ree’ suitable as roosting places for the fowls of the air. They could have saved themsel ves the trouble since the reference, at the ‘lower’ level, is simply a play on the Semit ic khardelä’, ‘mustard’ and ‘ardilã’, ‘mushroom’ ... If it seems strange to us that the wri ters of these stories should have used such a trivial literary device as punning so e xtensively, it should be remembered that they were heirs to a very long tradition of th is kind of word3spinning. The Old Testament is full of it, particularly where proper names are concerned, and very many more instances almost certainly lie beneath the sur face, where writers are playing with dialectal forms of the words which have become lost over the centuries. Furthermore, it is now becoming clear that many of the Old Testament traditions have reached us in a Semitic dialect which was not the o ne in which they were composed, so that the original word3play which they expressed has been lost.” +John Allegro, “The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross” (32) Today in Iran (Persia) the mushroom is called “SamJrukh,” which traces back to the Sumerian “ShU Mar Ugu/Aga,” or “Crown of the Womb+Favorer,” the glans/top of the fungus. The Sumerian “Bar Ia U Na,” meaning “capsule of fecundity; womb” connects to multiple names that relate the mushroom with the tiny “womb” from which the stem emerges. Another Aramaic example is “Pleasing the Jews” which comes from the Sumerian mushroom name “MashTabBaRi” or “that which is pleasing to the Hebrews/Jews.” The Hebrew “kotereih” from the Sumerian “GU+TAR” means “top of the head: penis ” and is the most common Semitic word for mushroom; In Arabic it is “phutr,” in Aramaic it is “pitra,” and in the English New Testament is “Peter.” Allegro’s ex amples continue on like this for over a hundred pages. “We must be in no doubt of the effect that importin g a new, mushroom element into the New Testament picture must have on our understa nding of the origin and nature of Christianity ... For the pseudo3translation demons trates an intention of deceit, and since mushrooms appear nowhere in the ‘surface’ tal e of Jesus, it follows that the secret reference to the cult must be the true relev ance of the whole. If the writers have gone to the trouble of concealing by ingenious lite rary devices, here, and as we have seen, in many cases elsewhere, secret names of the mushroom, not only must its worship have been central to the religion, but the exigencies of the time must have demanded they should be transmitted among the initi ates and their successors in a way that would not bring their enemies down upon th em. It therefore follows that the “surface” details of the story, names, places, and possibly doctrinal teachings must"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"be equally as false as the pseudo3renderings of the secret names.” +John Allegro, “The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross” (106+7) “For centuries, the impression given by religionist s is that to be a moral person, one must not only forgo but disdain sexuality, viewing it as if it were a curse from the devil rather than a ‘gift from God.’ The same can b e said of drugs, at least of the variety that has anything to do with altering consc iousness, even if such drugs are in the form of ‘God3given’ plants. Hence, the picture of a religious or righteous individual is basically someone who must have (hete rosexual) sex only with one person within a sanctioned marriage, if at all; to be in a constant state of procreation; and to remain as sober as ‘a judge.’ T o those who think life is to be enjoyed, rather than endured, this picture represen ts a dull, robotic state, to say the least. The reality is that there have been times o n this planet when cultures have recognized sacred sexual practices and sacramental plants not only as gifts from ‘God’ but also paths to ‘God,’ or ‘Cosmic Conscious ness,’ as it were. Indeed, sex and drugs have been considered from time immemorial as devices to create union with the divine, which is a major reason behind the negative spin put on them by religionists, who insist that only they, ‘Jesus’ or some other entity can be avenues to the divine. In actuality, it is the priest’s task to create an artificial separation between human beings and the omnipresent ‘God’” +Acharya S., “The Christ Conspiracy” (193) Through a long process of incremental changes the Christian churches (and other Brotherhood religions) have completely changed what it means to be religious. The ancient world consisted of mushroom and fertility cults, nature worship, and an astrological/astronomical based the ology (Astrotheology). Nowadays the three things of ancient reverence which modern religions were actually based on + sex, drugs, and astrology + are condemned and consi dered sinful. “If an all3powerful, dictatorial state religion was to succeed, it would need to destroy this concept of sacred sex and sacramental drugs fr om the human psyche and replace it with fear and guilt, such that those who had sex , for example, would be driven to cleanse themselves of their perceived sins by confe ssion or other priest craft. The exploitation of humanity’s weakness regarding sex i n particular worked nicely for priestly conspirators, since they could rail agains t it, knowing very well that people would continue to have it, such that the guilty wou ld then be forced to return repeatedly to the Church for absolution from ‘sins. ’ Despite their best efforts, however, the various religionists could not eradica te the widespread spiritual practices utilizing sex and drugs, even under penal ty of death. In reality, they held these practices for themselves while hypocritically preaching their evils to the masses and exhorting abstinence from them. As noted, along with the knowledge of astrology, the use of sex and drugs actually has formed part o f the esoteric religion or ‘mysteries’ hidden from the masses by the brotherho ods and secret societies that"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"create exoteric and vulgar religions for the masses . Indeed, these ‘sacraments’ constituted a significant part of the mysteries, as many schools and cults have used sex and drugs in their initiation rites.” +Acharya S., “The Christ Conspiracy” (193) “I have spoken personally with High Priests and Bishops (Secret Society Initiates), who simply told me that they could not discuss anything with me because of their oaths of secrecy. In fact they were so blown away that I knew the information, that it scared the hell out of them. Entheogens, and particularly the Amanita muscaria, are a huge secret. The initiatory rites, into this particular field, are so far up the totem pole of secret societies and religions th at when you find those who know, they really freak out, that anyone else knows, beca use it cuts to the deepest recesses of their self perceived spirituality, and cuts to the center of their most secret God/Society given indoctrination experiences. They have this ce rtain look in their eyes, and unless you somehow are perceived as a threat to them, they invariably have the need to tell you that they do know what you are talking about (w hich is likely a violation of oath in itself), but they cannot discuss it further.” +James Arthur, “Mushrooms and Mankind (23) Atlantis Our Rockefeller textbooks tell us that nobody in th e ancient world had ever crossed the Atlantic before Columbus.

The places known as Atlantis, Dilm un, and Lemuria are mentioned in the records of Sumeria. This is an obvious indicati on that these societies or cities pre3 dated the Sumerian era.

Of the ubiquitousness and similarity of pyramids, David Hatcher Childress states: Mayan pyramids are found from Central America to as far away as the Indonesian island of Java. The pyramid of Sukuh, on the slopes of Mount Lawu near Surakarta in central Java is an amazing temple with stone stelae and a step pyramid that would match any in the jungles of Central America. The pyramid is in fact virtually identical to the pyramids found at the ancient Mayan site at Uaxactun, near Tikal. In speaking of the global ci vilization, Keel elucidates the weaknesses of the current archaeological paradigm: All these things seem to be interrelated, as if they were once part of some gre at civilization—a common culture that spread throughout the world and then died ...We have a reasonably complete history of the past two thousand years, and a half3 baked archaeological reconstruction of the past five thousand years. But there are so many gaps in our knowledge that most the popular archaeological theories really have very little merit. Indeed, we can’t even be sure that the Egyptians built the Great Pyramid ... In fact, the Great Pyramid is admittedly much more ancient than the Egyptians of history, as Hotema relates: When the most ancient Egyptians first saw the mysterious Sphinx and the great Pyramid of Gizeh, only their tops projected above the wind3blown sand of the desert. They knew no more about the purpose of these structures, their builders, or when they were built, than we do” + Acharya S., “The Christ Conspiracy” (279) The Great Pyramids at Giza, even by today’s standards, are absolute miracles in archite cture, masonry/construction,"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"mathematics, and astronomy. The dimensions of the pyramids are extremely accurate and the site was leveled to within a fraction of an inch over the entire base. This is comparable to the accuracy possible with modern con struction/surveying methods and laser leveling. “Beneath the now3removed outer layer, the Pyramid’s construction consists of approximately 2,500,000 dressed stones, mostly yellow limestone, but with harder granite for certain interior features. The total mass of the Great Pyramid is estimated at around 90 million cubic feet, which would weigh between 637 million tons. To put this into proper perspective, the highest cathedral nave in E urope would fit three times into its height, and its mass exceeds that of all the cathed rals, churches and chapels built in England since the beginning of Christianity! The Gr eat Pyramid is often cited as the largest building on Earth, with twice the volume an d thirty times the mass of New York’s famous Empire State Building. The Pyramid re sts on an artificially leveled platform, which is less than 22 inches thick, yet i s still almost perfectly level, with errors of less than an inch across its entire area, despite supporting such an enormous weight for thousands of years. The base of the Pyramid is set out perfectly square 3 no mean feat of engineering in itself.” + Alan F. Alford, “Gods of the New Millennium – The Shattering Truth of Human Origins” (41) Up until the last millennium the pyramids were covered completely with smooth polished limestone casing blocks. In other words, the pyramids were not an irregular looking series of steps with a missing capstone like they are now. They were covered with 115,000 10+ton casing sheets of polished limestone fitted so perfectly that a razor’s edge couldn’t get between casings, less than 1/50 th of an inch."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"The Egyptians wrote how it reflected the sun like a mirror on all sides. Today there are still a few polished casings leftover at the ba se of one side. “Our first example of twentieth century engineering in the Giza pyramids is the six sided limestone casing blocks, which were polished and precision, carved to fit perfectly with each other and the core stones, with joints measuring less than one fiftieth of an inch. As if this was not incredible enough, all of these stones were found to be joined together with an extremely fine but st rong cement, which had been applied evenly on semi3vertical faces across a surf ace expanse covering 21 acres on the Great pyramid alone! ... The second example is th e internal passages of the Great Pyramid. These passages have been measured countles s times and found to be perfectly straight, with a deviation, in the case o f the Descending Passage, of less than one fiftieth of an inch along its masonry part . Over a length of 150 feet that is incredible. If one includes the further 200 feet of passage bored through the solid rock, the error is less than one quarter of an inch . Now this is engineering of the highest precision, comparable with twentieth centur y technology, but supposedly achieved 4,500 years ago: Our third example is the machining of granite within the pyramids. One of the first archaeologists to carry out a thorough survey of the Pyramid was Petrie, who was particularly struck by the granite coffer in the King’s Chamber. The precision with which the coffer had be en carved out of a single block of extremely hard granite struck him as quite remarkable. Petrie estimated that diamond3 tipped drills would need to have been applied with a pressure of two tons, in order to hollow out the granite box. It was not a serious suggestion as to the method actually used. but simply his way of expressing the impossibility of creating that artifact using nineteenth century technology. It is still a diffic ult challenge, even with twentieth century technology. And yet we are supposed to beli eve that Khufu achieved this at a time when the Egyptians possessed only the most bas ic copper hand tools.” +Alan F. Alford, “Gods of the New Millennium – The Shatterin g Truth of Human Origins” (43+4) Under the pyramids are large tunnels hundreds of me ters deep drilled into limestone bedrock with almost perfect 90 degree angles. This kind of drilling technology has only existed (in our current paradigm) for under a century, so how were they drilling, chiseling and lifting all these megalithic structur es? In a famous meeting with a panel of Egyptologists, author of “Giza Power Plant” Chri stopher Dunn brought a slab of granite, a hammer and a copper chisel and asked for a demonstration of how Egyptians were supposed to have chiseled out thousa nd+ton granite obelisks using simple hand tools. After a few whacks at it, the c opper chisel had a deep indent and not a chip of granite was displaced."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":" “Chris Dunn found that many artifacts bore the same marks as conventional twentieth century machining methods 3 sawing, lathe and milling practices He was particularly interested, however, in the evidence o f a modern processing technique known as trepanning. This process is used to excava te a hollow in a block of hard stone by first drilling, and then breaking out, the remaining “core” Petrie had studied both the hollows and the cores, and been astonished to find spiral grooves on the core which indicated a drill feed rate of 0.100 inch per revolution of the drill. This initially seemed to be impossible. In 1983, Dunn had ascertai ned that industrial diamond drills could cut granite with a drill rotation spee d of 900 revolutions per minute and a feed rate of 0.0002 inch per revolution. What these technicalities actually mean is that the ancient Egyptians were cutting their granite wi th a feed rate 500 times greater than 1983 technology!” +Alan F. Alford, “Gods of the New Millennium – Th e Shattering Truth of Human Origins” (44) “On the granite core the spiral of the cut sinks 1 inch in the circumference of 6 inches, a rate of ploughing out which is astonishin g ... These rapid spiral grooves cannot be ascribed to anything but the descent of t he drill into the granite under enormous pressure.” +W.M. Flinders Petrie, “The Pyramids and Temples at Gizeh” “Wasn’t it peculiar that at the supposed dawn of hu man civilization, more than 4500 years ago, the ancient Egyptians had acquired what sounded like industrial3age drills packing a ton or more of punch and capable of slick ing through hard stones like hot knives through butter?” +Graham Hancock, “Fingerprints of the Gods” “In the first and second pyramids at Giza there are granite portcullises in the lower passages which still baffle experts today. Firstly their complex designs suggest a use much more advanced than deterring robbers (the Egyp tologist explanation). It would take about 50 men to lift the portcullis slabs into place, yet the narrow corridors they’re positioned into could have only been occupied by a few men at a time.” +W.M. Flinders Petrie, “The Pyramids and Temples at Gizeh,” (36) The pyramids also encode high mathematics supposedly unknown to the simple ancient Egyptians. To begin with the pyramids are located precisely on the 30 th degree latitude and aligned to within 3 arc minutes of true north. The se are beyond coincidence so it can be assumed that they could very accurately measure both latitude and longitude. The ratio of the great pyramid’s height to its base per imeter is exactly Pi (3.14). The “Kings Chamber” and other rooms are perfect “golden rectangles” expressing the mystical number Phi 1.618. The ratio between succe ssive numbers in the Fibonacci sequence increasingly approach Phi as you go on fro m 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34... the resulting graph is known as the fractal “golden spi ral” and looks like a conch shell. Establishment Egyptologists say these mathematical considerations are all coincidence maintaining that ancient Egyptians didn ’t possess these concepts. But the"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"reality is, the ancient Egyptians did possess highe r math and they purposely encoded it into their construction. “Some routine mathematical games were built into th e dimensions of the sarcophagus. For example, it had an internal volum e of 1166.4 liters and an external volume of exactly twice that, 2332.8 liters. Such a precise coincidence could not have been arrived at accidentally: the walls of the coff er had been cut to machine3age tolerances by craftsmen of enormous skill and exper ience.” +Graham Hancock, “Fingerprints of the Gods” In the Kings Chamber the floor diagonal is precisel y twice the room’s height. W.M. Flinders Petrie says they managed to place the King s Chamber perfectly “ where the vertical section of the Pyramid was halved, where t he area of the horizontal section was half that of the base, where the diagonal from corner to corner was equal to the length of the base, and where the width of the face was equal to half the diagonal of the base .” Do you suppose these mathematics were accidenta l? Egyptologists say that the Giza pyramids were built for three pharaohs over the course of a hundred years. There are over 2.5 million sto nes, so if you built 24 hours a day for 100 years that means fitting one (average 3.5 t on) stone into place every 8.5 minutes. Using current technology, multiple cranes and work crews, we still couldn’t make that kind of time, nor could we match the craf tsmanship. Six million tons of stone, underground tunnels, cha mbers, corridors, 45/90 degree shafts, pi and phi ratios, golden rectangles and ot her mathematical inclusions, perfect cardinal alignments, right+angles, astrological con siderations and flawless masonry. How did ancient man the whole world over build thes e huge magnificent pyramids? They stacked stones so heavy, many of which cannot be lifted into place with the technology and machinery available today. They qua rried these stones from miles away and fitted them together so seamlessly that yo u can’t fit a blade between them. Also in Egypt tens of thousands of diorite bowls have been found with hieroglyphs engraved. Diorite is one of the hardest stones on the planet, harder than ir on, yet intricate inscriptions have been made, not through the use of chisels or scrapi ng but some unknown ancient technology. Whatever it was, was capable of etchin g lines 1/150 th of an inch wide, often in sets of parallel lines separated by a mere 1/30 th of an inch. The same kind of workmanship has been found in vases, urns, and othe r pottery unearthed at the Pyramid of Zoser. Graham Hancock says: “There was no technology known to have been available to the Ancient Egyptians capable of achieving such results. Nor, for that matter, would any stone3carver today be able t o match them, even if he were working with the best tungsten3carbide tools. The implication, therefore, is that an unknown or secret technology had been put to use in Ancient Egypt.” There are even"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"hieroglyphics in the Temple of Abydos that are clea rly of a helicopter and other advanced vehicles! How do we explain these with th e current paradigm? The Sphinx, which Egyptologists say is less than 5,000 years old, is actually at least 10,000 years old based on its weathering alone. Geologists confirm that it has been eroded by massive amounts of water which hasn’t been present in the Sahara for about 10,000 years. Egyptologists claim this weathering is just wind/sand erosion, but Geologists like Robert Schoch find that hard to swallow. “In October 1991, Dr Robert Schoch, a geologist at Boston University, presented detailed evidence that the Sphinx was thousands of years older than the commonly accepted date of 2500 BC.3’ His conclusion was base d on the weathering profile of the limestone rock, out of which the Sphinx had bee n carved. Visitors to the Sphinx today can clearly see the vertical weathering profi le in the limestone trench surrounding the Sphinx. This erosion, according to the science of geology, could only be the result of prolonged rainfall, in contrast to the dry weather experienced in Egypt since 2500 BC. Based on the climatic evidence , Schoch estimated that the Sphinx had to be between 9,000 and 12,000 years old , when the climate in Egypt was much wetter.” +Alan F.

The base length of the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacán is identical in length to the base of the Great Pyr amid at Giza. Where are those odds? Teotihuacán means “the place where men become Gods. ” They claim their pyramids and temples were instruments for transforming the s oul after death, exactly as the Egyptians did. This theme is all over the ancient world. Ancient Tibetans, the Egyptians and native Americans all had complex syst ems, multi+stage challenges for recently deceased souls to overcome in the afterlife. Specific stages of the different cultures afterlife journeys even match+up. The Mayans and the Egyptians both believed in stellar rebirth where Kings, Pharaohs, and Heroes die and are reborn as stars. “Archaeologists all over the world have realized that much of prehistory as written in the existing textbooks, is inadequate, some of it quite simply wrong...It has been suggested...that the changes now at work in prehistory herald the shift to a ‘new paradigm,’...made necessary by the collapse of the first paradigm.” +Colin Renfrew, “Before Civilization” The Noah flood myth from the bible was attributed to Zisudra and Atrahasis in Sumerian/Mesopotamian culture three thousand yea rs earlier. In Aztec mythology only Coxcoxtli and his wife Xochiquetzal were forew arned of the flood by God and survived by building a huge boat. They wandered fo r 104 years before landing in “Antlan.” The Mechoacanesecs of Central America sa y Tezpi built a large boat, loaded it with animals, grains, seeds, and escaped the flood with his wife and children.

T he same basic story is found in almost 600 cultures around the world. “From almost every culture around the world there emerge more than five hundred strikingly similar legends of a great Flood?

Is the flood just a story, a myth with metaphorical meaning, or a literal accoun t of global flooding? “Perhaps the greatest myth being purveyed is that m yths are just myths.” +Michael Tsarion In Japan the Yonaguni megalith is undoubtedly man+made yet it has been underwater since at least 8000 BC.

The word “Maya” means “Illusion” in b oth languages as well and refers to our material existence, which both cultur es believe to be illusory. They believe, as all ancient cultures believed, that we are immaterial souls having a physical experience. In Sanskrit, “Atl” means “to support or uphold” as Atlas was said to hold the world on his shoulders. Alonso de Molina’s 16 th century dictionary of the Nahuatl language, “Vocabulario En Lengua Mexicana y Castellana” says that \" The words Atlas and Atlantic have no satisfactory etymology in any lang uage known to Europe. They are not Greek, and cannot be referred to any known lang uage of the Old World. But in the Nahuatl language we find immediately the radical 'a ', 'atl', which signifies water, war, and the top of the head. ” Why the top of the head? The word “atl” is foun d in the names of most of their gods, and one of its meaning s is “top of the head.” “The tree sacred to Atlas; its branches, like his arms, supported the heavens. The oak’s association with Atlas implies a primeval tree cult or pillar cult, a memory of it surviving in Kritias, Plato’s Atlantis account, when he described a ceremonial column at the very midpoint of the Temple of Poseidon, itself located at the center of Atlantis. The Atlanteans’ oldest, most hallowed laws were inscribed on its exterior and sacrificial bull’s blood was shed over it by all 10 kings of Atlantis in that civilization’s premiere ritual.” +Frank Joseph, “The Atlantis Encyclopedia” (208) The pineal gland (6 th chakra, the third+eye) lies at the geometrical cen ter point of the brain. Plato’s account of Atlantis described a “ce remonial column at the very midpoint of the Temple of Poseidon, itself located at the center of Atlantis.” The ceremonial column (Oak Tree, Tree of Life, Staff of Moses etc.) is the human spine with 33 vertebrae. The actual medical term for the 33 rd vertebrae which holds up the skull is “Atlas,” same as the King of Atlantis. In Atlantean mythology, Atlas holds up the world or the heavens and in your body the Atlas vertebrae holds up your head/mind. In Atlantean mythology, Atlas has 7 dau ghters who spend all their time guarding and dancing around the Tree of Life; In yo ur body you have 7 energy centers (chakras) dancing around your spine.

Why would the center of a target be called a “bull’s+eye” anyway? The Atlas vertebra holds up your brain, your “third+eye” is at the center of your brain, and the center of Atlantis is a “bull’s+eye.” In fact, your skull, which Atlas holds up, is shaped just like Atlantis is described. At the center point is your third+eye. The third+eye is separated and surrounded completely by water/fluid. Next is the cerebral cortex, the meat of the brain. Then around that is a layer of constantly flowing/pumping blood. And lastly around that is t he skull. Plato said sacrificial bull’s blood was shed over the exterior of the Temp le of Poseidon, which is also consistent with the blood that flows over the exter ior of the brain. “Bulls were associated with divine regents in Sumer, Egypt, Assyria, Minoan Crete, Greece, Rome, Iberia, and Ireland. All of these cultures featured traditions of a great deluge from which their ancestors came with all the accoutrements of a high civilization, including, most importantly, matters of kingship. In each people, their king was ritually identified with a sacred bull, because it was important for a leader to identify with the tremendous strength and aggressiveness epitomized by such an animal. In pre3Celtic Ireland, the new monarch had to undergo a ceremonial bath of bull’s broth, which he then drank from an Atlantean3like golden cup. The Egyptian Hape, better remembered by his Greek name, Apis, was the sacred bull of Memphis. Like the bulls at t he Temple of Poseidon, he was allowed to roam free in a courtyard of the temple.” +Frank Joseph, “The Atlantis Encyclopedia” (78) If the Temple of Poseidon (between your “temples”) is your brain then Atlantis’ bull’s+eye is your third+eye/pineal gland which lit erally “roams free in the courtyard of the temple” because it is surrounded by water/fl uid.

Obatal a’s chief title is ‘King of Whiteness,’ because he is revered as the white3skin ned ‘Ancient Ruler’ and ‘Father’ of the Yoruba race by a native woman, Oduduwa.

Directly ac ross the Atlantic Ocean, in the west, the Aztec version of Atlantis – Aztlan 3 was referred to as the ‘White Island.’ In the opposite direction, in the east, Hindu traditions in India described ancestral origins from Attala, likewise known as the ‘White Island.’” +Frank Joseph, “The Atlantis Encyclopedia” (209) Is this where we get our legends of an Ivory Tower on an island? Was it a real tower on a real island or our ivory s pines on the islands of our bodies? Or was it both? “‘The White Island’ described in the great Indian e pic Mahabharata and in the epic poems, the Puranas, as the mountainous home land of a powerful and highly civilized race located in ‘the Western Sea’ on the other side of the world from India ... Atala itself sank in a violent storm.” +Frank Joseph, “The Atlantis Encyclopedia” (33) “The nations on the west of the Atlantic look to th e 'east' for their place of origin; while on the east of the Atlantic they look to the 'west': thus all the lines of tradition converge upon Atlantis. But here is the same testi mony that in the Garden of Eden there were four rivers radiating from one parent st ream. And these four rivers, as we have seen, we find in the Scandinavian traditions, and in the legends of the Chinese, the Tartars, the Singhalese, the Thibetians, the Buddhists, the Hebrews, and the Brahmans. And not only do we find this tradition of the Garden of Eden in the Old World, but it meets us also among the civilized races of America.

Kundalini is a Sanskrit word that can be translated as ‘coiled up.’ Kundalini is represented in many Tantrik illu strations as a sleeping serpent, coiled 3 ½ times, at the base o f the spinal cord. The popular view of Kundalini is that it is a dormant power that lies waiting to be unleashed, by means of various practices. The ‘s erpent power,’ once awakened, is coaxed up the central channel of the spine, enterin g the chakras (psychic energy centres) until it reac hes the Crown chakra 3 and the yogi achieves ‘illumination.’ ” +Phil Hine, “Kundalini, A Personal Approach” “The caduceus symbol of coiling snakes is thought t o be an ancient symbolic representation of Kundalini physiology. The concept of Kundalini comes from yogic philosophy of ancient India and refers to the mothering intelligence behind yogic awakening and spiritual maturation. It might be regarded by yogis as a sort of deity, hence the occasional capitalizatio n of the term. Within a western frame of understanding it is often associated with the practice of contemplative or religious practices th at might induce an altered state of consciousness, either brought about spontaneously, through a type of yoga, through psychedelic drugs, or through a near3death experien ce ...According to the yogic tradition Kundalini is curled up in the back part o f the root chakra in three and one3 half turns around the sacrum. Yogic phenomenology s tates that kundalini awakening is associated with the appearance of bio3energetic phenomena that are said to be experienced somatically by the yogi. This appearance is also referred to as ‘pranic awakening’. Prana is interpreted as the vital, life 3 sustaining force in the body. Uplifted or intensifi ed life3energy is called pranotthana and is supposed t o originate from an apparent reservoir of subtle bio3 energy at the base of the spine. This energy is als o interpreted as a vibrational phenomena that initiates a period, or a process of vibrational spiritual development ... Kundalini is mainly associated with Hinduism. However, Kundalini as a spiritual experience is thought to have parallels i n many of the mystical and Gnostic traditions of the world's great religions.

They knew, in their profound devotion and worship, that so perfect a Creator could only have created perfection in design, function and potential. Based on this respect, they sought knowledge of the totality of the human being. They researched the human ability to maintain good health, increase vitality, open consciousness and expand the experience of the excellence of human life. Their research gave them a great understanding of the nervous system, glandular system, organ system, energy system, and brain. They learned how blood, nerves, muscles, organds, and glands all work toget her. They investigated the seen and the unseen, and the inter3relationships between the physical and the subtle. From this research they developed Kundalini Yoga. Kunda lini Yoga is a highly evolved technology based on a through understanding of the ecology of the human body, how the breath affects the thinking, how the angle of a finger affects the pituitary gland. This technology works with the systems of the human body using the body’s own means. Hand position, breath, posture, sound, and motion are employed in various ways to create the optimum balance among all the body’s components ... until recent times these techniques had been secret, taught only to a chosen few.” +Harijot Kaur Khalsa, “Kundalini Yoga, Physical Wisdom” “Contemporary spiritual literature often notes that the chakras, as described in the esoteric kundalini documents, bear a strong similarity in location and number to the major endocrine glands, as well as nerve bundles called ganglions. One speculation is that the traditional practices have formalized a method for stimulating the endocrine glands to work in a d ifferent mode which has a more direct effect on consciousness, perhaps ultimately by stimulating the release of DMT by the pineal gland, which may be analogous to the 'pineal chakra'.

The body then becomes an effective antenna for the 7.5 Hz frequen cy, which is one of the resonant frequencies of the ionosphere. In layman's terms, y ou then pick up information from the air. This might account for repeated descripti ons of heightened senses as a result of rising Kundalini, e.g. as described by Yogananda : ‘The whole vicinity lay bare before me.

The number of astronauts known to be Masons is astonishing: Buzz Aldrin Jr. (Apollo 11), Gordon Cooper Jr., (Mercury 9, Gemini 5), Donn Eisele (Apollo 7), John Glenn Jr., (Mercury 6), Virgil Grissom (Apollo 1&15, Mercury 5, Gemini 3), James Irwin (Apollo 15), Edgar Mitchell (Apollo 14), Walter Schirra Jr. (Apollo 7, Sigma 7, Gemini 6, Mercury 8), Thomas Stafford (Apollo 10&18, Gemini 7&9), and Paul Weitz (Skylab 2, Challenger). This list is by no means comprehensive and there are likely scores upon scores of Masons within the ranks of NASA. Werner Von Braun, the first director of NASA was one of many top Nazi rocket+sc ientists the CIA brought to America during Operation Paperclip. So to begin wi th, NASA is full of Masons and Nazis + not the most historically honest folks. There is an area of very high radiation called the Van Allen Belt 272 miles from Earth which the Russians could never pass. In fact in 1959 Bill Kaysing reported on a Russian study which discovered that the amount of radiation on the moon would require astronauts to be clothed in 4 feet of lead in order to avoid instant death. John Mauldin, a NASA physicist, said they would need at least two meters of thick shielding. How did the NASA astronauts account for the Van Allen Belt and Moon’s radiation?

They claimed to be scoping out remote locations for top+secret training facilities, but skeptics sa y they went to collect “Moon” rocks. Bill Kaysing (author of “We Never Went to the Moon: America’s Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle”) hired his private investigator fri end Paul Jacobs to check with the head of the US Department of Geology in Washington and ask, “ did you examine the Moon rocks, and did they come from the Moon? ” The geologist simply laughed and insinuated that people high in the US government kn ew all about the cover+up.

It is interesting that we would travel all the way to the Moon and not take any color video either.

NASA claims to have conveniently lost all the original Apollo 11 high+q uality video and data telemetry tapes so experts cannot examine their authenticity. Blueprints and designs of certain machines are missing as well such as the Apollo Lun ar Module and rover. Award+winning British photographer David Persey is convinced the Moon pictures are fake. In his book he shows anomalies in light/ shadows which can only be accounted for with multiple light sources. The onl y source of light on the Moon should be the Sun but pictures show some shadows lo nger than others, shadows cast in different directions in the same picture, and certain undeniably spot lit areas. For instance he points out that the American flag and the words “United States” on the craft are always brightly lit even when all else is in shadow. There are a couple pictures where extension cords are clearly seen stretching across “the Moon’s” surface as well.

In 1947 the Area 51/Roswell UFO allegedly landed at 33.33 degrees north latitude (the Masonic number) and 104 degrees longitude. Interestingly, 104 is 33.33 multiplied by Pi (3.14159), and 33.33 degrees latitude is exactly 2012 miles. Thus 2012 has been numerically encoded into the alien hoax since the b eginning. Also in 1947 the US government created the CIA and the NSA. As Jordan Maxwell has pointed out, the terms NSA and NASA come from NASI or NAZI, the Germ an secret society creation whose UFO+experimenting rocket scientists were impo rted via the OSS/CIA. Also in 1947 was the Rothschild’s Balfour Declaration and a ll the AzkeNAZI Jews entering Israel. This is the same Israel that has seen much UFO activity, and is in the Bible where we see the AnnuNAKI. AnnuNAKI, AzkeNAZI, NAZI, NASI, NASA, NSA, what does it all mean? Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the Illuminati wrote , “ Of all the means I know to lead men, the most effec tual is a concealed mystery.

In 1947, 33 rd degree Mason and President Harry S. Truman formed Majestic+ 12 or MJ+12, a secret committee of scientists and g overnment officials assigned to investigate Roswell, UFOs, and aliens. One of the biggest organizations providing a voice for supposed whistle+blowers like “Mr. X” is Project Camelot ( www.projectcamelot.org ).

So there is MJ+12, the 12 Knights of the Round Table, and another Project Camelot “insider” is Clifford “Stone.” Stone as in Masonry, or Arthur’s Sword in the Stone perhaps? A llegedly these MJ+12 Camelot insiders discovered StarGate “Looking Glass” techno logy from the aliens. Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass plays righ t into this theme. Jim “Marrs” talks about Mars/Moon anomalies, UFOs, aliens, rept iles, and ancient astronauts (Marrs also worked with Oliver “Stone” on the JFK f ilm). Michael St. Clair of the St. Clair/Sinclair Illuminati bloodline and John Lear o f the Lear Jet (military+industrial) family are also interviewed by Project Camelot abou t aliens, and so is Richard Hoagland. Richard Hoagland uses the Masonic “Enterprise” as his project’s name, at www.enterprisemission.com Hoagland, a regular Coast 2 Coast AM guest and UN speaker, who allegedly has insider friends at NASA talks about pyramids, faces, and other anomalies on Mars that he claims NASA is covering up. He is also following the suspicious Hexagon formation on Satur n and the disappearance of the bees. Is he really exposing things going on within NASA or is that just the “good guy” image necessary for the public’s further indoc trination? Could Richard Hoagland be working for NASA, or at least for the M asons, and providing the antithesis to NASA’s thesis in the Hegelian Dialect ic? NASA provides the official line, denies there being aliens or anomalies on Mar s or the Moon. Then Richard Hoagland and other “insiders” present all this info rmation about UFOs and anomalies in Moon/Mars pictures postulating aliens as though that is what NASA is covering up. But to begin with, NASA is covering up the Moon lan ding, which Hoagland and many others never dispute. Thus Hoagland becomes a false antithesis to NASA’s thesis, and the synthesis is hoped to be the eventu al world+wide belief in aliens. “Dr. Steven Greer is the director of the Disclosure Project, a non3profit research project working to fully disclose the facts about U FOs, extraterrestrial intelligence, and classified advanced energy and propulsion syste ms. In a June 2002 article he warned of how a phony UFO invasion would be present ed to the public so they would willingly sacrifice their liberty and rally round t he government in opposition to the nefarious ET's. Greer describes the ultimate trump card – a hoaxed threat from space, Since 1992 I have seen this script unveiled to me by at least a dozen well3 placed insiders. Of course, initially I laughed, th inking this just too absurd and far3 fetched. Dr. Rosin gave her testimony to the Disclo sure Project before 9/11. And yet others told me explicitly that things that looked l ike UFOs but that are built and under the control of deeply secretive 'black' projects, w ere being used to simulate 3 hoax 3 ET3appearing events, including some abductions and cattle mutilations, to sow the early seeds of cultural fear regarding life in oute r space. Like the movie Independence Day, an attempt to unite the world through militari sm would unfold using ET as the new cosmic scapegoat (think Jews during the Third R eich). Do not be deceived. By commingling fact with fiction, and by hoaxing UFO e vents that can look terrifying, the Plan is to eventually create a new, sustainable , off3planet enemy. And who will be the wiser?” +Paul Joseph Watson, “Order Out of Chaos” (167) "},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"David Icke, Michael Tsarion, Jim Marrs, Zecharia Si tchin and other researcher’s current positions lean toward the idea that the wor ld’s royal bloodlines and/or all humans are descended from alien progenitors. I hig hly respect the work of Icke, Tsarion, and Marrs, but disagree with their belief in Reptilian extra+terrestrial progenitors. Many cultures all over the world have the same mythologies and creation stories that involve the heavens, stars, a ngels, demons, serpents, snakes, or dragons. African Kings claimed descent from the Ch ituhuri serpent people. Chinese Kings claimed descent from ancient dragon gods that came from the sky. The Sumerian Kings claimed descent from the Annunaki, “those who from Heaven to Earth came.” Annunaki, are called many things in the Bible: Anak, Anakim, Sons of Anak, and Nephilim are some of the more common. These are the Fallen Angels among whom Sat an is leader. But are they literal physical alien beings from outer+space? Th e Sumerian symbol for Planet X (Nibiru), which many say will come back in 2012, is the same symbol found over most Masonic temples and meeting halls. The symbol is the top of the caduceus, a winged+orb, sometimes drawn with the two serpents. This has already been explained as a spiritual symbol for crown chakra illumination , and not a physical planet. “Carl Sagan described the three tiers of the human brain as the reptilian (the most ancient and deepest layer), the limbic (the middle tier that directs motor sensory and normal life functions), and the neocortex (the unch arted territory of the upper realms). He also used the symbolic dragon to portra y the dormant, sleeping, reptilian part of the brain that is both ancient and undistur bed. When the sleeping dragon rises, his fire (kundalini) surges throughout the v arious layers and in alchemical measures awakens and integrates the triune brain.\" +Ray Flower, “The Union and Reunion of Opposites” Recent books like Dan Brown’s best+seller “Da Vinci Code” have promoted the idea that Jesus was a real person whose bloodline is being preserved to this day. It’s true that the elite obsessively inbreed to preserve their DNA, but it is not the DNA of Jesus. The Bible claims that the Son of Man will come back and sit on his throne in Israel. Matthew 19:28 reads, “Jesus said to them, ‘Truly, I say to you, in the new world, when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.’” It is impossible to “sit on twelve thrones” so this , like most everything in the Bible, must be metaphorical. The idea of sitting on twelv e thrones and ruling twelve tribes is something that can and does happen within our ow n consciousness when we become aware of the true twelve “gods.” As was und erstood all over the ancient"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"world, the 12 gods of Atlantis/Olympus are facets o f our own consciousness. Everyone carries the messages and personalities of all 12 signs of the zodiac. Different people exemplify (worship) different gods /signs, but He who is King, the 13 th , he who controls the 12 around 1, is something to strive for. To balance the characteristics of the 12 gods, we must keep our pe rspective as the 13 th objective observer. This is what is meant by sitting on twel ve thrones and judging the twelve tribes of Israel. This is not, however, a perspective shared by many of the world’s indoctrinated priests/pastors and their parishioners who are all waiting for a messiah to come and save the world. The idea of a messiah coming durin g end times is shared by Jews, Christians, and Muslims alike, thus this is the per fect paradigm through which to present the bloodlines’ first King of the New World Order. According to the elite, as the first messiah came t o establish the Kingdom of Heaven, the second illuminated messiah will establish a New World under his rule. Concerning this messiah, 33 rd degree Mason Manly P. Hall, in “The Secret Destiny of America” wrote that, \"The outcome of the 'secret destiny' is a World Ord er ruled by a King with supernatural powers. This King was descen ded of a divine race; that is, he belonged to the Order of the Illumined for those wh o come to a state of wisdom then belong to a family of heroes3perfected human beings \" (26). Someone of royal lineage like Prince William could be paraded around by the mass media and shown performing miracles + amazing feats and philanthropic gestures perhaps. UFO sightings increase, the news graduall y begins regularly reporting on aliens, UFOs, Area 51, Reptilians etc. until 2012 t hey stage a mass UFO wave over major world cities. Just like Independence Day the movie, they could claim that world government under the UN is the only way to ex terminate the alien threat. Along the Bible/Da Vinci Code line, they could clai m that Prince William is the descendent of Jesus, or they could give us some oth er messiah. Or they could use “Project Bluebeam” and give us different holographi c messiahs simultaneously in different parts of the world: “One of their key plans is called Project Bluebeam. One element of this is to use laser3generating satellites in the ‘Star Wars’ netw ork in different parts of the world to project holographic images in the sky of UFOs, Jesu s, Mohammed, Buddha, Khrishna, etc. With each belief system convinced th at their savior has come, the potential for enormous religious conflict is obviou s. Messages will be broadcast (as they already are) on the Extremely Low Frequency (E LF), Very Low Frequency (VLF), Low Frequency (LF) and microwave bands which can be picked up by the human brain. This technology is highly sophisticate d today and many people will believe that ‘God’ and their ‘savior’ is talking to them when it is really the Brotherhood manipulators.

Something not3quite3physical. Almost as if the whole thing is going on inside the observer’s head ... UFOs perform amazing, physics3 defying maneuvers, making right angle turns or 180 switchbacks, materializing and dematerializing, cha nging colors and shape, merging and splitting. One possible explanation of how they do these is that they don’t do them at all ... I’m not saying all UFO appearances are mer ely mental illusions, projections of some sort, but I believe many are. And I believe all of them have some psychological/illusory component. Some UFOs are cap tured on film, video, or radar. Some are witnessed by hundreds of people at once. A nd some leave fairly convincing physical evidence of their presence. So there may b e some physical manifestation aspect to in these things, too.

Among the similarities are recurrent image3constants, a basically consistent sequence of events, and the unusual ‘peak experience’ quality common to all. Also, very bizarre incidents in abduction reports have parallels in these phenomena. For example, the embarrassingly incredible ‘bodily dismemberment’ sometimes reported by abductees is a regular feature of shaman's ‘death3rebirth’ trances.” +Alvin H.

In Islam such creatures are called “Jinns.” Shamans regularly visit the spirit world through dr ugs and trances where they receive incredible information about medicine, the future, dangers, opportunities, etc. This information is relayed to them by actual entities, spiritual entities, many of which appear just like the “greys” or “reptilian” aliens. Again, the authenticity of this “spirit world” is one that can only be believed/verified th rough experience. Most people who have never taken an entheogen vehemently deny t he validity of this, while those who have already know and agree. “Demonology is not just another crackpot3 ology. It is the ancient and scholarly study of the monsters and demons who have seemingly coexisted with man throughout history. Thousands of books have been written on the subject, many of them authored by educated clergymen, scientists and scholars, and uncounted numbers of well3documented demonic events are readily available to every researcher. The manifestations and occurrences described in this imposing literature are similar, if not entirely identical, to the UFO phenomenon itself. Victims of demonomania (possession) suffer the very same medical and emotional symptoms as the UFO contactees ... The devil and his demons can, according to the literature, manifest themselves in almost any form and can physically imitate anything from angels to horrifying monsters with glowing eyes. Strange objects and entities materialize and dematerialize in these stories, jus t as the UFOs and their splendid occupants appear and disappear, walk through walls, and perform other supernatural feats.” +John Keel, “UFOs: Operation Trojan Horse” (192) “The 'medical examination' to which abductees are s aid to be subjected, often accompanied by sadistic sexual manipulation, is rem iniscent of the medieval tales of encounters with demons.

Abductees often feel psychologically manipulated an d abused. Another fishy aspect of abductions is the appearance of the inside of UFOs. They always appear different in size or shape from what could be possible, given th e size of the UFO as seen from the outside. Just another evidence of the surreal, drea mlike quality of sightings. I also like how the inside of these craft always appear in what ever form would seem high3tech to the abductee. The visitor to a UFO in the 1950s saw banks upon banks of magnetic tape drives. Modern abductees see flatscreens, proj ected 3D images, and lasers. Isn’t it amazing that aliens from all quadrants of the un iverse are advancing in their technology at exactly the same rate as Earthlings? ... It’s almost as if these creatures can tap into that part of the brain that stores the bugaboo costumes and don the garb themselves.

With the help and funding of the Rockefellers/Masons, the field of “d emonology” has slowly transitioned to “UFOlogy.” Medieval demons, imps, and goblins have become modern Nordics, greys, and reptilians. “The endless messages from the space people would n ow fill a library, and while the communicators claim to represent some other world, the contents of those messages are identical to the messages long received by medi ums and mystics.” +John Keel, “UFOs: Operation Trojan Horse” (183) “Thousands of mediums, psychics and UFO contactees have been receiving mountains of messages from 'Ashtar' in recent years . Mr. Ashtar represents himself as a leader in the great intergalactic councils which hold regular meetings on Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, and many planets unknown to us. But Ashtar is not a new arrival. Variations of this name, such as Ashtaroth, Ashar, Asharoth, etc., appear in demonological literature throughout history, both i n the Orient and the Occident.

This is the responsibility of The People.

(see www.whatistheendgame.com ) Therefore, a new model of an open People's government utilizing the internet to pu t the power of government back in the People's hands, should, and must be quickly instituted . Tyranny has already taken over our land to a large extent. If the People do not unite in a critically good cause as thi s in this year of 2008, the establishment monopolists and their political puppets may actually achieve their goal of turning the entire world into a 1984ish planetary prison, a global gulag.

Many of us who are against such forced tagging can already clearly see this rapidly developing reali ty. The idea of senators and representatives sent to \"far - off\" Washi ngton DC is outmoded by the internet. There is simply no need for them, when The People have access to the internet and can easily, immediately, efficiently, and periodically vote their will, even daily, on various issues across the spectrum of politics - and publish the results for the whole world to see . Today, all politicians serve only as a barrier to and filter of the true will of the people. Today The People have no power. 100% ZERO power.

This would help reinvigorate the already sagging economy as well. 3) The power of the \"Presid ent\" should be absolutely limited to the will of the People, as democratically and openly accounted for daily through the internet. All former executive orders should be abolished. The only laws tha t would remain intact and in effect is that which is out lined in the original Bill of Rights of 1776. Citizen courts should replace federal courts . Everyone would be quickly protected and be housed and fed and given new opportunities in the refreshed Republic.

The simple will of the People regarding all issues from every individual and each sovereign s tate will be represented and heeded.

There will be simply an end to any form of government fraud, usurpations of power, and abuse upon The People. 5) To catalyze and ensure regime change, and win the support of police and mili tary nationwide, as would be necessary to effect a peaceful revolution: each officer/soldier that would work for the side of goodness, for the benefit of the pe ople's revolution, would receive a voted/approved bonus and/or retirement fund. The criminally - bent ones that would remain in support of the corrupt establishment would ultimately lose their jobs and any benefi ts, as th ey did not uphold their oath to the Constitution & Bill of Rights and act in protection of the people. T.E.A. was envisioned and f irst written about in 2005 in the book The Freemasonic Architecture of History. In 2008, TEA, is again commissioned by US born citizen (May 27th, 1971), Eric James Rainbolt, 36 years old, veteran quality assurance software engineer, SSN: 342 - 58 - 7302, virt uous patriotic intellectual, Ron Paul Supporter, admirer of Thomas Jefferson, & is now independently running for th e 1st \"President\" of a reformed and revitalized republic. There is no other campaigning planned except for this commissioning statement. I am a peaceful and humble man, who is currently too concerned to come out of his home to further promote this message. My email is ericjamesrainboltchicago@gmail.com My contact number is 708 - 415 - 5413 and website is www.massivesecret.com and www.linkto - it.com . Link To It! dot com will be used as the first entry point for democratic governmental reform. Nothing like this is possible without the support of The People. This i s not a quest for power, it is a virtuous quest for world sanity and peace . The President of TEA reform will only mirror the power of The People as simply described in the paragraphs above . The choice of Vice - President will be most likely Dr. Ron Paul, o r Alex Jones, of infowars.com, www.gcnlive.com patriotic reporter/broadcaster, or Willie Nelson who recently came out and stated we need to \" Throw all the bastards out! \" or Governor Jess Ventura who also tells the trut h that 911 was an inside job. If I am character assassinated, framed/arrested, disappeared, or shot, the idea of TEA should carry on, thro ugh these people or persons who have done likewise for many years past. The Constitution demands only that our next president must have been born a citizen, must be at least 35 years old, and must have resided in the United S tates for 14 or more years . Nowhere in the Constitutio n does it say that one has be Senator or Representative prior to being President. We have to break this illusionary idea that America is to be run like a corporation, and the next pay raise up is from Congressman to Presiden t. The only other requirement - often overlooked and although it is not stated in our country's founding document, is that s/he must be intelligent , respectful, and trustworthy. It would help if s/he was from the middle - class. In summary, the current establishment agenda is to bankrupt and destroy the American middle class, ultimately then to feed them at random and in mass into concentration camps and mass graves , much like what was done in WW II Germany . If you support Hillary (Hitlery) or Obama (another establishment puppet stooge) or McCain (manchurian war regime candidate puppet #3), then you would simply support destroying yours, your children's, & other people's futures. It is that simple and it is that dramatic. America needs to return to constitutional protections of each citizen . The Republic has already been massively sabotaged from the inside out. There is no chanc e of fixing this in 2012. I, the founder of TEA, Eric James Rainbolt, 36, true blooded freedom intellectual, have no skulls & bones in my closet. I once was traveling in 2003 with a friend who had 1/4 ounce of marijuana out of the United States into Mex i co and spent 2 nights in a Mexican jail. They also stole my car. That is it. How truly unforgivable is that? Now I am here risking my life, just to help my country(wo)men have a chance of surviving into the fu ture, by simply pointing out that today's m odel of government is antiquated and highly corrupted and that a People's government today needs to be remodeled utilizing the democratic capability that the internet provides . I am only in support of the Will of The People, if these ideas are not accepte d by The People, I will only remain the humble quality assurance engineer that I am. If you like these ideas and ideal s, then quickly share/circulate this TEA statement with everyone else you know or can reach out to."},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":" The following are quotes from one m an, just one man, Albert Einstein : \" The strength of the Constitution lies entirely in the determination of each citizen to defend it.

Have you ever wondered why, if both the Democrats and the R epublicans are against deficits, we have deficits? Have you ever wondered why, if all the politicians are against inflation and high taxes, we have inflation and high taxes. You and I don't propose a federal budget. The President does. You and I don't have the Constitutional authority to vote on appropriations. The House of Representatives does. You and I don't write the tax code. Congress does. You and I don't set fiscal policy. Congres s does. You and I don't control monetary policy. The Federal Rese rve Bank does. One hundred senators, 435 congressmen, one President and nine Supreme Court justices - 545 human beings out of the 300 million - are directly, legally, morally and individually responsible for the domestic problems that plague this country. I excluded the members of the Federal Reserve Board because that problem was created by the Congress. In 1913, Congress delegated its Constitutional duty to provide a sound currency to a federally chartered but private central bank. I excluded all the special interests and lobbyists for a sound reason. They have no legal authority. They have no ability to coerce a senator, a congressman or a president to do one cotton - picking thing. I don't care if they offer a politician $1 million dollars in cash. The politician has the power to accept or reject it. No matter what the lobbyist promises, it is the legislator's responsibility to determine how he vote s. Those 545 human beings spend much of their energy convincing you that what they did is not their fa ult. They cooperate in this common con regardless of party. What separates a politician from a normal hum an being is an excessive amount of gall. Replace the Scoundrels. It seems inconceivable that a nation of 300 million cannot replace 545 people who stand convicted -- by present facts - of incompetence and irresponsibility. I can't think of a single domestic problem, from an unfair tax code to defense overruns, that is not traceable directly to those 545 people. When you fu lly grasp the plain truth t hat 545 people exercise power of the Federal Government, then it must follow that what exists is what they want to exist. If the tax code is unfair, it's because they want it unfair. If the budget is in the red, it's becau se they want it in the red. There are no insoluble government problems. Do not let these 545 people shift the blame to bureaucrats, whom they hire and whose jobs they can abolish; to lobbyists, whose gifts and advice th ey can reject; to regulators, to whom they give the power to regulate and from whom they can take this power. Above all, do not let them con you into the belief that there exist disembodied mystical forces like \"the economy,\" \"inflation\" or \"politics\" that prevent them from doing what they take an oath to do. Tho se 545 people, and they alone, are responsible. They, and they alone, have the power. They, and they alon e, should be held accountable by the people who are their bosses - provided the voters have the gumption to manage their own employees. We should vote al l of them out of office and clean up their mess."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"Comprehensive definition of: \" Cryptocracy\" (The global elite society that just 9 - 11'd the world again. ) Every individual American has been left to only speculate about what their government is doing. M ost people are accused of being too mindlessly trustful of the government; as most people certainly are day to day. The small minority of frustrated citizens attempting to \"wake up\" others are accused back by the majority of less informed/caring cit izens a s being paranoid conspiracy \"theorists\", and a concensus in the populations is never achieved on any issue, such as JFK or 9 - 11. Today's \"leaders\" are in - the - know and are all accomplices in the many ongoing coverups. The sad truth is that any one citizen, with rare exception, has had complete access to the overwhelming array of true facts regarding each particular unsolved crime in history. Where some information has been missing, logic can certainly be used to join the dots. H owever, the only group who fu lly knows what has gone on and how it was all carried out is the control group, the existing establi shment high crime network, or global elite monarchy, the \"hidden hand\", or cryptocracy . Although the Central Intelligence Agency has long been the convenie nt symbol for those who have often committed atrocities under the guise of \"national security\", the secret bureaucracy, the cryptocracy, does not consist solely of the CIA (or FBI/NSA/HSA/CDC/ETC). The globa l cryptocracy is a secretive yet vast network of alliances between individuals involved with a number of various national government agencies, in international banking, in positions of power within the global corporate mass media, and academia ; normally thought to be outside the intelligence field. A cr yptocracy is such a massive secretive organization; which has been (and of Dec 2007 still is) the hi dden force behind most major political events. It is termed a cryptocracy because its indoctrinated members strive to hide the truth of events in \"history\" from the general population; as it profits them more to do so. Events have been/are masterminded beh ind the scenes, prior to an event, such as 9 - 11, occurring, and are designed to play upon the subconscious and internal archetypes of the minds o f the citiz enry at large. ( the truth of events of each major event is typically spun around in the mainstream media, blame is placed on a patsy (al - CIA - da) or \"villian\" (\"Osama\") or the competition/propagandized enemy (Iraq/Iran/Chavez), so reality of \"what\" really happened and \"who\" really caused it becomes cryptic, blurred and/or or indiscernible/imperceptible t o the bamboozled citizenry. The result may be the entire countryside is fooled into a military coup of their nation ( JFK) or another horrible pre - planned wa r (9 - 11). ) Since the cryptocracy creates or leads the people into a \"consensus reality\" and then like a magician plucks things out of the air in order to create uncertainty and double - mindedness in the populations, things appear to people who search out t he truth as being totally out of whack. And things are totally out of whack. When someone comes acro ss facts which are at odds with the \"consensus reality\" { such as Building 7 turning into dust at freefall sp eed at 5:02pm on 9 - 11 ( see: www.WTC7.net ) } t hey must either ignore the facts (either consciously or unconsciously) or suffer ridicule, contempt, violence & legislation from those trapped within the \"consensus reality\" created by the cryptocrats. The predominant psychopathy of the cryptocracy is in fostering and maintaining the group - think conclusion that the global population will wind - up so disoriented (and choking other's throats) by the repeated historical distortions that the citi zenry of all nations shall fall as easy prey to become cattle for the elite controllers of the cryptocracy { who inevitably shall attempt to reveal themselves through the mass media in the future as some kind of savior - class prepared to end the madness, chaos, mass murder, & confusion they themselves and their ancestors infested & promoted upon the world over several generations. } It is because the public at large has never before been confronted with an enemy so profound, sophis ticated, omnipresent yet elusive as today's secretive and interlocked \"new world order\" crim inal monarchal hierarchy, where the core administrative, or 'executive', source remains hidden behind the scenes/media and the responsibility of its corrupt and murderous agenda and grandiose deceptions is shared so widespread, with no benevolent governmen t remaining to call upon for protection from it; the discombobulated droves, \"democrat\" or \"republican\", of individually innocent citizens feel helpl ess in its buildup and the cryptocracy's intermittent and haphazard path/course of reckless abandon of all ethics/morals and the resulting wanton destruction it perpetually causes at an ever accelerated pace. Since the cryptocracy violates every constitutional principle as a matter of course, breaks every on e of God's 10 commandments, and commits every crime k nown to man in the interest of \"national security,\" it cannot entirely rely on the patriotism of its agents to keep its secrets. Therefore, no single individual is told more than he h as a \"need to know\", they partake in playing accomplice by taking 'orders ' from their higher - ups. The existing global monarchy of cryptocrats is a brotherhood, and to a lesser degree \"sisterhood\", r eminiscent of the ancient secret societies, with rites of initiation and indoctrination programs to develop its loyal membersh ip a nd \"understanding\" of its hypnotizing \"mysteries\". Freemasonry is the global institution used as the principle physical house/ temple for this misconduct. High degree freemasonry has codes & oaths of silence (of immorality & dogmas) which reinforce the se ns e of elitism necessary for the maintenance of its strict loyalty. It is automated, organized in the mode of a com puter, where all its minions have access to general knowledge and the most obvious aims and goals (a tyrannical world government composed of cr ypto - plutocrats), but where each actor/conspirator is isolated by tribal rituals, compromisation, and com partmentalization, threats, bribery, and any \"honor\", if any, that a band of tyrants, mass murderers, crooks, thieves, and liars would like to believe they share amongst themselves. (Analogously, the proprietary global \"computer\" system obviously needs to be shut down/unplugged and re - installed with a software \"upgrade\" to a new \"open source\" operating system.)

We all agree something big has to change fast or we'll pass a point of no return. A couple comments, though. At one point you refer to the Bill of Rights of 1776, but it was written in 89 and came into effect in 91. No big deal, but bein g super accurate helps out any good document. Also, in my own personal experience it is important to not simply promote democracy but the democratic republic philosophy, which is our governmental system. If we just had popular vote on everything, things wo uldn't go so well. Just look around. The average Joe doesn't know what's what. Lots of our youth can't find America on a map. Tha t's why it's so important to elect officials who are knowledgeable and stand up for what we believe. And finally, I totally agr ee that the need for such a huge centralized government isn't necessary. In fact, it isn't what the fou nders intended at all. Ideally most things could be put back into the hands of state governments and the smaller role of a central government could be re established without massive national departments & thousands of lobbyists. That's my input for today! Keep up the good fight. Say no to the Real ID! I have to agree with what you say makes a great deal of good sense. Now I believe the modern ideas p resent ed in TEA should be retrofitted for all 50 states. The internet should be used to put the power of governm ent back in The People's hands. The 50 newly appointed governors, who's authority would be limited to The People's w ill of each respective state, woul d then convene as a national council regarding issues of the direction of the entire nation. This will also then only be authorized with a national vote, to reaffirm The People's will. Again th ere would be no need for state representatives and senators; th eir jobs would be abolished. States rights must be upheld. We should return to the model of individual state sovereignty. Sean: What makes this current government is not just the people who run it but the laws that have am ended our Constitution, the bills that have been passed by Congress, and the reforms that have been made to the Executive branch. Take all of these away, and start all over with an un - amended constitution, and we have ugly things like the slavery of Africans again. Also read about Andrew Jackson, if you have a chance, and you will see that even that far back, the bankers were in charge of our country. I think that Ron Paul's constitutionalism is ho peful because it can draw radical conservatives and reactionary liberals together for the fun damental change that is needed in this country, but as the TEA declaration makes clear - the internet could make the republic form of govt. less needed. Our forefathers planned this govt. as a republic, not a mob rule, and they created the electoral col leg e, so the idea of everyone voting online would be complete democracy, and against their opinions on government. In the long run, I don't know if it would be best to look to the past for a constitution or at what we don't like abo ut the present. Also, I won der if it is a good idea to elevate a programmer/technician class, as opposed to making that knowled ge as ubiquitous as writing. We don't want to end up with a situation of corrupted programmers - we only work with quantitative values and could be more des tructive to humanity than congressmen, if we became corrupted by greed or a selfish ideology. Sean, Under the Bill of Rights nobody would be a slave except those in jail, but also everyone in ja il would receive a review. The public could give many of the 3 million prisoners a second chance in a reformed republic, or at least jobs on plantations growing massive amounts of Hemp or some other voted upon public service! Yes, th e Internet outmodes any continued need for today's Senators & Representatives. There would be no dictatorship as the public could vote out and replace anyone within 48 hours anytime (50% of registered voters). As for all those assorted Executive level laws you mention, I sense the current administration isn't currently any mo re aware of t hem than The People. Each one, all, would have to be reviewed and voted back in by The People, on an individual law by law basis, while the new capital is being rebuilt. You may elevate yourself to President. I d on't really care who is the President of TEA as long as they are trustworthy and I get my freedom and former constitutional republic back. It seems you read the statement but only about 30% of it absorbed. Try a re - read: LinkTo - It.com/TEA2008 & with th at cup of tea try some LinkTo - It.com/hempfood too. It's all good for you! Just re - read the ingredient labels over and over. There is no force, TEA is the only platform, set of ideas, where the citizens receive 100% power back into their, The People's, hand s. The People's debate is refreshing however! Let the great debate continue. Cheers! This PDF is available at www.MassiveSecret.com & www.LinkToIt.com/TEA2008 ) "},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":" P.S. From Justin: Justin: Also, the bill of rights aren't typical laws but the restriction of laws, really. They are a list of inalienable God - endowed rights of humanity. So they are laws in a way, but laws of restriction and guidelines. Keeping only these laws you then have a list of restrictions but no affirmative actionable laws i n the land. For example it gives you the right to trial by jury and no cruel or unusual punishment or excessive bail. It doesn't outline for what offenses these apply. Also, the Bill of Rights are an addendum. They add onto the Constitution as a whole, so perhaps referring to the Constitution (which therefore includes the Bill of Rights) may be more apt. Also, don't forget the 9th amendment that states the Bill of Rights in no way lists all rights, and more can certainly be defined over time (hence the furt her amendments). Sorry for the lengthy thought. I really like the constitution. Secondly, the job description of the president seems a little too restricted. I am very much for a limited presidency, but what role does the president have other than reading the online voting of people? This sounds very much like a democracy, not a democratic republic. It is my philosophy that a pure democracy is a recipe for disaster (mob lynchings an example of large groups ruling on emotion alone). A limited office represe ntative elected based on his stances to represent the people is important. They can therefore devote their career to understanding current events, politics, the will of the people, etc in a way that every citizen cannot be expected to do. Also, th e preside nt is the head of the Executive branch. He is the highest executor of law and is in charge of ensuring that laws are followed. This aligns with your president adhering to the will of the people, so long as that aligns with law. (Oh, and so long as you are running for office it is important to remember the President is commander and chief of the armed forces. Knowing about the military is a strong asset in case one is called to action in an emergency which unfortunately happens.) And lastly, a pure online v oting system, I am afraid to say, will never be a safe environment. There has yet to be a computer or system of significance that hasn't been hacked. Those that haven't are new and it will be a matter of time. Now imagine corrupt interests devoting vast re sources secretly to undermine the system. It is terrible, but incredibly likely. I don't want to come off like a negative nelly. I just have some strong political stances that I don 't mind sharing. I think your continuous revision is a testament to your p assion. The article by the Texas history professor is interesting. May I ask who that is? The outline of TEA at the end seems to be a major part of your message. Maybe it should be listed sooner to grab the reader? - Justin Justin, Would you agree that the power of government should be placed as much into the hands of the American people as they are willing to accept.

Alternative information exists despite their dedicated efforts to control information through compulsory education and the \"free \" press. And because history is prologue, one may acquire an accurate perception of the events and political schemes of the current power base. Yet, due to disinformatio n, deception, and calculating rhetoric, ethical moral people frequently underestimate , justify or even dismiss the suspicious and deviant behavior of their political leaders. Notwithstanding the election charade, presidential candidates, with negligible exceptions, are self - serving, power - hungry, parasitical people who are recruited, co ached, and installed based on their compliance to the bankster's profit - producing agenda. \"Their\" candidate receives the media spotlight and seemingly — everything just falls into place despite questionable qualifications!

I won't belabor the point; you can see where I am going with this — follow the money and discover the culprits. Without the profit motive, the U.S. and other countries might actually have ethical repr esentative governments who benefit the citizens rather than the multinational scoundrels ensconced in their bank buildings, laboratories, corporations and foundatio ns — protected by a multitude of laws they have effectively maneuvered through the U.S. Cong ress by corporate - sponsored politicians who comply with well - compensated former politicians, now lobbyists, who collect hefty, self - appointed congressional pensions. It shouldn't take a rocket scientist to discern that there is something dra stically wrong ! As you read the following historical accounts, make some contemporary comparisons. Same banking cabal, same lies, methods, & circumstances -- just a different set of political puppets. The proper function of government is to protect the lives, liberty, and property of its citizens; nothing more. That government is best which governs least. Rights, Equaility, & Choice are the concepts that underlie t he ideology of sovereign individualism, and individualism is the indispensable foundation of freedom. INT RINSIC NATURE OF RIGHTS Only individuals have rights, not the collective group; that these rights are intrinsic to each individual, not granted by the state; for if the state has the power to grant them, it also has the power to deny th em, and that is incompatible with personal liberty. A just government derives its power solely from the governed. Therefore, the state must never p resume to do anything beyond what individual citizens also have the right to do.

The People's voices should be heard through the Internet, verified by IP address (or by hometown library) together with authentication to their account; open yet fully accountable. Impeachment of the President, due to any fraud or usurpation of the People's trust & power, could be voted upon and fulfilled within a 48 - hour period by 50% of the People. (likewise, for the dismissal of any government employee) The People would select the successor administration. Simple & Easy. No power to any scoundrels and hobbyists, 100% power to The People! The goal of TEA is to make The People f eel empowered again. The People would become the \"Commander & Chief\" of any large - scale military decisions such as wars. All issues submitted by The People would be listed daily on the new governmental internet - based system. All solutions submitted by The People would be listed and can be voted upon. A registered voter can re - log into the system and change his/her mind, change their selected solution, at any time prior to th e particular issue voting deadline. 2) State Representative and State Senator s would all be fired and not replaced. There would be no need for them when The People can vote their will daily on issues and solutions from each hometown in America instantaneously via the Internet. 3) Real Money would be re - commissioned which is back ed by gold and silver and platinum. No more \"paper - backed\" money through a counterfeiting fiat system printed and distributed by a private group (The Not - Federal No - Reserve ) would be \"legal tender\" anymore. 4) An end to the the atrocity of \"chemtrail\" (long - white line) aerosol chemical spraying all over American skies. An end to fluoride force fed in the public water system ( http://www.fluoridealert.org ), and mercury injected into newborn babies in vaccin es ( www.safeminds.org ) and any other horrible atrocity. 5) An end to state sponsored \"false - flag\" terrorism. The truth, and nothing but the truth, of the facts of un - covered - up history will be re - taught in history class. No more lies to be force fed to The People. 6) The closure of Washington DC for \"politics\" and the creation of a new capital city as voted upon democratically by The People to permanently denote these above changes. 7) Simply the will of The People will be heeded, and nothing short of it. The proper function of government is to protect the lives, liberty, and property of its citizens; nothing more. Rights, Equality, & Choice are the concepts that underlie the ideology of sovereign indivi dualism, and individualism is the indispensable foundation of freedom. This statement is just the beginning of putting the power of government back in the People's hands, literally.

This discovery is prese nted in the form of a 51 page book which the w orld's people will most likely reject for the time being, and then later at some point this report will be generally accepted as pure factual truth as well as a massiv ely unheeded warning . This information will likely be dramatically spok en of widely in th e year 2011; yet hopefully sooner. This Global Elite's, the ultra - rich class, dramatic ongoing manipulation, or manufacturing, of world history was independently discovered in mid - 2005 and published in 168 pages, The Freemasonic Architecture of History. This more recent freely - distributable, copyright - free, summary report (PDF) was produced in August 2007. This is no normal book. It is 100% unique and factual and very up to date. It breaks free and libe rates the mind from the establishment mind cont rol spell that most of global society has long been placed under. It reveals how the world has long been operated as a theater , and how high level politicians in the USA and elsewhere have been hired and placed into position as only puppets of a secretive elite powermad cult of international currency, banking, & finance pirates commanding deceptively and generationally for centuries. I have known about this mass world governmental depravity for about 3 years. What has been reported here together with sup porting evidence presented by others such as Mr. Alex Jones, of prisonplanet.com, does not disappear by simply not paying attention to the problem. I tried that. I personally lived in self - exile in Guatemala from March 2006 - July 2007. It just doesn't work. I wish it did, but it doesn't. I wouldn't be composing this letter and potentially putting myself in crosshairs of danger if the glob al megaproblem had evaporated instead of further metathesizing. But I think and feel: Why should I try to preser ve my own little life, by hiding like the \"illuminati\", the word given for the global elite class , do - when millions, or even billions, of lives of others worldwide, potentially hang in the balance? - (even in the light of the Biblical prophecies of Danie l & John) Surely truth has value on its face, and the surfacing of it may help alleviate some measure of future suffering in th e world. So I do this out of love I have for others. In the light of prophecy, I also deeply consider Hosea 4:6, Ezekiel 33:6, and Psalms 94:16. So denial doesn't work. I have even tried it myself once as a last resort. Still yet today, the wo rld just becomes more of warzone and state of hell. And it is rooted in people simply not understanding that all of North America and E urope and Asia are dominated by a secret government comprised of world elites, and those in DC and on TV are just their hired actors carrying out their assigned scripts . (Seemingly an easy enough problem for everyone to pitch in and help fix; potentially in less than a year's time.) Yet it appears The People will continue to be subjugated to the insanity of unchecked tyranny. And all the dissent and patriotism and activism of the various people with all their many assorted \" No More War! \" signs and songs will be entirely compartmentalized & terminally suppressed; especially by the myriad of hired - to - lie \"nightly news\" press titutes and cover - up artists of today's tightly controlled globalized mass media complex; ad - naseam. Tens of millions of citizens and handfuls of celebrities and even some Wall Street brokers will just be endlessly labeled by 'the president' as 'conspiracy theorists', cordoned off to their \"free - speech zones\", miles away from any microphones or news cameras, and the sick & demented saga will be allowed to continue. Metaphorically, The Emperor of the dark side, known as \"Lucifer\" to the body of the Unite d Nations and the elite, will soon have his long scheduled Death Star completed. Amongst this group of one world fascist revolutionaries, you'll even see the names of people such as George Lucas, the director of movie Star Wars. Most everyone society looks up to from Madonna & Oprah to the Fed's spokesman, will go down ultimately in world history as being members of a gigantic fraud against the rest of humanity."},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":" The main point of this report and book is: our world is being governed by an Orwellian elite - class administered \"Cryptocracy\" . From: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocracy \"Cryptocracy , from the ancient Greek (kryptós, hidden) and (krateín, to rule), refers to a type of government where the real leaders are hidden, or merely unknown. A puppet government or figurehead, whether aware or not of their status as such, usually figures into this type of government in concep t. It can al so be used when referring to similar arrangements in organizations, orders, sects and cults. As such governments are, by definition, secret.\" And the proof is written right onto the DATES & TIMES of all global terror events . (Believe it or not!) All th e major crimes of world history have all been linked together by a distinct and distinguishable process , and this report solves all the major crimes of world history, in one simplified analysis, through an analytical reverse engineering of the signature 'n ew world order' global takeover process , over the last century. Again, the definition of a Cryptocracy is a secret government that rules by cryptic methods to obscu re its existence; thereby lending more power to them and safeguarding them as untouchables . Their minions in the public's eyes, such as the Fed chairman, are generally highly respected in the business world and they, their elite puppetmasters, remain generally unknown by the majority of society. The surnames Rothschild and Rockefeller top the secret government org chart. They are the principle \"casino owners\" of the world's current economic order . Fascinating? Let us all hope so, because knowledge of Harry Potter will get us all nowhere but into a relocation, \"rest & relaxation\", or concentr ation camp. But a mass awakening or renaissance about reality may just help preserve freedom in the world by helping to ope n most everyone's eyes and mind widely. And henceforth uniting the people worldwide in a common cause of communication, investigati on, truth, love, peace, justice, economic & political reform, and ultimately mass freedom . This should be The People's hope. The elite class have fashioned themselves over the course of history as psychopathic madmen/women to the extent by conspiring tog ether they have repeatedly scarred the world into the giant unnecessary mess that it is currently in. Currently the elite are buying mass acquiescence until they can hire enoug h low - IQ microchipped soldiers to attempt to suppress any future mass uprising against governmental tyranny. The elite have even fooled themselves into thinking they are doing good.

There is no room for any doubt left: a \"Cryptocracy\" of psychopathic ruling elites exist. \"Cryptocracy\" is the term for \"Shadow Government\". Who are these unelected criminals running the world? They are the wealthiest. Just follow the money. This evidence glaringly displays not only the century long compromization of the world's mass media , but literally the complete modern day abolition of a free press worldwide . The World's People are only receiv ing a layer of carefully crafted THEATER placed on top of any existing randomly occurring or staged big events, such as the staged event of 9 - 11 . And events continue to happen frequently where the death counts reported in the mainstream press are typically set (somehow) to a patterned number: \"11\" & reductions to \"13\" are the most frequent. \" 11, 911, 191, & 119\" are the signature marks of the events carried out by Western intelligence agencies (pronounced by patriots across America: “al - CIAda”), and 13s ap pear to be the marks of world government/UN/black operations/world military . And in that regard it is by no coincidence why the United Nations building in New Your City has exactly \" 39\" floors, the triple 13 count ! Yes, it is all psychotic in nature . So , maybe now you will never read or look at \"the news\" the same way again, whether the 1984ish Orwellian/controlled media is reporting on GI death counts in Iraq or staged car/“suicide” bombings such as this example which is rife with psychotic masonic nume rology.

He was at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago at 3 - 5pm after a street rally on Michigan Ave. of thousands marching and chanting \"Who you going to call? Ron Paul!\" and other choruses. When I entered the foyer, I just felt the door was wide open with friendly supporters of Ron Paul mingling about, with lots of eye contact from everyone and smiling faces. I suddenly felt like I di dn't have enough time to meet everyone I cared to meet, as my first priority was to compose a note to Dr. Paul to insert into the book I wished to hand to him before the end of the assembly. We watched a video on the tremendous, huge, grassroots following he is getting nationally, and even internationally. Then Ron Paul came to t he podium amidst persistent cheering. For the next hour Ron Paul spoke about Liberty, abolishing the Federal Reserve and IRS, an idea for new gold and silver money, bringi ng the troops home, minding our own business, getting out of the UN, retaining our p rivacy, stopping the National ID and forced vaccinations, putting a road - block in any plans for a North American Union, keeping the internet open, unregulated, and untaxed, going back to strict constitutional law after repealing the 16th and 17 amendments, keeping campaign promises, and many other good points. He's talking about serious change, and it took him an hour ju st to outline all the steps to get the US back to being a free and prosperous and non - aggressive nation for at least one more time around. After his speech, the crowd poured in around him, most everyone desiring his autograph and photos ta ken with the kind and gentle straight talking statesman. As I had my new book this I wished to give him, The Cry ptocracy: http://www.lulu.com/content/117 7093 , his staff members and business suit dressed security guards were fully supportive and gave me the red carpet to meet him. I made a joke to the security guards, \"I see no Tazers here thank goodness!\". They all laughed in a slightly perplexed fashio n. I felt like I was at a public event like no other. Thousands of people were in the giant conference room, all in perfect agreement and harmony. There was warmth and a general feeling of abounding peace and a very natural sense of security in the roo m, almost like being at home with family. There were people with newborns wanting their babies to be photographed in Ron Paul's arms. One time I was close in line to meeting him, an d as he handed a newborn back to his/her mom, I said \"Oh, that makes 4000 & 1 now!\" Dr. {of Obstetrics} Ron Paul looked right into my eyes as I said that, got my little joke, and warmly laughed back. I waited patiently about a half hour as he signed many hundreds of autographs. As I was standing amidst the crowd many people took interest in the book I was holding... many Ron Paul supporters. I was real hesitant to give this book away as it wi th the first copy printed and the only copy I had and I am rather poor these days on top of that. However one support er who wanted to buy the book from me, changed his mind and urged me to give it to him, as he felt it was important f or the cause. I suddenly agreed with him 100% that it was the right thing to do. (I was actually goin g to ask him to buy it, but I just considered the gif t a campaign contribution.) We shook hands. He remembered my initial question to him in 2003 at a Bastrop Texas Ron Paul conven tion: Congressman Admits a Conspiracy for Global Gov't Exists: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGk719 - iD0U&eurl= Well, I gave him an update on that question with giving Him a fresh full - color hardcover copy of the new book and copies for his staff members too... He might be reading it and looking at all David Dee's incredible artwork too right now as I am writi ng this, the day after, 9/23/2007... Could this be a start of a historical healing process? A possible new Nurember g in the name of justice for those hidden criminal dynasties that sponsored the original trial itself (to only cast a ll WW II blame just on certain Nazi lea ders)? That is what is needed if all the positive changes he was talking about is really going to t ake place in the USA. I hope he will understand that from analyzing the research contained in this new book.

First, the reconstituted US government would cancel the debts to the money changers, (debts and money they made out of 'thin air'). Then the US Treasury would be re - commissioned to print 'debt - free' US dollars once again. These dollars would be used to pay off any legitimate outstanding national debts. To deal with the illuminati's large stockpiles of gold, it should be searched for, aggregated together, accounted for, and melted down and made into coins the size of that which would supply ev ery man woman and child on Earth with one gold coin apiece. These would then be able to be traded for other currencies, including the fresh n ew US Treasury dollars. This would in effect provide a gold - backing for all the currencies of the world as gold w ould be monetized, distributed, and circulated once again along with the various paper currencies. If we were going to have a new preci ous coin for the world, I would recommend it should be called \"The Rex\" as Rex means King in Latin. True, cash is king in society, but Rex would refer to the Our Heavenly King, The Father of all things Good. If so, then I can say for the first time h ere that my book only costs R17.76 Rex's. The illuminati would then be expected to work productive jobs as with the rest of us all to support themselves and their families.

In other word s, they have carried off a swindle of monstrous proportions. Quigley quotes William Gladstone who as Chancellor o f the Exchequer said in 1852: \"The governme nt itself was not to be a substantive power in matters of Finance, but was to leave the Money Power supreme and unquestioned.\" (325) Put another way, a private credit monopoly controls the governments' purse strings. Able to create money out of nothing, they naturally grabbed as much of the world's real wealth as they could. Quigley writes about the fo rmation of their American cartels: \"The period 1884 - 1933 was he period of financial capitalism in which investment bankers moving into commercial banking an d insurance on the one side, and into railroading and heavy industry on the other were able to mobilize enormous wealth and wield enormous economic, political and social power. \" (71) Indeed their representatives, the \"Eastern Establishment\" i.e. the Morga ns and now the Rockefellers run the United States. (72) The principle mechanism is the Council on Foreign Relations. According to Quigley, the ultimate goal is \"nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to do minate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled ... by the central banks...acting in concert.\" (324) Quigley confirms that the bankers have usurped mankind's collectiv e instincts by finan cing the Socialist and Communist movements. Bankers love big government because the ultimate monopol y is the State. Through it, they take over their competition and control debt, resources, market demand a nd labor. Speaking of the Communist takeover of th e US government in the 1930's and 1940's, Quigley writes, \"it must be understood that the power that these energetic left - wingers exercised was never their own power of Communist power but was ultimately the power of the international financial coterie.\" I n other words, millions of idealists committed to human brotherhood and equality were (and are) duped into advancing a totalitarian schem e to concentrate the world's wealth and power into the hands of the superrich. More opportunistic Leftist s, Communists, Feminists and Globalists prosper while piously pretending to serve humanity. The Money Power control s the debate and encourages gridlock by backing all shades of the political spectrum and marginalizing any one who shines the spotlight on them.

He then became editor at Chemical Abstracts Service, the world 's largest chemical information center, where he first became aware of the health damaging effects of fluoride. He is the former science director of the National Health Federation; he is the executive director of Health Action and president of the Safe Wat er Foundation. He is a world - leading authority on the biological effects of fluoride and is responsible for ending the use of fluoride in many areas of the United States and abroad. HARMFUL EFFECTS OF FLUORIDE Fluoride is used as an insecticide and a roac h killer. Even at the level they use to fluoridate your public water supply, usually at the rate of about 1 part fluoride for every million parts of water (1 ppm) by weight, it causes severe problems. As little as one - tenth of an ounce of fluoride will cau se death. It is more poisonous than lead and just slightly less poisonous than arsenic. No one will die from drinking one glass of fluoridated water, but it is the long term chronic effects o f drinking fluoridated water that affects health. Dental fluorosi s is one of the earlier signs of fluoride poisoning, appearing in mild cases as a chalky area on the tooth, and in more advanced cases, teeth become yell ow brown or black and the tips break off. Fluoride in the drinking water leads to fluoride levels in ti ssues and organs which damage enzymes. This results in a wide range of chronic diseases. Fluoride weakens the immune system and may cause allergic type reactions including dermatitis, eczema and hives. It cause s birth defects and genetic damage. Fluoride i s likely to aggravate kidney disease, diabetes and hypothyroidism. The amount consumed in drinking water has been shown to lower thyroid activity in humans. It also causes the breakdown of collagen which results in wrinkling of the skin and the weakening o f ligaments, tendons and muscles. There are a number of ways that fluoride can be administered. The most insidious way is through the drinking water. Some of you have it in your mouthwashes, or in your toothpaste, or you may take a fluoride supplement whic h is dispensed in pills or drops. FLUORIDE A BY - PRODUCT OF INDUSTRY Fluoride is an industrial waste product, a by - product of the aluminum industry and the phosphate fertilizer companies who have mountains of fluoride that is polluting the ground water. Th ey have to get rid of it, and the old solution to pollution is dilution - just put it in the drinking water. People living in the vicinity of aluminum, phosphate, steel, clay, glass and enamel plants are exposed to high levels of fluoride in the air. For i nstance, the Hamilton area shows extremely high lung cancer rates that decrease as you get away from the downwind plume of the steel mills. If fluor ide was left with the phosphate and sold to farmers, it would kill their crops. That is what originally happ ened when they used this high fluoride phosphate, and the farmers said they were going back to manure. FLUORIDATED TOOTHPASTE Unless it says on the package does not contain fluoride , you are using fluoridated toothpaste. Fluoridated toothpaste contains 1, 000 ppm fluoride . There is enough fluoride at 1,000 to 1,500 parts per million to kill a small child if they consume the entire tube. If a child c onsumes just part of it, it could result in either acute or chronic toxicity. A four to six year - old child wil l swallow 25 to 33% of the toothpaste they put on their toothbrush. Don't let them put it in their mouth unless when they swallow it, it is good for them. People ask me where they can get non - fluoridated toothpaste . They have many brands of non - fluoridated toothpaste in health food stores, so pick up your toothpaste there, and make sure it doesn't have fluoride, because some health food stores have a couple of brands of fluor ide toothpaste. Not everything in a health food store is safe. Always read the labe ls. Pepsodent toothpaste also doesn't have fluoride. If you want something inexpensive, use baking soda and sea salt, but mak e sure you dissolve the salt crystals in water before you brush your teeth; otherwise the salt crystal s will score the enamel. GUM DAMAGE Fluoride actually causes gum damage at the concentrations used in fluoridated toothpaste at 1,000 ppm. Fluoride poisons enzyme activity and slows down the ability of the gums to repair themselves. If you brush your teeth with fluoridated toothpaste , you will suffer gum damage."},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"FLUORIDE GELS AND SOLUTIONS Some schools have weekly fluoride mouth - rinse programs in which the children swish fluoride solutions around in their mouths. The fluoride comes in a sugar size pac ket, and on the outside of the pa cket it says fatal if swallowed . If your child is in any of these programs at school, get them out of it. We have testimonials one after the other of children who come home with a stomach ache because they had actually accidentally swallowed part of it, an d children do accidentally swallow. Fluoride treatments at the dentist's office are equally hazardous. In the typical fluoride treatment, 10,000 parts per million fluoride , which comes in a flavoured gel to make it taste good, is left on the teeth for abou t five minutes. Then the child spits it out, though invariable he swallows some. The child cannot rinse, eat or drink for at least half an hour afterward. Children have died after swallowing fluorid e topically applied on their teeth. In one well publicized case, the dental hygienist neglected to tell the child to wash his mouth out and spit out the solution. The child began vomiting and sweating and died the same day . Over 6% of children receiving fluoride treatments at the dental office suffer gastrointest inal distress such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain either immediately or within one hour after treatme nt. According to scientists at the U.S. Public Health Service, topical fluoride is practically ineffecti ve in reducing tooth decay, and d amages gum tissue. According to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, \"the high concentrations of some products (gels, mouthwash, tablets, toothpaste, etc.) may be neither biologically desirable nor clinically necessary\". FLUORIDE SUPPL EMENTS Tablets and drops are another means of administering fluoride. The Canadian Dental Association has admitted in the last couple of years that children under the age of three should not be given fluoride supplements. And yet dental practitioners and p ediatricians who haven't kept up to date are still giving fluoride supplements to young children. I advise against fluoride supple ments for anyone. ADDITION OF FLUORIDE TO PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS The addition of fluoride to the public water supply is the mos t insidious way of chronically poisoning hundreds of millions of people around the world. Dr. Dean Burk was former chief chemist of the National Cancer Institute, and has co - authored studies with many Nobel prize winners including Otto Warburton, and he is the co - author of the most cited paper in the entire field of biochemistry - the Lineweaver - Burk Enzyme Kinetics. In the 1970s, Dean Burk and I conducted a number of studies which linked fluoride and cancer. There was already scientific evidenc e from the 1 950s that fluoride was causing cancer, and a 1963 study by Driscowitz and Norton showed that increased fluoride concentrations in the media of experimental animals increased tumour incidence fr om 12% at the lowest concentrations up to 100%. Taylor and Tayl or published a study in 1965 at the University of Texas in all the mainline medical journals showing that 1 ppm or even 0.5 ppm increase d tumour growth rate by 25%. These studies bothered me and around 1975 I found that we had enough data to compare the ca ncer death rate before and after fluoridation of fluoridated communities and compare them to non - fluoridated communities. Based on millions of subjects, the study showed a 5 to 10% increase in cancer death rate within three to five years after fluoridation was put into the water after correcting for various demographic factors like age, race and sex. All the variables were controlled . We followed this by a series of other studies. In 1977 we had full blown Congressional Hearings, and Congress stated: \"We ca n no longer assure the American public that fluoride does not cause cancer\". Dean Burk and other well - known scientists were there, and on the opposing side was the American Dental Association. Ten years later, Proctor and Gamble, makers of Crest toothpaste found that fluoride was causing precarcinogenic changes in cells. HOW FLUORIDE AFFECTS THE DNA REPAIR MECHANISM Epidemiological evidence shows that fluoride causes cancer. It does this in several ways. It can actually cause the original lesion. In each o ne of our cells we have genetic material called DNA, and this DNA is double stranded, it has a helix sh ape and these two strands of DNA are held together by semi strong bonds called hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonds also hold proteins together. Fluoride goes in and breaks those hydrogen bonds, and consequently destabilizes DNA. It can't cause a lesion in the DNA itself, but if it is in a site of the cell that regulates cell growth, it will cause uncontrolled cell growth. A few minor modifications will give you first a tumour, and secondly an invasive tumour or cancer. So fluoride has the ability to actually cause the cancer. We have a marvelous system of repair and rejuvenation. Even if we go out in the sun, even if we have a lesio n by fluoride itself, we have what is called a DNA repair enzyme system . So any lesion caused by the sun or ultra - violet light will be repaired. The DNA repair enzyme system will cut off the ends and use the"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"complementary strand to repair itself and make intact genetic material. The un fortunate thing is that one part per million fluoride, the amount of fluoride that they use in the public water system, depresse s the DNA repair system by 50%. So they have attacked us on the first defense of damage to our genetic material. Since people ca n get cancer from so many different causes, fluoride is just increasing our chances of getting cancer. THE IMMUNE SYSTEM Even if the cancer cell starts dividing and invading surrounding tissues, if our immune system is strong enough, it will kill those ca ncer cells without any remedies, without chemotherapy, without anything and will destroy the occasional cancer that maybe all of us have had at one time or another. Once in a while cancer breaks through when the immune system is low or the DNA repair enzym e system is down, and we will get cancer. Fluoride causes the lesion; it inhibits the DNA repair enzyme, and then inhibits our immune system by 30 to 70%. And that occurs at only one part pe r million. How does it do that? Our immune system is composed of w hite blood cells including phagocyte cells that are carried in the blood system. If there is an infection or cancer or some foreign agent , these phagocytes will go to that area and start engulfing and destroying this bad agent whether it is a ca ncer cell o r a bacterium or virus. It engulfs it in a little pocket called a lysosome which squirts enzymes and breaks down the bad agent into little pieces. They have other things called peroxisomes which burn t hat agent with free radicals and either destroy it or u se it for building new and healthy cells. These phagocytes will actually eat up bacteria or viruses, and toxic substances are just thrown off. Studi es from the University of Glasgow show that fluoride inhibits these white blood cells. Fluoride at levels be low one part per million causes a chronic release of these free radicals from the white blood cell out into the blood stream where it starts slowly damaging your body by increasing free radicals. This is one of the rea sons why we call fluoride the ageing f actor . NON - FLUORIDATED WATER Industrial quality reverse osmosis water brings the total dissolved solids down to less that one part per million for all the pollutants that might be in there. Distilled water will remove 99% of the fluoride all of the time. I also recommend a pre - charcoal filter on a distiller to remove volatiles so that you are not getting noxious gases in your home. These are worse when you inhale them than when you drink them, b ecause they go right into your blood stream and into your lung s. You can buy your water at the supermarket, but quite frankly you don't know what the quality of the water is. You must take care that the fluoride concen tration is less than 0.2 ppm. Some spring waters like Vichy (which contains 8 ppm) are notoriously h igh in fluoride. Avoid beverages such as soft drinks, beer and fruit juices from concentrate that have been bottled in fluo ridated areas. Teas , even brewed in fluoride - free water will contain about 1.2 to 2.4 ppm fluoride. Some people drink 8 to 15 cups of tea a day, and these amounts are large enough to cause dental fluorosis and other harmful effects. MINERALS IN WATER If you want to get minerals, you must get them in the proper balanced ratio. Calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and other minerals must be in a ratio that is acceptable to a living organism. Get your minerals from healthy living organisms like vegetables, grains, nuts and seeds, and if you are not a vegetarian, like meats, bones or bonemeal. Beet greens are at the top of the list as a mineral s upplement. I don't recommend milk or dairy as a calcium source; cow's milk has a very different constitution than human milk. DETOXIFICATION If you stop taking fluoride, your body will get rid of it eventually. The fluoride that gets stuck in your bones g ets stuck there for life pretty much, but that is not necessarily bad. Where fluoride has adverse ef fects is in the soft tissues. If you take over 200 mg of vitamin C per day that is all you really need for removing fluoride. In three to six months you sho uld have about 99% of it out which is good enough. GOOD DIET, NOT FLUORIDE, IS NECESSARY FOR HEALTHY TEETH Many primitive societies whose drinking water contains negligible amounts of fluoride go through life without tooth decay because they eat v ery litt le sugar and other refined carbohydrates. DOES FLUORIDE REDUCE TOOTH DECAY? Numerous attempts have been made to show that the amount of fluoride used to fluoridate public water systems reduces tooth decay under laboratory conditions. St ill no laboratory s tudy has ever shown that this amount of fluoride is effective in reducing tooth decay. Further, ther e are no epidemiological studies on humans showing that fluoridation reduces tooth decay that meet the minimu m requirements of scientific objectivity such a s the double blind design. * * * You may contact Dr. Yiamouyiannis at 614 - 548 - 5340 .

However, The People co ntinue to slave away and buy the establishment coverup day to day for their own continued enslavement. They are only united in lies. Would you think the American people really want another 8 years of th e Bush/Clinton regime? Over 36 continuous years in the White House – since 1980 Reagan/Bush? Of course the American people have to be mind controlled and their votes manipulated for that to happen again. Somebody like Ron Paul has to be marginalized as muc h as possible without making it overtly obvious. This is why Dr. Paul received only \"9.11%\" in three precincts in the New Hampshire primaries. It was entirely rigged. The elite signed it. People go into denial about the fascist world takeover or like to t hink they are part of \"the establishment\". Well, the 7 astronauts aboard Columbia were not high enough on the ladder to be protected. They didn't know they were being used in planned ritual blood sacrifice; anniversary of a NWO speech event. The families o f those astronauts don't even know today. They still think it was just an accident. Those who really understand world history very well, as explained the The Cryptocracy Book, do know. It is obvious to me the great many people of the world won't care enoug h to become educated until they are hit very hard in this coming global depression and staged pandemic influenza - a depopulation plague. (The start of the pandemic planning was an 11/11/2004 11:30am WHO meeting). I've done most of the people of the world a service through my research effort and by warning them, but I can't make them learn, much like one can't make a horse drink, even one in need. The information is all over the internet. Most people just like their illusions better, seemingly easier to cope with - they think they are in control - but they areabsolutely not. However, history will eventually reveal to those still around that their ancestors were entirely mistaken about their illusions."},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"See: http: //www.whatistheendgame.com You can verify the serial pattern at http:/ /www.massivesecret.com – You will feel happy if you moved out of the system's counter.feit paper money into silver.

In this version of the PD F, (PSA2008 - 2010 - pdf) I include a link to the National Councils of State Legislators website, specifically to the page created for the National ID card. This is the page state governors come to; to receive orders from higher up Federal cult members. Please link to it before you read further: http://www.ncsl.org/realid This is the webpage for REAL ID where they are presented with the NOW signature codes \"11\" and \"39\" (like the reversal of the flight numbers of 9 - 11 , 11 & 93). Again this proves case in point, align ed with the rest of the factual evidence presented in this PDF, that a clan of psychopaths who think they together form \"god\" have taken over the upper levels of this government (and London, etc.). Their r eligion is \"luciferian\" who have steadfastly seized political power in the world over the last century. The machiavellian elite get these numbers from the Cabala and Bible. 3,7,11,13 and the triples 9,21,33,39 are the \"power/master numbers\" of the occult/h igh degree freemasonry and have been neurotically applied over the past 100 years to the biggest staged events of world history. The psychopaths neurotically believe they must use these numbers on each major staged event or their new world order plans migh t fail. This is also how the government hi.jacker cult pridefully sign what they do and also pass lines of BS: such as the REAL ID will initially cost \" 3.9 \" (that's a \" 39 \" even though it has a dot between the 3&9) billion, \" 11 \" billion total cost, May \" 11 th\", 2008 target date, and most recently January \" 11 th\", 2008, the most recent heavy propaganda date for the \"internal passport\" requirement for every citizen. This is how the NWO nutzo's operate. They really believe they are being \"god\" by copycatting the numbers 3,7,11,13 and the triples out of the Cabala and Bible. This is what it all comes from. It's one of the secret \"mysteries\" of 33rd degree and above freemasonry. This is why their \"Novus Ordo Seclorum\" (secular means \"without god\" by the way) pyrami d logo went on the back of the $1 in 19\" 33 \". Also, this is what Ron Paul is con tending with in his run for the presidency. Now do you see my former point made clear? Congressman Paul would either have to speak publicly about this to become president or joi n them, join with the cult of the psychos. Which one? Yes, it is completely nuts. I didn't invent this. These are the facts. This is what our government has turned into. My book documents hundreds more examples of this, covering the last century. From WW I ending precisely at 11 am on 11/11 /1918. This is why JFK was taken out on 11/22 (3 11's = 33) and why 9 - 11 occurred on 9 - 11 (3x3 - 11). This is why in 1962 America was faced with the \" 13 days of October\", and why JFK was taken out precisely 13 months from th e date of when the London and"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":" Scotland based oligarchs set JFK's speech for the Missile Crisis, 10/22/1962. This is why Diana was killed on 8/31 (the *only date*(out of 365) with a 13 (a reversed 13) that sums to \"39\"). This is why the Space Shuttle us e runway # 33 , and the two launchpads are \" 39 a\" and \" 39 b\". This is why there are 39 stories in the NYC UN building, and 33 zones on the UN logo (32 outer ringlets and the center circle makes 33 zones). This is why JFK was plotted to be assassinated exactly 13 months from the Cuban Missle Crisis speech on 11/22/1963 (a “33” signature). There is no coincidence in all of this. This is a dogma of the elite's cult. Align these examples with the other hundred or so examples presented in this PDF and in my 2 nd boo k, The Cryptocracy Book. This is a major factor in the psychopathy of our current form of government - what it has become since 1776. It's being run like a big world - wide corporation of psychos. Please have a read of the PDF and please archive it for aft er the next 911. That is when people will care more, right after the event... right after they are done mourning, hopefully sooner though. It would be good if your entire staff became educated prior to the date of the next major event however or they might be too distracted at that busy time to become educated about this. It only takes a few hours for a bright mind to become educated about this however. When this information goes from one person to another to another, and so on, then the public is ready to face the facts of the psychopathic beast their government has turned into. Ron Paul right now is only supporting an illusion of democracy for the crypto - rothschildrockefeller - oligarchs now. The seed of this discovery has been well planted worldwide alread y over the past 3 years. Now I am not promoting this myself beyond now sending this summary to you/infowars.com . Again here's the latest serial pattern trail: http://www.ncsl.org/realid (Real ID pushed mand atory by May 11 th, 2008) \" On January 11 , 2008, the U.S. Depart ment of Homeland Security (DHS) released the final regulations to implement the requirements of the Real ID. The release of the final regulations is a mere 120 days prior to the implementatio n deadline established in the Real ID Act. DHS estimates the costs for states to implement the Real ID will not exceed $ 3.9 billion. According to a study conducted by NCSL, the National Governors Association and the American Association of Motor Vehicle A dministrators, the act will cost states more than $ 11 billion to implement over five years and will have a major impact on services to the public. \" ~Eric James Rainbolt, 36, Chicago 708 - 415 - 5413 (I can be contacted through my family.)

"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"Twilight of the Psychopaths The Canadian National Newspaper, Monday 14. Jan 2008 by Dr. Kevin Barrett “Our society is run by insane people for insane objectives. I think we're being run by maniacs for maniacal ends and I think I'm liable to be put away as insane for expressing that. That's what's insane about it.” – John Lennon, before shot by CIA mind - control subject Mark David Chapman When Gandhi was asked his opinion of Western civilization he said it would be a good idea. But that oft - cited quote, is misleading, assuming as it does that civilization is an unmitigated blessing. Civilize d people, we are told, live peacefully and cooperatively with their fellows, sharing the necessary labour in order to obtain the leisure to develop arts and sciences. And while that would be a good idea, it is not a good description of what has been going on in the so - called advanced cultures during the past 8,000 years. Civilization, as we know it, is largely the creation of psychopaths. All civilizations, our own included, have been based on slavery and “warfare.” Incidentally, the latter term is a euphe mism for mass murder. The prevailing recipe for civilization is simple: 1) Use lies and brainwashing to create an army of controlled, systematic mass murderers; 2) Use that army to enslave large numbers of people (i.e. seize control of their labour power and its fruits); 3) Use that slave labour power to improve the brainwashing process (by using the economic surplus to employ scribes, priests, and PR men). Then go back to step one and repeat the process. Psychopaths have played a disproportionate role in the development of civilization, because they are hard - wired to lie, kill, injure, and generally inflict great suffering on other humans without feeling any remorse. The inventor of civilization — the first tribal chieftain who successfully brainwashed an army of controlled mass murderers — was almost certainly a genetic psychopath. Since that momentous discovery, psychopaths have enjoyed a significant advantage over nonpsychopaths in the struggle for power in civilizational hierarchies — especially military hierarchies. Military institutions are tailor - made for psychopathic killers. The 5% or so of human males who feel no remorse about killing their fellow human beings make the best soldiers. And the 95% who are extremely reluctant to kill make terrible sol diers — unless they are brainwashed with highly sophisticated modern techniques that turn them (temporarily it is hoped) into functional psychopaths. In On Killing, Lt. Col. Dave Grossman has re - written military history, to highlight what other histories hide: The fact that military science is less about strategy and technology, than about overcoming the instinctive human reluctance to kill members of our own species. The true “Revolution in Military Affairs” was not Donald Rumsfeld’s move to high - tech in 2001, but Brigadier Gen. S.L.A. Marshall’s discovery in the 1940s that only 15 - 20% of World War II soldiers along the line of fire would use their weapons: “Those (80 - 85%) who did not fire did not run or hide (in many cases they were willing to risk great danger to rescue comrades, get ammunition, or run messages), but they simply would not fire their weapons at the enemy, even when faced with repeated waves of banzai charges” (Grossman, p. 4)."},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"Marshall’s discovery and subsequent research, proved that in al l previous wars, a tiny minority of soldiers — the 5% who are natural - born psychopaths, and perhaps a few temporarily - insane imitators — did almost all the killing. Normal men just went through the motions and, if at all possible, refused to take the life of an enemy soldier, even if that meant giving up their own. The implication: Wars are ritualized mass murders by psychopaths of non - psychopaths. (This cannot be good for humanity’s genetic endowment!) Marshall’s work, brought a Copernican revolution to mil itary science. In the past, everyone believed that the soldier willing to kill for his country was the (heroic) norm, while one who refus ed to fight was a (cowardly) aberration. The truth, as it turned out, was that the normative soldier hailed from the ps ychopathic five percent. The sane majority, would rather die than fight. The implication, too frightening for even the likes of Marshall and Grossman to fully digest, was that the norms for soldiers’ behaviour in battle had been set by psychopaths. That m eant that psychopaths were in control of the military as an institution. Worse, it meant that psychopaths were in control of society’s perception of military affairs. Evidently, psychopaths exercised an enormous amount of power in seemingly sane, normal so ciety. How could that be? In Political Ponerology, Andrzej Lobaczewski explains that clinical psychopaths enjoy advantages even in non - violent competitions to climb the ranks of social hierarchies. Because they can lie without remorse (and without the tel ltale physiological stress that is measured by lie detector tests) psychopaths can always say whatever is necessary to get what they want. In court, for example, psychopaths can tell extreme bald - faced lies in a plausible manner, while their sane opponents are handicapped by an emotional predisposition to remain within hailing distance of the truth. Too often, the judge or jury imagines that the truth must be somewhere in the middle, and then issues decisions that benefit the psychopath. As with judges and juries, so too with those charged with decisions concerning who to promote and who not to promote in corporate, military and governmental hierarchies. The result is that all hierarchies inevitably become top - heavy with psychopaths. So - called conspiracy th eorists, some of whom deserve the pejorative connotation of that muchabused term, often imagine that secret societies of Jews, Jesuits, bankers, communists, Bilderbergers, Muslim extremists, papists, and so on, are secretly controlling history, doing dasta rdly deeds, and/or threatening to take over the world. As a leading “conspiracy theorist” according to Wikipedia, I feel eminently qualified to offer an alternative conspiracy theory which, like the alternative conspiracy theory of 9/11, is both simpler an d more accurate than the prevailing wisdom: The only conspiracy that matters is of the psychopaths against the rest of us. Behind the apparent insanity of contemporary history, is the actual insanity of psychopaths fighting to preserve their disproportion ate power. And as that power grows ever - more - threatened, the psychopaths grow ever - more - desperate. We are witnessing the apotheosis of the overworld — the criminal syndicate or overlapping set of syndicates that lurks above ordinary society and law just as t he underworld lurks below it. In 9/11 and the 9/11 wars, we are seeing the final desperate power - grab or “endgame” (Alex Jones) of brutal, cunning gangs of CIA drug - runners and President - killers; money - laundering international bankers and their hit - men, ec onomic and otherwise; corrupt military contractors and gung - ho generals; corporate predators and their political enablers; brainwashers and mind - rapists euphemistically known as psy - ops experts and PR specialists — in short, the whole sick crew of certifiabl e psychopaths running our so - called civilization. And they are running scared. It was their terror of losing control that they projected onto the rest of us by blowing up the Twin Towers and inciting temporary psychopathic terror - rage in the American publi c."},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"Why does the pathocracy fear it is losing control? Because it is threatened by the spread of knowledge. The greatest fear of any psychopath is of being found out. As George H. W. Bush said to journalist Sarah McClendon, December 1992, “If the people kne w what we had done, they would chase us down the street and lynch us.” Given that Bush is reported to have participated in parties where child prostitutes were sodomized and otherwise abused, among his many other crimes, his statement to McClendon should b e taken seriously. Psychopaths go through life knowing that they are completely different from other people. They quickly learn to hide their lack of empathy, while carefully studying others’ emotions so as to mimic normalcy while cold - bloodedly manipulat ing the normals. Today, thanks to new information technologies, we are on the brink of unmasking the psychopaths and building a civilization of, by and for the normal human being — a civilization without war, a civilization based on truth, a civilization in which the saintly few rather than the diabolical few would gravitate to positions of power. We already have the knowledge necessary to diagnose psychopathic personalities and keep them out of power. We have the knowledge necessary to dismantle the insti tutions in which psychopaths especially flourish — militaries, intelligence agencies, large corporations, and secret societies. We simply need to disseminate this knowledge, and the will to use it, as widely as possible. Above all, we need to inform the p ublic about how psychopaths co - opt and corrupt normal human beings. One way they do this, is by manipulating shame and denial — emotions foreign to psychopaths but common and easily - induced among normals. Consider how gangs and secret societies (psychopat hs’ guilds in disguise) recruit new members. Some criminal gangs and satanist covens demand that candidates for admission commit a murder to “earn their stripes.” Skull and Bones, the Yale - based secret society that supplies the CIA with drug - runners, mind - rapists, child abusers and professional killers, requires neophytes to lie naked in a coffin and masturbate in front of older members while reciting the candidate’s entire sexual history. By forcing the neophyte to engage in ritualized behaviour that would be horrendously shameful in normal society, the psychopaths’ guild destroys the candidate’s normal personality, assuming he had one in the first place, and turns the individual into a co - opted, corrupt, degraded shadow of his former self — a manufactured psychopath or psychopath’s apprentice. This manipulation of shame has the added benefit of making psychopathic organizations effectively invisible to normal society. Despite easily available media reports, American voters in 2004 simply refused to see th at the two major - party presidential candidates had lain naked in a coffin masturbating in front of older Bonesmen in order to gain admission to Skull and Bones and thus become members of the criminal overworld. Likewise, many Americans have long refused to see that hawkish elements of the overworld, operating through the CIA, had obviously been the murderers of JFK, MLK, RFK, JFK Jr., Malcolm X, ChÈ, AllendÈ, Wellstone, Lumumba, Aguilera, Diem, and countless other relatively non - psychopathic leaders. They r efuse to see the continuing murders of millions of people around the world in what amounts to an American holocaust. They refuse to see the evidence that the psychopaths’ guilds running America’s most powerful institutions use the most horrific forms of se xualized abuse imaginable to induce multiplepersonality - disorder in child victims, then use the resulting mind - control slaves as disposable drugrunners, prostitutes, Manchurian candidates, and even diplomatic envoys. And of course they refuse to see that 9 /11 was a transparently obvious inside job, and that their own psychopathdominated military - intelligence apparatus is behind almost every major terrorist outrage of recent decades."},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":" All of this psychopathic behaviour at the top of the social hierarchy is s imply too shameful for ordinary people to see, so they avert their gaze, just as wives of husbands who are sexually abusing their children sometimes refuse to see what is happening in plain view. If deep, deep denial were a river in Egypt, American citizen s’ wilful blindness would be more like the Marianas Trench. But thanks to the power of the internet, people everywhere are waking up. The only obvious nonpsychopath among Republican presidential candidates, Ron Paul, also happens to be the only candidate in either party with significant grassroots support. If “love” is embedded in the Revolution Ron Paul heralds, that is because Dr. Paul — a kindly, softspoken physician who has delivered more than 4,000 babies — implicitly recognizes that government is the invention and tool of psychopaths, and therefore must be strictly limited in scope and subjected to a rigorous system of checks and balances, lest the psychopath’s tools, fear and hatred, replace love as the glue that binds society together. The decline in militarism since World War II in advanced countries, the spread of literacy and communications technology, and the people’s growing demands for a better life, together represent a gathering force that terrifies the pathocracy, (those alternately competi ng - thencooperating gangs of psychopaths who have ruled through lies, fear and intimidation since the dawn of so - called civilization). Since nuclear weapons have made war obsolete, the pathocracy is terrified that its favourite social control mechanism — r itualized mass slaughter — is increasingly unavailable. And if war was the great human tragedy, the pathocrats’ pathetic attempt at a war - substitute — the transparently phoney “war on terror” — is repeating it as sheerest farce. Truly, we are witnessing t he twilight of the psychopaths. Whether in their death throes they succeed in pulling down the curtain of eternal night on all of us, or whether we resist them and survive to see the dawn of a civilization worthy of the name, is the great decision in which all of us others, however humbly, are now participating. About the writer: Dr. Kevin Barrett, co - founder of the Muslim - Christian - Jewish Alliance for 9/11 Truth, LINK, has taught English, French, Arabic, American Civilization, Humanities, African Literatu re, Folklore, and Islam at colleges and universities in the San Francisco Bay area, Paris, and Madison, Wisconsin. Barrett became a 9/11 truth activist in 2004 after reading David Griffin's The New Pearl Harbor and conducting follow - up research that convin ced him Griffin had accurately summarized evidence indicating 9/11 was an inside job. In the summer of 2006, Republican state legislators and Fox newscasters demanded that Barrett be fired from his job teaching an introductory Islam class at the Universit y of Wisconsin - Madison, but the University refused to buckle, and Barrett got high marks from his students. He has appeared in several documentary films, lectures widely on 9/11 and hosts three radio programs on three different patriot networks.
