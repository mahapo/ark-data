The result is a “for the record” omnibus of eyewitness accounts, documented facts and photographs weighty enough to be tossed like a brick through the nearest glass tower of denial. Don’t be alarmed. At least not by the length of this 85,000-word ebook. I have used big type to make the text exceptionally easy to read on your home comput er or laptop. If this book leaps at you at high magnification on opening to full screen view, calmly spring to the top of your Adobe Reader and click the magnifying glass to a smaller setting. This ebook is specially formatted for easy reading at 100%. It is also much quicker to navigate than a “bookbook”. Just go to the bookmarks in the left margin, click on the page with the blue ribbon on it – and click on any chapter. Or choose the twin pages above the bookmarks to open the page index and select the topic of your choice. Want to know about those black lines extending in front of some chemtrails? What about those little orbs zipping in and out of chemtrails? Rx for chemtrail-re lated illness? Just type in your key words in the search box and check out the pages related to your topic. With chemtrails often misleadingly identified as “contrails” by U.S. government websites, pictures of outrageous “gridding” and associated chemtrails phenomenon are central to this story. Nearly 200 photographs punctuate the text, adding to this ebook’s readability and credibility. The only bummer is I have collected these photogr aphs over many year s and many computer configurations. Though I have spent hours ensuring pr oper attribution to the many photographers and websites who posted these photographs, some identification and credits have vanished into the digital void. If you spot one of your photos in these pages without proper caption or byline, please contact me with your name, photo date and location and your webs ite if you have one.

Thank you for your many email reports, tips, clips, photographs and documentation – and for purchasing this updated ebook of a story that hangs on like those lines in the sky. Without your spiritual, emotional and financial support, my ongoing 10-year investigation into the most conspicuous cover-up ever perpetrated would not be possible. My apologies for taking so long to get back to each and all of you. Working alone as an independent reporter, producer and webmaster unfortunately leaves me little time to answer emails. This is my reply to your contributions and concerns. This is your book, your reward for those thousands of emails and boxes of photographs and videos addressed to me. Thank you. Chemtrails Confirmed 2010 is also dedicated to the many chemtrails researchers and activists whose diligence and dedication have made this book possible. Please keep your articles, alerts, and corrections coming in! Know that each submission w ill be read by me and carefully considered before being posted in fresh updates at willthomasonline.net. Because the next puzzle piece may snap this story into clearer focus, each contribution is potentially vital. Thank you! Since I first broke the “chemtrail” story for the Environment News Service in late 1998 and Art Bell in January 1999, countless chemtrails researchers hav e learned what farmers like my own neighbors have long observed: Sheep don’t look up. But whether circling raptors have claws and a 90-inch wingspan - or four jet engines, a spray nozzle and a 132-foot wingspan - denial is not an option. Not when personal health and sovereignty and the fate of our planet are at stake. The good news is that in this time of ubiquitous cameras and the Worldwide Web, no deception can remain hidden for long. Those who display their arrogance and deceit in eye-popping billboards plastered across the sky have awakened people in nearly two-dozen countries to covert operations that, once realized, immediately point to other official dec eits. Our awakening to scams that invariably lead to big banks and the corporations and politicians they finance add impetus to peaceful and insistent citizen “upwisings” now sweeping the globe. Congratulations for being part of this movement and for seeking out the evidence presented in this electronic version of Chemtrails Confirmed 20010 . In updating this ebook for 2010 – and highlighting important information in italics – I have drawn from more than 100 new documents. While some of the information presented in the 2008 edition of Chemtrails Confirmed remains intact, don’t skip these sections. Much of this material has been expanded updated – for the record.

"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Let’s start with some interesting juxtapositions... GLOBAL DIMMING \"Global dimming\" entered the global lexicon after Swiss geography researcher Atsumu Ohmura compared decades of records and discovered that levels of solar radiation striking the Earth had declined by more than 10% in 30 years. According to the BBC: “Research papers published during the 1990s... reported that sunshine in Ireland was on the wane, that both the Arctic and the Antarctic were getting darker and that light in Japan, the supposed land of the rising sun, was actually falling. Most startling of all was the discovery that levels of solar radiation reaching parts of the former Soviet Union had gone down almost 20% between 1960 and 1987.” Then came swarms of jet airliners. And chemtrails. In 2001, Dr. Gerald Stanhill and his colleague Shabtai Cohen at the Volcani Centre in Bet Dagan were astonished to find a large fall in solar radiation. \"There was a staggering 22% drop in the sunlight, and that really amazed me,\" Stanhill said. The Guardian took up the story: “Intrigued, he searched records from all around the world, and found the same story almost everywhere he looked... Overall the decline amounted to 1% to 2% globally every decade between the 1950s and the 1990s.” “Dimming appears to be caused by air pollution,” Professor Veerhabhadran Ramanathan told the BBC. “This visible air pollution reflects sunlight back into space, preventing it reaching the surface. But the pollution also changes the optical properties of clouds . Because the particles seed the formation of water droplets ... this makes them more reflective than they would otherwise be, again reflecting the Sun's rays back into space.” This is exactly how chemtrails are intended to work. Ditto the particulate pollution from jet engines that forms lingering veils – not of condensation trails, whic h quickly dissipate, but actual cirrus clouds that perpetually shroud the Earth beneath major air routes. Global dimming means we are underestimating the true power of the greenhouse effect. “It now appears the warming from greenhouse gases has been offset by a strong cooling effect from dimming – in effect two of our pollutants have been canceling each other out. This means that the climate may in fact be more sensitive to the greenhouse effect than previously thought,” said the BBC. The double-whammy is seeing CO2 levels rising sharply, while ground level air pollution is dropping. \"We're going to be in a situation unless we act where the cooling pollutant is dropping off while the warming pollutant is going up. That means we'll get reducing cooling and increased heating at the same time and that's a problem for us,\" says Dr. Peter Cox at the Hadley Centre, Met Office. And for plants, too. \"In greenhouses in Holland, the rule of thumb is that a 1% decrease in solar radiation equals a 1% drop in productivity,\" Cohen says. Global dimming is not entirely due to “normal” air pollution, Farquhar says. \" I don't think that aerosols by themselves would be able to produce this amount of global dimming. \" Our new “dim sun” menu was discovered just as the Jet Age began sending bumper-to-bumper, carbon- burning jet traffic over Europe and North America. It gained serious scientific momentum two years after chemtrails began obscuring less traveled skies. Contrails and chemtrails were never factored in. But the missing radiation from global dimming is visible light and infrared – the same spectrum addressed by the Hughes sky-obscuration patent.

The staple of right-wing radio shows in the US, there is fevered speculation that the chemicals being sprayed are part of a wider plot that involves the so-called New World Order and is being directed by shadowy forces within the government.

It's got to be looked at.” Comparing climate change to passengers in a car with bad brakes heading toward a cliff in dense fog, Holdren added, \"The sensible passengers will certainly say: 'Let's put on the brakes, even if we don't know it will save us. It may be too late. We don't know exactly where the cliff is.... Let's get on with it.'\" President Obama was not alone in condoning chemtrails. The National Academy of Science continues to discuss the subject in its latest multidisciplinary climate challenges program. The American Meteorological Society is also preparing a statement on geoengineering, stating \"it is prudent to consider geoengineering potential, to understand it s limits and to avoid rash deployment.\" The British parliament has also discussed the idea.

LOOK UP! A telephone is like roulette. Whenever it rings, you never know how your life might change. This time, Jim Crabtree was on the line. “I’ve got something I need you to check out,” announced the managing editor at Environment News Service. Neither of us knew that I was about to embark on a lifelong quest to uncover the biggest covert operation in modern times. Crabtree simply wanted a short blurb on someone named William Wallace. It seemed that Wallace had sent ENS a VHS video tape of what looked like airliners drawing contrails across the sky above his remote mountain home in eastern Washington State that he and his wife Anne had built to escape what Wallace termed the “craziness” of cities. Now it looked like the cities were coming after them. Listening to Crabtree, I was confused. As a former pilot, ocean sailor and volunteer member of the U.S. Navy Reserves before resigning my commission over the napalming of families not unlike my own in Vietnam, I was well acquainted with the condensation trails that briefly form when hot engine exhaust impacts super-cold, super-saturated air at very high altitudes – before dissipating like exhaled breath on a winter’s day. “So what’s the story?” I demanded. "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" The jet trails on Wallace’s tape looked different, Crabtree explained. But contacting the Wallaces would not be easy. They lived a rough mountain mile from the nearest pay phone. But Crabtree promised to send me the tape. When the tape arrived from ENS, I drove it down- island to a friend’s home. While her daughters played in another room, we sat on the couch as I slid th e tape into a VCR normally reserved for cartoons. As the tape started playing, we stared at her TV. Then we both burst into laughter. The “story” was a bust! “Why those are just contrails,” I exclaimed. “We’ve got an hour of shaky video of contrails going across the sky!” My friend agreed. But we kept watching anyway. Five minutes went by. Ten... I stopped laughing. “Something’s wrong,” I exclaimed. “The same big planes are flying back-and-forth across the same patch of sky. Airliners don’t do that. Holding patterns are racetrack-shaped, never in parallel rows. Besides, the spacing we’re seeing violates FAA r egulations for commercial airliner separation.” “Look at the sky,” S. said. “It’s clouding over.” Sure enough. Instead of dissipating like normal contrails, these cross-hatched plumes began to widen and spread across the sky. As we watched over the next half-hour, the strange trails blended together, turning a “blue sky” day into a milky murky overcast. The rest of the date-stamped tape repeated this strange motif over a period of days. I was baffled. I wrote to the videographer’s post office address, suggesting a telephone rendezvous. Sure enough, at the appointed time my phone rang. I took the call. Stopping only to drop quarters into the pay phone, William Wallace described how the big unmarked jets were almost daily crisscrossing the area, weaving a gr id that came together to turn blue skies into a murky haze. Temperatures dropped. And as this unusual aerial activity continued for days and weeks, Wallace went on, the plants in their garden had wilted and collapsed. Then their dogs died. This was spooky! It certainly did not sound like normal contrails formed by the particulates and water vapor in jet exhaust. Wallace suggested I call Dr. Greg Hanford in California for another take on these strange aerial activities. Dr. Hanford directed me to a former Raytheon employee named Tommy Farmer out in Tennessee. One eyewitness led to another. Within a short time, I had 700 emails and interviews in my database from people across the United States who didn’t know what they were seeing, but were unanimously certain it wasn’t contrails that was causing them to coax family and friends out of their homes, or park their cars beside buys highways to aim camcorders up at the sky. During my time in Kuwait as a member of the Gulf Emergency Response Team, I had covered that disastrous “eco war” for Environment News Service, sending out dispatches from burning oil fields and the crude-saturated Persian Gulf over that trashed city’s only working fax line. Although I didn’t know it then, I was now about to being reporting on another environmental war that would consume my concentration for the next decade and beyond."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" On January 8, 1999, ENS wire service carried my first dispatch on these mystery lines in the sky worldwide: \"Contrails\" Mystify, Sicken Americans By William Thomas ENS Jan 8/99 Contrails spread by fleets of jet aircraft in elaborate cross-hatched patterns are sparking speculation and making people sick across the United States. Washington state resident William Wallace became ill with severe diarrhea and fatigue after watching several multi- engine jets spend New Year's Day laying cloud lines in an east to west grid pattern. A neighbor working outside came down with similar symptoms. But their wives, who remained indoors, suffered no ill effects from the inexplicable maneuvers which observers liken to high-altitude \"crop-dusting\" by unidentified multi-engine aircraft... The strange spray patterns are being reported repeatedly over towns in Tennessee, Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, Nevada, Idaho, Mississippi, Montana, Oklahoma, Washington and California. Wallace has been watching formations of high-fl ying jets weave grid-like contrails above his home since last summer. Each time, \"We get a taste in our mouth,\" he reports. He and his wife Ann get \"kind of tired and sick,\" having \"no energy to do anything.\" After plants began dying around his mountain cabin, \"I got real sick for about three weeks,\" Wallace relates. \"My eyes watered. Fluid came out of my nose. I could hardly move my arm up above my head to comb my hair for about a week.\" Wallace and his wife are not alone in their plight. In March, 1996, Dr. Greg Hanford bought an expensive camera and binoculars to keep an eye on jets spraying white bands above his Bakersfield, California home. Hanford has counted 40 or 60 jets on some \"spray days.\" \"Everybody seems to be getting sick from it,\" Hanford told ENS. \"Hackin' and coughin' when you really get nailed with this stu ff.\" The dentist, many of his patients and two receptionists have repeatedly contracted severe respiratory infections. Hanford's illness lingered for five months despite courses of four different antibiotics. \"It's really weird,\" Hanford says. \"You think two jets are going to hit each other—and then they make an X.\" The dentist says he has sometimes seen \"furry globular balls\" spread downwind in a long feather from the high-flying aircraft. Unlike normal contrails, which dissipate soon after a lone jet's passage, video taken by Wallace and Hanford show eerily silent silver jets streaming fat contrails from their wingtips in multiple, crisscross patterns. But instead of dissipating like normal contrails, these white jet-trails coalesce into broad cloud-bands that gradually occlude crystal clear skies. \"Passenger jets don't make contrails that stay and become clouds,\" Wallace observes. Government officials deny that anything unusual is taking place. When Hanford called the local airport, tower personnel told him there was nothing going on.\" The jets were \"just commercial\" undergoing \"international flight training.\" But a skeptical Hanford responded, \"Is the FAA going to allow two jets to come at each other?\" X's, overlapping W's and the Roman numeral XII are among the patterns flown by the mystery aircraft. Last June (1998), Hanford watched four aircraft spraying in circles to form a perfect bulls-eye. Through his Swaroski binoculars, Hanford could see what \"looked like a 737\" painted all-white on top with an \"orangish-red\" underbody and red"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"engine cowlings. Another 727-like aircraft was painted \"all-white with a black stripe up the middle of fuselage.\" None of the planes carried identifying markings. Pat Edgar has been watching the jets spraying over eastern Oklahoma since a sunny day in October, 1997 when as many as 30 contrails gradually occluded the sky. \"They look like they're playing tic-tac-toe up there,\" he says. \"You know darn well it's not passenger planes.\" Edgar says he has watched \"cobwebbing stuff coming down\" from the zigzagging jets flying \"all day long, line after line, back-and-forth, like furrows in a farm field.\" Edgar adds that \"There is a lot of Lupus in the area now. A lot of women have come down with it.\" Edgar's father-in-law, a former judge, and three or four other close friends were hit hard in their immune systems. Symptoms incl ude swollen hands and legs, night fever and shortness of breath. Contrails spread out over time. Retired Oklahoma state judge Bill Ed Rogers now runs out of breath after walking 20 feet to the bathroom. Climbing stairs, he says, \"is directly out of the question.\" Neither Rogers nor his doctors can explain his breathing difficulty, which began shortly after spraying began in November, 1997, and is getting worse. The 57 year old former judge says he thought he was experiencing congenital heart failure when he was admitted into the Mayo clinic last January. But after being diagnosed with severe inflammation in his right lung, a team of top surgeons were unable to pump an unidentified \"Jell-O-like\" fluid from his lung. Edgar, Wallace, Hanford and other eye-witnesses are uneasy over the ongoing aerial \"experiments and the secrecy surrounding them. They're gettin' ready, practicing,\" Edgar believes, for some kind of mass population cull. Before Edgar sold his restaurant, customers came in complaining of airplanes \"flyin' around all night\" over a remote area of Oklahoma. In the morning, they could see \"stuff comin' out of their wings.\" Edgar says he knows four-dozen witnesses who have \"come down violently ill, coughin' up blood for two weeks - or [with] real bad nosebleeds.\" As far as he's concerned, \"it had to be something in that doggone plane that was spillin' out in the middle of the night.\" Edgar joins witnesses across the U.S. who worry that whoever is behind the mystery spraying just has to \"come up with something a little stronger later on. It's just a guess,\" he says. \"But it sure seems weird. They have a mission. They go back and forth all day. Hey man I'm talkin' hundreds of contrails in a day! It's unbelievable.\" "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" UNCENSORED After peer-review by professional journalists, my nex t dispatch for ENS – released the following week – was chosen by Project Censored as one of their top censored stories of 1999: Mystery Contrails May Be Modifying Weather by William Thomas ENS Jan 14/99 SEATTLE, Washington (ENS) - U.S. Air Force aerial tankers may be causing and seeding clouds to modify the weather. The condensation trails and chemicals spread by these aircraft could be what is making some people sick in Tennessee, Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, Nevada, Idaho, Mississippi, Montana, Oklahoma, Washington state and California. Tommy Farmer, a former engineering technician with Raytheon Missile Systems, has been tracking patterns of jet contrails phenomena for more than a year. Farmer has \"positively identified\" two of the aircraft most often involved in the aerial spraying incidents as a Boeing KC-135 and Boeing KC-10. Both big jets are used by the US Air Force for air to air refueling. A Boeing T-43 used for navigation training and mapping may also be involved. Confirming reports from eye-witnesses across the United States, Farmer reports that all aircraft are painted either solid white or solid black with the exception of two KC-135s which were in training colors - orange and white. No identifying markings are visible. Farmer has collected samples of what he calls \"angel hair\" sprayed by the mystery aircraft on six occasions since February, 1998. Four samples have been taken since November, 1998. Farmer says that globular filaments resembling ordinary spider webs, \"usually fall in clumps or wads ranging from pencil eraser size to the size of a balled up fist.\" Winds often whip the cobweb-like material into filaments as long as 50 feet (15.3 meters). Farmer told ENS that the sticky substance \"melts in your hands\" and \"adheres to whatever it touches.\" Farmer urges caution to collectors after becoming ill after his first contact with the \"angel hair.\" Like Bakersfield, California dentist Dr. Greg Hanford and other ground observers exposed to the spraying, Farmer's ensuing sore throat and sinus infection lasted several months. After repeatedly observing aircraft spraying particulates \"in front of and into cloud systems,\" Farmer is \"fairly certain the contrail phenomena is one part of a military weather modification weapons system.\" He notes that because the chemical contrails allow much more moisture to form inside cloud systems, severe localized storms result from the aerial seeding, while surrounding areas that have surrendered their moisture to the storm cells experience drought. The huge Xs being traced by formations of tank er jets in the sky can be tracked by satellite and coordinated with the crossed-beams of ionospheric heaters to heat the upper atmosphere - changing its temperature and density and enhancing the storm's effects."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" Based in Gakona, Alaska, this unclassified joint U.S. Air Force and Navy project known as the High Altitude Auroral Research Project ( HAARP ) has for the past several years been using phased array antennas to steer powerful beams of tightly-focused radio waves \"to stimulate,\" heat and steer sections of the upper atmosphere. Awarded in 1985 to MIT physicist Bernard Eastlund, HAARP 's commercial patent claims that directed energy beams of more than one-billion watts can be used for \"altering the upper atmosphere wind patterns using plumes of atmospheric particles as a lens or focusing device\" to disturb weather thousands of miles away. In an interview with this reporter, Eastlund admitted, \"I had looked at using this intense beam, which can be angled, to do some experiments in terms of guiding the jetstream, moving it from one spot to another. I presume it is possible, which might lend credence to these other things...\" Farmer guesses that besides its obvious tactical military applications, aerial-seeding of contrail-clouds aligned in HAARP's characteristic grid-patterns could be part of a secret U.S. government initiative to address the global weather crisis brought about by atmospheric warming. The aircraft spraying that has sickened Americans across the country may not be confined to the United States. On August 11, 1998, \"USA Today\" reported dozens of residents of Quirindi, Australia \"swearing they saw cobwebs fall from the sky\" after unidentified aircraft passed overhead. Media coverage of the Wallace’s plight was not well received in certain corridors of power. After William Wallace went to Channel 2 television news with his claim that odd-acting contrails were making him and his wife sick, “two jets buzzed me and left a contrail” over their yard. Two days later, after returning to Channel 2 with this new complaint, a small airplane over flew the Wallace’s remote homestead. When it reached their property, Wallace says the prop plane emitted a chemtrail from its tail. The plane pass ed directly over their house, shutting off its valve as it exited their property. “After that,” Wallace relates, “we started getting really sick. We got horrible headaches and backaches and bone aches and we felt nauseous and sick and we felt very sick. We felt we would get cancer and die. Ann got shaky and achy and went upstairs to bed.” The propeller planes were “white planes with blue on the tips. I call them UN planes. They fly by all the time. And out of its tail came a spray and we got real sick and that was tellin’ me to shut up.” On New Year’s Day, 1999 Wallace was outside splitting wood when... “It started up again. The jets came over about three times.” That evening another jet flew over their remote mountain home and William Wallace showed Ann chemtrails woven in a silver tracery against the moon. About six in the morning, Wallace became sick with diarrhea. He suffered from diarrhea all day – “the worst I ever had it.” But Anne, who had remained indoors when the jets were working overhead, suffered no ill effects from maneuvers many observers liken to high-altitude “crop-dusting”. After requesting an explanation from the FAA’s Arthur Jones in Spokane, William Wallace received a letter stating in part: "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" Dear Mr. Wallace: The contrails viewed in the video all appear normal and shows a variety of shapes, which are dependent on atmospheric conditions such as temperature, wind speed and direction, and relative humidity. While your hypothesis is doubtful, we have taken the liberty of forwarding the material to Ms. Margaret Gidding, United States Air Force, Environmental Public Affairs, Pentagon, Washington D.C. You may expect a direct reply. Sincerely, Arthur Jones That reply, says Wallace, was delivered at 1045 on January 22, 1999 when two jets broke the sound barrier over the Wallace home. William and Ann “thought that they had dropped a bomb on us.” According to Wallace, at 2:30 that afternoon, a CH-53 “Black Stallion” Marine helicopter “painted all black” flew over their home at treetop height (about 200-feet), flying north to south. The next morning, after a twin-turboprop aircraft flying east to west laid a single fat chemtrail overhead, William and Ann Wallace became “very sick and ill with headaches.” BLUE SKY DAYS Blue skies seem to bring them ou t. Silent, silver or white with red bands matching official USAF markings, formations of three-and four-engine U.S. Air Force KC-10 and KC-135 tanker planes trail broad white ribbons that instead of quickly dissipating like normal contrails, linger for hours in overlapping lines that gradually coalesce, unt il the sun is obscured behind milky haze. Once you have watched two, six, eight or more unmarked tanker planes weaving broad white plumes into cross-hatched tic-tac-toe grids, giants X’s or fu rrows of expanding parallel lines – you will never look at the sky the same way again. In the words of eyewitnesses across 48 states: -- “The day starts out clear, and then they come, from the east, in a fan-shaped spread, laying down the trails. By noon, or early afternoon, the sky is solidly overcast. Sometimes they just go back and forth down south, over Yuma. Sometimes it’s to the north, over Las Vegas. Our two senators, Kyl and McCain, think I’m nuts for pointing this out to them, as does our representative, Bob Stump. I’m not. I know too many people who’ve been sickened by the chemtrails. I’m a retired airline pilot. I know a chemtrail from a contrail!” -- “I’ve lived here for 26 years never seeing this number of contrails at once.” -- “They look like they’re playing tic-tac-toe up th ere. You know darn well it’s not passenger planes.” -- “I watched a clear blue sky become crisscrossed wi th the white trails from many jets. The sky then became overcast, in spite of the forecast calling for sunny weather. I felt stunned as I witnessed this event.” -- “I remember sitting on my porch and telling my husband that the trails from jets were different now days, they stayed longer in the sky and looked different. He laughed at me.” "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"-- “One morning I saw so many I almost had a car accident. They were X’ing, probably 50, 100 of them, as far as I could see. Lots of X’s and parallel lines. Definitely not normal air traffic.” -- “These co ntrails do indeed behave differently from the usual contrails made by jets. They don’t dissipate right away. They like linger, hang there. But they were so heavily concentrated that I just about fell over.” -- “I am under the understanding that we have regular flight patterns. This however, broke all the rules, as these patterns crisscrossed one another over a dozen times.” -- “About the contrails in Montana. The first time I noticed the different types of contrails was about five years ago. I was in the Air Force. So I know the difference.” -- “I was southbound on Interstate 65 from Indianapolis toward Camp Atterbury. I had just heard of chemtrails on Coast to Coast earlier in the week and thought it was a bit of a kooky theory. I noticed the sky in front of me had 27 separate contrails. I then noticed a large jet at altitude, also southbound parallel to the highway, was not leaving any contrails. I wondered, Why? This jet began to turn. As it settled up on 090 (due east), it immediately began to leave a classic chemtrail. That was when I knew it is being done on purpose.” -- “We are a society that doesn’t look up. But these chemtrails were so out of place one couldn’t help but notice them. We never see planes in that area of the sky at that time of day, for one thing. And for another, their trajectories were all weird. I had alr eady mentioned chemtrails to one of my co-workers months ago, and when she came in on Tuesday morning I asked, “Did you see them?” She said she had noticed, and said they were ‘all over the place.’” -- “Everywhere from horizon to horizon, as far as I could see above the trees and buildings, perfectly parallel streaks or stripes of clouds.” -- “I am under the understanding that we have regular flight patterns. This however, broke all the rules, as these patterns crisscrossed one another over a dozen times.” -- “I am a private pilot and have a penchant for watching everything that moves in the skies above me. On Thursday, beginning around mid-morning, high altitude jets began ‘painting’ the sky with non- dissipating contrails. I am familiar with the physics involved in the production of ‘normal’ contrails. The fact that these contrails do not dissipate leads me to suspect that something of a chemical nature was being emitted.” -- “I am a veteran of eight years active duty in the Navy and still serve in the reserves. I was a qualified lookout while stationed aboard ship and was trained to observe the sea and sky and identify targets. I am also an aviation buff and also interested in weather. I have therefore spent a lot of time flying and also observing the sky from the ground. I jog every morning at a park near my apartment in the DFW metroplex.” -- “On the morning of 10 March, 1999, as I looked to the sky I saw something I have never seen before. The sky was covered as far I could see with a crisscross pattern of evenly spaced thick contrails. I counted at most three aircraft still spraying trails. This day had begun sunny with a brilliant blue sky just as forecast by weather channel and local foreca sters, but they did not seem bothered by this unexpected ‘haze.’” "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"-- “Real jet trails are not as low as these.” -- “I am a police officer and have been one for 15 years. I was driving to a doctor’s appointment in Beachwood, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland. My attention was drawn to an unusually thick contrail traveling from the southeast to the northwest. I saw a large four-engine jet, silver in color. There was not a cloud in the sky and no other contrails. Unusual for Clev eland weather in February – basically a beautiful day. The plane was unusual because it was so big and lower than most jets that leave a contrail. Also it seemed to take a very long time to travel its path. I got a good look at it at a stoplight and from what I could make out it was silver and was reflecting the sunlight. It had four engines, two on each side and was making two large contrails that did not dissipate.” -- “The band in question was about 30 to 40 miles wide. I started by seeing them about three miles west of Crawford notch, and as we got onto I 93 I counted 18 aircraft. It is incredibly strange to see so many jet aircraft in this type of formation. It gives me the shivers because it looks like a high density bombing run, and you know what? Maybe that’s just what it is. I checked myself this morning to see if I had morphed into a different sex or something, but things seemed OK so far.”  -- “Our skies [in Australia ] are being sprayed almost da ily since April. Planes with red tanks underneath, spraying from 7 am till 8 pm at night. People getting sick everywhere, and no one gets answers. Why?” -- “I work out on the runway at Sea-Tac Airport and I have been observing these all summer. Quite amazing! I have asked pilots about them just to get a reaction. What always tickles me how fast intelligent people ‘dummy-up’ when I look up in fake amazement and say ‘wow, what are those’?” -- “I have been in aviation for thirty years and was in the U.S. Air Force for sixteen. Never have I observed a pattern of contrails like that one.” Someone was stealing our skies. And sickening us, as well. As the temperature drops and the wind begins to rise, you might smell petrochemicals. Or taste something metallic on your tongue. Depending on your age, general health and immunity, the congestion and dry hacking cough, fierce headache and gushing nosebleeds, suffocating asthma attacks, stiff neck and aching joints, twitching eyelids, dizziness and inability to concentrate or remember simple errands could begin within 24 to 48 hours. It is not the flu. There is no fever. But the ensuing onslaught of “flu-like” symptoms is more drastic than any illness you have ever endured. Pneumonia, heart problems, even death may follow. And still the y came."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" MASTER OF CEREMONIES My next noteworthy phone call was from Art Bell. The host of Coast To Coast AM – one of the most listened to radio shows on the planet – wanted me on his show. We went on air for the first time together on January 7, 1999. It was a grueling late-night format. As Art would later tell Wired magazine, “There's a different breed of person awake at those hours. And the world is a quieter place, with less to distract us from esoteric thought.” [Wired Apr 20/09] The show was a barn burner. If you ignore the sky while these trails are being laid down, I told Art, and then happen to look up, you’re apt to think that these are just clouds. But they aren’t. If airline pilots pulled stunts like making head-on passes at each other, or flying in formation with eight other airliners for hours on end, or flew back-and-forth in parallel rows over the same patch of sky instead of proceeding immediately on a direct course to their des tination—they would lose their jobs as well as their licenses. I also pointed to a U.S. Air Force research study provocatively titled, \"Weather as a Force Multiplier: Owning The Weather In 2025.\" Issued in August, 1996, seven U.S. military officers outlined how HAARP could be used in conjunction with chemicals sprayed from aerial refueling tankers to allow U.S. aerospace forces to \"own the weather\". Among the desired objectives were \"Storm Enhancement,\" \"Storm Modification\" and \"Induce Drought.\" Citing “airborne cloud generation” capabilities and “aerial obscuration” missions flown by “Weather Force Specialists,” the report concluded, \"In the United States, weather-modification will likely become a part of national security policy with both domestic and international applications.\" Initially skeptical, Art Bell assigned his researchers to track down my citations during commercial breaks. When they came back with Owning The Weather and similar corroboration, he became convinced that I was on to something. Just what that “something” was, neither of us was sure. But the showman smelled “a really great tale” that might even be true! William Wallace’s story was compelling. Especially when corroborated by similar eyewitness accounts across the nation. Unfortunately, following my on-air disclosure with his permission, William and Anne Wallace were visited by a twin-turboprop aircraft, which came in low over the trees to spray something over their property. Within days, Anne became extremely ill. The hospital found a dangerously low white platelet count. "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"It was around three-thirty in the morning when I finished answering Art Bell’s probing questions. The four-hour interview had felt like an oral exam before 15 million listeners. Still wired from my presentation – and oblivious to the firestorm we had just unleashed –I put down the phone and went outside. Hidden away in the hills outside Duncan, British Columbia, my mountain cabin was an ideal refuge. Taking a lungful of the bracing winter air, I paused, looked up – and froze. Directly overhead, the sky was mobbed with stars. And a giant “X”. I’m not paranoid. But when unidentified tankers started laying down parallel rows above the ridge right across from my cabin over the next few weeks, I began to wonder if some people were sensitive about having this story exposed. "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" Chapter 2. FALLOUT Like many inhabitants of Sedona, Donna has observed chemtrail spraying for years, including sticky “angel hair” which she and others found on rocks on at least one occasion. Donna became very ill herself from the spraying and finally moved away. Ice-crystal contrails do not rain cobwebs and “goo” over porches, power lines and police cruisers. Yet, chemtrail cobwebs dubbed “angel hair” have been observed in Tennessee; New Jersey, Ohio, Colorado, Washington and New York states, Oklahoma, Oregon, Illinois, California, Nevada, Arizona, Pennsylvania, New Mexico and Quirindi, Australia – to name a few locations. Alighting from a helicopter to effect repairs on five different rigs in the Gulf of Mexico in 1998, an oil worker was stunned to see a “white web or angel hair type stuff,” draping each platform. Also that year, while backpacking up in the mountains of California near Yosemite, William Wallace was startled to see “this stuff comin’ out of the sky at 8 to 9,000 feet. High up in a forest, it was just hanging all over, just like cobwebs falling out of the sky – long st rands of it, 20 foot long, [for] hundreds of feet.” When Wallace wadded some of the lightweight substance into a marble-size ball, “it just disintegrated after a while.” In November of 1998, an MD from Sedona reported that he and his wife “observed hundreds, thousands perhaps of these filaments seemingly drifting in the wind and landing on the ground, covering all the plants with their shiny structures. The filaments appear to be several feet long, perhaps over 10-foot and relatively thick, like large spiders will make. We both became sick a month later coming back to California with running noses, cough, extreme fatigue and I am still experiencing pain in my arm. Coincidence? Maybe.” "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Near Jonesboro, Arkansas that same month, a wife and husband traveling to his mother’s for Thanksgiving dinner... began noticing what appeared to be spider webs suspended up in the air or attached to trees and high-line electric wires. The webs continued on for several miles towards Jonesboro. We noticed some people rolling their windows down and trying to catch the webs or strands as they drove. As we approached Walnut Ridge, we began to see more of the fiber. It would be in big floating streams hundreds of feet long tens to hundreds of feet in the air and also gathered along the highway in bushes and trees and hi-line poles like so many very large cobwebs. As we were driving westward home with light high clouds allowing some sun to shine through the webs gathered along the highway looked like ice frozen in webs. Another eyewitness driving nearby saw gossamer strands “like a blanket 300 to 400 feet-long, blanketing power lines over the highway, hanging in trees, blowing in the air.” Also that November, this policeman wrote in his journal: I have been a police officer for nearly 24 years, and the last three years of my career has been spent working at Denver International Airport. Some of my work there includes directing traffic – most often at passenger drop-off on United Airlines side of the terminal (what we call ‘Six-West’). A couple weeks ago while I was directing traffic on six-west at the terminal I noticed fine filaments floating through the air. There were thousands of them, and some were thirty to forty feet long. They were floating down at ground level and perhaps a thousand or more feet up in the air. They were so fine that they could only be seen if the sunlight caught them just so. These filaments floated past for over an hour. I’ve never seen anything like it. Some of the filaments caught on light poles and other structures. At one point I reached out as one went by and caught some of it on my arm and clothing. It seems to me that spiders wouldn’t be flying around out on the Colorado prairie with winter setting in. COBWEBS IN COBDEN Living on Bell Hill directly across from Bald Knob, the tallest hill in Illinois, “J” reports that spray planes have been flying daily since December 21, 2000 - with only a few days off. It looks to him that the pilots are using Bald Knob as a reference while working a line from the Mississippi River to the Ohio River. J. is seeing as many as a dozen spray aircraft duri ng a single session. - mostly “stretch Lear jets” or similar executive-type bizjets - wi th an occasional tanker-size plane working back and forth, west to east, east to west and occasionally north-south over the ridgeline. Collecting fibers dangling from tree limbs, J. recalls how Project SUCCESS sought to use updrafts along ridgelines to waft fibers spread by aircraft into the upper atmosphere, forming clouds. Under comp uter-enhanced electron microscope magnification at 3200x, he and a friend were able to clearly discern three fluorescing colors – red, green and blue – in the airdropped fibers covering his yard and farm machinery."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"While any link to possible pathogens is strictly speculative without actual lab testing, J believes that the National Textile Center provided a clue when it discussed growing bacterium inside polymer strands using fluorescing colors to denote the level of biological activity. Green, for example, can denote E- coli. According to a DNA researcher, blue biomarkers indicate an RNA virus, red denotes sera blood product protein, green shows a DNA of bacteria. J. and his a stonished colleague watched through the microscope as the fibers broke into five parts, forming a ball “like a closed fist” before returning to a single str and containing chain-like or bead-like balls. Under very high magnification, the balls showed a faint black line down the center with the knob and one end. A doctor providing special instruments for collecting cu ltures was very interested in J’s investigation. Like many other residence in the surrounding area, the MD was suffering from a lingering upper respiratory illness that soon segued into body temperatures one or two degrees below normal - indicating the presence of a fungal infection. But when J. asked the MD for assistance in having the samples lab tested, the doctor demurred, fearing for his reputation and his medical practice if a lab flagged suspicious samples and notified the CDC or the FBI. J. also contacted an environmental organization, which had alerted Illinois residence that high chlorine levels in their drinking water may be responsible for birth defects and congenital illness. When J suggested that a heavy loading of air-dropped bacteria could be worse than chlorine in the water, the group was very interested in his fibers. But after examining some of the material, J says they called to insist, “Do not get it lab tested. Do not get it lab tested.” Instead, the environmental group suggested he draft a petition and “organize a protest”. Whatever you do, they reiterated, “Do not have this material lab tested.” J. had a professional lab “unofficially” look at his fiber samples. But on December 14, 2002 he told this reporter, “Every time I talked to them it was something different. First they said it was a polymer. Then they said an acetate. Then definitely not acetate. Most curious was the inability of the lab to match the airborne fibers with any of the m any fibers in its extensive database.” Since then, J reports that the white sky “looks kind of plastic, the weather’s been really screwy, and the leaves have fallen off the trees.” And everyone’s coughing. Year round. POLYMERS ARE FOREVER As an example of what happens when a sticky polymer is released into the atmosphere and breathed by humans, a blogger named Eric quotes a report in Macon Daily Times relating how, in April 2003 an Avery Dennison plant suffered a chemical release at their Mill Hall plant when “a sudden increase in temperature and subsequent buildup of pressure in a batch reactor” caused a safety vent to open, discharging acrylic polymer adhesive to the atmosphere.” According to Eric’s report, WNEP TV, WBRE TV and WYOU TV in central and northeastern Pennsylvania also covered the spill, showing clips of what looked like cobwebs of “sticky glue-like clear polymer clinging to trees in the area.” The Daily Ti mes went on to note, “The sticky material landed on 550 vehicles, 225 buildings and 250 people, including students from nearby Central Mountain Middle School.”"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Roughly a mile away, Central Mountain Middle School had to be evacuated after more than “100 students were sent to local hospitals for severe respiratory problems, skin irritations and flu-like symptoms” caused by the polymer strands - properly known as Polyvinyl Ester Polymer. “The children had breathing problems and complained of skin and eye irritation.” [macon.com; wjactv.com] Interesting that an Ohio newspaper picked up this story. In an email to this author, HAARP inventor Bernard Eastlund responded that two Ohio companies also make polymers that could be sprayed in the air and “tuned” to HAARP’s frequencies to heat the local atmosphere and thereby modify the heat transfers responsible for weather. ’Any idea what these are?\" asked University of Plymouth marine biologist Richard Thompson. As the science magazine Orion went on to report: “About one-third turn out to be natural fibers such as seaweed, another third are plastic, and another third are unknown - meaning that they haven't found a match in their polymer database...or that it's too small for their machine, which analyzes fragments only to twenty microns, slightly thinner than a human hair.” Not good, the editors concluded. “The material still remains a polymer. Polyethylene is not biodegraded in any practical time scale. There is no mechanism in the marine environment to biodegrade that long a molecule.\" [Orion May-June/07] ANGEL HAIR IN KELOWNA Half a continent away, in Kelowna, B.C., David continues to monitor, photograph and log spraying events since 1998. While living in Pritchar d between Kamloops and Chase on the Trans-Canada Highway, he witnessed six different occasions on which heavy spraying dropped 20 to 25-foot lengths of “spider web-like” material “everywhere”. His apple tree streamed with this strange “angel-hair”. So did his fence and vegetable garden. Within weeks of the initial shower of “angel-hair”, black mold appeared on their crops. David says that chemtrails are being laid “almost daily up here in the Okanogan,” especially over Kelowna. Others in the area agree. “The evidence is everywhere,” he insi sts. “But no one is telling us anything!” WORRIED ABOUT WEBS This explanation did not help Robert, who wrote from north central Texas to describe small planes over the Edgecliff area just south of Fort Worth “spreading some type of chemical.” Half an hour later, he received a phone call reporting small planes sighted near Rio Vista also spraying something into the atmosphere “that appeared like spider webs.” His family watched two small jets ra ce from west to east. This was odd because the normal flight pattern out of DFW and Love Field usually pass flying from north to south. “Soon after the two jet planes had passed,” Robert recounts, “there were a lot of what appeared to be spider webs falling to the ground all around us.” Ushering his family inside, Robert called the lo cal sheriff’s office. He was told his call was among many inquiries about what the police were calling, spider webs. When Robert tried to get samples, “the webs turned to dust almost every time I attempted to pick one up and put in a Ziploc bag.”"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"After shooting some VHS video of thicker webs hanging from a relay tower almost in their front yard, when he took off his protective rubber glove, an “orangish-yellow area” on the palm prompted him to seal the glove in a separate bag. “Something I also found strange is that these webs fell unto existing spider webs, but those spiders are not on their webs now,” he explained. “Spider webs do not just turn into powder around here. This was over 25 of them that did this.” Robert “never heard another word” about the small spray planes. “Why isn’t this on the news?” THOSE CRAZY CHEMTRAILS Converted skeptics often become the most ardent chemtrail claimants: The first time I heard about this on Art Bell, I thought it was “crazy”. This is the reason it nags at me: Around 10 years or less, ago, I walked out a back door into a huge cob-web, I had to laugh at myself after I got over the shock of it, for no spider could be that big to weave it. It was at least 6 ft. tall and spanned across several feet also. It was springtime and I had on a jacket, for it was in the middle of the night. I started brushing this off me. It was sticky, but all of a sudden it started dissipating and disappearing. It was so unusual that I have often thought of it. It was on that night or around that time frame that it also rained in one spot only in the middle of this property. I walked back and forth through it in amusement. Maybe a 10’x10’ area, or a little bigger? So both events stayed with me, and I never forgot them. I also remember sitting on my porch and telling my husband that the trails from jets were different now days, they stayed longer in the sky and looked different, he laughed at me. The web and rain was in the middle of the night, the jet trails I refer to I noticed during the day hours. But here is the bottom line: after the two first events I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and later with CFIDS. I am from NW Ohio. I have developed allergies and all kind of problems. "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" TRUCKERS The only people who see almost as much national sky are long-haul truckers. In February 1991, D. wrote... “I was going south on I55 in Missouri, when I started noticing quite a few contrails, forming X’s in the sky but also something else. I’m a trucker, go thru this area quite often, and it’s the first time I saw this and a whole lot of spider web type substance floating down out of the sky. I asked some other drivers via the CB, and they were fascinated by this also. The substance clung all over my truck for several hundred miles. Just wondered if anyone else ever noticed this stuff also. I could give exact dates if needed via my log books.” Another “cobweb” correspondent had his find lab-tested: While driving back to Alaska on November 11, 1999 traveling up I-5 approximately 30 miles north of Sacramento and continuing to Red Bluff, I saw a strange substance falling from or floating in the sky. I noticed strings of fiber-like ma terial of varying lengths, a few inches to many feet long (up to 50), floating at various elevations above the highway. After maybe 10-15 miles of seeing this and noticing some along the shoulders and on the roadway I stopped at a rest area and saw many strings of this attached to trees, signs, and on the lawn. I used a straw and twirled strings of it into a ball about the size of a golf ball and put in a drink cup with lid and put in a zip lock bag. That sample today is about half the original size. These ranged from clusters half the size of my hand, to rope-like diameters ballpoint pen-size, down to spider web size. As I collected the sample some of the thinner strings attacked to my arm and seemed to have a sticky, almost suction type attachment. A burning sensation followed for about 10 minutes after pulling off of arm, even after washing at rest area restroom. No apparent skin irritation appeared. "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"One rope-like strand, about 12-15 feet long was horizontal across the road at about 3 feet and stuck to my vehicle from the far left bumper , up across the headlights and grille and continued up across the hood to the bottom edge of the windshield. This is still visible today, although shrunk to a thin thread, however, it survived approximat ely 1,000 miles of rain and 1,600 miles of snow on the balance of the trip to Anchorage. I took the sample to a lab here in Anchorage and the CEO was amazed at it but said no lab here was capable of analyzing it and referred me to a lab in Colorado. He asked for my name and number (I thought that was strange since he couldn’t help me), and the next morning he called me to say that I should be very careful with this material. He had done some research since I left his lab the day before and said similar substances had been collected in 22 states over the past year and he believed it could have some harmful bacteria associated with it. These filaments finally came into the hands of computer consultant Clifford Carnicom, who examined them under a high-power electronic microscope. Photographs of enlarged fiber sections showing what appear to be blood cells are available on Carnicom’s website. Carnicom describes the artificial fibers as sticky and unusually resilient – unlike any natural fibers. [carnicom.com] But health researchers disputed this description. During three years working with human red blood cells in the Surgical Pathology department of a large teaching hospital in Michigan, Erminia Cassani is very familiar with their appearance under an electron microscope. “I had seen human red blood cells, fixed on slides many times and was familiar with their distinctive appearance,” she writes. “However, when I looked at the photos that Mr. Carnicom posted on his site of what he believed to be red blood cells, I immediately questioned that these were blood cells at all, and if they were, they were not likely human blood cells unless they had been very poorly prepared for the slide and their most distinctive tell-tale features had been lost. Human red blood cells typically present differently than what is seen in these photos.” [moonbowmedia.com] “MYSTERIOUS WEBS DROP FROM THE SKIES” On Decemb er 22, 2000 Oregon’s Wallowa Chieftain reported sightings of “web-like material... falling from the sky.” Some locals thought the filaments were falling “from three military jets that had been flying back and forth in an east-west flight pattern at high altitude.” Two years later, on December 4, 2002, “Moonflowers ” from Santa Monica, California (where else?) “found one of those white fibers floating thru the air that start to disintegrate upon touch. It was three- foot long when it floated by my office window, and about two-inches by the time I got it and brought it inside.” The previous October 8, the Associated Press had reported, “long, floating spider webs bobbing through the skies of Santa Cruz, California.” A University of Wyoming microbiology professor quoted in the AP story attributed the Santa Cruz conundrum to a seasonal migration of hatchling spiders leaving their nests. The professor, who did not return messages left by a local resident at his home and office, told the wire service it was not uncommon to see “dozens” of webs floating across the plains of Wyoming. “But observers here were not reporting dozens of webs,” the resident responded, “but hundreds of thousands.” "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"A few weeks later, on December 21, the Galveston Daily News looked like a bad acid trip under a Stephen Kingish headline: “Mysterious Webs Drop from the Skies”. The story by Michael A. Smith described skies over Galveston County on Friday “literally filled with floating, shimmering strands and fuzzy, luminescent wads that looked a lot like spider webs.” It was around noon when Lorenzo DeLacerta spotted the weird webs while delivering building material to a site a mile east of the San Louis Pass Bridge. “It blew my mind,” DeLacerta said. “I have never seen anything like it before.” Back at the Daily News , a half-dozen skeptical news minds were also being expanded as “people were forced to admit that there was, indeed, under way a slow, steady parade of slender web-like strands, some near the ground, some way up where the airliners ply.” The wacky webs remained visible in the air “for five hours, and poles were left wrapped with the sticky strands and fuzzy wads. So what were they? Offici al sky-web sources seem scarce. A spokesman at the National Weather Service Office in League City said the service had received no reports of flying webs, and that flying webs “weren’t really their thing.” A few weeks later, on D ecember 22, 2002 Oklahoma’s Duncan Banner asked, “Just What Was That White Stuff?” Toni Hopper hopped on the story, asking, “What was that powdery substance covering vehicles throughout Stephens County on Wednesday? Was there a volcano eruption somewhere in the world, dropping ash on Duncan? Maybe it was some unknown chemical sprayed from an airplane as it flew over southern Oklahoma during the early morning hours. Was it acid rain? A terrorist attack? Fairy dust?” Fairy dust seemed the most plausible answer as two library employees asked Hopper to follow them out o the parking lot. “I was astonished to see their cars covered in the powdery substance,” Hopper hyperventilated. “I recalled seeing similar white spots on my vehicle earlier in the day. At the time, I hadn’t given them a second thought. What was that stuff?” At a nearby Wal-Mart, people shopping between 11 p.m. and midnight reported their cars were clean when they entered the store. But when they came out, they found their vehicles covered with white powdery. “Cokie Kifer felt sprinkles on her head when she was walking into Wal-Mart around 11:30 p.m. Tuesday. She assumed it was rain.” A local resident named Danny wrote his own “rain” report the next day: My car, all of my family member’s cars, in cluding a cousin in southeast Oklahoma whose car was covered as well. I don’t know what it was, but I do know it was everywhere. The best way to describe it is kind of like rain, mixed with a little bit of snow, mixed with a little mud. It wasn’t just simple water or dirty rain that ran off of things. It had substance and its appearance and the way it stuck to things just seemed unnatural. That was weird. But Danny found the lack of “news” coverage even more boggling: “It’s amazing that this stuff covered literally thousands and thousands of cars, and obviously many miles, but nothing has been said about it here in Oklahoma in the media.” "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" COBWEBS OVER OZ On August 11, 1998, USA Today reported dozens of residents of Quirindi, Australia “swearing they saw cobwebs fall from the sky” after unidentified aircraft passed overhead. FUNGUS AMONG US Global warming alone cannot account for a new plague of extremely toxic mold spreading through basements and bedrooms across North America. A specia list who conducts environmental sampling of indoor environments later confided that the contaminati on he is seeing is so extensive it’s making all of his team’s hard work remediating infested homes a total waste of time. He wonders if the mystery mold is “dropping out of the sky.” Idaho naturopath Joseph Puleo and investigative medical researcher, Dr. Len Horowitz both remark on how dormant fungus can be “raised from the dead” by exposing it to ultraviolet light. Could fungal spores colonizing the fuel tanks in jet tankers be inadvertently sprayed and activated by high levels of high altitude UV, mutating them into mycotoxins? WHAT HAS CHANGED IN YOUR PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT? Whatever its origins, there is increasing fungus among us. Chemist and botanist Bruce Tanio’s list of symptoms is familiar to many people exposed to chemtrails:  Abdominal pain, gas and bloating, indigestion, heartburn, constipation, diarrhea, gastritis.  Swelling and pain of muscles and/or joints.  Depression, anxiety, sudden mood swings, lack of concentration, drowsiness, fatigue, insomnia, poor memory, headaches, and light-headedness. Tanio is describing what happens when microscopic fungi invade the body. But despite the upsurge of damp-loving fungus in North American homes and offices, it is inconceivable that millions of people would be simultaneously stricken on the same weekend, jamming hospital emergency rooms with acute allergies to long-accruing natural molds. "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" In late 1999 the Idaho Observer observed “Last year, north Idaho naturopaths determined that the upper respiratory infections that would drag on for months were not viral or bacterial but were fungal.” In a recent survey among 179 patients reportedly suffering from CRI:  22% had been to a hospital Emergency Room.  34% exhibited rashes and sores.  Half or more had experienced disorientation and suffered from stiff neck and gastro-intestinal problems.  72% had a sore throat.  78% reported severe headaches.  81% complained of congestion.  Almost everyone surveyed experienced short-term memory loss and difficulty in concentrating.  99% were found to have fungus in their blood. In Healing Codes For A Biological Apocalypse , co-authors Len Horowitz and Joseph Puleo point out: “As fungi grow in the body, their fermentation products further acidify blood and tissues, further taxing the immune system and leaving people more susceptib le to opportunistic infections and even certain cancers.” Fungus can also “morph” into bacterial infections. Puleo has found that low fluctuating body temperatures among “those with the first horrible cough: 95.6, 96.8, 97.4, 97.6 –encourages the formation of bacterial crystal chains as fungal infections flip to bacterial states.” Any good doctor will ask: “What has changed in your environment that could be making you ill?” In almost every case, among the more observant the answer must be: “Chemtrails!” POLYMERS ARE FOREVER “Any idea what these are?” asked University of Plymouth marine biologist Richard Thompson.

When hydrocarbons photodegrade, ultraviolet solar radiation weakens plastic's tensile strength by breaking its long, chainlike polymer molecules into shorter segments. “Plastic is still plastic.

There is no mechanism in the marine environment to biodegrade that long a molecule.” [Orion May-June/07] POLYMER POWER On August 24, 2001 Margie was walking down h er driveway when her path was blocked by an “extremely long strand, shimmering in the sunlight.” Anchored near the top of an oak tree on one side of the driveway, the strand ran to the ground on the opposite side."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"It looked synthetic. Suspecting aerial antecedents, Margie ran back to the house to fetch a pair of microscope slides. After collecting slide samples, two very long pieces remained. Heedless of health hazards, “I grabbed both and they flowed behind me as I walked up the driveway.” When she examined her finds under the microscope, the snipped strands had recoiled into corkscrews and matted together. After teasing it apart, she found that what looked like a single submicron strand was really composed of two or more strands woven together. In November, she wrote to Professor Brian Spratt at the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College, St. Mary’s Hospital, London after reading about his work in a newspaper story. “Dear Professor Brian Spratt,” Margie wrote, “All across the country we are experiencing dense amounts of spider silk, whether natural or synthetic, falling from the sky and draping itself over everything I have collected a number of samples and had sent one off for an Infrared Analysis: The Institute that I sent it to concluded that it was natural spider silk. They compared the Infrared A of my sample to one of known spider silk done by some company in Japan. The two spectrographs were similar but not identical. I got a second opinion from a biology teacher who worked in a lab and he stated twice that he thought the sample was synthetic. He pointed out to me that the spectrographs were not identical. In trying to be rational about all this, I thought to myself, I know they are making synthetic spider silk so it follows that they would use similar components to the real thing. I would assume this would also mean that the spectrographs would also be similar. There are never any spiders seen clinging to these strands from the sky. My sample has a very artificial looking corkscrew quality. I looked at it under my microscope and compared it to known spider webs and there was no similarity. My strands were much thicker and were composed of what appeared to be many submicron strands bundled together. People are reporting sickness after touching these strands. I myself became strangely ill about four days after playing with it under the micr oscope however it could have been coincidence. I would be very much appreciative if you coul d share any knowledge you may have on this subject. I feel that all the different types of experimentation that are taking place at every level of our atmosphere, must be affecting our health and the public has a right to know what they are breathing and also how they are being affected electromagnetically. "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"An intrigued Spratt replied the same day, wondering if she was “referring to experiments that were carried out using spider’s threads to test the survival of bacteria in the environment by the military in the 1960’s and 1970’s.” The idea behind the experiment was to use spider threads as a convenient matrix for bacteria to be sprayed on “and left in the air to see how they survived.” Allaying his questioner’s concerns over a deliberate biowarfare attack, Spratt pointed out. “The silk thread technique is of no use for spreading bacteria as a BW attack as far too few bacteria will stick to them to get any significant exposure.” What about yet another “Open Air” test gone awry? It was Spratt who disclosed the secret military tests of biowarfare agents carried out over Britain between 1961 and 1976. According to one news report, “Prof Spratt’s report focuses on a series of tests by Porton Down on the transmission of biological agents released by sprays from aircraft and ships in Dorset and east Devon. A number of tests used the ‘microthread technique’ where bacteria were attached to the threads of a spider’s web.” Professor Spratt stated that the spiders’ thread tests “posed no conceivable threat to human health”. But he added that other “open air” biowarfare trials “did expose a large number of people to clouds of bacteria that would have been breathed into the lungs.” As we have seen, the bacteria Serratia marscesens and Kledsiella aerogenes were supposedly “attenuated” or killed before being released over jolly olde England. BRUISED BY CHEMTRAILS In early 2001, Pat Edgar sent a Sallisaw update: I’m not fairing well myself. Last Thanksgiving I was sick again and my throat was sore. I noticed a lesion that popped up beside my tongue in the back of my throat. My father and I were in the town of Rochelle, Illinois back in September. Dad had a seizure and ended up in the community hospital. I was telling all the nurses about the contrails and all the Lupus in our area, as they were spraying the hell outside overhead. Complete with the cobwebs coming dow n. They were all most interested. The one nurse told me they are at epidemic stage in their town with people being diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" Chapter 3. PANDEMIC On January 7, 1999, just as I went on Art Bell’s “Coast to Coast” radio show for the first of seven shows with news of something called “chemtrails”, the Philadelphia Daily News was reporting that Emergency Room patients were overflowing into the hallways at West Jersey Hospital in Berlin, New Jersey “as a wave of respiratory illnesses swept the area.” At Northern Westchester County Hospital, \"there was a 24 hour waiting period to get in.\" New York State hospital was so full of patients suffering with the “flu” there was a 24-hour waiting period to get in. The following day, local San Francisco TV stations reported that paramedics were being diverted to help handle swamped ERs. In Manitou, Michigan, Registered Nurse Kim Korte was driving north on M52 when she noticed \"stripes\" in the sky. \"It appeared as if someone took white paint on their fingers and from north to south ran their fingers through the sky. These contrails were evenly spaced and covered the whole sky!\" from east to west. Within 24 hours, Korte became very weak and feverish. After her boyfriend told her that \"many in his family started coming down with the same complaints,\" the RN \"started noticing a lot of my patients and their family members were coming down with these sy mptoms at the same time.\" On checking with her colleagues, the former hospital supervisor learned t hat other nurses and physicians were complaining “of being extremely busy with respiratory diagnoses.\" Two days later, a person in Portland “heard on the radio that the hospitals in Portland are jammed up with people coming in. Plus in Eugene it seems like everyone is coming down with something. And my wife and I saw some rainbow-colored clouds yesterday. We are calling them chem-clouds.” The Oregon Health Science Building, which takes overflow from hospitals, was “overloaded with people with upper respiratory problems.” "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"In Austin, Texas, where Richard Young reported local skies “filled almost daily with trails crossing each other,\" a school nurse told a worried parent that she had seen over 100 sick children in a single day. On January 31, Lake Havasu’s Today’s News Herald reported: “Victims Curse Unnamed Bug, But Can’t Call It The “Flu’”. A local family physician “said Friday that a nameless virus is bringing at least 10 patients a day into her office and driving some into the hospital, but laboratory tests show only a few are suffering from Type A or other identifiable strains of influenza.” After cobweb-like filaments fell in Santa Cruz, one resident collected some, only to see the strange strands disintegrate in a jar. “Hospitals full here in Santa Cruz, and also in Salinas,” she reported. A HAM radio operator in contact with a Richmond resident learned that “a lot of planes flew very low over his home one night which was very unusual and very quickly he and his wife got very ill. When they went to the hospital they “couldn’t get in ‘because it was filled up with people. The MD he saw there hadn’t seen anything like it and was rather upset.” In Castle Rock, Colorado: “The emergency room was filled with people and the prescription line was out the front door; all the cold medicine was on a table in the lobby instead of behind the counter. The woman doctor who was new to the USA told my wi fe, ‘You don’t have to say anything, everyone here has the same thing.’ And she told my wife it was a new bacteria that they can’t fight. She said ‘your sickness will last for up to three months.’” Also in Colorado, following a day of heavy spraying: “Right now, the news is showing that hospitals in our area are turning away patients with flu, asthma, etc. Greeley, Fort Collins hospital is 95% full. Operations are being postponed for lack of beds.” The News and Observer in Raleigh, North Carolina reported that respiratory admissions to Durham regional hospital jumped from the usual 184 patients a day to 247. Ambulance drivers were told that the hospital was not receiving any more patients. In Canada, an epidemic of influenza-like illnesses had broken out in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia, as well as Edmonton, Toronto and other cities across the country. This was not the flu. In Peterborough, Ontario a single hospital emergency room took in 307 acute care patients in one day. Great Britain was particularly hard hit by the mystery pandemic. After lingering co ntrails and cobweb-like fallout were reported and videotaped over London and Birmingham, the BBC reported that refrigerator trucks were being hired as temporary morgues after more than 8,000 people - \" mostly elderly \" - died from pneumonia and other respiratory complications in the last week of December 1998 and the first two weeks of January 1999. [BBC Jan 14/99] MDs reported: -- “This is the worst crisis I have seen.” -- “We have people double- and triple-parked in the ER on stretchers.” -- “Respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses are filling up the beds.” -- “It was sur prising to me how sick they got and how quickly it happened.”"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" -- “The increase in respiratory infections may not be due to the flu.” -- “We know there’s a lot of sickness, but our diagnosis shows that it’s not the flu.” -- “We’ve seen a lot of cases that you can’t typically classify as flu.” These events followed 12 straight weeks of what the Centers for Disease Control called, “ an epidemic of mortality .” Unlike flu, which takes time to spread through a population, these illnesses were appearing virtually overnight in neighborhoods and cities, swamping hospi tal wards. And what the media never remarked on was that incidences of heavy spraying, the characteristic X’s in the sky, the gel falling onto parked cars and windshields and buildings took place always at the same time. And within 24 to 48 hours, we saw these outbreaks of illness. Very little of it was influenza. The outbreak of associated pneumonia and cardiac arrest killed even healthy people in four to five days. Since when is cardiac arrest a symptom of the flu? Most stricken patients tested negative for the flu. When the WHO conducted medical tests of more than 18,000 patients, they found that just 13 in 100 - the national average – tested positive for influenza. What about the rest? One doctor spoke for many when he told the New York Times , “I don’t know what’s causing this.” “What’s going down?” reporters asked the CDC. The outbreak experts answered, “This could be due to some other pathogen?” What pathogen? They didn’t know. Or they weren’t saying. My next appearance with Art Bell was on January 25. Relating these wave of undiagnosed illnesses, I said that when I looked at reported heavy spray days by city, I found an exact correlation with reported spikes in emergency room admissions. And they were continuing. SICK IN SALLISAW In Sallisaw, Oklahoma, restaurant owner Pat Edgar watched “cobwebbing stuff coming down” from the zigzagging jets flying “all day long, line after line, back-and-forth, like furrows in a farm field.” An exasperated Edgar told me, “I wish more people would pay attention. There must’ve been 30 contrails in the sky on a sunny day last October.” Before Edgar sold his restaurant, customers came in complaining of airplanes “flyin’ around all night” over this remote area of Oklahoma. In the morning, they could see “stuff comin’ out of their wings.” Edgar knows four-dozen witnesses who have “come down violently ill, coughin’ up blood for two weeks, or real bad nosebleeds.” Pat Edgar was convinced: “They have a mission. They go back and forth all day. Hey man, I’m talkin’ hundreds of contrails in a day! It’s unbelievable.”"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" On January 24, 1999 Edgar reported that on “Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday of last week, we were really hit hard with the contrails. I mean real bad. Everybody in this town is sick right now – sicker than a damn dog. It’s all in their head and their sinuses, and it hangs in the throat, [sore necks], ears ringing.” Edgar added: “Some customers that frequent our business have stated that they have been to the doctor and the offices have been full of sick people. Same thing at the Indian clinic. People have to wait for hours because the waiting room is full. Some people have reported being on their third and fourth round of antibiotics and they are still ill. We noticed excessive contrails Thursday February 11th.” Edgar became ill the following day, and visited a doctor. From a friend he learned that “Sparks regional hospital had over 500 people seeking medical attention at the emergency room for flu, or flu-like symptoms.” In nearby Gore, Oklahoma, Mary Young was watching TV on January 20, 1999 “about 2:30, quarter to three in the morning,” when she heard a prop plane in the distance, “going around and around.” Ignoring the television, she listened as the plane “kept getting closer and closer and closer.” Finally it went right over the house – so low “the windows rattled, and everything shook. It sounded like sand was hitting the windows.” About 1:30 that afternoon, Young went outside to rake leaves with her cousin. But when she began burning them, “an odor like the smoke bombs kids play with” made them put it out. “The smell was so nasty and so bad it scared me. I told my cousin let’s put it out because it’s hurting my eyes and burning my throat bad.” The full-blooded Cherokee has had a bad cold ever since. She says she “Keeps coughing phlegm that tastes bad. My eyes hurt, my joints hurt. I’m not catchin’ my breath right. I can’t get rid of this cold.” Even worse, Young says, “I’ve had this bad headache. It’s not just a headache. My eyeballs hurt so bad – way in the back – I just wish they would fall out. I’ve got a neighbor lady down the road who keeps talking about headaches all the time. This person had never complained of headaches before.” WILDFIRE In Phoenix, Arizona the January 28, 1999 edition of Arizona Republic reported 237 hospitalizations for bronchial problems in Phoenix that month is – “vs. last year at 160 or so.\" At the same time, hospitals in Portland, Oregon, Marietta, Georgia and Chandler, Arizona – as well as Bakersfield, Santa Cruz, Redding and Salinas, California and many other cities across the U.S. – were jammed with bronchitis, pneumonia and other acute respiratory cases after repeated spraying and cobweb-like fallout was reported in those regions. \"We're getting sprayed real heavily with the contrails,\" a south Pennsylvania resident told ENS. \"It's just total saturation.\" As overfilled Pennsylvania hospitals diverted their overflow respiratory emergencies to other facilities with bed space, another south-central Pennsylvania resident named Deborah Kammerer looked out her window and watched aircraft \"flying and dispersing over the city. It was supposed to be a clear sunny day. It became more overcast as the day progress ed. I observed how the white trails widened out and settled down creating a haze over everything.\" South Florida resident Karen Okenica told ENS she has watched on several occasions as contrails \"crisscrossed or ran parallel to each other. They did not dissipate but got thicker and stayed in the sky for quite a while.\""},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" Okenica says she became frightened after gazing through Nikon binoculars and noticing an all-white jet with \"plumes\" coming from the rear of the plane. In early December, local newspaper reported that Bethesda Memorial and Delray Community hospitals were full and could not accommodate any more patients. In New York City, doctors were calling a flood of respiratory cases an epidemic. \"We have people double- and triple-parked in the ER on stretchers,\" Dr. Elliot Friedman, associate director of emergency medicine at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in Queens, told the New York Times on January 31. \"And there have been times when upwards of 40 people have been admitted but are waiting for someone to be discharged,\" Friedman added. \"This high fever is not typical of other flu’s,\" Dr. Sigurd Ackerman, the president of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center told the New York Times shortly after a TV cameraman panned up to frame lingering \"X\"-shaped contrails over Times-Square. On February 9, one month after I was assigned by the Environment News Service to cover the strange sky patterning, seven Kentucky counties closed all the schools because of sick children. All with flu-type symptoms. In Youngstown, Ohio, a doctor told a patient “the hospitals were filled with patients having severe problems.” By the week ending February 13, 1999, the CDC reported: “Deaths from influenza and pneumonia in a sampling of 122 cities were at epidemic levels for the third consecutive week.” The CDC’s definition of influenza includes “influenza-like illness and/or culture-confirmed influenza.” But lab tests for influenza kept coming up negative. Robert Page, director of the Chemung County Health Department in Elmira, New York, told reporters “We know there’s a lot of sickness, but our diagnosis shows that it’s not the flu.” MDs across America told the New York Times and other newspapers: -- “This is the worst crisis I have seen.” -- “We have people double- and triple-parked in the ER on stretchers.” -- “Respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses are filling up the beds.” -- “It was surprising to me how sick they got and how quickly it happened.” -- “The increase in respiratory infections may not be due to the flu.” -- “We know there’s a lot of sickness, but our diagnosis shows that it’s not the flu.” -- “We’ve seen a lot of cases that you can’t typically classify as flu.” WHAT REGISTERED NURSES SAID After serving two hitches in the Navy, a Registered Nurse for nearly 20 years claimed that Americans “were being used as Guinea pigs for man-made pathogens, quite probably viral, which were designed to produce different symptoms by casting off a series of shells or layers.” Crop-dusters, she noticed, “were spraying at the wrong time of year and over populated areas instead of over the fields.” Another RN was worried when “Omaha announced there was very few cases of flu this winter, and then just a few weeks ago we had an outbreak of flu-like symptoms in the hospitals and where I work.”"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"In Jefferson City, Missouri, after a co-worker helped her count “25 various size contrails which lingered until it was too dark to see,” this correspondent, “received call from nurse at Carroll County Memorial Hospital. She said that a child in ER was being seen for severe respiratory distress, but I didn’t think much of it until later because the nurse was coughing almost uncontrollably during the call.” In Austin, Texas, a resident reported: My wife is a nurse. The local hospitals are begging the nurses to work extra shifts and there are no empty beds in town. About two weeks ago, on a beautiful clear-blue day I made a trip to the store with my six-year-old daughter. In the parking lot when we got out, she pointed to the sky overhead and said, “Look daddy, it’s tic-tac-toe.” I looked up and saw the giant pattern of huge contrails – four of them crossed in a perfect tic-tac-toe. In Pierce County, Washington: When I went to St. Francis Hospital’s emergenc y room for treatment, the number of severely coughing patients there was overwhelming. Nurses and doctors kept saying it was the flu and bronchitis. But when I told my mother about the chemtrail reports over the Internet, a doctor who was treating another woman in the same room with my mother, he suddenly stopped talking to his patient and turned round and looked at me for several seconds rather sternly, then began talking to his patient. I don’t know what that was about really, but I feel like we were both poisoned by something. In another state: My nurse contact... states emphatically that a number of people have died, and are dying this very day, having displayed symptoms of Sarin gas poisoning. All ages, all economic groups, all ethnicities. She was amazed that I, a non-med type, was aware of the “mysterious” symptoms that are killing people. She also stated that it is not one or two a week or month who are dying, but that several people die each day from “flu-like” symptoms just in her hospitals alone, when, in fact, no known flu strains are present. She is an RN who serves at several local hospitals, not just one place. My contact RN is scared of this and isn’t really telling me much more. I believe many meds know exactly what is happening but have been told to keep it quiet. My wife’s eye doctor says, “It is some strange allergy that we don’t know about,” when she went to have blisters checked on her eyelids. Me too. Very painful burning, itching, watering. Horrible headaches, dried blood in noses upon waking in am, muscle weakness and lethargy. I’m ready to move away. In Blaine, Washington, a couple of sky watchers were noticing short contrails that quickly dissipated. “The next thing we see blows our minds. Out of the north comes one humungous, huge jet. This thing was as big as a C5A and it was leaving a contrail miles long. It was painted white all over. Our neighbor, who is a Med Tech at Saint Francis Hospital, says they are jammed packed with people with upper respiratory problems.” "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"In Russell Springs, Kentucky, in a case of sudden fatal illness repeated throughout the USA: “My uncle who has always been healthy, had to go to the hospital because he couldn’t breathe. Well, he died in the hospital. He wasn’t even sick!” On February 15, an Akron resident reported: The trails above our home are lower and wider. How long has this been going on? Our kids are coming up with throat, lung, and upper respiratory ailments that no one can figure out. My husband started with the sore throat last week. Also, my elderly neighbor across the street is now in a hospital on a ventilator. She came down with what they thought was pneumonia, then decided it wasn’t that. It’s a thick lining growing in her lungs, and they do not know how to get rid of it or what it is. A local hospital is leasing an entire floor and it’s growing into a hospital company who specializes in upper-respiratory diseases. That same day, I used the word “chemtrails” for the first time in a follow-up piece for Environment News Service. I may have coined the word that would soon reverberate worldwide. I would soon make that term infamous... Or the other way around.  Hundreds of photographs and videotapes made by ground observers show pairs or larger formations of aircraft spre ading a white mist that thickens and drifts toward the ground. Hundreds of eye-witnesses - including police officers, pilots, military and public health personnel - provided detailed accounts of aerial spraying in characteristic \"X's and east-to-west grid patterns, followed by occluded skies and acute auto- immune reactions and respiratory infections that saw emergency rooms across the nation flooded on heavy “spray days”. \"I keep coughing phlegm that tastes bad,\" 50 year ol d Mary Young of Sallisaw, Oklahoma told ENS after an aircraft sprayed her home at rooftop level one night last January with something that struck the windows like sand. \"My eyes hurt, my joints hurt. I'm not catching' my breath right. I can't get rid of this cold. I've had this bad headache – it's not just a headache – my eyeballs hurt so bad, way in the back. I just wish they would fall out.\" Severe headaches, nosebleeds, shortness of breath, joint pain and a dry hacking cough \"that never leaves\" are being reported by countless Americans jamming hospital Emergency Rooms from coast to coast. While December and January are traditionally bad months for asthma sufferers, patients, doctors and nurses across the USA reported hospital wards filled to overflowing with bronchitis, pneumonia and acute asthma admissions at up to twice normal winter rates. "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" Another morning in late March, observers in Spokane counted 33 chemtrails in a two and half hour period. “We have a police scanner, and we are hearing so many rescue calls for people with breathing difficulties.” In Everett, Washington about the same time: I’ve been noticing the chemtrails for a while now. My 8-year old daughter has been sick this week with a bad upper respiratory infection and her asthma has flared up. My 18-year old son came home sick about three weeks ago with fever, bronchitis and incredible dizziness. Took him to the doctor a couple of days later and all the staff were out very sick with the same thing. One of the office girls fell over from dizziness at the office, nearly hitting her head on the filing cabinet! They had to drive her home because she was too sick to drive. They had to hire outside temporary help just to run the office! They were extremely busy with patients coming in all week very sick with the same symptoms. Same thing with my son. His girlfriend had to drive him home because he was too dizzy and sick. Also – and this really scares me – one of my son’s friend’s sister who is about 22-years old showed up at her parent’s house sprawled out on their couch very sick with 104 fever. The next day she had open sores all inside her mouth with bleeding gums! What awful things are they spraying on us and why? In Chandler, Arizona that spring, one resident reports that after heavy chemtrail activity, “the doctor’s offices and hospitals were totally packed the next week and one of the nurses I spoke to said they didn’t know what was wrong with everyone.” In Norfolk, Virginia, “schools were closed and everyone was sick.” Dr. Robert Saken, a partner in the Soho Pediatrics Group, told the same newspaper, \"It was surprising to me how sick they got and how quickly it happened.\" Montefiore Hospital’s Director of Virology could not explain the sudden epidemic of fatal respiratory cases. It was, Dr. Ilya Spigland, told the New York Times , \"very possible that the increase in respiratory infections may not be due to the flu.\" That same day in Lake Havasu, California, headlines in Today's News Herald announced: \"Victims Curse Unnamed Bug, But Can't Call It The 'Flu'.\" MD Mary Lou Callername told the Herald that a nameless virus was bringing at least 10 patients a day into her office – and driving some into the hospital. “But laboratory tests show only a few are suffering from Type A or other identifiable strains of influenza,\" she said. The previous weekend, after San Francisco resi dents Curtis Schumann noticed \"sky grids in the making\" and Melanie Zucker watched nine contrails woven over Berkeley, local TV stations reported Bay area emergency rooms also inundated with flu-like cases. A Seattle resident reported: \"I've lived here for 26 year s never seeing this number of contrails at once.\" But the sky trails were not condensation trails. Pneumonia patient Lowell Barger told ENS that in the hospital where he was admitted in late January, \"their respiratory ward was overflowing with people, and they were having to put respiratory patients in other wards.\" At that time, a resident of Spokane listening to a police radio scanner reported hearing \"many rescue calls for people with breathing difficulties.\" In Palmyra, New Jersey shortly after Lucreci a Moon watched unusual lingering contrails from a McDonald's, a nurse reported \"many people ill.\" In Las Vegas, Nevada, TV news coverage told of area hospitals being filled with people experiencing breathing problems."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"A resident of Lexington, Kentucky watched helicopters circling the city for several days, flying low overhead at three in the morning. \"The sky looked like a giant checkerboard from the planes crisscrossing it, and the air still had the steel mill smell,\" he reported. \"Everyone here is sick. So far six counties have cl osed all the schools because all the students were sick with 'flu-like symptoms'. I've been having headaches, a sore throat, and an annoying, hacking cough for the past four months and it seems to get worse after I see these aircraft circling the area.\" THE ABC’S OF CHEMTRAILS On March 21, Jane reported: Several of my teacher colleagues and I have been observing the trails here in central Virginia since 1997. They have grown more numerous and occur more often. I personally have been out of school, sick with flu-like symptoms, three times this school year. As I think back over the past few years, I have noted a huge increase in the numbers of students and staff who are absent for illness; respiratory problems are far and away the most frequent. Almost daily on my drive to work from Madis on Heights to Nelson County I can count anywhere from six to 26 trails fanning out over our ski es. The science teacher next door and I have even gotten students into going out back to count the trails. White aircraft can be seen making patterns. PANDEMIC ‘99-’2000 The deadly epidemic of influenza-like Illness over the winter of 1999-2000 was a virtual repeat of the previous winter’s toll. Only this season, the number of acute care patients testing positive for the flu was even lower. Gastrointestinal problems were also linked to chemtrail exposure THE EYES HAVE IT In December 1999 a chemtrail watcher from San Francisco Bay described a new symptom: The last two weeks of non-stop spraying is and has been affecting my eyes. People of all ages around here are having eye problems – from pink eye to blurred and deteriorating vision. I’m trying to compensate with herbs, vitamin C eye drops and other nutritional nervous system support supplements, but it is not enough to evade the effects entirely. I hope they are reversible.

In November 2001, Barbara wrote: Well, they are spraying today across Tallahassee. I went to walk the dogs around 10:30 and, our beautiful sunny day was already being marked by ‘contrails’ – the kind that spread out and become a haze. These are different from the original chemtrails we had last year in that they don’t appear greasy. When they sprayed several weeks back with what appears to be the same stuff, my eyes began itching and burning like mad and my nose bec ame very irritated and runny. Well, now the same thing is happening. Now, there are rain clouds threatening and my head is killing me – all in three hours. This really, really sucks! It’s not nice to fool Mother Nature. I fear we will pay a terrible price for their interference – one day soon. On January 8, 2000 the London Telegraph reported: Refrigerated lorries are once again being used by the National Health Service as temporary morgues in a grim repetition of scenes outside hospitals last winter. Hospitals on Britain’s south coast were forced to store bodies in trailers after nearly 40% of elderly victims of pneumonia contracted from an Influenza-Like Illness died. A spokesman at the Conquest Hospital in Hastings explained why a refrigerated container was brought into use on New Year’s Eve: “We can’t stack bodies up in the corridor.” OH OH, CANADA Nauseous, aching, coughing Canadians also flooded c linics and hospital Emergency Rooms that winter. But this onslaught of fevers were not symptoms of chemtrail poisoning – which results in a lowering of body temperatures. Not flu-like fevers. CALIFORNIA’S WINTER “FLU” On Decemb er 18, 1999 the Associated Press reported, “A nasty strain of the flu is flooding Southern California hospitals with haggard patients, straining emergency rooms and forcing some medical centers to send the sick elsewhere.” "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" At a hospital northwest of Los Angeles, patients suffering acute upper respiratory distress rocketed the emergency admissions count by 30 to 40 patients per day for 18 consecutive days. “I don’t think anybody really knows what’s causing it. Maybe it’s a new strain,” said Silvia Mieure, nursing supervisor at Northridge Hospital Medical Center. According to one eyewitness, “Unbelievable ch emtrail sprayings” took place December 4 th and 5 th (1999) over Los Angeles and Orange County involving “ dozens of trails sprayed” from approximately 9:00 am to noon – “until the entire sky was covered.” John Quinn corroborated many other California chemtrail reports, noting, “Full-on inundation of California skies with a tremendous number of jet contrails occurred both prior to and during the outbreak of this unknown, horrendous ‘flu.’” In nearby Nevada, more reports came in from “C oast-To-Coast” host Art Bell’s hometown of Pahrump during December 1999: Contrails [chemtrails] have been extremely heavy ov er Pahrump, NV for weeks also. I have been too ill as has my family to do much more than stay alive. Husband is barely making it to work, falling asleep immediately upon getting home. Kids have been sick. Doctor tested me last Thursday for some ‘immune compromise’. I had thrush in mouth real bad, so much pain in joints I have not been able to work over one year. Found a photo of my girls, maybe three years old, playing on the beach in Santa Monica and was shocked to notice the sky was filled with contrails.” Texas turned toxic, too: Christmas Day in Houston was most remarkable for the massive chemical spraying that begin near dawn over the outer western suburbs. We drove through an area that revealed a great view of the sky for about 25 miles in all directions. A little math revealed that in only five hours or so, the three or four aerial tankers working that morning had managed to saturate an area of about 1,500 square miles! Worse was driving by so many homes with ch ildren outside, playing with new Christmas toys and never looking up to notice the bizarre appea rance of the sky above them. I wondered how many had recently been diagnosed with asthma. About two weeks ago I was the guest of a radio program in Asheville, NC, where spraying has been heavy all year. As luck would have it, three or four aircraft were engaged in spray operations that very morning, and listeners were calling in frequently to tell their neighbors to get their lazy butts outside to see what everyone was talking about. After about 25 minutes of this, callers reported that all three aircraft had turned off their pumps and were “high-tailin’ it outta here.” On the second day of Year 2000, a Long Island woman was coughing blood: Still sick here. Even my houseguest and his friend took ill. Steve is not well yet. I have a patchy rash and feel very weak. Trouble breathing and I am experiencing a lack of balance. I packed a suitcase just in case I have to go to the hospital. I cannot eat, as all food tastes very odd to me. I do not even feel like drinking, but am forcing water and juice. My animals are ill. Two of my cats got sick today. One of my goats looks bad, too. Emergency rooms are filling up quickly here. When Steve was taken to the hospital last week, patients were lying in stretchers in the aisles. Another coughing correspondent correlates:"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" If I had any doubt that there was such a thing as “chemtrails” and that they were poisoning the public, it was removed after returning from our recent road trip to Las Vegas. Upon our return from the town that never sleeps, my email “in” box had an unsolicited message from somebody with a report from December 4, 1999. The email report stated that on the Las Vegas Channel 8 evening news every emergency room in the area was overcrowded with people suffering from upper respiratory infections. The story was rather in-depth for a TV news segment – a little over a minute long. The anonymous Las Vegas resident stated that he has witnessed many chemtrails over Las Vegas over the last month and that many others have also witnessed the phenomenon. The news story was eerily consistent with what we experienced in our travels through Nevada with our eventual arrival in Las Vegas. [We] entered Nevada in the early morning of December 2. We traveled south all day long through the sparsely populated Nevada high country of Interstate 93. Having seen contrails in the skies above north Idaho almost daily since last spring, we were habitually looking up as we drove toward Las Vegas. We had noticed that the sparsely populated areas in Nevada had brilliantly clear blue skies and that occasional airplanes left vapor trails that dissipated normally. But as soon as we neared Las Vegas, the skies directly above the city recorded a smoky brownish gray grid pattern of airplane traffic. We watched what appeared to be a military C-135 transport spraying something over the populated areas over Las Vegas and then shut off whatever was being sprayed. When the plane was no longer directly over Las Vegas it continued flying, leaving a vapor trail that dissipated normally. As heavy spraying continued over Sedona, residents felt as if they were under sustained aerial attack. Diane wrote: The skies are so saturated here lately it’s becoming hard to understand where the real air might be. I’ve never seen such a thick stew and frequent spew. Lately I am detectably succumbing to whatever this is: definite and rather alarming periods of mental confusion, muscle weakness, inflamed lymph system, and the primary ongoing probl em of super- (un)natural fatigue. Before, I was more impersonally outraged than personally affected. Now my deteriorating personal condition is adding a whole new fear and loathing to the equation. She passed out and was rushed to hospital: I don’t know what happened to me yesterday, but I ended up in the emergency room. On the way to lunch with a friend, not feeling well anyway, I was suddenly overcome with intense nausea and began to black out. Three people tried six times to find a vein for intravenous rehydration with no success. I heard them say, “Huh, I never saw this before.” This was not comforting. You and I know that this is not the flu in the ordinary sense. I’ve had degrees of fever and chills for a very long time, but the last two weeks of heavy heavy spraying here have finally knocked me over. I’m taking some sort of (Yeah I know) powerful antibiotic which I am assured will do nothing whatsoever for getting rid of the virus, but will prevent me from sliding into pneumonia and exiti ng this lunatic asylum prematurely. I never thought I would be a victim of this, but here we are. What is to be done? Spraying here is intense again today. DO YOU MIND? Other symptoms now associated with chemtrails include disorientation, depressi on, inexplicable anxiety, memory loss, and an inability to concentrate."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" The Wallaces have been sick and lethargic ever since being sprayed by aircraft flying at high and extremely low altitudes. Echoing many other reports across the USA, William Wallace reports that residents of Coleville, Washington and the su rrounding heavily sprayed area have been experiencing headaches so excruciating “your eyeballs hurt.” Despite their isolation in a remote mountainous area of eastern Washington, Wallace’s wife Ann has been newly diagnosed with Epstein-Barr. “Her heart is bothering her,” a worried William says, “and her white blood cell count is very low, and she remains in terrible pain, almost too weak to move. “Whatever they’re dumping on us does something to your mind,” Wallace insists. Like the veterans of a distant desert war, some chemtrail-contaminated people like Wallace –who have never served in the military – now forget simple errands. When I asked William Wallace for directions, he couldn’t even remember the name of the town closest to his own. Mental muddling is a common chemtrail complaint. After a heavy spray week in Santa Fe this fall, a waitress and her co-workers found it “hard to think, hard to put two thoughts together.” Everyone, she said, felt “spaced out, wavy, woozy – like coming ashore after being on a boat.” It felt like the onset of flu. But the spraying stopped and the strange symptoms went away the next day. In mid-September, 1999 a chemtrailed Californian wrote: Will, they are really doing their job in a big wa y – chemtrail overlords, that is. My IQ has been rated at 180 IQ. I feel as if I’m functioning like a 12 yr. old. Also feel close to physical exhaustion. The feeling down here is rather scary. Cats nervous, ducks nervous. I’m on guard. That’s the best way I can describe it. Cats sticking very close. We sit up at night, outside, and wonder. TWINGES AND TWITCHES This reporter experienced severe pain in my left elbow after heavy chemtrail spraying over my remote hillside home following my first appearance on Art Bell’s radio show. Another writer was “very excited to see the ‘tennis elbow’ and wrist pain symptoms, which I noticed personally but did not really think of as a flu symptom.” Following heavy chemtrail spraying over Canada’s west coast, I also experienced purple bruising on my upper arms – indicative of burst platelets. As well as intense vertigo and sudden exhaustion so extreme I could hardly stagger from my car into the house. Surmounting stairs was like ascending Everest. I also experienced an annoying and worrisome twitch ing left eyelid following heavy chemtrail spraying over my relocated residence off Canada’s west coast. Like the pain in my elbow, this symptom of neurotoxin exposure even tually went away. Sore joints and skin inflammations appear to be characteristic of the 1999-2000 epidemics: A massage therapist had the flu and one of the symptoms was with the acute wrist pain, like glass broken in the joint. I also had the flu and briefly had the same symptom of the wrist and also tendonitis pain in the tennis and golfer elbow area, infections on the skin, red inflamed, wounds on the hands, and two boil-like pimples on the face next to the mouth, and a boil-like pimple on the chest red and itchy, all right-sided. Another correspondent encountered symptoms felt by many North Americans: Depression, hopelessness, overwhelm, frustration, unable to find a remedy that fit. Chill would drive me to bed and then would sleep for three hours and then had to force myself to wake up. Periodic, the symptoms would all get better and 24 or so hours later it was all back. Felt not myself for weeks, vision slightly skew ed, head slightly dizzy, mind not clear."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" And this is spooky because I am experiencing this, and a significant percentage of chemtrail sufferers are also reporting this unusual symptom... Both me and my wife, my left eye has been twitching disturbingly, hard to look at something at times, never had this or the pimple on the face symptom before. Wife’s left eye twitching in the same area. Her lower lid almost spasms to the point of having to hold it. BLOODY NOSES Gushing nosebleeds are a common chemtrail symptom. In mid-January, 2000, Vicki posted this account on her Oklahoma website: On Monday of this week, the chemfog rolled in. I had lots of errands to do and was outside for about 3-4 hours. I had sneezed 2 or 3 times but no big deal. About 10 minutes after I got home, both sides of my nose started gushing blood. I don’t get nosebleeds, and this wasn’t the minor kind. This was the posterior kind – no matter if I was leaning forward, or standing, blood was gushing down my throat. I would put a tissue to my nose with my left hand, and by the time I reached for another tissue with my right hand, the tissue in my left hand was completely soaked with blood. I had to use a towel. If you’ve ever had a bad head cold where you feel the mucous bubbling around in your head and in your ears, this is what it felt like, only it wasn’t mucous, it was blood. I’m not squeamish and am usually very calm when there’s an injury. But I must admit, this freaked me out. When the bleeding finally stopped after about 20 minutes, we noticed that my ears were bright red and they felt like they were on fire. All day yesterday it felt like every sinus pass age in my head was on fire and my eyeballs ached. Every joint in my body was sore and I was ex tremely cranky. Every footfall resounded in my head. Suffice it to say, I now believe there is something going on here more sinister than weather modification. In another incident in the fall of 2000, while driving to the radio station, a talk show host suddenly started gushing blood from his nose. At the radio station, he discovered that two office workers also had nosebleeds. So the talk jockey asked his listeners to call in with their most notorious nosebleed stories. A listener described what happened next: “Most of the calls were, surprisingly, about people who had nosebleeds that afternoon. Alot of them had never had one before and were wondering what could have caused it. Some of them, including the talk show host, also had flu-like symptoms. The host usually tries to make a joke out of everything, but he had a difficult time trying to lighten up the show on this particular afternoon.” As William Wallace related, after being sprayed by a low-flying Intruder-type jet while plowing a field in Washington State: “They are spraying something deliberately. I must’ve had 15 nosebleeds last summer. I’d blow my nose and it would bleed. And I never had that before. I’d bend over planting and it would bleed.” Wallace was not tested. But blood from his wife Ann was later lab-tested and found to have dangerously low blood platelet counts. According to one medical lab: “When platelets are low, microscopic vessels become weak and rupture easily. Patients can have spontaneous nosebleeds.” Platelets are produced in the bone marrow by large ce lls called megakaryocytes. A normal platelet count is 130,000 to 400,000. The bone marrow is capable of increasing the production of platelets up to 6 to 8-times normal, if necessary."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" Platelet production can plunge when antibodies are triggered, destroying platelets in the marrow before they can be released into the blood. When the immune system attacks the body’s platelets, bright purple and red bruise-like spots can appear on the skin. Some chemtrail sickness sufferers will immediately recognize this symptom. Low platelet counts are associated with mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr) – often reported in the wake of heavy spraying. A mother whose white blood (platelet) count was down by half reported: I live in a rural community and most of these people work outside and have their whole lives and have never experienced these kind of symptoms till the contrails started showing up last fall. We live in no flight area, yet it is not uncommon for us to see up to 50 contrails a day, flying the multiple line pattern and the X pattern. Not just the usual sicknesses, ones that docto rs have no idea what is causing them and have no cure for. We had two children die here from totally unexplained illnesses when the contrails were flying all the time. We have dead birds in our yards, we have dead animals. The livestock are sick. Suddenly last winter my nine year-old daughter came down with an asthma problem out of the blue. My uncle died of respiratory problems, again, out of the blue. Then just a couple of weeks ago my sixteen-year-old daughter started having panic attacks, just sitting at the computer it started and went on for a week till I took her to the doctor and he gave her Xanax. Yes, indeed. Take this pill. All the symptoms you are suffering are really all in your head. A Registered Nurse working for a home health care service travelled extensively. She reported: Approximately December 16th or the 17th, while traveling north, I could see ‘stripes’ in the sky. It appeared as if someone took white paint on their fingers and from north to south ran their fingers through the sky. These contrails were evenly spaced and covered the whole sky! They covered it completely! When I was finished with the next visit, approximately 45 minutes, I came out of the house and found the whole sky was white. There was no definition in cloud pattern. Within the 24 hours I became very weak, feverish, and my asthma began to act up. I didn’t think too much about it, until my boyfriend told me that many in his family started coming down with the same complaints. I also started noticing a lot of my patients and their family members were coming down with these symptoms at the same time. In our area we have one main hospital which I was the Supervisor of for four years. I worked there a total of six years. I stay in close contact with the nurses and physicians and am planning on investigating into this more. At that time, they complained of being extremely busy with respiratory diagnoses. In Russell Springs, Kentucky, in a case of sudden fatal illness repeated throughout the USA: “My uncle who has always been healthy, had to go to the hospital because he couldn’t breathe. Well, he died in the hospital. He wasn’t even sick!” Another report among many similar incidents: Mrs. Betty Marlin and Mrs. Pricilla Cisneros – suddenly deceased. Both died suddenly of pneumonia, which overtook them so fast that family members did not even have time to get their families together. Mrs. Marlin was admitted to the hospital on Friday afternoon. Her lips were already blue and her lungs were full of fluid. By Sunday morning, she was gone. And this from Utah:"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"We’ve had an unusually mild winter here in Utah. Wa rm sunny days, dry climate. Not the sort of weather you would associate with such a widespread pneumonia epidemic. Within weeks of each other, the mothers of two of my closest friends passed away. Both died of a pneumonia that overtook them so quickly that there was no time to even prepare family members. On one of the local news channels, there was a special report about the hospitals in Provo, Utah being filled to capacity with cases of pneumonia. In early 2001, Pat Edgar sent a Sallisaw update: I’m not fairin g well myself. Last Thanksgiving I was sick again and my throat was sore. I noticed a lesion that popped up beside my tongue in the back of my throat. My father and I were in the town of Rochelle, Illinois back in September. Dad had a seizure and ended up in the community hospital. I was telling all the nurses about the contrails and all the Lupus in our area, as they were spraying the hell outside overhead. Complete with the cobwebs coming down. They were all most interested. The one nurse told me they are at epidemic stage in their town with people being diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. Mindy from Arkansas might be describing a chemical attack: I am a preschool teacher in Birmingham and we are experiencing a “flu” outbreak like I haven’t seen before. Many of our children have been out sick. And many, many parents of children in our school were sick over this past weekend. What caught my attention was that Monday of this week I saw (for the first time) a white airplane flying high in the sky (approx. 7:45 a.m.) with a thick white trail behind it. It was flying up in the sky and had a line that stretched as far behind it as I could see. I called to my six-year-old son to come out and look (we had just arrived at school) and he said, “Cool! A rocket!” As I was walking to the other building, I noticed other trails pointing in different directions. (After the fact, I realize it was probably an X or crisscross.) Later that same afternoon, I began coughing with a bronchitis type cough. The next morning I remember joking with a parent about it because I’ve never gotten a cough that just started in full-force like that before – usually I get “sick” first. The cough just seemed to appear. I was feeling great before. BIO-WAR? Indications of a concerted cover-up came on February 11, when a retired Southern Baptist preacher named Everett Burton finally succeeded in reaching C- span. After voicing his opinion on the Clinton impeachment trial, this former minister told Americans to get a copy of the Constitution and read it to realize what they have lost. Rev. Burton then advised viewers not to take his word for what was happening in the United States, but to \"just look up in the skies as the planes regularly spray contrails across the skies, spraying people and making them ill.\" "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"At this point, Rev. Burton was abruptly cut off. The screen flipped from C-span to the Tennessee state seal and remained silent for several minutes before resuming its coverage of the Clinton distraction. Was the aerial spraying simultaneously reported over so many cities on both sides of the Atlantic aimed at weather modification – or population modification? In the absence of official explanations, the Internet was already rife with speculation. Were chemtrails a deliberate bio-warfare attack? I wondered what would be the purpose of randomly sickening the very people who make everyday society function? I knew from extensive research carri ed out during my investigation into the origins of Gulf War Illness for my book, Bringing The War Home that it was yet not feasible to launch bio-warfare attacks from high altitudes, where intense solar radiation would sterilize pathogens even before they were further degraded by rainfall and rendered ineffective by widespread dispersion. And yet... In the twisted logic of the bio-weaponeers, the difficulty of launching a high- altitude bio-attack capable of “taking” out an entire city – or nation – might be driving further experimentation using bio-war “simulants” to test the dispersal patterns and effectiveness of high-altitude drops. There was plenty of pattern and precedent to su ggest that clandestine bio- warfare experiments were routinely practiced on the American public without their informed consent. Two congressional investigations in 1977 and 1994, as well as recently declassified British defense documents, detail 50 years of \"open air\" testing employing naval vessels and spray-equipped air force planes to spread biological warfare stimulants on hundreds of cities across the Canada, the UK and the USA. As recently as 1997, 61 separate tests secretly sprayed the residents of Minneapolis with germ warfare simulants over a period of several months. Respiratory illness increased sharply in the sprayed areas. Even as atomic detonations were being conducted in the open air upwind of American cities, Washington’s airborne bio-warfare tests began in earnest in 1957 and 1958, when cargo planes crisscrossed the country, spraying highly toxic zinc cadmium sulfide chemicals. A U.S. Army report states that \"virtually, the whole country of the United States was covered with this material.\" Professor Leonard Cole testified at the first congressional investigation into these nationwide bio- warfare experiments. The author of Clouds of Secrecy told state representatives how... \"The plane would take off from the Canadian border, and fly slowly down to the Gulf of Mexico. These materials would be spread, and were found to be landing as far away as New York State. So, you know that, as the air would push the zinc cadmium particles around, most of the people who were residents of the United States during that time were inhaling at least some of the zinc cadmium sulfide. And the cadmium in that compound was clearly known then to be toxic, even in small amounts.\" In the Sixties and Seventies, British germ-warfare trials spread Bacillus globigii and E. coli from a ship, as well as from a Canberra jet bomber converted wi th stainless steel tanks and sprayers. For people with breathing problems or poor immune systems, these bacteria can cause septicemia, fever, pneumonia and severe chest infections. Congress also learned how in 1956 U.S. military personnel released mosquitoes infected with Yellow Fever over Savannah, Georgia and Avon Park, Flori da. Following each test, Army agents posing as public health officials tested victims for the effective spread of this disease. "},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" In 1966, U.S. Army bio-weaponeers dispensed Bacillus subtilis variant Niger throughout the New York City subway system. More than a million civilia ns were exposed when army scientists dropped light bulbs filled with the bacteria onto ventilation grates. Similar bio-warfare canisters were released in London subways. 1977 Senate hearings found that 239 populated areas in the USA were deliberately contaminated with biological agents between 1949 and 1969. Some of cities hit included San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Key West, Panama City, Minneapolis, and St. Louis. [Wall street Journal Oct 22/01] The secret tests were illegal. U.S. Code Title 50, Section 1520 gives the Secretary of Defense authority to conduct “research” tests or experiments \"involving the use of a chemical agent or biological agent on a civilian population.\" This law also stipulates that bio-warfare tests can be carried out on Americans only if Congress is notified 30 days in advance, and \"only if informed consent to the testing was obtained from each human subject in advance of the testing on that subject.\" No one who was alive at the time could recall being notified for their permission to become a bio-warfare test subject. How could these bio-warfare simulants be \"harmless\" when they were intended to sicken entire populations to the point where people seeking medical attention could be tracked? This didn’t track, either. Such “tests” were typically conducted sporadically over a few cities and then evaluated. There was no need for daily “testing” over many regions of the continent. And in any case, there weren’t enough bio-warfare agents or simulants in world arsenals to fill fleets of tanker planes. Perhaps, I speculated, this outbreak of respirator y-related illnesses were an “unintended consequence” a secret weather modification program. If so, once the perpetrators became aware of such widespread and continuing “collateral damage” – and continued the spray program regardless – any resulting injuries and deaths became deliberate. It was not a happy thought. But more than 200,000 sickened Gulf War soldiers in the United States alone had already been sacrificed on the same altar of secrecy and expediency. Was that war now coming home? TAKING A FLIER I later penned a “Welcome To The Chemtrails Section” on my website: If you are new to chemtrails, a brief introduction is in order. A professional working journalist for more than 30 years, I first reported on chemtrails for the Environment News Service in the winter of 1997. Since then, thousands of websites have appeared claiming various theories and agendas behind a phenomenon witnessed in the skies over 14 allied nations. Presenting no evidence to back their claims, some sites claim this is a clandestine bio-warfare operation aimed at “culling” the human population so that only the elite inherit a ruined Earth. When confronted by the obvious lack of corpses piled high in the streets, these claimants quickly shift gears, stating that chemtrails comprise Part “A” of a binary bio-weapon that will be activated later by special radio frequencies, causing everyone not ‘specially inoculated to instantly drop dead. When asked for documentation or lab tests to back up their assertions, the cull contingent falls silent. Ignoring the illogic inherent in dispersing low concentrations of organisms – or medicine - randomly at sunlight-killing altitudes, other sites state that chemtrails are an aerial vaccine delivered to save us from terrorists who can genetically alter their biological cocktails overnight, instantly nullifying all existing vaccines. The fact that there are not enough vaccines or bio-warfare agents on the planet to fill hundreds of tanker planes spraying daily for more than five years does not bother irresponsible Internet"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"hysterics, who peer through microscopes without medi cal qualifications, or point to lint trapped in home air filters as “proof” of their contradictory contentions. I even receive calls from people who come away convinced I am part of a cover-up because I will not “admit” that ET space aliens are flying the tanker planes! None of this helps the credibility of chemtrails - or the many conscientious re searchers who have spent years delving into this mystery while enduring much ridicule, continuous expense and no pay. It is easy to make fun of what we don’t understand—and fear. During my time in Kuwait as a member of a three-man environmental emergency response team, with oil raining out of a perpetual “oilcast” onto windshields and Arab garb, I learned that denial is the strongest human propensity. It is also, in this time of murder ous government perfidy and runaway global warming, a species-limiting activity. Having researched and written two books dealing with bio-warfare - Scorched Earth and Bringing The War Home – I can state for the record that while chemtrails are apparently making many people sick and could even be linked to some deaths, they are not deliberate bio-warfare. On February 18, and again on March 17, 1999 I went back on-air with Art Bell. Before he eventually left the air, we would do six shows on chemtrails toget her. All were wildly popular. A TIME magazine cover story on Art Bell later called me his most popular guest. “Chemtrails” was now common currency among more than 15 million listeners and readers. But how could anyone be sure they weren’t really seeing normal contrails? "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" Chapter 4. CONTRAILS OR CHEMTRAILS? Somewhere on Earth, every second of every day and night, commercial airliners commences their take- off runs. With the runway speeding past and four huge jet engines howling at take-off thrust, a 747 gulps one gallon of fuel every second during take-off and initial climb-out. Just five minutes into an eight-hour flight, the jumbo jetliner will have burned the day’s oxygen production of a 44,000-acre rainforest. Creatures of another ocean, jets prefer to cruise in the cold, airless reaches of the stratosphere 11 kilometers above the Earth. Pollutants linger here. By the time a New York-departed 747 descends into Ireland, some 239,000 pounds of “Jet A” will have been spewed out its exhaust pipes as soot, greenhouse gases and ozone-destroying chemicals. It may even form contrails. Like breath exhaled on a cold winter day, contrails form in the frigid upper atmosphere when hot, moist engine exhaust momentarily condenses stratospheric ice crystals into thin wispy trails. “Water in its liquid state is a normal component of jet exhaust and when the airplane is high enough (the higher you go the colder it gets) it is cold enough to flash freeze that water. The water goes from liquid to ice. The ice ‘sparkles’ when sunlight hits it and we see a ‘white’ contrail,” an atmospheric expert named Jeremy wrote me. But high in the stratosphere, air pressure is so low these ice crystals “subduct” – switching directly to vapor before reverting to a liquid state. This scientist suggested: “A simple layman’s observation technique would be to hold up a ‘fist’ at arm’s length. A normal contrail disappears behind your outstretched fist as the ice ‘subducts’ to an invisible vapor. Generally, anything that persists longer is not a normal contrail.” "},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Another big point, he added: “The altitudes at which planes must be flying to flash freeze the water in their exhausts are so high that you can barely see the plane. So, if a plane is larger than the fly-speck you see at one end of your fist, it’s very likely flying too low for water to flash freeze. Therefore, it’s ‘probably’ not a normal contrail.” Both the “formation” and “persistence” of a norma l contrail will be affected by daily changes in temperature, humidity and air-pressure at high altitudes. But contrails are anything but harmless. Cloud cover has increased by 5% nationwide – and more than 20% in the busiest air corridors over the United State – since the jet age took off four decades ago. During those years, atmospheric scientists calculate that “normal” jet contrails added at least one-third of the warming we’re now experiencing. The problem of artificial overcasts and adverse atmospheric chemical reactions in the wake of jet airliners first appeared on official radars during the 1970s. At that time, governments of advanced nations started shoveling money, scientists and technology at atmospheric and cloud physics. Atmospheric studies such as SUCCESS, TARFOX and more recent offshoots employed a variety of aircraft – from airliner-size jets to executive Cessna Citations sighted dispensing chemtrails over Arizona and Ohio - to spray small amounts of atmospheric “tracers” that can be tracked by satellite, laser radar and other sophisticated sensors equipped to measure at mospheric responses to pollutants produced by us. The SONEX project, for example, looked at the interactions of the ozone layer and the nitrogen oxide emitted in large quantities by je t exhausts. NASA also cooperated with the European Union’s project POLINAT, which flew research aircraft in the North Atlantic Flight Corridor to correlate actual measurements of aircraft pollution with computer models. AIR BUST An early Airbus Industries study on the atmospheric impacts of jetliners flyin g nearly nose-to-tail in the most heavily traveled trans-oceanic and trans- continental air corridors jolted governments and industry. Airbus learned that while contrails occurred too high to trap heat like lower level clouds, the condensation trails left by jetliners and military aircraft high in the stratosphere were helping to chew Earth’s protective ozone shield into record-breaking shreds. The delaminating ozone layer was also contributing to greenhouse warming on the ground. In their “Environmental Protection” report, Airbus warned that nitrogen oxides are the most worrisome of jet engine emissions. They are also jets’ biggest pollutant. Since the early 1970s, jet engine manufacturers had cut carbon emissions by 70%. Hotter-burning jet turbines were flying more miles can be flown on the same amount of fuel. But the higher temperatures needed to boost fuel combustion and efficiency al so produce much more ozone-destroying NOx. And despite stunning gains in fuel efficiency, between 1977 and 1988 rising passenger volumes fueled a 37% increase in commercial aviation fuel consumption. Dr. Colin Johnson of the UK Atomic Energy Authority found that the NOx exhaled by high-flying jets cause 30-times more atmospheric warming than nitrogen oxides emitted at ground level. "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Nitrogen oxide released by aircraft in the lower atmosphere forms a photochemical smog, which traps heat and attacks human respiratory systems. As jets climb higher into the stratosphere, their NOx emissions begin eating ozone. As the ozone layer disintegrates, more solar radiation streams through to fry trees, crops, people and animals. In addition to nitrous oxides, high-flying jets trail smoke, carbon dioxide and unburned hydrocarbons. These emissions linger in the clear, cold, calm of the stratosphere, modifying Earth’s atmosphere 100- times longer than when released near the ground. And the nitrogen oxide particulates found in “harmless” high-altitude contrails retain 200-times more atmospheric heat than CO 2 . Even though aircraft account for only 3% of all human-produced NOx emissions, Dr. Johnson claimed they contribute as much to global warming as all car emissions worldwide. Unfortunately, Airbus noted, “there is no alternative to our atmosphere.” This major European manufacturer of commercial jets further warned that the resulting “irreversible” climatic modification “would weaken the world economy enough to seriously jeopardize... the international competitiveness of industrial firms.” This was not good news for nations already experienci ng successive years of freak storms and record- breaking temperatures. TOO HOT FOR CONTRAILS Driven by th e twin imperatives of the Pentagon’s need to stop drawing arrows in the sky to otherwise “stealthy” aircraft and commercial airlines faced with government- imposed environmental taxes and fines, the drive to understand and control contrails continues to receive major funding and attention. Contrails cannot form behind aircraft unless the atmosphere is very cold. As NASA explains : “Contrails only form at very high altitudes (usually above 8 kilometers) where the air is extremely cold (less than -70°F).” (graph Celsius) NASA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also agree that a relative humidity of 70% or higher is necessary for clouds and contrails to form. “If the air is very dry, contrails do not form behind airplanes,” NOAA states. Taking NASA’s expertise as contrail catechism, chemtrail investigator Clifford Carnicom correlated atmospheric readings by NASA’s Climate Diagnostics Center of with 21 days of heavy “chemtrail” gridding over Santa Fe from January 1999 to August 1999. At altitudes where persistent white plumes crisscrossed the usually cloudless New Mexico sky, Carnicom found 30% humidity. Or less. "},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"In a region known for big blue skies 360 days of t he year, most desert days once began with typically clear skies. But as USAF “Weather Force” tanker planes were photographed laying chemical tails in extensive grid patterns and characteristic satellite-marking X’s, Carnicom and other New Mexico skywatchers saw the planes creating artificial cirrus cloud layers that turned once clear skies into a milky haze.  “One would have expected these days to be generally clear at that altitude,” Carnicom commented. “But that was not the case.” STEAD HAM COMPARES CONTRAILS AND CHEMTRAILS More proof that chemtrails are not contrails came from a sky plume study conducted by Mark Steadham in the winter of 2000. As Steadham stated, “ This report is the result of research into the science of contrail formation and an analysis by observation and measurement of contrail persistence. This research was inspired by the claims of an unnatural type of trail known as Chemtrails as an attempt to detect such trails.” Steadham simply matched his observations of heavy aircraft overflying Houston’s busy flight corridor to Flight Explorer. This subscription flight data service from the FAA identifies shows all aircraft flying on Instrument Flight Plans over the United States by type aircraft, location, altitude, heading and airspeed. Since military flights are omitted by Flight Explorer, Steadham confirmed the military aircraft he was seeing by their “unidentified” label. For four months, Steadham recorded meticulous data on flights over Houston, Texas. The warmest temperature at which a contrail was observed was -41°C. This agrees with the -40°C textbook threshold value for contrail formation. Among other data, Mark Steadham recorded the “persistence” of aircraft trails, measured in seconds. The results were remarkable. 96% of the contrails observed were in the 5-20 second range; 80% persisted for 30- seconds or less. One airliner contrail lasted for 25 minutes. Another persisted for five hours. They were exceptions. These examples tell Steadham’s chemtale: 12/02/00 11:00 am ~4-8 hrs. (military) 11:45 am ~2 minutes (commercial) 12:00 noon ~2 minutes 10 sec.

But the average for all military flights recorded at comparable altitudes in the same airspace and timeframe was 6.25 hours. This was an enormous difference! The persistent plumes left by these military aircraft were lasting 1,500-times longer than their commercial counterparts. The persistent plumes always emanated from KC-135 and the KC-10 aerial refueling tankers. Commercial aircraft tallied in the Houston study included the Boeing 752, Boeing 757, Airbus, DC87, Boeing 733, Learjet and MD80 flown by Southwest, Air Canada, Northwest, American, AeroMexico and Federal Express. While Flight Explorer does not provide altitudes for unidentified military aircraft, the FAA states that “heavy” military aircraft usually transit U.S. commercial airspace around 30,000 feet to ensure safe separation from airliners flying at 35,000 to 39,000 feet. The Air Force confirms that its tankers do not fly at contrail forming altitudes in order to reduce hook-up times for fuel hungry fighters. With air temperatures dropping 3° every 3,000 feet, the higher-flying airliners should have been leaving longer-duration contrails. Steadham’s study found just the opposite! Basic atmospheric physics states that the lower-f lying tankers could not have been leaving such long- lingering plumes – unless they were spreading fine particulates in their wake. CLOUD RECIPE Vincent Sch aefer is a Naval postgraduate who invented iodine cloud-seeding techniques first widely used in 1946. Joseph Moran wrote the classic textbook, Meteorology . Both experts agree that clouds form when water vapor accretes around particles of grit acting as attracting nuclei. And NOAA’s and NASA’s atmospheric studies – including TARFOX, ACE-Asia, ACE-I and II, INDOEX and Project SUCCESS – have since confirmed that t he only way to form artificial clouds under conditions of low humidity and less than ideal temperatures is by dispensing additional particles from aircraft. In other words, when atmospheric conditions prevent the moisture-attracting nuclei left by aircraft engine exhausts from forming contrails, chemicals adde d to the fuel can leave enough extra particles exhausted to create artificial clouds when the relative humidity is less than 70%. Modeled by Paul Demott at Colorado State Univer sity’s Department of Atmospheric Science, the principle factors determining cirrus cloud development are temperature, relative humidity, and aerosol size. The last variable is of primary importance, and may be supplied either inadvertently or deliberately by high-flying aircraft. MAKING CLOUDS AND RAIN At the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado, Al Cooper also studies the tiny particles that form the nuclei of condensing clouds and raindrops. Cooper says that burning tropical forests and grasslands may be the largest source of these cloud-forming particles. Other cloud condensation nuclei come from airborne dust, sea salt, the nitrogen and sulfur compounds released by aircraft engines, as well as very fine particulates released by specially equipped aircraft. Spread a few extra nuclei like silver iodide into hi ghly humid air and rainfall results."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The smaller the size of each additional nuclei, the greater the rate of cirrus cloud formation. Here’s the catch: In air not already swollen with moisture, introducing too many particulates into the atmosphere to compete for a small amount of moisture can act like a sponge, resulting in decreased rainfall . HOW TO TELL A CHEMTRAIL FROM A NORMAL CONTRAIL Brian Holmes at holmes.ca offers some “simple, direct points to look for or questions to ask if you see an unusual plume in the sky”: Are the aircraft in question on regular commercial flight paths or in some restricted, such as military, air space? Are the aircraft seen on a regular scheduled, perhaps daily, basis or very irregularly? Are aircraft seen laying plumes interacting with other similar aircraft in a way that is obviously at odds with normal air traffic, such as crossing flight paths and flying at closer than normal spacing or intervals? Are such plume-creating aircraft seen very frequently, perhaps in considerable numbers, for a period of days and then perhaps not at all for a while in a way that would not be typical of regularly scheduled commercial air traffic? Is there by chance another aircraft in the sky at a similar high altitude that is apparently on a regular commercial flight path but is leaving behind a short, shall we say, traditional, condensation trail whereas the other aircraft is laying a trail that may stretch from horizon to horizon? The persistent contrail may spread out over the sky and, under certain light conditions, may refract light showing some colors of the rainbow. Are the plumes laid throughout the sky so that in an hour or so your sky becomes over cast purely from the spreading plumes? "},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" Using Flight Aware or another flight tracking program, determine whether or not the aircraft that you are observing are being tracked in near real time by the tracking program. If the aircraft you have observed do not show up on these tracking pr ograms, then you must assume that they are exempt from being tracked. Only military ty pe aircraft and some government aircraft are exempt from tracking. The tracking is not done by radar but by receiving transponder information “broadcast” by the aircraft in question. But Holmes adds any military aircraft conducting extensive maneuvers or ex ercises over populated civilian areas violate FAA and military flight regulations – unless the Secretary of Defense receives written permission from the Governor(s) of the affected state(s) under a limited-time “Special Use Authorization” at least 90 days prior to any such operation. He suggests checking with the National Weather Service for their “Upper Air Sounding Data” to determine the temperature and humidity values at flight altitudes. Remember that for normal contrails to form and linger, temperatures must be -70°F or lower, and humidity values must be 70% or higher at the flight altitudes of observed aircraft. ON THE MOVE FROM TAOS Santa Fe was not the only New Mexican town suffering from chemtrail fallout. On September 19, 2004, Taos resident Joan wrote describing how she and her children were traveling home from Farmington, New Mexico: The sky was clear and sunny as always in northern New Mexico. My son and daughter first noticed the X’s that followed the road going east to west. These X’s followed the Colorado - New Mexico boarder for at least 50 Miles. When we finally turned to go south, the trails followed that road and after awhile there was an end... The final X was thick on one side and it had the most unusual opalescence quality to it. It was multi colored and very almost metallic or a sparkle quality to it. When I got back home, I got out of the car and became violently ill, which seemed to come on suddenly out of nowhere. I will never forget how sick I was. My children witnessed this and we often have wondered what that was about. After that I noticed in my town of Taos there were often the same type of X’s in the sky but the odd thing was there was literally almost no air traffic over that area an d no real reason for any trails to be that low in the sky. I no longer live there, and this was one fact or that weighted my decision to leave. It was just too weird. “ROUTINE OPERATIONS” North Ameri can aviation officials continued to insist that nothing unusual was going on. And that precisely spaced grid patterns and perfectly intersected X’s never before seen by ground observers were “normal flight operations”. But when confronted with their own data showing the impossibility of normal contrail formation during heavy “spray days” they grew silent. Aviation authorities also failed to explain the sudden appearance of formations of grid-weaving jets over communities unused to seeing any air traffic at a ll. Why were so many people who have lived near airbases and airports for most of their lives – w ho would not normally give a contrail a second glance – stopping their cars, or hauling family members and neighbors out of their homes to point cameras and camcorders at unprecedented concentrations of jet spoor they instinctively recognized were not normal contrails? And since when does “scheduled air traffic” suddenly appear, saturating otherwise unvisited skies for weeks, only to abruptly cease – before starting up again weeks later?"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Most sightings take place far from navigation beacons and established air routes. Nor do airliners obsessed with point A to B effici ency spend hours crisscrossing the same patch of sky in close formation. To do so would violate many air safety regulations mandating minimum commercial aircraft separation. And passengers would refuse to fly in airliners without windows, as many photographs of the planes show.   HOT A ND COLD Whether deploying contrails or chemtrails, tinkering with cloud cover could trigger unintended consequences. Acting as a complex planetary thermostat, clouds cool the Earth by reflecting sunlight. But they also heat the atmosphere by trapping outgoing heat. “The net effect is a very delicate balance of cooling and warming,” a NASA scientist told the Rocky Mountain News . “A small tip in one direction or another can eliminate global warming or greatly enhance it.” Both natural and aircraft-induced cloud decks can reflect sunlight that would otherwise warm the Earth’s surface. Or they can act like an atmospheric blanket, trapping heat radiating up from the ground, instead of allowing it to escape. It turns out that contrails concentrated over regions of the United States and Europe have resulted in local warming 35-times higher than the global average.

I could also clearly see two or three long chemtrail lines at high altitude at the edge of the overcast. They must be getting hit very hard today. Deborah here. I just got back from Gresham. The city of Portland is completely blanketed with the chemclouds - it is solid. Driving in to Portland it looks like a cloudy day. The spraying is definitely going north/south.

What the hell is this shit?” -Semper Fi  COUNTING CONTRAILS OVER CONUS Here is a chemtrail koan straight from NASA and the Pentagon: Conundrum: How can contrails be increasing when they are declining? Answer: When they are really chemtrails. NASA scientists say that despite a steady increase in commercial air traffic over the Continental United States (CONUS) in recent decades, contrails are decreasing over the USA . The aeronautical agency’s 2002 study, “An Estimation of CONUS Contrail Frequency”, was conjured after correlating rapid meteorological updates called RUCs with near “real time” flight data supplied by FlyteTrax of Silicon Valley. During Nove mber 2001, FlyteTrax provided up-to-the-minute specs on all commercial air traffic over the continental U.S. This included readouts on commercial aircraft type, latitude, longitude and altitude every five minutes around the clock. Air traffic densities were then charted on grids encompassing 10,000 square kilometers each, and extending from 20°N to 50°N and 135°W to 60°W. Within each grid at 40-kilometer intervals, detailed atmospheric profiles of height, temperature, humidity and horizontal and vertical wind speeds were derived from one-hourly Rapid Update Cycle analyses. "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"When the flight data for an aircraft transiting an area matched atmospheric requirements for contrail formation, the computer made predictions concerni ng contrail formation and persistence over CONUS. Minnis, an ardent foe of “chemtrail conspiratorialists ”helped calculate the computer algorithms used to estimate “CONUS contrail frequency”. WHERE HAVE ALL THE CONTRAILS GONE? “According to the classical contrail formation theory, contrails can persist when the ambient air is super- saturated,” says this latest NASA contrail study, which isn’t often. Even when NASA’s meteorological model was deliberately skewed with software modifications to predict more contrails under less than ideal contrail conditions – the number of contrails was found to be declining. The “ Potential Persistent Contrail Frequency ” shows the month of Thanksgiving to be typically the heaviest air traffic month in the U.S. – where the region with the highest potential occurrence of contrails continues to be the Pacific Northwest. Other regions of high contrail frequency occurred in central Canada and the eastern Midwestern U.S. These areas can see twice the number of contrails as the continental average. But in December 2001 the distribution and magnitude of potential contrails “changed dramatically” said NASA – not because of September 11, but as a re sult of radical, unexpected changes in weather patterns between November and December. Even in the contrail-congested Portland and Seattle regions, contrail frequency dropped well below continental averages. Presented to the “10 th Conference on Aviation, Range, and Aerospace Meteorology” in heavily chemtrailed Portland, Oregon in May 2002, NASA’s newest findings showed that contrail coverage over the North Atlantic and central Europe remained “significantly smaller than those given” in 1994. Ditto the Pacific Northwest. Yet the skies in these regions were more obscured than ever! "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" UNHAPPY TRAILS TO YOU Try telling Leslie that jet plumes are decreasing. That same November – with far fewer contrails showing up than predicted and photographs and eyewitness reports of persistent white plumes left by high-flying jets flooding the Internet – this school teacher took a trip from Las Vegas “up to Reno, over to Sacramento, up to Portland, Oregon, and then over through Idaho and down through Wyoming into Denver and back to Las Vegas. And every bit of the way, they were spraying. The range of the spraying was just phenomenal. We covered six states in four days and saw them everywhere.” Leslie became “very, very sick”. It took almost two m onths for her lungs to clear from something “almost exactly like a whooping cough I got ten or so years ago that turned out to be a lung fungal infection.” Ice crystal condensation trails do not cause fungal infections in the lungs. But airborne colonies of mutated molds and fungi brought down from the irradiated upper atmosphere by chemtrails could certainly cause symptoms experienced by Leslie and tens of thousands of North Americans following chemtrail exposure. A MILITARY METEOROLOGIST On May 6, 2001, a former military meteorologist wrote the author: Just thought I’d report that I have witnessed my first chemtrails over central NH. I have absolutely no doubt whatsoever. I am a former m ilitary meteorologist and am familiar with the typical commercial flight patterns over my area. I went out to look at the sky around mid-night and directly overhead stretching east to west was a large fat plume at the mid-levels, about 16000-20000 feet I would estimate. I also noticed two aircraft to my north flying east to west and minutes later another large plume showed up. The moon is nearly full so visibility is good. Again, I have absolutely no doubt whatsoever that these plumes are completely anomalous and in no way are they typical of any contrails I have ever seen, and I’ve seen many in my 12+ years in the military, observed both from the ground and on satellite photos. The aircraft traffic is also non-typical for my area. LOOK DADDY! Four years later, on June 16, 2005, Jonathan sadly related from Portland: Yesterday morning early I watched in fascination as the first large white jets punched through the crystal clear skies over my place at 5:30 AM. Re lentlessly they pressed on four, five and more. By Nine am the skies where looking more like a blue and white striped flag with over 12 lines in the sky. By the afternoon there was nothing but a white hazed sky, by 6 pm we had a completely gray haze overcast complete with a circular rainbow. Today we have a grey sky and intermittent showers. I used to look up and marvel how nature painted the sky, now I simply wish I knew the artists’ names. I cannot show my daughter the sights I hav e seen. A pity I cannot show Sky how nature paints the sky. She simply looks up and says to me, “Look Daddy. Look what the plane made!” She was nearly 4. "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" Chapter 5. SUNSCREEN What else was happening to our skies? Though other projects have since piggy-backed onto this extensive covert program, environmental consultant Mike Castle discovered the primary purpose behind chemtrails when he discovered a patent for “Stratospheric Welsbach Seeding for Reduction of Global Warming”. Filed by aerospace giant Hughes Aircraft Company in 1991, the patent explained that Welsbach materials are oxides of metals capable of reflecting incoming sunlight. They also convert heat trapped by greenhouse gases near the Earth’s surface into far-infrared wavelengths, which then radiate back into space. Cautioning that the resulting white skies may be unpopular, the Hughes patent nevertheless suggested that these very tiny metal flakes could be “added to the fuel of jet airliners, so that the particles would be emitted from the jet engine exhaust while the airliner was at its cruising altitude.” Aluminum oxide can withstand temperatures far higher than jet engine exhausts. While highly abrasive in larger sizes, a former Alcoa aluminum engineer to ld me that aluminum in the 10 to 100 micron sizes called for in the sunscreen patent would simply polish jet turbine blades without harming them. (A human hair is about 100 microns across). The engineer added that this “very fine, talcum-like” aluminum powder would appear as a “pure white plume” in the sky.

Easily identified MD-80s alone currently log 4,800 daily flights. Co-produced with artist Paul Grignon, a disturbing clip in our video documentary “Chemtrails: Mystery Lines In The Sky” clearly shows this MD-80 jetliner laying a thick white plume beneath two equally prominent and persistent chemtrails. The phenomenon observed above dozens of nations fit the patents, studies, proposals and computer models calling for a “sunscreen”.     TELLER’S LAST BIG IDEA When Dr. Edward Teller stood to address an International Seminar On Planetary Emergencies in 1998, the Earth’s lowest temperatures had just been found by worldwide NOAA observatories to be heating up more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit per century. Frightening forecasts called for even more rapid heating over the coming decades. Bellwether Antarctica was warming 10-times faster than this global rate. Adele and Chinstrap penguin colonies were going extinct on the Antarctica Peninsula, where stunned scientists clad in windbreakers strolled in unprecedented rain showers marveling at a first-time profusion of wildflowers. While corporate-controlled medi a scoffed at the inevitable outcome from trapping more solar heat in Earth’s enclosed greenhouse, top scientific advisers to governments from Tuvalu to Washington were close to panic. Just the year before, while the father of the H-bomb was busy co-authoring a quick techno fix to reduce global warming without reducing greenhouse gas emissions, our space colony was hurriedly heating up. Even as malarial mosquitoes invaded the continental United States and tropical Dengue fever spread as far north as South Carolina, melting Arctic tundra threatened to burp megatons of heat-trapping methane gas into an already overheating atmosphere. Canada’s northern boreal forests were sweating out a warming trend that threatened to add their dying mass of carbon to the greenhouse, as well. The vast, interconnected world ocean was also heating up, altering weather-moderating currents, changing pelagic patterns of food fish and other sea life, and triggering massive storms. As Teller described his sunscreen solution, the strongest El Nino ever recorded was seeing tropical marlin and mahi-mahi caught off the coast of Washington state. Swordfish were beaching in Scotland, and torrential rains had resulted in “once-in-a-millennium” flooding in Germany. The year before, similar “Superstorms”, droughts and floods killed 50,000 people. Also in 1997, the first “Category 6” hurricane ever recorded packed sustained winds of 200 mph."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"As long-lived CFCs, bromines and other industrial chemicals continued to devour Spaceship Earth’s solar shielding, ground level radiation levels were also rising alarmingly. U.S. farmers alone were losing more than $3 billion a year to crops damaged by rapidly rising rates of solar radiation, as an epidemic of sun-induced cataracts was sweeping North America. The U.S. EPA sharply revised its estimated skin cancer deaths from 9,300 to 200,000 sunshine-related fatalities over the next 50 years. Global warming threatened to bankrupt global insurers. Bigger than big oil and the international trade in arms, insurance companies handling more money than many once-sovereign nations are one of the world’s largest sources of investment capital. Losses from Extreme Weather Events and related damages were hitting a record $92 billion a year – three-times the annual dollar cost of the Vietnam War Reeling from catastrophic storm losses up 1,500% over the previous decade, this powerful lobby pressed Ottawa, Washington and Whitehall to turn down the heat on global warming. If global warming bankrupted insurers, the resulting “domino effect” would take out the money markets and the banks that backed them. Flagship in surer Lloyds of London was already nearly foundering after losing almost $11 billion in just four years. Insurance claims from Hurricane Andrew alone “totaled” $15.5 billion. Over many millennia, Eart h’s climate has “cycled” between lesser extremes. But there is nothing “natural” about the unprecedented warming we are now experiencing. Tree rings from a 10,500 year-old Tasmanian pine show that the last 30 years have been the warmest in 2,000 years. In the past 3,800 y ears there has been only one comparable 30-year period of warmer temperatures than the present time. [Vancouver Sun Feb 4/94] And carbon levels are climbing steeply within our space colony’s closed, recirculating atmosphere. Today, the “CO 2 Equivalent” of heat-trapping carbon dioxide, nitrogen and methane in Earth’s atmosphere are near 423ppm and climbing faster than a chemtrails tanker. If this trend continues, our “Climax Civilization” will suffer the same fa te as our clear-cut “climax” rainforests. CHAOS We’re talking about major instabilities being unleashed across our planet with unpredictable consequences. Scientists call this a “nonlinear” dynamic. At the Santa Fe Institute, I talked to leading experts who simply call it Chaos. What happens when Chaos kicks in? As novelist Robin White writes in The Flight From Winter’s Shadow : There was a zone of uncertainty, a chaos zone where small perturbations had large effects... very soon after, a breaking point was reached. The world’s climate shifted suddenly and dramatically from the familiar to the utterly hostile. How long would it take? The journey from the zone of shadows to utter collapse was a matter of decades; perhaps as much as two. The climate was already in the shadow zone. Ten years sounded like a long time, but it wasn’t. Every five weeks you lost one percent of the time remaining until, until what? SUNSCREEN In 1998, the choice appeared stark. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory calculated that cutting back fossil fuel burning 20% to 1990 levels would cost the U.S. economy $100 billion a year. But other scientists reported that carbon emissions must be slashed by 80% to curtail runaway global warming. Either way, global warming threatened to be a real showstopper. "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"In the midst of deepening environmental crisis, Teller offered a quick affordable fix. Dusting off a proposal first suggested by scientists in the 1960s and ‘70s, Teller urged the conference on planetary emergencies to adopt his updated magic bullet. “We have to do it now,” he urged. Everyone present listened intently to one of Americ a’s most prominent scientists, whose last horrific invention had mingled with Soviet plutonium to contaminate every square mile on Earth. Long enamored of massive engineering projects, Edward Teller had earlier proposed detonating “peacetime” atomic bombs to carve harbors and canals out of U.S. coastlines. Now he presented an even more grandiose geoengineering scheme. Why not, Teller urged, spray a protective chemical “sunscreen” into the upper atmosphere? Computer simulations conducted at Lawrence Livermor e showed that if enough reflective particles could be suspended in the atmosphere to deflect just 1% of incoming sunlight, runaway “greenhouse” warming could be stopped in its tracks. This chemical cloud cover would also greatly reduce levels of potentially lethal ultraviolet rays at the same time. It could be done. With the Cold War officially over and nearly 700 air-to-air refueling tankers in its active inventory, the U.S. Air Force had the planes and the personnel to conduct a sustained aerial spray campaign. PARTICULATE POLICY In sheer weight and frightening scenarios, the 1992 National Academy of Science study for the U.S. Government rivaled a Stephen King horror-fest. The hefty $80, 944-page report on the “Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming” included chapters on “mitigation” – the including geoengineering schemes championed by Freeman Dyson, Edward Teller and others. Produced by an ominous-sounding “Committee on Abrupt Climate Change” – comprising heavyweight oceanographers and atmospheric scientists from the USA, UK and Switzerland – this massive study opened like a clap of doom, warning: “Large, abrupt climate changes have repeatedly affected much or all of the earth, locally reaching as much as 10°C change in 10 years.” To put this into heart-lurching perspective: the 1°C warming experienced in the 20th century was a very big deal, triggering Extreme Weather Events, widespread droughts and the movement of some 25 million “environmental refugees”. A 3°C jump in average temperatures will end daily life as we know it, turning weather into Nature’s vengeance as rising sea levels drown the coasts where most people live.

The alarming NAS intro continues: “Available evidence suggests that abrupt climate changes are not only possible but likely in the future, potentially with large impacts on ecosystems and societies.” In 1998, the year the father of the H-bomb began calling for a sunscreen to be placed over the planet (or at least over the countrie s that could afford it), scientist Jay Michaelson called for a geoengineering effort commensurate with the Manhattan Project that spawned the first U.S. atom bombs ever dropped on cities. [Stanford Environmental Law Journal Jan/98] “A periodic program of distributing particulate matter in the atmosphere can be cheaper than simply conserving f ossil fuels,\" Michaelson enthused. It’s cheap, quick and doesn’t call for anyone to change their habits. “Geoengineering is less contentious than regulation and avoids any form of behavior modification. Geoengineering, in contrast to regulation, leaves powerful actors and their interests relatively intact.” But not the paper-thin atmosphere overlaying a tiny space colony surrounded by the cold, irradiated vacuum of deep space. TINKERING WITH A WOUNDED PLANET Another corroborating clue came in late summer 2000, when this reporter was handed a leaked draft document prepared by the International Panel on Climate Change. As the BBC put it, the IPCC “represents the best consensus the world’s leading climatologists have been able to achieve.” Governments listen when IPCC projections call for atmospheric heating from a disastrous 3°F – to a catastrophic 7-8°F by the year 2100. Vostock ice core sampling shows the present levels of heat- trapping atmospheric CO 2 to be the highest and hottest in the last 220,000 years! Since the 17 th century, methane – an even more powerful greenhouse gas – is up 150%. The Inuit of the far north do not need oil company scientist-prostitutes to “debate” global warming.

Since the 1970s, as Arctic temperatures have risen a balmy 11 degrees, the thickness Arctic ice cap has shrunk by nearly half. This warming is extending far inland and underwater to thousands of billions of tons of methane stored in the frozen tundra and seafloor. Once released in the atmosphere, methane traps 22-times more heat than CO 2 . If it lets go, we will be toast. And we may have a hard time breathing. Issued for peer review on May 15, 2000, Chapter 4 of the GOVERNMENT / EXPERT REVIEW IPCC- WGIII TAR SOD report was all about geoengineering – the deliberate, large-scale, manipulations of dynamic and complex Earth ecologies we know little about such interactions, and have no control whatsoever over the vast oceanic proc esses that drive weather and climate. Intended to advise policy makers around the globe on ways to anticipate and perhaps ameliorate the catastrophic effects of global warming, the IPCC report pointed to the plausible “potential” of Caldeira’s computer models and Teller’s sunscreen scenario. By increasing Earth reflective albedo by 1½ to 2%, a predicted doubling of atmospheric CO 2 over the next 50 years would result in no net temperature increase. At least, not over the Western Hemisphere. Concurring with a 1992 National Academy of Scientists study, Teller and his cohorts found that 10 million tons of sunlight-reflecting chemicals spread in the atmosphere would be sufficient to increase the albedo of the Earth by just under 1%. They did not say what would happen to millions of people who inhaled particulates so tiny the EPA called them “an extreme human health hazard.” But the IPCC worried about “unexpected environmental impacts, our lack of complete understanding of the systems involved, and our concerns with the legal and ethical implications.” International atmospheric experts also cautioned against “the potential impact on atmospheric chemistry ,” the change in diffuse sunlight (later termed “global dimming”) – “and the associated whitening of the visual appearance of the sky.” GOING FOR IT ANYWAY Panicking scientists now say that an 80% reduction in CO 2 emissions is essential for meaningful climate change abatement. Immediate and drastic reductions in fossil fuel consumption would not only literally provide breathing space, but would also cushion the shock of no-longer-affordable oil. Known as Peak Oil, this dangerous intersection of plummeting oi l supplies and skyrocketing demand is already occurring – and is expected to seriously disr upt advanced societies... very soon. The first detailed assessment of more than 800 oil fields – covering three-quarters of global reserves – has just found that most of the biggest fields have already peaked, and the rate of decline in oil production is now running at nearly twice the pace as calculated just two years ago. Chronic under-investment by oil-producing countries is hastening an \"oil crunch\" within the next five years that will jeopardize any hope of a recovery from the present global economic recession said Dr Fatih Birol, the chief economist at the respected Inte rnational Energy Agency in Paris, which is charged with the task of assessing future energy supplies. In its first-ever assessment of the world's major oil fields, the IEA concluded that the global energy system was at a crossroads and that consumption of oil was \"patently unsustainable\", with expected demand far outstripping supply. Oil production has already peaked in non-OPEC countries and the era of cheap oil has come to an end, it warned. \"We have to leave oil before oil leaves us,\" Dr Birol said. \"The earlier we start, the better, because all of our economic and social system is based on oil, so to change from that will take a lot of time and a lot of money and we should take this issue very seriously.\""},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The International Energy Agency believes demand after 2010 is likely to exceed dwindling supplies. Are any more reasons needed to stop chemtrails and kick our oil addiction? [Independent Aug 3/09] Geochemist Wallace Broecker believes the “sunscreen” proposal would cost around $50 billion. It could also cost the planet. Focusing on geoengineering projects li ke chemtrails subverts other efforts to attain sensible reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. National Research Council scientists worry that attempting to offset global warming by deliberate climate modification “could be used as an excuse by those who would be negatively affected by controls on the human appetite to continue polluting and using the atmosphere as a free sewer.” The mercurial Michaelson agrees. “Essentially,” he says, “a Climate Change Manhattan Project seeks to cure lung cancer with the latest technology, when really the smoker should just quit smoking... Economists believe a sizable amount of GHG emissi ons can be reduced quite cheaply. Surely, it is better to just get used to the idea of ‘living lightly’ than to scatter dust in the sky or seed oceans with iron, especially when living lightly is good for all of us anyway.” DEAD ZONES To revisit an other mega-project gone awry, check out the dried-up Aral Sea. Or Iron Ex. Since just one iron atom can stimulate enough plankton growth to consume approximately 10,000 carbon atoms, an estimated 430,000 tons of annual iron seeding could theoretically offset the three billion tons of carbon that humans release into the atmosphere each year. But there are several problems with this nautical addiction avoidance scheme. First, after taking up nearly half the CO 2 released by us, the interconnected world ocean is just about fully saturated and can’t absorb much more CO 2 . Even worse, as they take up some 20 million additional metric tons of carbon every day, the ocean is rapidly turning acidic. Unless slowed dramatically by curtailing our land and airborne emission, this acidification will have dire consequences for plankton that anchor the entire marine food web and remove more carbon from the atmosphere than all the remaining forests ashore. [earthfiles.com Aug 13/04; Guardian Nov 25/08] The second Iron Ex ocean-seeding experiment caused proliferating plankton to gobble tons of additional atmospheric CO 2 . But – oops! – these giant plankton blooms also devoured all available sea surface oxygen, killing the sea life that came to eat them, and leaving “dead zones” of oceanic desert in the wake of the iron pellet-dispensing ship. Who needed it? There are already more than 30 human-caused oceanic “dead zones” around the world. Some of these oxygen-deprived zones extend up to 70,000 square kilometers. [BBC; MSNBC Aug12/04] "},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" In similar fashion, I became concerned that more than 10 years of heavy chemtrail spraying is causing similar atmospheric “dead zones” by destroying the microscopic life forms that inhabit Earth’s atmosphere – and are intricately tied to our weather. PATENTLY OBVIOUS Nascent chemtrails technology had already been developed for the U.S. Navy. Issued in 1975, the navy’s Contrail Generation Patent described a “Contrail generation apparatus for producing a powder contrail having maximum radiation scattering ability.” Noting “some details unavailable”, the classified invention was intended to produce an easily observed powder contrail behind target drones used to simulate “aerial threats” for anti-aircraft missile tests. The patent described how “light scattering pigment powder particles” are dispensed from jets “to produce a powder contrail having maximum visibility or radiati on scattering ability for a given weight material.” The patent further claimed that the Navy’s invention is also suitable “to generate contrails or reflective screens for any desired purpose .” Could artificial “contrails” actually cool the lower atmosphere? CONTRAILS REDUCE DAILY TEMPERATURES It is now well known that artificial cirrus clouds formed by particulates and water vapor in jet exhaust do effect daily temperatures. The grounding of commercial flights for three days after last September's terrorist attacks in the United States gave David Trav is at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater and colleagues a chance they never thought they'd have: to study the true impact that contrails from jet engines have on our climate. Travis's team found that the difference between daily high and nightly low temperatures in the absence of contrails was more than 1°F greater than in th e presence of contrails. Comparing the three-day grounding period with the three days immediately before and after, the impact was even larger – about 2°F. “It's obviously a significant effect,” says Andrew Carleton, an atmospheric scientist at Pennsylvania State University in University Pa rk and a member of Travis's team. In regions with crowded skies, contrail overcasts pr event days from getting too hot by reflecting the sun's rays. They also keep nights warmer by trapping the Earth's heat. “Locally, contrails are equally as significant as greenhouse gases,” says Carleton. [Nature Aug/02] Ditto chemtrails. Deteriorating weather conditions are often observed in the wake of an activity referred to by the U.S. Air Force as “aerial obscuration”. These unpredicted weather changes include sudden temperature drops, high winds, unusually heavy or unseasonable precipitation, and murky overcasts on days forecast for “sunny weather”. Concurrent with this toxic sky spraying, in timing and location too drastic and too often occurring to be coincidence, epidemics of sudden, acute and sometimes fatal illness continue to occur among populations exposed to chemical clouds. Widespread accounts of a “metallic taste” in the mouth, odors of petroleum, difficulty in breathing and other acute allergic reactions by observers on the ground suggest that the rapid fall-rate of highly allergenic JP-8 jet fuel, as well as other toxic chemicals present in varying spray mixes, may be major factors in adverse health reactions among residents of heavily sprayed areas."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The prevalence of fungal infections in 99% of survey ed sufferers from Chemtrail-Related Illness, and the growing belief among prominent health researchers that novel forms of fungi are responsible for many mystery ailments, lends credence to this author’s theor y that rapidly descending particulates in chemtrail fallout are bringing airborne bacteria, viruses and fungi “down to Earth” – and into lungs unprepared to confront these unfamiliar life-forms. Even more disturbing are independent lab tests of samples obtained from deliberate low-level drops of cobweb-like and gel material that reveal a mix of pathogenic bacilli and molds capable of killing children, the elderly or those with weakened immune systems. Weather modification and atmospheric amelioration can in no way be attributed to these low-level releases of biological “cocktails”. The mix and concentration of these airdropped pathogens – along with telltale “bio-markers” and genetic engineering enzymes – are rarely if ever seen together in nature. The whole notion of “weather control” is a spectacularly bad idea. The best way to mitigate our current \"atmos-fear \"is to park our cars, shut off unneeded appliances (including computers), close coal-fired power plants, and basically stop burning carbon in the closed “garage” of Earth’s airspace – which, if freeways went straight up, you could drive out of within an hour. Scientists agree that the only cure for this planet’s terminal lung cancer is not more spin control, but to stop smoking – and switch immediately to energy conservation and clean, renewable fuels. Otherwise, what are we going to tell the children? "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" Chapter 6. ESPANOLA In the summer of 1998 – long before anyone had heard of “chemtrails” – Ben McNenly and other residents of Espanola began seeing unfamiliar aircraft and strange clouds in the skies over this small Ontario, Canada community of 6,000 souls located about 30 miles above Lake Huron. That July, McNenly sighted a pattern he called a “sheet music grid” involving five parallel plumes running just above the northern horizon. It did not dissipate like a normal contrail. “I was suspicious of it,” he later emailed me. Especially after he and others within a 50-mile radius began coming down with sinus infections and flu-like symptoms at the same time. “My suspicions where there because I had heard a show on shortwave radio speaking about the spraying in the USA,” McNenly wrote. Since then, he didn't see anything dramatic in the skies over Espanola until the middle of February 1999. “Then these grid patterns re-appeared in our skies - but only on weekends.” Ben McNenly wondered if “this might be evidence of a malicious intent - simply because they were choosing a time when most people up here are off work and outside. On one such weekend in late February a fellow in a neigbhouring town 20 miles away with a history of emphysema died of respiratory distress. When I have attended church lately, the service is often drowned out by coughing. Virtually ever yone I know personally has a bad cough.” "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" McNenly became so upset, he posted a link to one of my Environment News Service reports on his web page. “Since then we have been sprayed almost daily,” he in formed me. “Maybe that’s just a coincidence – or the result of a heightened awareness – I don't know. As of today the spraying is the heaviest I have yet seen. I wonder when this will stop. I have even seen this “sheet music” pattern show up at midnight, illuminated by the full moon. As images go, I've never seen anything so off the wall.” Then, at the local gym, he heard about “three fellows who were out ice fishing on March 8th, and identified “military aircraft” - 7 of them flying “in formation.” He thought that three untrained observers insisting that they had seen “military aircraft” was compelling. If they were Canadian, McNenly said jokingly, “That must have been the entire air force.” On March 8, 1999, he noted another “massive” plume running from east to west, just north of Espanola. “Later that day the whole sky clouded over completely.” Ben McNenly kept his ozone generator and a HEPA filter going around the clock. He also took colloidal silver to purge any toxins form his body. “I st ill have occasional body aches and headaches,” he says, though “much reduced though from the way this was in February. I just thank God I listen to shortwave radio.” Another resident I a nearby community confirmed Mc Nenly’s sightings. “I have been observing contrails for the past several months from my location 30 miles west of Sudbury,” Ted Simola wrote. “Friday May 28, 1999 stands out in my mind as this was the first time I noticed them in an east-west pattern right over our home. Normally they are in a north-south pattern west of us over Espanola. There were five trails and each one appeared perhaps as being 1/2 mile wide and lower than I normally see them. The interesting part is that I had been out earlier and had not noticed any trails at that time. I would say that within a time span of 15 minutes or so they had appeared and I had not heard any aircraft overhead.” The following day at 11:30 a.m. while en route to Espanola, Simola observed more strange “contrails” to the south west of us as his family was driving we st. After dinner with a ham radio club on Manitoulin Island, he spotted two X's in the sky and numerous lingering “contrails” way off in the distance. About 20 minutes, as they were driving north toward Espanola on Highway 6, Simola and his wife “noticed an aircraft to the west of us, flying northeast. The setting sun glinted off the aircraft and a normal contrail was observed as it dissipated behind the aircraft. However, suddenly there appeared a wider trail behind the aircraft which did not dissipate. “Suddenly this trail just ended, as if it had been shutoff. And it remained in the sky. About three to four minutes later, this wide trail appeared again and then ended as if someone had just turned it on and off again.” As the aircraft disappeared from view, Ted Simola looked back and saw the two separate sections of the interrupted ‘trail “still visible and getting wider.” He later gathered samples of rain water, which had “some tiny particles in it that sparkle as the sunlight hits the container.” He didn’t know what they might be. Shortly after my January 1999 appearance with Art Bell, McNenly told me that he’d been seeing scallop clouds that were “almost laughable” they look so artificial. When he placed microwave oven detector strips on the east side of his aluminum-sided home, the indicator strip stayed clear. But on the west side of the house – where the scallop clouds appeared – the strip showed purple-red, indicating microwave radiation concurrent with the chemtrails. There were a lot of depressed people in Espanola, McNenly added. “It’s free-floating, abstract. You can’t really put your finger on anything.”"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" In addition, “a lot of people here in town are complaining of short term memory loss. She can’t remember where she parked her car – it’s become a running joke.” Each aerial drop was followed by a bout of diarrhea “I am convinced it’s a carrier and not cloud-seeding at all,” Ben McNenly said. Using sterile containers, he collected rain falling through the mystery plumes – and sent it to a nearby lab for analysis. The head of the lab was surprised by the high number of bacteria in McNenly’s sample. Most likely these airborne organisms had been carried to earth by the particulate fallout. Quartz dominated the rainfall samples, along with mica. While there was no local source for these minerals, they are known to be used in weather modification experiments. The commercial lab also identified large and hazardous amounts of aluminum oxide in the rainwater falling through chemtrails over Espanola at seven-times government-permissible safe levels. Concerned residents finally forced the provincial envir onment ministry to conduct air sample tests. But when government officials refused to release their fi ndings at a raucous public meeting in August, a near riot broke out. Canada’s government-run CBC News picked up the story: ONTARIO TOWN WORRIED ABOUT U.S. MILITARY FLIGHTS Espanola, Ontario - Residents of a small town west of Sudbury, Ontario are anxious. They think they're getting sick, and they think they know why. It involves the U.S. military, the government and strange planes overhead. Tempers at the Espanola town council run high. Residents want to know what's flying over their community. Shelly Jordan thinks strange planes might be making her kids sick. \"I was concerned to see if this had anything to do with it, because I've heard of other things that are going on with children. I'm just wondering what the ratio is? If my daughter is one in 60,000 with her condition? All these other things that are happening to kids in this little area. If there are more I'd like to hear from them.\" In fact, many in the community have report ed respiratory problems and strange aches and pains. Town council heard that some believe military jets are dropping material over the town as part of a weather experiment. It isn't just a couple of people who think that. More than two 200 have signed a petition. Ben McNenly has seen the planes and he thinks they're American KC-135s. [CBC Newsworld Aug 29/99] Just two months before, government opposition defense critic Gordon Earle had come close to putting this question before the House – but backed down after visiting the “contrail connection” website and seeing links to UFOs. Following the August community meeting, and press coverage across Canada, public pressure persuaded this Member of Parliament to go on record with a local petition demanding answers from the Canadian government. “As you know, our petition has finally been tabled in Ottawa – which means the clock is now ticking,” Ben McNenly wrote me. “The government must make a statement on the record within 30 days.”"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" Chapter 7. SEE NO EVIL To the residents of Espanola – and the entire North American continent (referred to as Turtle Island by its original inhabitants) – the air force has repeatedly declared, “Those are not our planes.” Initially responding to complaints by citizens suffering adverse chemical reactions under high-flying aircraft, U.S. Air Force representatives pointed to “routine fuel dumping” over Las Vegas and other populated areas by fleets of multi-engine jet aircraft crisscrossing those skies for hours. This starling revelation riled residents who were apparently being regularly doused with highly toxic jet fuel in order to lower aircraft weights within proscribed maximum limits for landing. But veteran USAF tanker pilot Lt. Col. Den Ardinger, (Ret) has flown enough tanker missions to know this was not happening. “One of the things I want understood is that ‘spraying’ from a tanker is not unheard of regardless of what anyone tells you. It’s what is being sprayed that is t he puzzle,” said this former tanker pilot. “There are reasons for a tanker to sometimes spray fuel into the atmosphere. What we are seeing today is not the occasional spraying I am talking about. When we dumped fuel we didn’t fly in a grid pattern.” "},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"A man named Edwin also checked with two friends wi th air force tanker refueling experience. “They have commented that these planes will not be used for air-to-air jet refueling,” he reported. “They will not say what they are to be used for, and often appear nervous when I discuss this subject in detail. This leaves only one other option.” And that option did not include contrails. Air force officials insisted that those definitely were not condensation trails coming from their KC-135 tankers. According to Major General Gregory P. Barlow at the Office the Adjutant General, Camp Murray, Washington, “Our KC-135 jet aircraft operate at altitudes below 33,000 feet, which is typically the altitude where jet contrails form.” What tanker pilot wanted to draw an arrow to her in combat and get shot down? Assuming the wings stay on. These heavily laden flying gas trucks are alarmingly ancient. The first KC- 135 Stratotanker took to the air in August 1956. A modified version of the first jetliner to see widespread commercial use at the dawn of the jet age, each $52 million reconfigured Boeing 707 carries 150,000 pounds of transferable fuel and costs $3,448/hour to fly refueling or chemtrails missions. The last KC-135 was delivered to the Air Force in 1965. Today, the Air Mobility Command operates more than 442 Stratotankers. The Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard fly just over half of these aircraft. Almost 400 of these old warplanes have been retrofitted with new CFM engines. Born-again KC-135s can now carry 225,000 pounds of fuel. Their new “hush kit” engines are also nearly 100% quieter than the original Boeing 707 fuel hogs, which are so loud, commercial 707s are now banned from taking off from U.S. airports. A modified Boeing DC-10 airliner, the KC-10 entered service in 1981. The three-engine KC-10 carries about 320,000 pounds of transferable liquids.

NEW MEXICAN STANDOFF Sky watchers are still awaiting the outcome of New Mexico Representative Tom Udall’s March 13, 2000 request to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to hold oversi ght hearings on the “chemtrails” issue. In September 1999, John Volkerdin of the New Mexico Environmental Protection Division responded to a letter from Alan Hutner of the Santa Fe-based Skywatchers organization. The environmental enforcement specialist stated that after contacting the National Guard, U.S. Army, New Mexico Agricultural Department, New Mexico Department of Military Affairs, and the Federal Aviation Administration – “the data does not suggest that any illegal or clandestine activity is occurring.” Another Santa Fe resident was contacted after complaining about the chemtrails: “I have finally received responses from the Health Dept. and Attorney General here. Same o’ same o’. Just normal contrail activity. Meanwhile, I just had some clients cancel their appointments because the whole family of six were down with pneumonia.” CONGRESS RESPONDS By now, con cerned citizens across the USA were asking a host of mayors and congressional representatives to intercede and stop chemtrails. Among those contacted in writing were senators Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Wayne Allard, Jesse Helms, Edwards, McCain, Murray and Bingaman. In the House of Representatives Jon Kyl, Charles Taylor, Tom Allen, Bob Stump and Wayne Allard were also contacted. “ I recently wrote to my representatives from Maine,” another constituent reported: I received a call from Rep. Tom Allen’s’ office telling me that they had assigned my complaint to the student intern in the office. They made a request for info to the FAA and the EPA, both of whom wrote back saying that the chemtrails were just normal jet contrails and that the stupid public was simply being misled by erroneous reports on the Internet. Clearly, they are in deep, deep denial and are treating the public with total contempt.” THE U.S. AIR FORCE RESPONDS AGAIN Senator John McCain contacted the U.S. Air Force. On August 3, 1999 Col.

Amazingly, his phone calls to each location were transferred to the same man “who sounded just like Jethro from the Beverly Hillbillies, and also sounded drunk! This is apparently how they handle inquiries about Chemtrails,” he later wrote, “by having you talk to a CIA/FBI/NSA/NRO/DIA etc operative who sounds completely incompetent.” Other chemtrail callers in the Bay Area report bei ng instantly transferred to a gruff, military-sounding voice demanding personal identification. The intimidation usually works. THE FAA RESPONDS Speaking from his Los Angeles office, head of the FAA’s Western region, Charles Lieber, told me: “There are no unidentified aircraft flying over the USA. There’s different people looking at different types of aircraft flying back and forth across the country.” Three regional FAA Centers in the East, Central and West United States track all transiting aircraft flying at or above 18,000 feet. Each must file a flight plan identified by a flight number. “We know where they are all the time,” Lieber affirmed. Not quite. Airspace may be cleared for aircraft on military or covert missions that are not required to “squawk” identifying civilian transponder codes. Or file a civilian flight plan. After I relayed our conversation to the person who set up the interview, my intermediary informed me: “I just called and talked with Charles Lieber in the LA Regional office of FAA. He said he hadn’t talked with you. I quoted what you said you were told by the FAA person, and he said he hadn’t made those comments.”"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" Though no noise complaints have ever been received in connection with whisper-quiet chemtrails, Lieber recommended that reports concerning unusual airplane activity be sent in writing to the Noise Ombudsman in Washington, DC. SPOOKING THE SPIN-MASTERS Was this “file-a-noise-complaint” response a cover-up for clandestine flights in which airspace was being cleared by the FAA and therefore required no flight plans to be filed? When a Toronto chemtrail observer called the Pearson International Airport authority in the spring of ‘99, he was startled to hear “an obvious military voice” on the phone. Pretending to be an airplane buff, the caller excitedly asked where the air show was. The airport authority was taken off guard. “There’s no air show today,” he stammered. “Well,” the caller responded, “I’m watching KC-10’s and KC-135s painting low contrails over the West end of Toronto. I’m looking at them right now.” “Contrails!” The official was clearly taken aback, almost shouting the word “I have no information on that!” To the caller he actually sounded scared...before giving out the FAA number for noise control. EARLY CHRISTMAS Perhaps the most ludicrous official response came in March 1999 when a Michigan caller complained of three bouts of illness suffered by him and his girlfriend after heavy chemtrail activity. An FAA representative calmly explained the unusual aeria l activity as “delayed Christmas traffic.” THE AIR FORCE RESPONDS AGAIN AGAIN “The air force doesn’t do anything that emits anything other than a normal contrail, which is vapor,” U.S. Air Force spokeswoman Margaret Gidding informed the Spokesman-Review of Spokane, Washington in November, 1999. So was her story. USAF CALLS CHEMTRAILS, A “HOAX” Two years after their initial denials, an October 2001 public disinformation paper released by the United State Air Force called chemtrails a “hoax” perpetrat ed by people confused over contrails. According to this new spin: “The ‘Chemtrail’ hoax has been investigated and refuted by many established and accredited universities, scientific organizations, and major media publications” – who were either ordered or volunteering to avoid compromising national security. “The Air Force is not conducting any weather modification experiments or programs and has no plans to do so in the future,” the official statement concluded. This was an even bigger whopper, considering the activation of weather-altering HAARP and other atmospheric experiments ongoing since the late 1940s.

BLACKOUT Was a geoengineering project called “chemtrails” really underway? Stephen Schwartz, Senior Scientist for the Atmospheric Sciences Division of Brookhav en National Laboratory in Upton, New York could find no academic references. He wrote: “After fairly diligent search I am unable to find any information on this in the atmospheric science literature. Sorry. The literature I refer to is the published refereed literature in atmospheric science.” But “black projects” are not published in the scientific literature.

A recent list of formerly classified operations includes: “Operation Cloverleaf 9810109-V and 9910395-P closed 30 Nov 1999 and 03 Aug 2000.” Why was Cloverleaf “closed” twice?

I read the email you received from the anonymous mechanic and felt compelled to respond to it. I, too, work for an airline, though I work in upper management levels.

I wish I could document everything I am about to relate to you, but to do so is next to impossible and would result in possible physical harm to me. Airline companies in America have been participating in something called Project Cloverleaf for a few years now. The earliest date anyone remembers being briefed on it is 1998. I was briefed on it in 1999. The few airline employees who were briefed on Project Cloverleaf were all made to undergo background checks, and before we were briefed on it we were made to sign non- disclosure agreements, which basically state that if we tell anyone what we know we could be imprisoned. About twenty employees in our office were brie fed along with me by two officials from some government agency. They didn’t tell us which one. They told us that the government was going to pay our airline, along with others, to release special chemicals from commercial aircraft. When asked what the chemicals were and why we were going to spray them, they told us that information was given on a need-to-know basis and we weren’t cleared for it. They then went on to state that the chemicals were harmless, but the program was of such importance that it needed to be done at all costs. When we asked them why didn’t they just rig military aircraft to spray these chemicals, they stated that there weren’t enough military aircraft available to release chemicals on such a large basis as needs to be done. That’s why Project Cloverleaf was initiated, to allow commercial airlines to assist in releasing these chemicals into the atmosphere. Then someone asked why all the secrecy was needed. The government reps then stated that if the general public knew that the aircraft they were flying on were releasing chemicals into the air, environmentalist groups would raise hell and demand the spraying stop. Someone asked one of the G-men then if the chemicals are harmless, why not tell the public what the chemicals are and why we are spraying them? He seemed perturbed at this question and told us in a tone of authority that the public doesn’t need to know what’s going on, but that this program is in their best interests. He also stated that we should not tell anyone, nor ask any more questions about it. With that, the briefing was over. All documents in our office pertaining to Project Cloverleaf are kept in locked safes. Nobody is allowed to take these documents out of the o ffice. Very few employees are allowed access to these documents, and they remain tight-lipped about what the documents say. I am no fool. I know there’s something going on. And frankly, I am scared. I feel a hig h level of guilt that I have been aware of this kind of operation but unable to tell anyone. It’s been eating away at me, knowing that the company I work for may be poisoning the American people. I hope this letter will open some eyes to what’s happening. Again, I wish I could give you documented information, but you have to understand why I must remain totally anonymous.

The last two weeks have been horrendous. I finally got my wife to look up and notice--she, like everyone I mention it to, didn’t believe me. Two days ago we had one particular contrail that spread mostly across the metropolitan sky. It looked like a huge spine with all the nerve endings shooting out up and down the trail. I too have been sneezing uncontrollably - I have no allergies, and am not sick."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Very strange. I have tried to alert people here, but they are so complacent. I am outraged that we are being dumped on and no one is talking about in government or media circles. I don’t remember a clear day from morning to night fo r at least two years now. If there really aren’t “chemtrails” up there, then the planes are dumping more fuel than ever before. And that in itself is deadly to the environment and to U.S. Gary wrote me to describe a possible chem trail monitoring mission the previous day: My friend and I are spending the day in the foothills of the North Cascades, at Lake Cavanaugh, about 75 miles north of Seattle. Around noon we see massive “trails” crisscrossing each other and beginning to spread. A couple hours later they have spread to cover half the visible sky (from our vantage point, that is). The huge “rainbow” that is often reported to be seen around the sun through the “trails” was clearly visible. When we arrived home late that night (about 20 m iles north of Seattle in the Everett/Mill Creek area), I noticed a pen and ink sketch on the table. Actually, two sketches. I recognized it as the work of my friend’s daughter who is twenty years old. I’ll call her “Jane”. The one sketch showed two circles, one labeled “Sun” and the one around the “Sun” was labeled “Rainbow”. Obviously Jane had seen what we had seen. The other sketch, however, had me baffled. It was simply labeled with a “?” beside it. She said as she was gazing up at the “trails” she saw something emerge from one of them. She kept watching it descend as it floated northward. She could clearly see it was a parachute with a large, orange “ball” attached to the bottom of it. This is what she had attempted to sketch. I asked her if she had any idea how large it was. She didn’t but said she thought it must have been “pretty big” since she could see it so well. Perhaps chemtrail watchers should keep an eye out for orange balls on parachutes coming out of the chemtrails. They could be some sort of atmospheric monitoring devices. Two weeks later, on June 21, 2000, another commercial pilot reported to Rense: Today we g ot “pounded” with trails. My wife is a bus driver and calls me when she sees them working. I hold a commercial pilot license, but I am not flying much these days. The entire sky, from the major north/south airway (V121 that is predicated on the VOR on the Eugene Airport, just west of town) to as far as we could see east. They were rather high, I am guessing appeared about 25,000 feet, and very heavy. They created an obscured overcast to the east, as the prevailing winds aloft were from the west. There are over a dozen trails, each about a quarter mile apart. They spread out until they met each other."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Most of the spraying stopped after I contacted McCord Air Base last week saying we were filming these trails in the Portland area. They resumed with a vengeance yesterday, 6-20-00. If these were normal contrails in the north-south flyway, they would happen every day – not just certain days. And from the films we took and sent to LA it clearly shows only 4 planes: three white and one orange. I talked to the CDC yesterday and they said that ‘no one in America’ has reported these trails. The Portland Tower also denied any flyovers as I was standing outside watching them spray. Temperatures soared abnormally for 36 hours following south latitude strike. My eyes were itching and I had a rough throat for 24 hours after strike. Some other friends that were working outdoors felt abnormally tired and generally lethargic. BLACK LINED A growing number of chemtrail observers - inclu ding this reporter - are puzzled by an associated phenomenon we have only seen accompanying chemplanes. If the bl ack line observed ahead of these planes is a shadow cast by the sun, why aren’t we seeing it in front of much more prevalent airliners? In June 2000, while waiting for her car to be washed, a woman “studied the spray planes as they passed as specks overhead. I would guess at around 35,000 feet appearing to be about the same altitude as commercial aircraft cruise ‘cross the country.” She “was amazed to see a faint line projected from the nose of the plane directly in their projected path, which appeared to clear the mist or cloud matter that was ahead of them. This faint pathway was constantly projected about a forefinger’s length ahead of the jet, as I could watch it become visible at a constant distance ahead of the plane.” Sounds like Sweden. As this Swedish observer relates: For about two years, we have had heavy spraying al most every clear day. Usually, you find the same pattern that has been described from all over the world. On the day that this picture was taken, I found a strange dark shadow in front of the plane. The aircraft followed the dark “shadow line” in a perfect way, when it all of a sudden made a turn and moved away from it. I realized that this was some kind of line that the plane followed and not at all an illusion created by the plane. I have been watching these chemtrails for a long time, but this was something new. In June 2000 Nancy wrote, “While driving from Des Moines to Shenandoah, Iowa (rural Iowa), I saw a black line extend out from a plane I was watching. The subsequent chemtrail followed the black line exactly and then continued its formation without further visible black lines. When I saw the chemtrail following the black line, I thought to myself: This must be how they are able to create the patterns. A radio listener wrote in: The last massive “Spray Day” here was Sunday about two weeks ago. As I was waiting for my car to be washed I studied the spray planes as they passed as specks overhead. I would guess at around 35,000 feet appearing to be about the same altitude as commercial aircraft cruise ‘cross the country.

As it flew it flew directly on or just to the left of the line. HARASSED If nothing un usual was going on in allied airspace, why were chemtrails activists being harassed? Vicki’s photo-filled “purplehaze” website was hacked shortly before Christmas, 1999. A vexed Vicki reports “All the info from all the files (34 pages at the time) was deleted. The files themselves were left intact, all showing 0 bytes of info.” Offering frequently updated chemtrail news and photos, Clifford Carnicom’s website was knocked off the Internet at least three-times by extremely sophisticated viruses that this professional computer consultant insisted could not have been devised by amateur hackers. [carnicom.com] On September 8, 2000 aerial interlopers followed Kim Weber home. As the head of CACTUS (Citizens Against Chemtrails US) relates: Today I returned home from dropping my husband back to work after lunch – it was around 1:45. I was followed by a helicopter part of the way home. I reached the parking lot of our apartment complex and got out of the car. I literally stood there nearly five minutes leaning against the car with my legs crossed looking up as the helicopter hovered over me. A neighbor sitting outside on her stoop smoking saw the whole thing. Her jaw was hanging down around her chest. I just sent out yesterday beaucoup announcements about Blue Skies Intl. to radio/shortwave, webcasts, patriot groups, etc., some even overseas.  On September 26, Weber reported... We once again had a helicopter hover directly over us for a long period of time about 4:00 pm. in the parking lot of our apartment complex. We are carrying cameras at all times in an effort to catch this on film. As far as I know this is still the U.S. of America. If something should ever happen to us (and we will not go quietly into the night}, assume foul play. The next day she elaborated on the intimidation tactics she experienced since forming the grassroots chemtrails group, CACTUS: We’re carrying our cameras full time. I know I should probably be scared, but Will, I am not. Our telephone has been bugged for two years. The Army National Guard from VA tried to hack into my computer the last week of June and did a little damage to my start up. We’ve had helicopter flyovers now for about a year and two hover incidents. It just gets me angry. And when I get mad I work all that harder. I received this email in June 2003: "},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" A friend of mine, told me today, you were one of the people to talk to about this, and that you are either involved in one of the biggest organizations fo r investigating or researching chemtrails, or would know people that are heads of the best orgs in the nation. Well, we are involved. In fact, one my very top contacts for us, has just informed me, he is being harassed by the military. He had two black choppers fly over his house, and hover there, and fly away. Shortly after, an F-117 fighter jet flew in within 1000 feet above his home, and turned on the sprayer, and sprayed his area, and closest to his house the jet could. As soon as the jet made its pass, it quickly turned off the spray, and sharply turned, and went straight back towards Edwards AFB. I know this is for real! This one of our top men, and he has given us 100% reliable information for close to two years, so you can see why I am upset, worried and angry for! TROUBLE DOWN UNDER Matt Farmer lives in northern New South Wales, Australia about an eight hour drive north of Sydney, and an hour-and-a-half inland from the coast. Alerted by an article in Nexus magazine in 1998 commenting on spraying in Quindi, he and his wife began noticing “escalating” spraying over the next four years. Then what he terms a “silencing attempt” occurred when a Royal Australian Air Force F-18 “flew meters over the roof of my house, full throttle with both engines open, scaring the absolute #*@# out my partner and I and our two small children, while we were outside enjoying the mountain air.” Diving for cover, fearing they were being bombed, the jet screamed overhead and was gone, leaving the children “really traumatised.” Farmer said he was in shock for hours. “You can't hear these things coming until they are a second away,” he wrote. “I tried calling many air authorities and was just given the rigmarole soon realising no one was listening.” It later occurred to them that the day before, when his partner had been talking to her father in New Zealand about CT's and Pine Gap, she had mentioned that they would be taking part in a coming protest against U.S. forces at this Echelon eavesdroppi ng post. “They knew we were political activists and tried to silence us,” Farmer writes. The attempted intimidation backfired. “I am now in the process of making a documentary about CT's and building a website at nrg.com.au/~acro ,” he continued. (ACRO = Australian Chemtrail Research Organisation) “I am now working with many people in my local community to bring CT's to the forefront of the media or at least educate people about what they are, that they are what make us so sick, as well as the scalar and microwave weapons that they are using here too based at Pine Gap and a Queensland Military base. “I can't sit back and watch any more and wish they weren’t here, so this is a start to what I must do, for the sake of the future which is our children. I am here to help humanity and mother earth. I care so much, and will not accept injustice and tyranny or biological warfare on any scale and I believe that so many others would do the same too, if only they knew it were happening, that’s the biggest problem we face: people’s ignorance and apathy.” SPRAY PLANES An investigation by Mother Jones magazine has documented how $100 million-a-day “back door” transfers of tax dollars are used to fund the Pentagon’s black operations. None of this money – or the projects it funds – is accountable to Congress or the American people."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" SPRAY PLANE BASES Outside Dobbins Air Base in Marietta, Georgia, one observer writes: “We drove up to a light and saw the runway, and saw a large, white plane, with a blue stripe, no markings at all, taxiing to take off.” A delivery person at Tinker AFB states “I have seen more than 30 of these white, KC-135s parked on the tarmac. I have seen six to 10 take off, one after another. They are, indeed, white with no markings.” The white planes have also been spotted at a former AFB near Phoenix, and at the previously closed George AFB in the Mojave Desert. One correspondent claims to have personally seen the spray planes taking off from and landing at McGuire AFB in New Jersey. Active in the Canadian military “since my birth,” Bryan says, “What I have noticed is that unusual trails have been coming from white USAF KC-135s heading to Shilo, Alaska.” Marcus Dalton concluded by asking a question on many minds: “Where is the mainstream media’s reporting of this mass phenomenon?” CONCEALED WEAPON? While serving in the U.S. Air Force, Ziad Haik photographed what appears to be a tail sprayer replacing the KC-10 tanker’s standard refueling probe. Whatever this is, it certainly won’t fit the refueling probe from an F-16! A front-page article published in the Journal identified an obscure program at Kirtland AFB called “Agent Conceal Weapon.” The logo showed clouds with big blue drops coming out of them, and a beaker of bubbling chemicals, divided by a bolt of lightning. Another tip-off to tanker s came on March 2, 2000 when the Associated Press reported that hundreds of KC- 135s had been grounded to fix problems in their tail feathers. The next day, the chemtrail tracking center in Houston reported that daily spraying over the U.S. had suddenly dropped from 24 to just two locations – where KC-10s had most likely taken over. When the big jets were returned to service the following week, Chemtrail sightings climbed right back to previous levels. "},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" PHOENIX RISING Sid has been investigating chemtrail activity for more than four years. It’s hard to avoid, living in Phoenix. “As you are probably aware, we have missed our monsoon season for the last three years,” he writes. “No accident! I’ve watched the Citation and Lear type jets destroy the oncoming storms for the last three years. KCs also!” On Oct 6, 2002, while visiting Deer Park airport outside of Phoenix, Sid “got lucky, and got up close and personal photos from a few feet away of the adaptations made to the Citation Bravo atmospheric test aircraft. Of particular interest were the big vents in the fuselage and small nozzle under each engine.  Sid sent copies of his photos to Cessna and Pratt & Whitney’s corporate headquarters. “P&W responded with a phone call and subsequent emails,” Sid relates. ”What I can tell you now is that the engineers had no idea what the modifications were for. I think they do now! As far as I’m aware, it’s the only photographic proof of the engine modifications used to spray Dyn-O-Mat or whatever to suppress rain clouds.” "},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"CHEMTRAILS TAUGHT IN U.S. SCHOOLS A is for Apple. B is for Boy. C is for Chemtrails. At least this is what one American father found. Recently checking out his children’s science book, “SMT” was astonished to find seventh graders being taught about chemtrails. And geoengineering the planet. Anyone with question about the “spray programs”, he now says, “should perhaps just ask their kids.” The chemtrails section is found in the Centre Point Learning Science I Essential Interactions science book. Under “Solutions for Global Warming”, section 5.19 features a photo of a big multi-engine jet with a familiar orange/red paint scheme. The caption reads: “Figure 1- Jet engines running on richer fuel would add particles to the atmosphere to create a sunscreen”. The logo on the plane says: “Particle Air”. “I kid you not,” SMT insists. “Why did I spend all of that time doing research when I could have just asked my kids?” Helping habituate children to a life of lethal sunshine and “protective” spray planes, this trippy textbook urges young readers to “Use Sun Block”. But its authors are referring to a sunscreen spread across the sky. “Could we deliberately add particles to the atmosphere?” asks the text, before helpfully suggesting that “Burning coal adds soot to the air.” In a country whose self-appointed regime routinely censors scientific studies, at least some 7 th grade science are more focused on indoctrinating kids with risky techno “quick-fixes” than conscious conservation and common sense. Forget science. SMT gazed in disbelief at another schoolbook picture showing a helicopter seeding the ocean with iron particles. These desperate “IronX” experiments did indeed cause plankton “blooms” that, in turn, transferred tons of atmospheric C02 underwater as these carbon-inhaling critters eventually died and sank to the seafloor. But – oops! – his kids’ science book fails to mention that the resulting algae-like blooms sucked all available oxygen from the seawater, creating suffocating all marine life in massive “dead zones”. Where are the picture, SmT wonders, “of people planting trees, or turning down thermostats, or bicycling, or any of the other ways not to add to the problem?” Though his family gave up the idea of home schooling, he says, “It’s perhaps time to reconsider.” Perhaps it’s also time to reconsider state-sponsored brainwashing. And other escalating consequences of our carbon addiction, as well.

Some were just the standard straight line contrails, but others were the puffy, spreading chemtrail types. Indoctrination starts early.” "},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" Chapter 9. BREAKTHROUGH The first crack in the dam of denial erected by offici als insisting that sky-clogging, never-before-seen jet trails are “normal airline operations” came in the winter of 2000. A brief message left by a conscientious airport official would eventually travel from a concerned citiz en’s answering machine to this investigator’s tape player. And the chemtrails conundrum would have some answers at last. According to the city caller and many other ey e-witnesses, similar unusual plume patterns had been spread by large four-engine jets over Victoria for the past two years – most often on weekends. The aircraft had been photo-identified as USAF KC-135 tankers - often silver and sometimes all-white in color. A check with the air force found that the official aluminum coloration for its tanker aircraft has recently been changed to an all-white paint scheme. Similarly spaced sky patterns, disturbingly different than normal contrails, prompted the December 7 call to the Victoria International Airport. Months later, when the micro-cassette containing Stewart’s call made its way through Internet links, phone calls and Canada Post and began playing on a miniature tape player, the reply from the airport manager for planning and the environment blew me out of my chair. The following unedited transcript is a recorded message from a December 8, 2000 call by a Canadian aviation authority from the Victoria International Airport to a local resident. "},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Stewart was responding to a call the previous day dem anding to know why intense aerial activity had left lingering X’s, circles and grid-like plumes over the British Columbia capitol on December 6 and 7: “Mark, it’s Terry Stewart, Victoria Airport Authority. Ju st calling you back from your comment. From what I gather, it’s a military exercise; U.S. and Canadian air force exercise that’s goin’ on. They wouldn’t give me any specifics on it. Hope that helps your interest. Very odd. Thanks a lot. Bye-bye now.” CLICK HERE FOR TERRY STEWART’S CALL Bye-bye “airliners”. For the first time, an aviation official at a major airport had confirmed that the chemtrails were coming from a military operation. Since joint U.S.-Canadian military exercises have been going on for decades, I also found it intriguing that an aviation authority at one of Canada’s busiest international airports would refer to this particular operation as “very odd.” A call to Leftenant John Coppard at the Comox Canadian Forces air base north of Vancouver elicited a brief official response from Canada’s primary air defence base on the west coast. “No such joint operation exists,” Coppard claimed. But it was too late for Coppard to cope. The operation had already been confirmed. “Chemtrails has become the bane of my existence,” Stewart later told the Vancouver Courier . “It’s caused nothing but embarrassment. My uncle in L.A. even phoned me one night to say that a late night talk show host mentioned my name in his monologue.” The ground-level airport manager was also red-flagged at the U.S. border. “I may be getting paranoid,” Stewart added, “but the last few times I visited the U.S., the border guards really grilled me and made me cool my heels, as if they suspected me of being a whacko.” Or they wanted to know how much he knew. A March 20, 2001 Lifeboat News press release sent to news agencies across Canada was headlined: “‘Chemtrails’ Confirmed As USAF “Military Operation” In Canadian Skies”. Instead of investigating this encroachment on Canadian sovereignty and serenity, my opic “news” organizations kept their corporate gaze averted from the skies directly over their heads . But more pieces of the chemtrails puzzle would soon be disclosed from higher-level source. CANADIAN SOVEREIGNTY? The quiet sp lash of a kayak’s double-paddle carried clearly over waters calm enough to mirror the sky. It was one of those magical afternoons, with a small wooden boat and its master suspended in time and space. As Chimera’s long wooden prow drew a “V” toward the snow-capped mountains of Vancouver Island, I looked up and cursed the telltale X’s stretching from horizon to horizon across the Channel-like Strait of Georgia. Would the meddling Weather Force Specialists from that other country to the south never stop stealing our sovereignty – and skies? Across the strait, chemtrail-watcher and webmaster Richard Vizzutti was enduring the same assault. “Rick,” I wrote, “more than 27 continuous hours here – biggest chemtrails assault I have ever seen in this area.” “Major attack yesterday! No storm front moving in though, according to the weather report,” Rick Vizzutti replied. “The attack we had was a typical heavy attack day for us. Just have not seen a heavy attack for a while."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"I noticed that they preceded the cumulous clouds that came in today.

Shasta is a desecration of sacred ground - right up there with the chemtrails laid over the ruins of the Twin Towers. “We live in Mt. Shasta, California, close to the Or egon border. I observed a very strange black jet that was spraying a black substance all above the town. He made several swipes, not just one fly-by. This was just before the 9-11 episode. I told my husband about it and he thought I was crazy.” Tammy wrote. “We see these chemtrails all the time in our area.

Brendt awoke and entered the kitchen of her country home in Parsonsfield, Maine. As she poured her first cup of coffee, the late night reporter for WMWV radio could not guess that her life was minutes away from drastic change. Her partner Lou Aubuchont was already up, puzzling over what he had seen in the sky a half hour before. The fat puffy plumes arching up over the horizon were unlike any contrail he had ever seen, even during his hitch in the Navy. The pencil-thin condensation trails he was used to observing are pretty to watch but short-lived, subliming into invisibility as hot aircraft engine exhaust gases cool quickly to the surrounding air temperature. But in late 1997 Aubuchont had started observing thicker ‘trails extending from horizon to horizon. Hanging in the sky long after their creators had fl own from view, these expanding white ribbons would be invariably interwoven by more thick lines left by unmarked jets, air force white or silver in color. On this March 12 morning in 2001, Lou did not mention his sighting as S.T. indulged in caffeine. Sipping gratefully, she glanced out the window. It looked like another gorgeous, cloudless day. But not quite. Brendt balked at two chalk marks scr awled across the crystalline blue sky. “Contrails or chemtrails?” she jokingly remarked. "},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Lou got up and looked. “What kind of clouds run exactly side-by-side in a straight line?” she wondered out loud. It was just too perfect to happen naturally. When Lou said he wasn’t sure, S.T. stopped smiling and went outside. Looking up towards the southeast over West Pond, she spotted the first jet. A second jet was laying billowing white banners to the north. Both aircraft appeared to be over 30,000 feet. Turning her gaze due west, Brendt saw two more lines extending over the horizon. She called Lou. Within 45 minutes the couple counted 30 jets. This isn’t right , S.T. thought. We just don’t have that kind of air traffic here. While Lou kept counting, she went inside and started calling airports. One official she reached was guarded but friendly. He had relatives in West Pond. The Air Traffic Control manager told Brendt her sighting was “unusual”. His radars showed nine commercial jets during the same 45-minute span. From her location, he said, she should have been able to see one plane. And the other 29? The FAA official confided off the record that he had been ordered “by higher civil authority” to re-route inbound European airliners away fr om a “military exercise” in the area. “Of course they wouldn’t give me any of the particulars and I don’t ask,” he explained. “I just do my job.” Excited and puzzled by this information, S.T. and Lou got into their car and headed down Route 160. Looking in any direction they could see five or six jets flying over 30,000 ft. Never in the dozen years they’d lived in rural Maine, had they seen so much aerial activity. As a former U.S. Navy intelligence courier, Aubuchont was used to large-scale military exercises. But he told S.T. he had never seen anything this big. “It looked like an invasion,” he later recounted. Another driver almost went off the road as he leaned over his dashboard trying to look up. As they passed, he acknowledged them with a nod. As far as they could see stretched line after line. Two giant grids were especially blatant. Instead of dissipating like normal contrails, these sky trails grew wider and wider and began to merge. Looking towards the sun, Aubuchont saw what looked like “an oil and water mixture” reflecting a prismatic band of colors. He couldn’t call it a rainbow. Rainbows aren’t sinister. "},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" As Lou and S.T. completed their errands, the jets kept them company, leaving lines and circles that resembled smoke rings. Even living near Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark jetports, Aubuchont had never seen so many big jets performing identical maneuvers in the same sky. When they returned to Parsonsfield around four, the lines were starting to merge into a dingy haze. Richard Dean called back. After receiving ST’s message, the assistant WMWV news director had gone outside with other news staff and counted 370 lines in skies usually devoid of aerial activity. Brendt put in another call to the FAA official. He had never heard of chemtrails. But similar military activities were ongoing in other regions. His radars showed the aircraft – which he identified as U.S. Air Force tankers – flying north into Canada... Brendt’s “Deep Sky” source later agreed to go on record. In taped three interviews with this veteran radio reporter – two of which took place before witnesses at WMWV - the senior Air Traffic Control manager repeated and developed, “for the record” the information he initially relayed to Brendt in their initial phone conversation. He also answered sp ecific questions relayed from this writer. CLICK HERE FOR ‘DEEP SKY” INTERVIEW The following press release went out to all major print and broadcast media across Canada and the USA: FAA OFFICIAL CONFIRMS AIR FORCE CONDUCTING WEATHER MODIFICATION OVER U.S. AND CANADA by William Thomas and S.T. Brendt PORTLAND, Maine (March, 2001) A senior air traffic control manager responsible for commercial aircraft over the northeastern United States has confirmed in a second exclusive interview with radio reporter S.T. Brendt that large formations of U.S. Air Force tanker aircraft are conducting ongoing operations over the USA and Canada. The sky-obscuring chemicals laid down in crissc ross patterns by the big jets have been observed by thousands of eyewitnesses across North America over the past two years. In a corroborative statement, a Canadian Airport Authority for airport planning and environment at Victoria International Airport confirmed on December 8, 2000 that grid patterns and X’s laid by tanker aircraft over the British Columbia capitol on December 7 was “a joint U.S.-Canadian military operation.” When asked the purpose of these missions, the FAA official said he was told “weather modification” after a “higher civil authority” ordered him to divert incoming trans-Atlantic airliners around military formations flying over 37,000 feet on March 12, 20 and 21, 2001. On Monday, March 12, reporter Brendt and her partner Lou Aubuchont counted 30 aircraft laying down a lingering gridwork of several hundred plumes between 12:05 and 12:55 p.m. Aubuchont, who witnessed many military maneuvers during his stint as a courier in U.S. Navy Intelligence, said he had never seen anything like it. “It looked like an invasion,” he told this reporter. Aubuchont emphasized that unlike aerial battle exercises, the tankers were unescorted by combat helicopters or fighter jets. “It was just tankers.” After being contacted at a major metropolitan airport by Brendt, the ATC manager drove to her home on Monday; March 26 to see for himself how many commercial jets would be visible from her location. The FAA official counted just three jets “off in the distance” between 12:05 and 12:55 p.m."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Of the nine jets on his radarscope during that same time period on March 12, the official told Brendt she should have been able to see only one from her location. Instead, she and Aubuchont counted 30. The flights continued all day. Such cloudy radar returns are consistent with cl ouds of talcum-fine aluminum particles released by high-flying tankers in a process USAF Weather Force Specialists term, “aerial obscuration.” The Air Traffic Control manager admitted that the chemicals sprayed by the tankers degraded ATC radar returns. When asked if this posed a threat to flight safety, he replied, “not from my perspective.” But the ATC manager added that similar military operations have been carried out “on other dates” and “other regions” in the USA. When asked whether the air force jets crossed into Canadian air space, he replied “yes.” Corporate media ignored this taped evidence – just as its editors and producers continue to ignore thousands of public reports and photographs, virtual miles of videotape (often their own footage inadvertently catching chemtrailed skies), and certified sample analysis carried out by certified laboratories. In a third follow-up interview, Brendt and I decided to play a hunch. Referring to the mission objectives, the ATC manager had actually said that weather modification “approximates” what he had been told. We guessed that “climate modification” was more accurate. When Brendt questioned Deep Sky again regarding the purpose of the spray planes, he agreed that “climate” modification was the word used by higher authorities calling for airspace to be cleared for the big military jets. Fitrakis cited the example of the West-Quebec Post, which in May 2001 had spread chemtrails photographs across its front page. Post publisher Fred Ryan reported that his readers had been photographing and comparing the aerial activity for some time.” [Columbus Alive Mar 27/02] "},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":" Chapter 11. CHEMTRAILS 9/11 Who stood down U.S. air defenses on the morning of September 11, 2001? Diverted by simultaneous distant air defense drills ordered for that morning by Vice President Dick Cheney – and forbidden to intercept radio-silent airliners on the first notifications of NORAD and air traffic controllers because Defense Secretary had suddenly rewritten long-standing rules requiring immediate scrambles – many air force pilots were kept busy chasing bogus radar blips. Air National Guard pilots waiting on 24-hour alert pads in fully armed aircraft near the Pentagon were never launched. Two other “ready alert” jets were launched late from Cape Cod, then directed to fly slower than the hijacked airliners they were supposedly pursuing! Virginia fighter pilots were also launched late, then redirected away from known threats over the empty Atlantic Ocean. Two other Air Guard jets on a training mission within minutes of Manhattan could have easily intercepted the Twin Towers attackers. But they were neither notified nor diverted from their practice bombing runs.

The other order given by the vice-president resulted in the shoot down of Flight 93 over a little town in Pennsylvania by a pursuing F-16. [Days Of Deception: Ground Zero And Beyond by William Thomas] This much is documented. This much we know. And yet the complete U.S. media black-out surrounding these events – as well as the repeated blocking by Bush administration officials of CIA and U.S. military investigations and interrogations that would have captured several of the hijackers, including alleged ringleader Mohamed Atta, weeks before the attacks – demonstrate how even lesser evils like chemtrails can be successfully kept from public purview. Even when those telltale lines in the sky are so persistently scrawled right over our heads. As I later wrote in All Fall Down: The Politics of Terror and Mass Persuasion – the first book published on 9/11: We came to this moment in ways and places we will never forget, holding our TV clickers as gingerly as betraying wands summoning evil jinn. We watched slack-jawed, silent or silently cursing, unable to grasp what we were seeing. The images were grotesque, impossible, preposterous. Assailed by revulsion and vertigo, unable to look away, we watched hypnotized by horro r as endless replays relentlessly revealed huge airliners floating through the air – too low! too low! – before banking like fighters to harpoon twin skyscrapers taller than three Titanics stood on-end. Staring like passengers assured of the absolute impossibility of the disaster now unfolding, we discovered that big buildings are just as vulnerable as big ships to the inexorable laws of mass, inertia, and gravity. Not since the funeral of a princess did an entire grieving world gape so grimly at the same event. From sunny fishing villages in Honshu, to sleepy European capitals, a bungalow in Maine, a hideout fitted with life-support for a Saudi millionaire...voices in a babble of dialects were shouting the same four words: “Turn on your TV!” One billion of us did. And in the glow that replaced archaic campfires with flickering images watched by a global tribe, something in us died as suddenly and irrevocabl y as those kindred lives before our stricken eyes. Gone in a heartbeat, gone forever was the illusion of our pampered invulnerability. Tragically, ominously, ironically and incontrovertibly, the immediate aftermath of Black Tuesday would also prove conclusively that chemtrails had nothi ng to do with commercial airliners or contrails. "},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" CHEMTRAILS CONFIRMED On September 12, I knew only that indeed the world had changed – and not in ways that bode well. Seeking my bearings, and wanting to top off my trim aran’s water tanks for whatever came next, I sailed to Deep Bay in the Strait of Georgia off Canada’s west coast. With all commercial flights grounded, the sky was startlingly clear. Chemtrails were the furthest thing from my thoughts. But there they were. Directly overhead! Under the ultimate command authority of Bush and Rumsfeld, the unmistakable sky-smearing plumes seemed to mock the very notion of mourning. Given the circumstances, these fresh desecrations seemed outrageously obscene. And incredibly arrogant. No one could argue their provenance now. Except for a few military aircraft, and the chartered jet whisking a planeload of bin Laden family members beyond the reach of the FBI, all airliners were grounded. Yet, throughout the unprecedented four-day shutdown of all commercial aviation in Canada and the USA, heavy chemtrail activity continued to be re ported over Vancouver and Vancouver Island in Canada, as well as Chicago, Illinois and Columbus, Ohio – among many other locations. What could be deemed critical enough to continue chemtrail operations in the midst of global grief and shock? That dark day, Caroline voiced the sentiments of many chemtrail watchers when she wrote on September 11 to say, “With all this national state of security business going on right now, you’d think, they wouldn’t have the time or the resources to continue to chem up the skies with that muck, but they’re right on track and still at it, spraying their chemtrails all over the place, right here in Vancouver anyways.” Caroline had just returned from northern Saskatc hewan after 11days, where she’d found “They’ve got ‘em just like we do. I don’t think you can find a corner or crevice in North America that doesn’t have this crap dumped on them. Anyways it really puzzles me with all of the air traffic today supposedly at standstill, yet we’re still getting chemtrailed to bits.” Still reeling from images of a massacre in Manhattan, Rosalie wrote from Chicago: A lot of planes today, I noticed about 4 pm, some planes lower than others, the low ones you could see th at the emission was from the rear of the plane. They were in two’s and three’s, seemed to be centering overhead, some were circling back. We are 40 miles south of the quad- cities at the river, and about 100 miles southwest of Chicago. I had not noticed contrails lately. I am wondering why the trails would b e overhead here today, to my knowledge there is nothing military here except for the National Guard, it is rural agricultural here, just a few factories where they make rubber goods, Maytag, Carhartt, etc. Also from Chicago: “Last night between 1:15-1:30 a.m. I saw no less than 10 chemtrails overhead in the classic grid pattern, two of which were parallel heading south and then hard banked to the east. These were big, big trails. Biologicals perhaps? God forbid.” The following day, Bonnie wrote from Maidstone to report, “On September 12, 2001, when all air traffic was supposed to be grounded, they were right over my house in Maidstone, Ontario spraying those chemtrails.” Reporting for Chemtrail Tracking USA in Houston, Lorie Kramer disclosed that on September 12, with the grounding order still in effect, chemtrails were observed over Maidstone, Ontario as well as Indianapolis and Fort Wayne, Indiana; Lexington, Kentucky; southern Illinois; Detroit, Baltimore, Maryland; Eugene, Oregon and Houston, Texas:"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" Between 4-6 am skies became filled with wispy chemtrails could not see planes during this time. Planes sighted about 25,000 ft up making CT’s at 5:57 am: two X’s made over skies in northwestern suburbs. One plane made one X and two planes made the second X. They then turned off the sprays and increased altitude and flew out of area going west. X’s remained in skies till at least 7:45 am. At 8:30 – 9 am two planes spotted over Livonia area making a chemtrail in shape of a circle. 10:30 am: Feather-like trails and lines present in the southern skies. Northern skies have lines that have spread out into chemclouds going eas t and west. Chemdome in place from Westland area to Troy and all areas in between. In Houston, Texas: “Heavy grid spraying north of H ouston. I could easily hear these planes fly directly overhead. What’s wrong with this picture? There are trails being laid in semi-circle patterns to the southwest of town. Call into area officials. “I saw the plane! No, this is not normal air traffic, because there is not supposed to be any air traffic.” In Los Angeles: As you all know, the airport here is shut down as well as a lot of other stuff. When the marine layer broke this morning there was an immense HAARP cloud canopy above it from horizon to horizon. Apparently offshore spraying was going on big time all night and probably right up until the attacks took place...It’s my under-standing that the ban only applies to commercial air traffic, and this definitely appeared to be a military jet, going N to S directly over Santa Monica at 7:10 pm. In Eugene, Oregon: “After watching the horrors on TV yesterday, I at least thought that our skies would be clear here in Eugene, Oregon. Not so. Although I saw no direct overflights, the sky was filled, all day with long clouds that moved in from upwind. The clouds early today look highly suspect.” In Indianapolis, Don went outside to go to work Wednesday morning: I look up as I usually do, but this time thinking there would be no Chemtrails because for the first time none of the 4,000 daily flights would be up there. I was absolutely floored when most of the sky was covered with Chemtrails. I know the ch aracteristic tendrils and patterns of Chemtrails, and these were them! They also were about 3-4 hours old for the most part because I also know how long Chemtrails take to reach certain stages of spreading. If you ever needed proof for government planes c ausing the Chemtrails, this is it! It was impossible for these to be contrails from commercial planes, because there were zero commercial planes. They must have felt the need to spray during the night, because people would have been alarmed if they saw aircraft flyi ng when all flights were grounded. People might think they are terrorists (not far from true) and bring much attention to them. It’s ironic that bin Laden would be the one to provide positive proof of spraying for you and put an end to it through your efforts armed with this absolute truth. So, please hurry to close this chapter out! On September 11, Lexington, Kentucky basked under a perfect clear blue sky, “for the first time in years” Laura reported. “I guessed that with the airports shut down the chemical-spraying tankers were also grounded. Unfortunately, Wednesday afternoon spraying resumed.”"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" MINNIS’ MISCUE Meanwhile, NASA’s most vocal contrail expert, Dr. Patrick Minnis was achieving national prominence after taking advantage of the emergency grounding order issued to study U.S. skies in the absence of airliners. On September 12, 2001, during a time of worldwide shock and grief, the chemtrails debunker was cited in the Louisville Courier Journal and the New York Times for collecting “valuable data” on contrails during a period when the only planes in the air were nine military flights crossing the skies from Ohio to Virginia. In story slugged, “Empty Sky Aids Study”, the New York Times reported Minnis exulting in the valuable data on “contrails” he’d collected from those nine missions. The NASA research scientist explained how his team was able to chart “precisely how these contrails fanned out over five hours to form a shield of cirrus clouds covering over 24,000 square miles.” Yet NASA’s official website presumes that “contrails persist for one hour only.” NASA scientists further estimate that a rare, persistent contrail “spreads to two kilometers wide and has a length of 60 kilometers.” Was Minnis studying chemtrails? Along with contr adicting NASA’s published contrail information, his miscue graphically demonstrated the difference betw een military aircraft emissions and the civilian variety by recording long-lingering ‘trails behind nine special military aircraft – type not revealed. MORE SKEPTICS BITE THE CHEMTAIL DUST Less than one month after the horror and cover-up of 911, it was chemtrails-as-usual over the land of the less free, and its northern neighbor. In Hamilton, Ontario, the spraying was so heavy, family members Leander, Stephanie and Arthur Zimmerman began making connections between their health and the skies overhead. "},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" As Leander Zimmerman relates: I started becoming aware of a chronic bronchial congestion that still persists today. After submitting sputum samples to my doctor on two occasions and receiving negative results for typical bronchial microorganisms, I began to questi on the cause of my persistent illness. During the weeks to follow my father and I also began noticing bizarre cloud formations and we recalled an article that we had previously read about mysterious “chemtrails”. Initially, Stephanie Holliday and the Zimmermans “were skeptical of the chemtrail theories.” But Leander Zimmerman relates how “that all changed one afternoon in late January when I emerged from my grandparents’ home to see a perfectly linear cloud formation stretching across the entire sky.” As he scanned the sky for the aircraft responsible, Leander “was astounded to see an aerial spraying operation taking place with some six or seven jets in participation. Each plane was leaving a long thin dense white trail behind that would not dissipate.” Leander was familiar with the existence of jet condensation trails. But he had never witnessed anything like this before. “Over a period of an hour or so, the trails slowly widened before transforming into cirrus-like cloud formations. After several hours, the sky was blanketed with a thin haze, accompanied by cirrocumulus- like waves, a cirrostratus-like blanket and cirrus-li ke wisps. Although these cloud types are perfectly natural, I was amazed that I had just witnessed a cloud manufacturing operation,” he later said. Leander Zimmerman quickly accumulated more than two hours of video clips showing chemtrails spreading over his Ontario city. The intruders are coming up from the ‘States. As he related: Most of these large high-flying white jet planes we witness making “chemtrails” appear to originate from the United States, flying north and northwest from over Lake Ontario. Multiple jets take part in these operations forming all sorts of cloud patterns including grids, X-shapes, multiple parallel lines, and curved trails (including U-shapes). However, the majority of sprayings randomly blanket the sky without any set formations. The planes can be observed making lasting chemtrails in the same sky as other [planes] simply leaving behind rapidly dissipating contrails. The heaviest spraying operations appear to take place in the early morning just before and after sunrise and continue all day. Other heavy sprayings take place above naturally existing cloud covers. The “chemtrails” and “chemclouds” can be seen in breaks in the natural cloud cover. Some operations take place at night or during the early morning hours. The planes are much lower and can be heard passing over repeatedly. On at least four occasions, my family has been kept awake as planes passed over our house every five to 10 minutes for about an hour. One night in May at about midnight, my father and I watched as two “chemjets” flew overhead in perfect tandem, leaving behind the long trails barely visible in the glow of the urban lights below. A couple of weeks ago, my father and grandparents witnessed a plane leave a chemtrail underneath the full moon on a cloudless night. Later on, the jets could be heard flying back and forth across the sky. The haze produced by the chemtrails refracts lig ht, occasionally producing rainbow-like rings around the sun and moon. The “chemclouds” seem much more reflective than natural clouds at night. The skies have recently been covered by this white haze. Is this the same white haze that Teller says will remain in the sky for five years at a time as it is compounded by continuous aerial scattering operations?"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The Zimmermans collected samples of chemtrail fallout on three occasions. Each sample came from rainwater falling through chemtrail-laden air. But they could have combed it out of their hair. As Leander Zimmerman explained, “A heavy cover of silver-brown powder – sometimes a very fine fibrous deposit – is most visible on neighbourhood automobiles. Could these strange particles be the cause of my congestion?” Arthur Zimmerman holds a PhD in Engineering. A BILL TO BAN CHEMTRAILS On October 2, 2001, Representative Dennis Kucinich tabled House Resolution 2977 before the 107 th session of the U.S. Congress. His SPACE PRESERVATION ACT OF 2001 was intended “To preserve the cooperative, peaceful uses of space for the benefit of all humankind by permanently prohibiting the basing of weapons in space by the United States, and to require the President to take action to adopt and implement a world treaty banning space-based weapons.” Under Section 3 callin g for a PERMANENT BAN ON BASING OF WEAPONS IN SPACE, The President shall-- (1) implement a permanent ban on space-based weapons of the United States and remove from space any existing space-based weapons of the United States; and (2) immediately order the permanent termination of research and development, testing, manufacturing, production, and deployment of all space-based weapons of the United States and their components. The kicker came in Section 7, where DEFINITIONS of weapons and technologies to be banned included: (ii) Inflicting death or injury on, or damaging or destroying, a person (or the biological life, bodily health, mental health, or physical and economic well-being of a person)-- (II) through the use of land-based, sea-based, or space-based systems using radiation, electromagnetic, psychotronic, sonic, laser, or other energies directed at individual persons or targeted populations for the purpose of information war, mood management, or mind control of such persons or populations; or (III) by expelling chemical or biologica l agents in the vicinity of a person. (B) Such terms include exotic weapons systems such as-- (i) electronic, psychotronic, or information weapons; (ii) chemtrails ; (iii) high altitude ultra low frequency weapons systems; (iv) plasma, electromagnetic, sonic, or ultrasonic weapons; (v) laser weapons systems; (vi) strategic, theater, tactical, or extraterrestrial weapons; and (vii) chemical, biological, environmental, climate, or tectonic weapons . (C) The term `exotic weapons systems’ includes weapons designed to damage space or natural ecosystems (such as the ionosphere and upper atmosphere) or climate, weather, and tectonic systems with the purpose of inducing damage or destruction upon a target population or region on earth or in space. "},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" INTERNATIONAL CHEMTRAILS AND HAARP BAN PASSED BY THE UNITED NATIONS Fitrakis found this own NG0 chemtrails proposal circulating among the major European nations, where the subject of “chemtrails” was being actively debated. It turned out that HR 2977 was actually modeled on a previous UN General Assembly Resolution 55/32 calling for a Permanent Ban on Basing Weapons in Space. This international resolution was passed 138 to 0, with just three abstentions, Fitrakis reports – the “United States, Israel and Micronesia, under U.S. domination.” Signed by all but three members of the 141 member General Assembly, Article 5(3) of this international treaty also bans “chemtrails.” Under immense political pressure, HR 2977 was withdrawn. A replacement measure tagged HR 3616 no longer referred to “chemtrails”. CONGRESSIONAL CLASH OVER CHEMTRAILS More down-to-Earth chemtrail combatants took a legislative approach. On October 2, 2001, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich brought a bill to ban chemtrails before Congress. Kucinich’s “Space Preservation Act of 2001” was intended “To preserve the cooperative, peaceful uses of space for the benefit of all human-kind by permanent ly prohibiting the basing of weapons in space by the United States, and to require the President to take action to adopt and implement a world treaty banning space-based weapons.” En route to the Committee on Science, and the Committees on Armed Services and International Relations, House Resolution 2977 reaffirmed the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, which states that it “is the policy of the United States that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind.” VISION 2020 “The truth is there’s an entire program in the Department of Defense, ‘Vision for 2020,’ that’s developing these weapons,” Representative Kucinich told reporter Bob Fitrakis. Released by the U.S. Space Command in 1998, “Vision for 2020” called for “Full Spectrum Dominance” of space, land, sea and air superiority. Total military control of Planet Earth and near-Earth orbit by the world’s sole superpower is the final step in achiev ing the Bush “National Security Strategy”, which authorizes “first-strike” use of nuclear weapons in order to assure “global domination” by the United States. As the news of HR2977 lit up the chemtrails community like a thunderbolt, the furor in the Science Committee threatened to scuttle a bill aimed pr imarily at keeping weapons out of space. HR3616 was quickly substituted. Submitted on January 23, 2002, this new “Space Preservation Act of 2002” omitted all mention of “chemtrails”. As Carol Rosin, President of the Institute for Cooperation in Space, explained to outraged chemtrails activists, the switched bills many saw as a betrayal “simply makes it likely that more congress representatives will sign-on to the bill with less debate and controversy.” As Rosin elaborated, “the ‘chemtrail’ issue...and other specific weapon systems were becoming a distraction from the intent of the bill. It is time for everyone to rise above the negatives and their differences, and to help get this World Treaty and legislation signed into law before Bush breaks the ABM Treaty – at which time he will deploy space-based weapons under the guise of merely testing.”"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"But compromising over chemtrails surrendered the entire bill After looking at the replacement bill, Dr. Len Horowitz protested: “In the new bill, however, all of these protections were removed leaving citizens susceptible to control and attack with such “exotic weapons systems” directed by agencies and organizations” detailed in his extensively documented books. Congressman Kucinich deserved major kudos for putting “chemtrails” on the Congressional agenda. After years of being called “hoaxers” and “UFO nuts”, people who knew that what they are seeing, smelling, sampling and photographing is real could take hea rt that chemtrails are finally, officially on the Congressional record. No amendments have been made to the original HR-2977 . Technically, this bill still exists. It remains in “referral” limbo before the same Science Committee whose protest led to its hasty withdrawal. HR-2977 can be revived at any time. MYSTERY OF THE MISSING CHEMTRAILS LEGISLATION Kucinich’s bid to make chemtrails illegal did not make the evening news. As Bob Fitrakis later told me, “Sources close to Kucinich’s new bill, HR 3616, which has been endorsed by some 254 community groups throughout the nation, say that the term ‘chemtrail’ was dropped because Kucinich couldn’t get the Union of Concerned Scientists or the Federation of American Scientists to sign on.” Fitrakis later learned that international symposiums on changing the atmosphere of planets such as Mars – a process called terraforming – have engaged in active discussions since at least 1955. “DEEP SKY” MAKES SOME CALLS Less than th ree months after the traumatic events of September 11, the senior Air Traffic Control manager known as “Deep Sky” was becoming increasingly worried. Unlike himself, his family did not work in the air-f iltered confines of a windowless building. They were still experiencing health problems. His wife, who had never experienced allergies, suffered from episodes of Sudden Onset Acute Asthma whose occurrences exactly matched the increased aerial activity he was seeing on his scopes. Deep Sky began calling his colleagues at FAA flight centers across the United States. Were they seeing something in the air that was degrading their radarscopes? What were they being told? Chicago’s O’Hare Field is still the busiest airport in Am erica. Controllers there, as well as all three New York airports, LA’s LAX, San Francisco, Jacksonville, Cleveland, San Diego, Dulles, Washington DC and “the big one” in Atlanta (the biggest airport in the nation) – all responded. Without exception, these air traffic controllers told Deep Sky they were still seeing formations of air force tankers on their scopes. So were tower personnel at smaller airports li ke Westchester County in Armonk, New York and Manchester, New Hampshire. The controllers contacted by Deep Sky also unanimously reported that they were being told to divert commercial traffic below unusual formations of air force tankers flying strange patterns – described by their superiors as “routine”. Controllers across the U.S. were being told that unspecified “experiments with radar” could degrade their own displays. Controllers told Deep Sky they had never seen so much “clutter” or manmade “cloudiness” obscuring their scopes. "},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" A growing number of informally networked air tra ffic controllers were following the chemtrails controversy. Some of the professional skywatchers Deep Sky spoke with cited the short-lived House Resolution 2977 sponsored by Kucinich. Concerned controllers across America also told Deep Sky that while not actually jeopardized, commercial flight safety was a “consideration”. Even more worrisome was the fallout they were seeing on their scopes. They knew from their professional meteorology studies that “this stuff falls to the ground.” And they wondered about what they termed, “potential health hazards.” As federal employees scanning America’s skies 24/7, these FAA radar operators had the final say in the chemtrails controversy. And they agreed without exception that the chemtrails there were seeing on their scopes fanning out behind high-flying U.S. Air Force tankers were real. But after former President Ronald Reagan underlined their vulnerability by firing every striking air traffic controller, they were understandably afraid to come forward with their concerns. At least one controller working in America’s heartland visited a local hospital after heavy tanker activity – to find the emergency room jammed with acute respiratory cases. “They want to know what the heck is in there,” Brendt relayed. “One of them said – al or barium – that’s not something you want to be breathing.” (al = aluminum) One controller working in America’s heartland became concerned enough about possible health effects after particularly heavy tanker activity to visit a local hospital – only to find the emergency room jammed with acute respiratory cases. In their talks with Deep Sky and Brendt, concerned controllers across the country independently confirmed that the only further ex planation from their superiors was that there are some “experiments”. Many Air Traffic Controllers were told that the tankers were engaged in “climate experiments”. STORMY WEATHER Long a hotbed of chemtrail activity, and chemtrail protests, Columbus, Ohio finally achieved national prominence for in-depth chemtrails coverage with a December 6, 2001 article in Columbus Alive by reporters Bob Fitrakis and Fritz Chess. “Stormy Weather” observed that “the grounding of virtually all civilian air flights in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks” heightened “bizarre speculation about what’s happening in North American airspace.” The newspaper kept receiving “numerous citizen repor ts concerning airplanes ‘spraying’ or leaving behind mysterious ‘chemtrails’ or ‘contrail grids’ in the skies over Columbus. Fitrakis and Chess reported, “Some feared we were under biochemical attack while others postulated we were being inoculated against anthrax or some other biochemical hazard.” During a flight to Phoenix in early October, a Columbus Alive reporter noted that air traffic was like a nest of hornets over southwest Ohio and Indiana, with jets spraying everywhere. One plane appeared to be a Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker , a refueling plane. Typically, contrails can only form at temperatures below negative-76 degrees Fahrenheit and at humidity levels of 70 percent or more at high altitudes, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration meteorologist Thomas Schlattes. Even in most ideal conditions, a jet contrail lasts no more than 30 minutes."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" Yet, in the month after the attack on the World Trade Center, there was very little commercial airline traffic and virtually no private civilian air flights. Still, white jets billowing lingering plumes frequently appeared in the skies over Columbus. An Alive reporter, using high-quality binoculars, could see that some of the white planes had orange markings. In addition to Stratotankers, KC-10 Extenders, another refueling plane, appeared to be used for spraying. One scientist familiar with chem trail experiments even agreed to speak with Columbus Alive (though he refused to allow his name to be used), saying that public disclosure of the experiments is inevitable and maybe imminent. That did not happen. But while watching the news on CNN, Fitrakis and his wife were watching an interview the day after Catherine Whitman resigned as head of the EPA. Whitman had come under heavy fire from chemtrail activists for refusing to accept and analyze samples they claimed came from high-altitude aerial spraying by U.S. Air Force tankers over the United States, Canada, Britain and at least nine other allied countries. Now Fitrakis and his wife turned and looked at each other with raised eyebrows when Whitman blurted, “People criticize the President for not doing anything about global warming. But he’s doing a lot of things about global warming that people don’t know about.” Bob Fitrakis believes that HAARP can move “zonal winds” around – just as the Soviets once shifted the jetstream to increase their growing jetstream, usi ng seven similar energy transmitters arrayed around a place called Chernobyl. With the [air force] Test Command confirming that HAARP is for weather modification, Fitrakis feels that an Arctic air mass was moved south from Canada that winter. “Like opening the door of a deep freeze, and moving it into the bedroom,” he told me, temperatures plummeted as Columbus shivered in its coldest winter since the 1960’s. Fitrakis also speculated that massive chemtrail sp raying observed over Columbus that fall could have “created a vacuum” or low pressure area, drawing cold air out of Canada to help cool the rapidly warming continental USA. MINNIS MISSES AGAIN Calling chemtrails, “perfectly natural” clouds , Minnis had participated in showing a sharp decrease in contrail activity since November 2001. Yet, in March 2202, he told the Akron Beacon Journal that people were noticing contrails more often because of increased aircraft traffic! [Akron, Ohio Beacon Journal Mar 16/02] Speaking in March 7 from NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, the atmospheric scientist complained to USA Today that it’s impossible to argue with “conspiratorialists”. “If you try to pin these people down and refute things, it’s, ‘Well, you’re just part of the conspiracy,’” Minnis muttered. “Logic is not exactly a real selling point for most of them.” “Them” of course, being airline pilots, air traffic controllers, military members, police officers and veteran news staff. Though Minnis did not mention this. [USA Today Mar 7/2002] DISINFORMATION FROM DURANGO On November 19, 2002, the Durango Herald ’s contemptuous chemtrails commentary appeared in a “story” by Jennifer Kostka helpfully headli ned, “Scientists Dismiss ‘Chemtrail’ Theories”."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" In the tradition of USA Today and similar chemtrail “coverage” by editors and producers more fond of their corporate paychecks than journalistic ethics, Kostas immediately confused chemtrails with contrails – before belaboring the seemingly obvious point that contrails are harmless to human health. At least until the heat they trap and the sunli ght they dim really kicks in. Fallout from jet turbine exhaust is highly toxic. But this was not mentioned by “experts” happy to discuss water vapor while taking potshots at all those contrary conspiratorialists. “I have looked at those (chemtrail) websites a couple of times, and they’re right up there with the UFO folks,” Paul Newman told Kostka. The physicist with the Atmospheric Chemistry and Dynamics Branch of NASA was careful not to mention the NASA-de fined “UFOs” caught by its own space cameras – which must make NASA “conspiratorialists” too! The Durango drivel was prompted by a local talk on chemtrails: Clifford Carnicom, a geophysicist and mathematician from Santa Fe, spoke at Storehouse Baptist Church south of Durango on Saturday night. Carnicom told about 50 residents that he believes a national or global organization is placing harmful particulates in jet emissions, which he calls “aerosol trails.” Carnicom presented videos and photographs he said showed suspicious aerosol trails that stayed suspended in the sky longer than normal. However, Charles Knight, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, said that under certain weather conditions contrails could stay suspended in the sky for days. Kostka failed to mention that in regards to the “c ertain weather conditions” necessary for contrail formation, Carnicom had produced reams of official high-altitude temperature and humidity data over Santa Fe showing conclusively that contrails co uld not have formed under the atmospheric conditions existing at the times of heavy sky gridding. Nor did the reporter refer to Steadham’s documented discrepancies between contrail and chemtrail longevity over Houston. Kostka also neglected to report the Espanola lab findings. Nor did the newspaper quote the senior Air Traffic Controller manager who described on tape the climate modification missions flown by U.S. Air Force tankers. The Wright-Patterson scientists who described their work on chemtrails projects at Wright-Patterson to Columbus Alive reporter Bob Fitrakis also went unmentioned in a story that carefully overlooked irrefutable evidence of massive, ongoing chemtrail activity. Instead, Kostka quoted FAA spokesman Allen Kenitz er mouthing the standard denials: “A couple of years ago we were getting swamped with calls about this. All of these reports turned out to be nothing.” Then why are they continuing? “This is a very standard reply to receive, that everything’s normal,” long-time chemtrails researcher Clifford Carnicom told Kostka. “It is not normal. Contrails are composed of water vapor. What I’m speaking of is not emissions of water vapor. What I’m speaking of is the emissions of aerosol trails.” I LEFT MY CHEMTRAILS IN SAN FRANCISCO Even as Kostka was describing contrails, chemtra ils were still regularly banding the sky above the Golden Gate. “All this week grids and big blankets of perfectly straight and very wide lines have appeared over San Francisco,” wrote a November 2002 correspondent:"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"I was downtown on Thursday. While walking from the top of a hill (Sutter St) and heading down towards Market St and it looked like the entire area was filled with smoke. When I got home, there were X’s and grids all around my neighborhood. Friday there were more. My husband, who’s having a hard time accepting this stuff, even commented about the “pretty” sunset, the chemtrails were bubble gum pink!” Saturday morning I zipped over to the market at 7:30 am and there was a huge blanket of perfectly straight “clouds” going from Pac Bell Park (the new baseball stadium near the Bay Bridge) going south towards Candlestick Park (the old one, near the airport.) Occasionally another wide stripe crossed over the large blanket. Last night as the moon rose it looked like she was behind a big fuzzy blanket. Definitely not fog! Today, Sunday we have pretty much normal clouds. Interestingly, my favorite cat has been suffering from asthma and a cough all year. It’s been assumed that it was an allergic reaction to her cat litter and to one of our rabbit’s fur. Wednesday her cough suddenly came back. I noticed my husband reaching for his inhaler a lot more than usual and my lungs have been tight and my eyes slightly red. Getting back to my cat, the cough persisted and the light bulb in my head went off! She began coughing with the chem trails! Another friend of mine who lives just outside of the wine country about 1 1/2 hours north of SF reports that she’ s finding a yellow powder everywhere. But this sounds like another issue...an even scarier one. On December 9, 2002, Kathleen reported “an outbreak of a flu-like illness in huge numbers in the SF Bay Area: mild fever, congestion, sore throat, weakness, chills. One doctor’s office in SF had 40 calls in three days!” Residents in Santa Rosa and Ukiah, two to three hours’ drive to the north, as well as someone near Seattle, a person in Milwaukee, and a man in upstate NY – all told Kathleen there were no flu outbreaks in their area. The CDC website reported no flu in the USA. But in the Bay Area...”It’s been several days and my husband and I can’t shake it,” Kathleen wrote. “One friend has relapsed after a week, another has relapsed after two weeks. Of course, we get our fair share of chemtrails, and I’m very suspicious. A big anti-war rally in SF is scheduled for 12/28.” "},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" That same day, in north central Arizona, as the chemplanes passed over, Jackie passed out. “I became instantly dizzy, staggered with delirium, felt nauseated, whole body went limp, hair standing on end as if in an electromagnetic field. Tried going outside several times in two hours; same thing each time. Relief instantly upon going inside and closing the door.” Three hours later, the artificial overcast left by the tankers still covered the sky. DUSTED IN DIXIE While U.S. media attention remained focused on massive military attacks targeting destitute families in mud hut villages, Americans continued to face attacks from their own air force in their own skies. On December 3, 2002, Rose Marie reported a disturbing incident in Jackson, MS: My sister had a very sudden onset of an illness with very severe untreatable dry cough, and sudden imbalance of her body where she could not sit up without falling over, could not walk, she fell four times, also she became confused with mild hallucinations. When checked at the hospital she was found to have low sodium and potassium in her electrolytes. The doctors could not account for her sudden drop in electrolytes. She is still weak, shaky and depressed. The doctors should look up! “We have heavy contrail activity all days including holidays and weekends.” Rose Marie declared. “We start out with clear skies and end up with strange cloud coverage, and we have overnight rain showers that make sure the chemicals are brought to earth.” Rose Marie feared for outdoor vegetables, waterways and animals eating chemtrail-contaminated grass, our waterways are being contaminated. In addition, “Most of the people living around me are having strange illness taking for ever to get over and the people with depressions are severely depressed and not always responding to meds.” CHEMTRAILS OVER SEDONA Sedona used to be a special place renowned for spiritual healing and cosmic connection. That vibe is still pre sent. But this renowned New Age “vortex center” has been getting hammered with chemtrails since at least early 1999. “So many good things have changed for the worse since then, helped along by a faceless oligarchy carving up what’s left of the Earth pie and drooling down their chins. And too much – like chemtrails – has remained the same,” one resident wrote. On March 23, 2002 Carol wrote a brief update: “I live in Sedona, AZ which is a very beautiful place with relatively little air pollution. But we have frequent and sometimes very heavy chemtrails.” And then it was summer. For much of the USA and Canada, a parching drought continued. Crops failed. Major herds of cattle were sold off. And vast forest fires burned in Australia and the USA. Were the sky pirates trying to ruin farmers in some kind of bizarre domination trip? It made no sense to spray megatons of desiccants into air already almost wrung out of moisture. On June 24, a “Chem 11” Internet message board message read: I was just watching NBC coverage of the 50-mile wide fire front that is raging through Arizona. Three years of drought have basically turned su rrounding forests in the area into kindling. Wanna take a wild guess what I saw in the skie s above Heber during the on-location interviews?

The spraying continued into the night. There were four and five parallel lines in the sky at various times wh ich spread out into the hazy clouds with which we are all familiar. The trails crisscrossed and continued all morning and afternoon. I pointed the sky out to my patients. As a doctor, I am ensuring that I educate each of my patients about what is happening. Someone must teach the public about what appears to be happening. We've got to stop this madness. Once again, we in Arizona missed our monsoon season. This is the two month period when we receive most of our rain. Apparently the Bari um chemical removed the moisture from our atmosphere and we did not received any significant rain. Our drought continues. Those who plan these chemical activities must be proud of their accomplishments and must be high- fiving each other over their “success”. I am noticing my patients are coming in with frequent headaches, sinus congestion, asthma and ear infections in recent days/weeks. I attribute this to the allergic reactions to the chemicals which our government is spraying in OUR air! I have noticed that the “hair analysis” labs which I run on some of my patients all are indicating HIGH levels of Barium. My own hair analysis indicated high Barium levels. I am pretty familiar with diet and nutrition and quite honestly cannot think of any food that contain significant levels of Barium...Barium is not known to be absorbable in any significant degree. For this reason radiologists use barium for colonoscopy's and other GI scans. Yet, we seem to have high levels of barium in our hair which means either barium is being stored from digestion or the hair is being contaminated by an outside source. I am quite concerned with this violation of our environment by a government that denies it is occurring, yet a person can step outside and watch our tax dollars at work. I am also angry that our Senators have no concern for us. I called Senator John McCain and Sen. Jon Kyl to discuss this. Sen. McCain's o ffice did not have the decency to even return my call; Sen. Kyle had an assistant call me and he spouted the party line that all I was experiencing was CON-TRAILS. Sorry, guys these are NOT contrails. I haven't seen many articles on chemtrails lately and I am hoping those that are aware do not let this poisoning of our sky, and control of our weather be forgotten. I feel this is what the government wants. If they ignore those of us who are trying to raise awareness of this activity long enough, our citizens-with our general attention span of approximately 15 minutes- will forget about chemtrails and the government/military c an continue with their experiments on us.

Somehow, we must wake the public up, get them to look up in the sky and realize these are NOT contrails!!!” SOL POWER As unprecedented solar storms wash electromagnetically-sensitive humans with waves of invisible energy, and Earth’s shrinking magnetic field is felt by beings acutely attuned to its subtly shifting frequencies, neuro-reactive chemicals sprayed into air already charged with nerve-jangling electronic “smog” may be triggering emotional storms. In Glenwood Springs, Colorado where another despondent correspondent reported relentless spraying, the correlation between chemtrails and consciousness is not encouraging. “People are acting weird,” wrote this waitress after work. “People are acting strange. People don’t have really good mental health. Everybody’s sick. More people are down. Things are just not right. Erratic behavior. It’s not like life used to be.” SCANNER CHATTER As 2002 drew to a close, chemtrails continue to be reported across Canada, the USA, UK and Europe. On the morning of December 30, Lou Aubuchont decided to write a “Good Wishes” letter to his local New Hampshire paper after looking out the same kitchen window where S.T. had seen her first chemtrail - and seeing “trail after trail...a whole sky full of them, and the jet tankers making them.” Aubuchont cursed with naval fluency as he watched “eleven jets in under ten minutes leave the white plumes behind them – the kind that do not dissipate like normal contrail’s do; the kind that hang in the sky and spread out unlike normal contrails do; the kind that turn a crystal clear blue sky into an overcast mass of manmade Gack!” That was just the start. At 9:30, “I went out for a while and in my travels I counted forty-seven separate aircraft making Chemtrails before I actually lost count.” By 11:30 am, “most of central and southern New Hampshire was being covered by a thick gray/white mass of Chemtrails... We do not get this much air traffic in a month let alone one day.” December 30th “was almost as bad” as March, 12, 2001 “when over three hundred and seventy aircraft were counted by a group of people in Gilford, NH in only five hours.” Aubuchont saw a single jet “leaving a short normal contrail that dissipated quickly as the aircraft moved across the sky.” The rest “were leaving Chemtrails that stretched across the sky for miles, lingered and spread out.” The arrival and departure numbers for Maine and New Hampshire for December 30th, 2002, Aubuchont saw, “do not even come close to the amount of aircraft that I saw in the sky that day.” And that was not all. As Lou Aubuchont wrote to me from Maine, “We have had spraying on and off all this month, some days heavy, some with just a few chemjets showing up, but they are still quite active here in the northeast. I’ve noticed that on heavy spray days the chemjets are usually accompanied at some point into the spraying by a P-3 Orion weather bird out of the Brunswick Naval Air Station.” Listening in on his radio scanner, the former naval Intel courier was only catching airborne fragments of conversations that hopped around frequencies faster than Aubuchont’s scanner could follow. Still, the transmissions were tantalizing. "},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"In late September 2002, Lou Aubuchont explained, “My scanner seems to be able to pick up the chatter when they are really close but not both ends of the transmissions. What I get is coming directly from the aircraft, I get nothing from a ground source/control.” He conclude d, “They are using a computer controlled system that changes frequencies rapidly and my scanner only captures a frequency from the aircraft when they are very close, like right overhead.” One year after we first went to the self-censored corporate media with the Deep Sky interview tapes, the spraying had not let up over Maine. “We have been getting sprayed on average of three times per week and the spraying has been on a huge scale covering hundreds of thousands of square miles by the time the spraying stops,” Lou Aubuchont wrote on September 27, 2002. On October 9, he notified me of “Heavy spraying over Maine and New Hampshire”: At 10:00 am, I saw the first plumes being spread across the sky here in Parsonsfield, Maine and from that point on it was just tanker after tanker laying down a massive grid that extended well over into New Hampshire. They came from the northeast, northwest and east to west, it was quite a show and by 3:30PM the sky was a complete whiteout. We had some high thin cirrus clouds overhead when the spraying started here. The tankers were below the clouds and as the “Chemtrails “spread out it became hard to tell the cloud cover from the “Chemcloud”. But we ended up with a sick looking yellow-white overcast. You know, if it is just a ho ax as the U.S.A.F. portrays it as being, it’s one hell of a hoax. UNMERRY CHRISTMAS FROM A SERGEANT-MAJOR The day after Christmas 2002, a retired Canadian Army sergeant major named Phil wrote from Teulon, a town approximately 30 minutes drive due north of Winnipeg: This summer on a couple of different occasions I observed these aircraft flying back and forth emitting these chemtrails for about an hour each time. On one of these occasions I watched with my neighbor who expressed extreme surpri se and wonder at this activity. These aircraft emitted what I thought at first was their normal exhaust, after a few minutes it was obvious that the exhaust was not dissipating, but was just spreading, and forming into a light cloud which covered a great amount of area in the sky. Like the people in Espanola, we found that quite a few people suffered from the same illnesses, however my efforts in bringing attention to this activity was met with a bit of skepticism and just a cursory interest. A Lexus Nexis search made in 2002 showed 24 TV stations carrying nearly identical segments on chemtrails. From Baltimore to Florida to Houston, people being interviewed are watching chemtrails and getting sick. Invariably, the station runs an official denial or a joking rebuttal from their own meteorologist scientifically commenting on “conspiratorialists”. Almo st all stations run compelling footage of bizarre aerial plume patterns, before dismissing the phenomenon. According to Bob Fitrakis, affiliate stations sometimes overlap while using local talent to report a local chemtrails angle. The result: key evidence and credible interviews replaced by ridicule."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":" Chapter 12. EDMONTON’S EVIDENCE Dave Dickie’s World Landscapes Company performs contract landscape work for the City of Edmonton. “Some contracts require us to utilize the services of environmental labs for soil tests,” says Dickie. “Recent soils analysis have come back with a high EC rating 4-7 (toxic) and we’ve had some soil sources rejected of course because they did not meet specifications.” In an interview on November 23, 2002, Dickie told me that his city landscape crews were finding widespread nutrient deficiency in soils could cause severe problems for plant life – including trees. “Wait,” I interrupted. “Aluminum sucks nutrients from the soil.” “No question” answered this soil expert. Moreov er, added Dickie, when measuring the electrical conductivity in Edmonton soil samples, “city specifications call for a reading no higher than 1.” Vickie’s crews are now finding readings from 4.6 as high as 7. The “choruses” condition resulting from this drastically high electrical conductivity in soil was impacting their landscaping business, Dickie explained. “We were not able to determine the cause of the high EC [electrical conductivity], and many reasons are possible.” Presuming that unusual metal content in the soil could be causing the high readings, Dickie obtained samples of a fresh snowfall in sterile containers and took them to NorWest Labs in Edmonton. As he explained, “Our most recent snowfall was tested for aluminum and barium and we were not surprised with the results. You’ve said it all along and this just substantiates some of your claims.” "},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"A November 18, 2002 a $33 lab test of snow samples collected in a sterilized container confirmed elevated levels of aluminum and barium. No rwest Labs lab report #336566 dated November 14. 2002 found:  aluminum levels: 0.148 milligrams/liter  barium levels: 0.006 milligrams/liter As Dickie confirmed to this reporter, as well as chemtrailcentral.com confirmed, “It is the scientific opinion of the lab that the aluminum content of the sample is high and unusual. [chemtrailcentral.com] Because aluminum is ubiquitous in the environment, and its chemistry depends on soil pH and mineralogical composition, it is difficult to provide generalized estimates of natural background concentrations. But according to Dickie, the NorWest Lab techs told him, “That’s interesting. Elevated levels of aluminum and barium are not usually found in Alberta precipitation.” “It may not prove that the aluminum came from at mospheric programs,” Dickie admits. “However we are going to sample precipitation from various areas within a 40 mile radius of the City of Edmonton to determine Aluminum/ Barium within precipitation.” Dickie says it’s simple to test for aluminum and barium in soil samples. Labs typically charge about $15 for these tests. I suggested he add quartz to the list of chemtrail fallout components to check for. In Espanola, quartz predominated rainfall samples, which also showed hazardous levels of aluminum. This was hot. But imagine my shock when Dickie told me that he regularly visits Air Traffic Control at the Edmonton municipal airport to watch USAF tank ers making repeated spray passes over the city! “I’ve been a plane spotter all my life,” Dickie told me. Blessed with good friends at work in the tower, he has watched radar-identified KC-135s “on many occasions.” On Father’s Day 2002, Dickie and an excited group of 12 year-olds watched two sorties by two KC- 135s. Petro 011 and Petro 012 were tracked by radar as HA (High Altitude) targets flying at 34,000 and 36,000 feet – “one to the south, and one to the north of the city.” Both USAF t ankers had flown south out of Alaska. As Dickie, the kids and the controllers watched, the big jets began making patterns over Edmonton – “circuits” the controllers called it. The Stratotankers were working alone in “commanded airspace” from which all other aircraft were excluded. And they were leaving chemtrails. “The signature is significant,” commented one radar operator, referring to a trail clearly visible on the scope extending for miles behind the KC-135. In contrast, a JAL flight on the display left no contrail. Going outside, Dickie and several controllers scanned clear blue skies. They easily located the KC-135 leaving its characteristic white-plume “signature”. Visibility was outstanding. They also clearly saw the JAL airliner at a similar flight level. It left no contrail at all."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" On other occasions, Dickie has watched KC-135s on Ed monton radar leaving lingering trails as low as 18,000 feet. “We see these guys up here a lot,” Dickie says radar techs told him. The tanker flights originate in Alaska, grid the Edmonton area, and continue on into the States. “You should have seen it when they had the big summit up in Calgary. It was exciting to watch them.” Perplexing, too. Was the U.S. Air Force spraying barium over the G7 leaders to enhance radio and radar surveillance – or target protestors in the surrounding woods? There could be no doubt that particulates were being sprayed by the American tankers. On radar, these reflective particles showed up as “birdie feet” – triangles in the radar-tracked plume. They also appeared “as a concentration of dots” in the radar-visible ‘trail. Focusing in and out on each plane with the click of cursor, “we could see different contrails,” Dickie added. Some were short, and quickly vanished from the scopes. Other trails were thick, long and lingering – not contrails at all. Especially exciting was watching head-on passes between KC-135s and commercial airliners. Flying directly at each other with a closing rate of nearly 1,200 mph, the huge jets appeared destined to become briefly one. But the controllers were never concerned, Dickie relates, because both planes always adhered to the 1,000-foot vertical separation rule (recently reduced from twice that distance.) What would happen, if the “top” plane suffered a sudden decompression and had to dive to lower altitude? [See Dickie interview on the History Channel] A HOUSEWIFE IN EDMONTON Dave Dickie is not the only Edmontonian exercised about chemtrails. On October 12, 2005 Jeannie wrote to say: Just a housewife but am very concerned about the current chemtrail situation here in Edmonton. We have been seeing frequent aerial spraying since 1999. Today as usual we had beautiful fall clear skies until the fog started! From horizon to horizon until the sky blanked out and was dull and fully clouded. I have traveled to Saskatoon and Calgary and the same stuff was going on when I was in those cities those weekends. However it did not seem to be happening in- between. Just largely populated areas, eh? That is on those particular days. We have experienced nosebleeds, heavy mucus in nasal passages, dry irritated throats and other respiratory problems. We feel it is related to the aerial spraying as other friends also report the same symptoms. No one gets nosebleeds on different parts of the city the same mornings of spraying do they? One of our relatives works at a hospital and since being alerted to the chemtrail scenario he reports that there is a rash of patients in respiratory distress every time there is spraying over our city... THINKING ABOUT ALUMINUM Seeing reflective tanker trails on radar, and finding i nexplicably elevated levels of highly reflective barium and aluminum in soil samples sparked efforts by Edmonton officials to probe deeper into a chemtrail conundrum that was killing plants citywide. Dickie and others were also concerned about possible human health risks. Ingesting calcium-leaching aluminum can cause gastrointestinal problems, weak and acing muscles, headaches, lethargy, fatigue and flu-like symptoms that leave the body vulnerable to opportunistic infections. Significantly, the electromagnetic radiation emitted by cell phones, portable phones and cell phone towers also leaches calcium from human cells – and may be significantly am plified by electrically-conductive chemtrails."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Unlike aluminum chaff dropped by warplanes to jam enemy radars, aluminum oxide is a mineral almost as common and inert as sand. And sand, as residents of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia and veterans of other desert storms can attest, can trigger radical responses from afflicted respiratory and immune systems. Dr. Dan Woodard calls aluminum oxide a “nuisanc e dust”. The MD points out that prolonged exposures at very high concentrations (showing as visible dust in the air) “can produce pulmonary fibrosis, somewhat like the silicosis formerly seen in miners.” Woodard continues: “At one time it was thought to precipitate Alzheimer’s disease, but more recent research has shown it is almost certainly unrelated. There is little evidence for chemical toxicity, or for effects at levels below the nuisance dust limit.” It does not take chemical toxicity to make people exposed to chemtrail fallout very ill indeed. Basing recent conclusions on more than 3,000 new health studies published since 1997, the EPA has concluded that there is a strong link between the tiniest particles and thousands of premature deaths each year. [EPA press release Apr 134/01] It turns out that hearts and lungs can be damaged by ultra-fine particles small enough to get into the bloodstream and inflame tissues and cells. Two key st udies from the early 1990’s by the Harvard School of Public Health and the American Cancer Society found strong links between high levels of small particles and a rise in death rates. In an article headlined, “Tiny particles can kill” the New Scientist pointed to findings among 8,000 adults in six cities ov er 16 years, which found that “city-dwellers in Europe and the U.S. are dying young because of microscopic particles in the air.” [New Scientist Aug 5/00] When these microscopic particles are inhaled into the lungs, “they are able to penetrate into the cells themselves,” said Dr. Ralph Delfino, an epidemiologist at UC Irvine, who helped conduct the latest study. “In addition, they can go in through the blood vessel walls and get into the bloodstream.” “Microscopic motes – composed of metals, carbon and other ingredients – are able to infiltrate the tiniest compartments in the lungs and pass readily into the bloodstream,” the LA Times reported. “After they reach the heart, the particles are thought to cause a stress reaction in cells, producing inflammation that contributes to heart disease. The particles also may cause blood clots.” [Los Angeles Times Dec 29/03] The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory scientist who ran Edward Teller’s computer simulations predicting the effectiveness of a planetary sunscreen, told, “We originally did this study to show that this program shouldn’t be done,” Ken Caldeira told Columbus Alive. “Why not?” asked awar d-winning author and reporter Bob Fitrakis. Because of negative health effects, Caldeira replied. Particles in the lower size range called for by the Hughes aluminum oxide spray patent are “most strongly tied to illness and early death, particularly in people who are already susceptible to respiratory problems.” [Los Angeles Times Dec 29/03] EPA Air Quality Management Rule 402.

Nearly one in four children suffer from this acute breathing disorder at some point in their lives – compared to 13% of children, the BBC reported following sudden epidemics of breathing- related deaths in the winters of 1998 and 1999. “It is becoming a major health problem.

That and his own subsequent respiratory illness convinced him.\" [imageevent.com] SPACE BUGS What about the fungal a nd possible viral components of chemtrail contamination? If not deliberately introduced into a climate modification program, could malevolent microorganisms be piggybacking on the plumes? A surprising series of balloon flights made high above the U.S. during the 1960s collected stratospheric samples swarming with live bacteria and fungi - as well as viruses bigger than any known at the time. If viruses fall from the sky, most would land in the sea. And seawater is brimming with bugs. One study found that coastal seawater contains as many as ten million large virus-like particles per quart. As one researcher said: “No one knows where they come from or what they do. Their size and shape matches the virus-like particles found in the upper atmosphere.” "},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" Other life forms, even tinier than bacteria, are thriving in our atmosphere. The discoverer of nanobacteria describes the most populous organisms on Earth as “dwarf forms of bacteria, about one- tenth the diameter and 1/1000 the volume of ordinary bacteria.” FOLK LORE Dr. Robert Folk is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Geology at the University of Texas at Austin. Folk figures that these ultra-tiny creatures are “possibly an order of magnitude more abundant” than normal bacteria that swarm everywhere. Though everywhere underfoot, nanobacteria have gone undetected for decades by myopic microbiologists who have long insisted that bacteria invisible under optical microscopes could not exist. Since chemtrails are commonly spread over populated areas where sun shading is most needed, it is reasonable to conclude that these particulate-laden plumes are bringing airborne viruses, bacteria and fungi down into human lungs and respiratory systems unabl e to recognize or resist the alien invaders. This possibility was further strengthened by Folk, who chose a lightweight metal as a matrix to grow bugs too small to be seen by optical microscopes. Viewed under electronic magnification, Folk found many diverse kinds of swarming nanobac. The bacteria were feasting (he called it “metabolizing”) on aluminum. “Fungis just love metals,” says one researcher. Strato-bugs also influence the weather. After discover ing as many as 1500 bacteria in each milliliter of rainwater collected on the summit of Mount Sonnblick near Salzburg, cloud-catcher Birgitt Sattler says, “We have so far just proved that there is life up there and that it can reproduce. Now we want to know who is up there.” Reporting in the August 26, 2000 New Scientist , the meteorologist believes that these microscopic cloud-dwellers could play an important part in triggering rainfall and altering climate. Translation: Inadvertently precipitat ing these living nuclei out of the sky with large quantities of free- falling chemical aerosols could cause drought. A May 28, 2002 press release from the National Climate and Atmospheric Research center in Boulder, Colorado announced an 18-month project “to discover whet her airborne microbes play an active role in forming clouds and causing rain to fall.” “It is known that bacteria, fungal spores, algae and other micro-organisms survive and possibly reproduce in the harsh conditions of the atmosphere,” said the NCAR bulletin. It appears that “an active, self-sustaining ecosystem exists in the clouds.” These microscopic bacteria and algae apparently “play a key role in the processes that create clouds and trigger rainfall.” As Dr. Moffett remarked, “We know that the balance of gases in earth’s atmosphere has been generated and sustained by microbial activity during the 3.5 billion years since life evolved. We are looking for evidence that microbial metabolism could have a major influence on patterns of climate and weather today.” A “really exciting possibility” added Moffett, “is that microbes have evolved ways of triggering cloud formation and rainfall to facilitate their own dispersal and reproduction – in other words, they could be controlling the weather.”"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"So what happens when megatons of airborne desiccants precipitate these mobile, precipitation-forming nuclei out of the sky?

The U.S. Air Force is doing plenty. On November 23, 2000 the Times of London reported renowned scientist Dr. Rosalie Bertell’s confirmation that “U.S. military scientists are wo rking on weather systems as a potential weapon. The methods include the enhancing of storms and the diverting of vapor rivers in the Earth’s atmosphere to produce targeted droughts or floods.” The air force admits to deploying its jets to spray weather-altering chemicals. A U.S. Air Force study, Weather As A Force Multiplier: Owning The Weather In 2025 describes how jet tankers flown by Weather Force Specialists are being deployed in “aerial obscuration” missions that spray chemicals to form “cirrus shields”. Marc Filterman, a former French military officer, told the Intelligence Newsletter of several types of “unconventional weapons” using (RF) radio frequencies. Referring to an ongoing “weather war”, Filterman stated that the U.S. and the former So viet Union have already “mastered the know-how needed to unleash sudden climate changes” by the early 1980s.” Tightly beamed ELF (Extremely Low Frequency) have been used to bend the jetstream and alter weather patterns over entire regions since the Soviet s’ first fired up seven transmitters arrayed around a place called Chernobyl in the late 1970s. Hammered by successive crop failures from frosty weather, the Soviet “Woodpecker” chirping disrupted HAM radio bands around the world – and ushered in unprecedented warm winter temperatures from Vladivostok to Anchorage, Alaska. The Russian harvest rebounded. But this writer and my crewmate were nearly sunk when a Woodpecker-spawned hurricane caught our backyard-built trimaran 100 miles off the California coast in 1978. Fortunately, Celerity’s was stronger than Russian black technology. Indulging a planet-threatening impulse to turn the environment into a weapon or war, the U.S. Air Force now talks about deploying “Weather Force” specialists to upset the weather “by adding small amounts of energy at just the right time and space.” The tomato gardener from Howard County named Lee in turns out to be a HAM radio operator, as well: call sign WAØAUU. He writes: "},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" I have been a FCC licensed ham radio operator for over 40 years. I know how the “bands” work at different times of the year, I have been thr ough many sun spot cycles, I know how the bands should work and how far I can talk on a given band at a given time, day or night. This winter the ham bands have been all screwed up, the 20 meter band should have been good for talking around the world at night, this winter it was good for only about 4 or 5 hundred miles. Normally our radio signals are reflected off of the ionosphere but it is like the radio signals were being reflected by something else that was not as high up which means our radio signal range would be shorter. I am sure that is what happened. My brother and I have seen the “tick-tac-toe” the X’s and the O’s in the sky over northeast Iowa. We have seen the tankers day and night. All have been high level. About HAARP, I can receive that radio signal on the ham 20 meter band. I know a ham that made a real to real tape recording of it, when he can here that signal, he points his beam north and plays the tape back, after he does that a few times the HAARP signal will stop! Despite la Niña forecasts calling for a considerably drier climate across the USA for late 1999 through early 2000 – just the opposite occurred. The desert town of Bakersfield hosted an unusual snowfall after heavy springtime spraying coincided with jammed emergency rooms there. “Can it be that the contrails reported in the Bakersfield area are related to the 6” of snowfall in Bakersfield?” one resident wrote. “If not, it’s an interesting coincidence.” Whether accidental or intentional, spectacularly lousy weather often follows chemtrail gridding – which often takes place in clear blue skies ahead of approaching fronts. Another Californian reported, “Since my initial message to you, we have had two severe storms pass through the San Francisco Bay Area, one of which passed over Lake Tahoe and dumped eight feet of snow! Also, I have experienced some respiratory difficulties and some stomach upset.” On April 8, 1999, Channel 3 KCRA reported that Sacramento was in the middle of the wettest and coldest storm yet, with hail and snow forecast for the San Francisco Bay area. In the Sierra foothills, Interstate 80 was closed in both directions east of Sacramento and Reno. According to one area resident, “It is snowing so hard in the Sierras that the snow is coming down sideways. They continue to spray this area. When there are breaks in the clouds, you can see the tell- tale signs of what the chemtrails look like as they spread further and further out.” Another correspondent described how in Arkansas on January 19th and 20th, 1999: “There was heavy spraying. On the 21st, Arkansas had the worst outbreak of tornadoes on record, killing many people. The spraying has continued. I spent eight years in the military and was around many different kinds of aircraft and I have never seen anything that left contrails such as those in these photos.” "},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" In Utah that month: “I did not know of the impact of such things until a 4-line grid was made over the Cottonwood Utah Area and David John Oates and myself fell ill. Three-line grids were seen three days before. The temperature in Utah was 62 degrees and dropped to 10 degrees; 90 mile-an-hour winds took place and clouds rolled in dropping six-inches of snow.” In Rockford, Illinois: The City of Rockford, metro area 650,000, has experienced last week on a Wednesday XXX patterns in the sky. The next day Thursday it was a record 65 temp, then it dropped to about 20 temp same day with violent thunderstorms and winds of 60 mph plus damage to property. The contrails continue with the black helicopters unmarked and I called a friend who is an Air Traffic Controller he did not know anything about the choppers – six going crazy around the city. It appears the weather, plus numerous flu-like symptoms, and choppers are not coincidences. In West Virginia an item on the 6 o’clock news on WSAZ Channel 3: Hospitals are full with flu bug. Doctors say “near epidemic”, “schools closed”. People have “sinus infections to pneumonia”. There is a waiting list for people to get into Cabell-Huntington Hospital. Blamed on the weather. By the way, the temp here in Charleston today was 75 degrees. Tonight it will go down to ‘30’ with snow this weekend. The planes are still making waves over the skies. In Pittsburgh, Kansas: It’s incredibly rare that we have a plane come in here. I’ve lived here for more than 10 years; jets going overhead is a very uncommon thing. These jets flew over about three different nights, with a two or three night ‘break’ between. I’ve watched the ‘contrails’ in the sky myself. I remember thinking how ‘different’ they seemed, wondering why they just hung there, thinking how much it looked like somebody took a thick paintbrush and drew a couple of lines across the sky. The weather here has been crazy. Literally, during the day walking around with no shoes and a T-shirt. That very night, snow, light hail, and ice on the ground. Few days later, comfortable again. In Houston on January 15, 2000: We’ve seen the largest spraying operation we’ve ever recorded over and around Houston, today. Reports coming in from all directions. Started at dawn, will probably continue all day long. Absolutely unbelievable. Extends to small cities as far as 75 miles from here. Dense enough in some cases to produce rainbow colored “sundogs”. Weather is warm and beautiful (no natural clouds) and many many people outside, of course. In Washington state: Our town, Twisp, has only 600 full-time residents. We are experiencing jets spraying contrails east to west. They have been going at it a few days every week since early spring, some time in February, and all day at least three days this week, but do not seem to fly on weekends. The regular jet flights with normal contrails are above the spraying planes. Those regular contrails disappear, but the lower jet trails spread out and cover the sky with a gray overcast that does not go away for many hours. We have had X patterns and circles as well. Many people here in the valley are suffering from upper respiratory ailments, the same lung problems as are being noticed in many parts of the country."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"I have just finally gotten over a major cold that took a month to go away. I am still clearing my throat very frequently, and I still have a pulled mu scle under my left lung, from coughing so hard. It hurts like a broken rib and takes about as long to heal. I sure would like to know the ‘who’ and ‘why’ story on these contrails! I have two grandsons, three and five years, who live with me. They have had a bad hacking cough for months, it seems to come and go, they always have running noses, and are frequently cranky. I know it is because they are ill from the spray. On the 16th of June we had a fierce thunderstorm that had horizontal lightening, and rained so hard that it felt like we were under a waterfall. It was unreal. Like the worst monsoon rain a tropical island could endure. Yeah, it does rain a lot in Washington State, but not that way, particularly on the east side of the mountains. I have lived here most all my life, and we have always experienced mostly light rain, or drizzle. Never monsoon, waterfall deluges like the one we had Wednesday night. I spoke to a number of friends up and down the east side of the Cascades. Three of them said it was the same in Idaho, and Oregon all along the Cascades. A huge line of storms that really dumped massive water in a short time in Bend, Oregon, Chelan and Twisp, Washington, and Caldwell, Idaho simultaneously. If this has anything to do with weather modification, and rain was the desired result, it is obviously working! Storms in the southern United States turned vicious in January 1999, spawning 150 tornadoes and killing 18 people during a time of year when summertime twisters are rarely seen. In Tennessee, former Raytheon missile technician Tommy Farmer filmed complex chemtrail patterns the day before 90 tornadoes struck three adjoining states. On August 21, 2005 another Tennessean wrote, “Just wanted to let you know we have multiple jets almost daily spewing chemtrails here over Knoxvi lle. I’ve been concerned for the last six or seven months and have told many people, but no one seems to believe the government would do anything to harm us... I’m a believer.” "},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" So is the retired reverend Everett Burton. In February 2003, Tennessean Everett Burton phoned repeatedly before finally succeeding in reaching a live C-span “call-in” broadcast. After voicing his opinion on the Clinton impeachment trial, the retired Southern Baptist preacher told Americans to get a copy of the Constitution and read it to realize what they have lost. Rev. Burton advised viewers not to take his word for what was happening to their country. “Just look up in the skies as the planes regularly spray contrails across the skies, spraying people and making them ill,” he suggested.” Almost instantly all sound was cut off. Astonished viewers saw their silent TV screens flip from live C-span coverage to the Tennessee state seal. Burton told me that the “dead air” lasted for more than a minute. In September of that year, David Letterman asked Al Roker why they weren’t having any sunshine this summer in NY. Without missing a beat, Roker replied, “It’s la Niña, which is Spanish for government controlled weather!” MAKING WAVES The temptation to tinker is total. According to a source identifying himself as a high-ranking air force weather-tracking pilot, NASA and the U.S. military hav e long been interested in artificially inducing “atmospheric folding” – a process in which upper atmospheric winds are “folded” down into the weather- forming troposphere. Air Force weather mod pilots reportedly attended a NASA-sponsored meeting in 1989 or ‘90 at the NOAA office in Washington, DC. According to this source: The theme was the potential adjustment of large air masses. NASA wanted to be able to move or stall some of the systems in order to ensure a reasonable or enlarge the launch window at the Cape. Because of the financial consequences, there was an oh! la! amount of money available for the information and application. Our team, with some of the best Weather Mod people, concluded that it was not possible to accomplish such a large-scale rearrangement, because of the lack of a focal point and the general energy distribution parameters. After we were dismissed from the meeting, there were at least two other groups (modelers) still engaged in the discussion. One of my former colleagues has again reminded me of the stratosphere folding work that we started in the mid- to late 70’s.” Weather experts like Atmospherics Inc.’s Tom Henderson insist that the amount of energy needed to influence weather is beyond human means. But Chaos Theory teaches that in systems as dynamically unstable as weather, even the beat of butterfly’s wings in Taiwan can cause a hurricane in the Caribbean. Smaller-scale weather modification involving t he seeding of clouds with silver iodide and similar compounds has been routinely conducted for many years under license in most states. In Fresno, California in 1960, Thomas Henderson founded Atmospherics Inc. with a vision of taking commercial weather modification global. An internationally known authority in weather modification, Henderson has conducted and applied cloud physics research for government and private industry. North American Weather Consultants, also seeds rain clouds with silver iodide to enhance rainfall for reservoirs supplying irrigation, power and drinking water around the world. In 1994 this leading weather modification company filled rainmaking contracts in California, British Columbia, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Colorado, Guatemala, Honduras, Taiwan, Texas, De laware, Abu Dhabi, Georgia, Oregon, Mexico and Iowa. Both companies use long-proven “cloud seeding” techniques to trigger rain clouds into selected deluges using silver iodide crystals to attract moisture, tipping humidity into rainfall. While acknowledging increasing interest in non-conventional weather modi fication, both companies say they are not aware of weather modification techniques that actually form clouds, or trigger weather change using advanced spraying technologies or “atmospheric heating” techniques. They need to do some homework."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"“KILLER” CONSEQUENCES On August, 30, 2001 the BBC reported on “Rain-Making Linked To Killer Floods” after learning that 35 in the historic Lynmouth flood disaster “came only day s after RAF rain-making experiments over southern England” triggered monsoon rains which caused 90 million tons of water to sweep down a narrow valley into Lynmouth on August 15, 1952. Entire buildings were destroyed as North Devon experienced 250 times normal rainfall for the month of August rainfall – within hours. In a description familia r to many chemtrails observers, survivors described planes circling before the disaster – and “how the air smelled of sulphur on the afternoon of the floods” as rain fell hard enough “to hurt people’s faces.” Uprooted trees dammed streams behind bridge abutments, “creating walls of water that carried huge boulders into the village, destroying shops, hotels and homes. Bodies washed out to sea were never found. Dilys Singleton lost six members of her family, including her grandmother.” Jokingly referred to by those involved in the secret experiment as “Operation Witch Doctor”, a covert program called “Cumulus” used silent gliders to “seed” clouds with salt and chemicals. A glider pilot named Alan Yates described, “How he flew over Bedfordshire as part of Operation Cumulus, spraying quantities of salt into the air.” Scientists later told him his efforts caused a massive downpour to fall from “summery” skies over Staines, 50 miles away The perpetrators of this drastic deluge drank toasts to meteorology – until a BBC news bulletin caused a “stony silence” to fall on the military contractors. NOT IN MY SKY Large-scale atmospheric modification is instinctively unpopular. Weather mod is also illegal. In May 1997, Washington adopted a United Nations “Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of the Environmental Modification Techniques”. ENMOD prohibits “the use of techniques that would have widespread, long-lasting or severe effects through deliberate manipulation of natural processes and cause such phenomena as earthquakes, tidal waves and changes in climate and weather patterns.” Citizen displeasure with atmospheric modification intensified in October 1999, when the grassroots group Citizens for Natural Weather collected a mail-in vote in which 252 respondents were in favor and 903 opposed to the Western Kansas Weather Modification Program. The non-binding vote led the Rawlins County commission to pass a resolution opposing weather modification there. Other counties are considering a similar move. "},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":" Chapter 14. PULSES AND PERSUASION You won’t be seeing this on the evening news: For years, the Air Force and Navy have conducted atmospheric engineering experiments known as the High Altitude Auroral Research Project. Using phased-array antennas situated near Gakona, Alaska, HAARP is steering the most intense beams of tightly-focused radio waves generated on this planet “to stimulate,” heat and steer sections of the upper atmosphere. “The name of the game is, can you accelerate electrons?” HAARP’s inventor Bernard Eastlund told me. Capable of being operated remotely in concert with similar smaller “ionospheric heaters” located in Puerto Rico, Germany, the Soviet Union and other far-flung locations, HAARP’s 72-foot antenna arrays will be able to bounce beams off the ionosphere strong enough to “penetrate” deep underground. Just like atomic weapons, these new beam weapons are unrestrained and out of legislative control. When Oppenheimer and other nuclear enthusiasts detonated a weapon brighter than the sun for the first time at Alamogordo, New Mexico, they feared that Earth’s atmosphere might ignite in the ensuing chain reaction. They went ahead anyway and more than three million people died at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Marshall Islands, Nevada, Kazakhstan and many other locations as lethal fallout rained down, accumulating in teeth, breasts and bones. Oppenheimer later repented. But his legacy of plutonium pollution, spit-second incineration and lingering death haunts us still. What hazards will HAARP unleash? Instead of melting cities and killing kids with cancer, the new idea is to heat up 30-mile patches of an already highly charged ionosphere until “the air glows”. Why? "},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" In the immortal and immoral words of one HAARP researcher to a reporter: “To see what will happen.” WEATHER VANDALS The first of three patents awarded to MIT physicist Bernard Eastlund describes his Method and Apparatus for Altering a Region of the Earth’s Atmosphere, Ionosphere and/or Magnetosphere as focusing on weather modification. Issued on August 11, 1987, commercial patent #4,686,605 claims that directed energy beams of more than one-billion watts can be used for “altering the upper atmosphere wind patterns using plumes of atmospheric particles as a lens or focusing device” to disturb weather thousands of miles away. Writing in Nexus magazine, Dr. Nick Begich and Jeanne Manning – authors of Angels Don’t Play This HAARP – note “leading-edge scientists are describing global weather as not only air pressure and thermal systems but also as an electrical system.” Scientists say “there is a super-powerful electrical connection between the ionosphere and the part of the atmosphere where our weather comes on-stage: the lower atmosphere.” Calling HAARP, “vandalism in the sky,” Begich and Manning report: Weather modification is possible by, for exam ple, altering upper atmosphere wind patterns by constructing one or more plumes of atmospheric particles, which will act as a lens or focusing device. As far back as 1958, the chief White House adviser on weather modification, Captain Howard T. Orville, said the U.S. defense department was studying “ways to manipulate the charges of the Earth and sky and so affect the weather by using an electronic beam to ionize or de-ionize the atmosphere over a given area. Eastlund confirmed this, telling me, “I had looked at using this intense beam, which can be angled, to do some experiments in terms of guiding the jetstream, moving it from one spot to another.” Paul Schaefer has a degree is in electrical engineering and used to build nuclear weapons. Shaefer says, “The unnatural level of motion of highly energetic particles in the atmosphere and in radiation belts surrounding Earth is the villain in the weather disruptions.” Fire up giant transmitters like HAARP, and Shaefer’s computer models show how Earth discharges this sudden heat buildup, relieving stress and regaini ng balance through storms, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Commenting on HAARP-related experiment s, Schaefer says, “One look at the weather should tell us that we are on the wrong path.” NEED TO KNOW Did you agree to this? Have you been officially notified of a February, 1990 Plans and Activities report RFP N00014-91-R-0001 jointly issued by the U.S. Air Force Geophysics Laboratory and the Office of Naval Research? Perhaps not. Its circulation was “restricted.” RFP N00014-91-R-0001 declares with emphasis, that HAARP will go “beyond basic research” to “controlling ionospheric processes” by “significantly altering” regions of the ionosphere at a range of 1,200 miles or more. “What is clear,” this formerly classified study notes, “is that at one gigawatt and above effective radiated power...a variety of instability processes are triggered” in the ionosphere."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" Weather is all about energy transfer and the distribution of heat. One recipe for intensifying regional weather calls for adding iron oxide or carbon black to the atmosphere and allowing the sun to heat those particulates. Aimed at doffing Earth’s ionospheric cap, HAARP’s high-energy beam passes right through the atmosphere without heating it – unless something is added by USAF spray planes for HAARP to heat. Putting iron oxide into the atmosphere similar to the particles found in chemtrail fallout in Washington State, Tennessee and Ontario would help HAARP heat the weather-forming troposphere. Alternately, strands of extremely fine polymers could be sprayed into the upper atmosphere to be heated by HAARP. Wafting slowly earthward in thousands of gossamer strands to drape porches, power lines and police cruisers across the United States, this “cobweb-like” material would tend to disintegrate rapidly from moisture, handling and abrasion on the ground. After Environment News Service carried my stor y on advanced weather modification worldwide, HAARP’s inventor Bernard Eastlund wrote to sa y, “The experiments described by Thomas seem technically feasible. Recent work on polymeric additives for microwave absorption has been done for commercial curing applications so the polymer fibers are available.” Trying to imagine polymers sprayed aloft to hold heat, Eastlund said, “The choice of the polymer for high altitude heating experiments would be based on the ability to make low weight filaments that have aerodynamic properties that would allow them to stay in place for long periods of time.” HAARP’s inventor supplied addresses for two producers of polymer capable of being heated by intensely focused Radio Frequency beams. “The heat generation occurs by adding magnetic iron oxide powder to the polymer,” Eastlund explained. FREQ UON-B-20 and F-5 PPS polymers “are sensitive in the 1-50 MHz regime. Note that the HAARP is between 2 and 10 MHz.” EASTLUND’S LATEST PLANS FOR HAARP In a direct contravention of EU protest, Eastlund says that his company ESEC has recently signed a contract with the European Space Agency “to review the weather modification potential of the HAARP facility in Alaska.” "},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Eastlund is also looking to hit budding tornadoes with HAARP – and turn them off before wind speeds reach destructive force. Neither Eastlund nor Dyn-O- Mat – which sprays tons of gel into forming hurricanes to dry up the moisture that drives them – has satisfactorily explained where excess energy equivalent to hundreds of hydrogen bombs is “dissipated” to in the closed recirculating system of Earth’s atmosphere. Eastlund sa ys the extremely high power required to zap tornadoes will come from “high power electromagnetic radiation produced with solar power satellites.” At a time when even low-power cell phones are being shown to have detrimental health effects, the Texas inventor has yet to describe the effects on wildlife and humans of beam ing extremely intense energy through the atmosphere from HAARP or orbiting satellites. Eastlund says that his present preoccupations with HAARP include its application as a “missile shield antenna” – using a one-billion-watt phased array antenna. The unpredictable consequences of hitting the highly fluctuating ionosphere with a beam of energy never before radiated on Earth include wild weather, blown-our power grids thousands of miles from the Alaska transmitter – and the holing or possible complete destruction of the ionospheric shielding that protects all life from lethal cosmic rays – including the gamma and X-rays pouring from the biggest sun flares ever measured. Eastlund’s “current project menu” also includes extracting North Slope gas to power a souped-up HAARP “for weather modification”, “high power solar satellites for weather modification” and “ozone hole mitigation” using electromagnetic processes some scientists fear could destroy the rest of Spaceship Earth’s tattered radiation shielding. Then came word that HAARP is heading for hellacious power levels. The ARRL amateur radio newsletter of October 31, 2003 reported that their technical specialist had attended the 2003 High Frequency Active Auroral Research Project meeting on September 24 at the HAARP site. At the meeting, Richard Lampe learned, “Joint funding through DARPA will allow HAARP to quadruple in size from its current 960 kilowatt output to 3.6 megawatts.” That’s more than three-and-a-half million watts of power tightly focused on Earth’s electrically unstable ionosphere – already under relentless pressure by high-energy bombardments from unprecedented solar eruptions. RUSSIANS WARN HAARP ENDANGERS THE WORLD Kane’s comments came seven mont hs after the Ukrainian parliament raised renewed concerns over HAARP’s “global threat”. Carried on the front page of the January 15/03 edition of Pravda , an article by Duma deputy Yuri Solomatin explained that the Russian Federation State Duma spent nearly a year considering the global threat posed by HAARP. "},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"The first of two documents prepared by the Duma was sent to President Putin and the UN, as well as to international organizations, parliaments and gov ernments worldwide and the global scientific community. The second info sheet was sent to the mass media. Calling HAARP a “weapon,” Solomatin warned, “The operators of such a weapon are able to program floods, tornados storms and even earthquakes in any region of the planet. It is also possible to paralyze civil and military electronic surve illance systems, and even to affect the psyche of entire nations.” According to the parliamentarian charged with handling another techno-calamity called Chernobyl, the Russian government suspects that “unusual natural phenomena and cataclysms, technological catastrophes in 2002 were caused by HAARP transmissions. This techno mayhem, charge the Russians, includes the otherwise inexplicable crash of a jet SU-27 “Flanker” at the Ukrainian Skynliv airshow on July 27 of that year, which left 83 dead and 199 people injured. As described in my book, Scorched Earth, high-performance fighters like the Flanker depend entirely on electronics for their flight-control and fuel systems. The U.S. Air Force earlier launched a major study the effects of electromagnetic pulses on high-performance aircraft after bombs were inadvertently released and fuel systems shut down, causing crashes. Other aircraft exposed to electronic emissions have exploded in flight. “APATHY” OF RUSSIANS BLAMED ON HAARP Even more alarming was the Russian government’s allegation that “the scientifically incomprehensible apathy of entire peoples in the post-Soviet territories can be connected to testing by the USA of such geophysical weapons at low power.” “Apathy” is a widely reported symptom of North American chemtrail exposure. Do high levels of HAARP-conducting barium found in chemtrail samples point to a deliberate policy by Washington to control the moods and emotions of people subjected to relentless travesties of their rights and freedoms? Or are these symptoms another “unintended consequence” of chemtrail spraying that serve its perpetrators well? Yuru Solomatin is a deputy in the Ukrainian parliament, and Secretary of the Ukrainian committee for economic policy, ecological management and the cleanup of the cons equences of the Chernobyl tragedy. Referring to the 1970 convention signed by the USA prohibiting atmospheric modification, the Russian parliament is seeking a global ban on all HAARP tests. DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THE WEATHER In March 1997, Arnold Barnes Jr., of the “Star Wars” Phillips Laboratory described a key element of “Full Spectrum Dominance” at the U.S. Army’s Tecom Test Technology Symposium. In his address this consultant on the Air Force study, calmly outlined the history of the U.S. military’s weather modification programs and what would be needed for future “integrated weather modification capabilities,” reported Bob Fitrakis for Columbus Alive on May 16, 2002. Fitrakis wen t on to detail some of the biggest U.S. Air Force weather modification experiments:"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" * In Operation Popeye, USAF aircraft intensely seeded clouds over Vietnam in order to produce heavy rains along the Ho Chi Minh Trail through Laos which carried supplies from North to South Vietnam. * USAF weather modification was also allegedly carried out during Desert Storm. * USAF projects conducted using the HAARP transmitter are, according to inventor Bernard Eastlund, primarily aimed at “weather modification”. * Air Traffic Controllers across the USA say they are being told to direct civilian airliners below U.S. Air Force tankers engaged in spraying chemicals for the purposes of “weather modification” and “climate modification” experiments. * A secret 1967 memo from the Joint Chiefs of Staff to President Johnson stated: Authorization requested to implement operational phase of weather modification process previously successful tested and evaluated in some area”. (U.S. Senate, Subcommittee on Oceans and International Environment; 26 July 1972) As Bob Fitrakis later wrote in an article describing “Weather Warfare”: With a goal later described as “Full Spectrum Dominance” by the year 2025, the Air Force On March 19, 1997, Dr. Arnold A. Barnes, Jr. of John Hopkins University and Senior Scientist at Phillips Laboratory described a key element of Full Spectrum Dominance at the Tecom Test Technology Symposium in his address on Weather Modification. Barnes, a consultant on the Air Force study, calmly outlined the history of the U.S. military’s weather modification programs and what would be needed for future fully-integrated weather modification capabilities. Barnes noted that there has already been a long history of U.S. military weather modification. As the U.S. Air Force History Office points out on its webpage, “For meteorologists, a major consequence of World War II was the development of a world weather network utilizing new equipment and techniques.” The British Royal Air Force and Western scientists engaged in Operation Cumulus between August 4 and 15, 1952, which, according to a August 30, 2001 BBC broadcast, was a rainmaking project that led to 35 flood-related deaths in Devon. Declassified documents show that in 1953 the British military and their allies were experimenting in increasing rain and snow by artificial means in hopes of “bogging down enemy movement.” Between November 1955 and April 1956, the U.S. Air Force participated in Project 119-L, which resulted in a worldwide meteorological survey. USA Today confirms, “From 1961 into 1980 U.S. scientists conducted extensive research into the possibility of weakening hurricanes with cloud-seedi ng techniques. The Project was known as Project Storm Fury.” Fitrakis continued: By early 1967, Operation Popeye was underway. The 54 th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron took off, in the words of one military official, to “make mud, not war.” The military seeded the clouds over the Ho Chi Minh Trail to create floods and wash out North Vietnamese supply routes. Dr. Barnes pointed out that “Operation Popeye [was] run by people from our lab.”"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Columnist Jack Anderson broke the story about the politically sensitive operation in 1971 paving the way for a Congressional investigation that documented these and other secret weather modification warfare programs. As public anger grew, Senator Clayborn Pell of Rhode Island, who originally believed it was better to be rained on with water than bombs, wrote an editorial in the Providence Journal Bulletin in 1975 entitled “United States and Other World Powers Should Outlaw Tampering With Weather for Use as War Weapon.” That year, the U.S. and the Soviets began negotiations to ban weather modification as a military weapon. On October 10, 1976, the UN produced the treaty “Convention on the Prohibition of Military or any other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification” (ENMOD). Barnes argued that the new “advanced weapons systems” were “more environmentally sensitive” and once again, the military should be engaging in weather modification weapons. In the years following Dr. Barnes’ presentation on fully integrating high-tech weather modification into the U.S. military, so-called chemtrail sightings have occurred throughout the United States and its Western allies. Barnes embraced the government’s HAARP Project in Alaska, also managed by Phillips Laboratory, as a weapon “to enhance communications and surveillance systems, e.g., over-the-horizon (for both civilian and defense purposes).” [columbusalive.com] BRINGING HAARP TO HEEL Will the EU intervene to internationally condemn chemtrails? A precedent was set in February 1998, when the European Parliamentary Committee On Foreign Affairs, Security And Defense Policy held public hearings in Brussels on the HAARP program. A Motion for Resolution submitted by the committee to the European Parliament: “Considers HAARP by virtue of its far-reaching impact on the environment to be a global concern and calls for its legal, ecol ogical and ethical implications to be examined by an international independent body; [the Committee] regrets the repeated refusal of the United States Administration to give evidence to the public hearing into the environmental and public risks [of] the HAARP program.” The parliamentary committee went on to produce a “Green Paper” on “the environmental impacts of military activities.” "},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" Chapter 15. STEERING HURRICANES Steer a hurricane? Drain its punch? Many believe it c an’t be done. But as chemtrails have shown, reality often trumps belief. Dr. Ben Livingston is one of the world’s foremost weather modification experts. After receiving a master’s degree in cloud physics from the Naval Weapons Center and Navy Post Graduate School in California, Livingston was invited to the White House to brief President Lyndon Johnson on the effectiveness of weather control. Following that meeting, Dr. Livingston was ordered to seed rain clouds over Vietnam in a monsoon manipulati on effort dubbed Operation Popeye. Interviewed by Alex Jones at prisonplanet.com on October 13, 2005, Livingston lamented that hurricane control was no longer a federal government priority, as it was in the ‘Sixties during Project Storm Fury. As detailed by reporters Steve Watson and Paul Joseph Watson, Livingston insisted that reducing or redirecting a Category 4 hurricane is not difficult: A hurricane is made up of energy sails and each of those sails adds to the ferocity of it. It was proven in 1974 by an international project that these energy sails exist and that they are the reason that hurricanes can develop and grow move and cause damages. So there’s no reason to attack the hurricane in total but just to fly in to the right front quadrant primarily relative to the direction the storm is moving in and seed those energy sails that are converging and making the rain and wind velocity increase in the front part of a hurricane. "},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" We would be trying to destroy or at least grossly reduce the velocity in these individual energy sails by seeding the clouds with silver iodide in the top part of the cloud... and those tops would then have so many small droplets in them that the prevailing wind just blows them away and so an energy sail would be neutralized until it can regroup which may be several hours later. Livingston asserted that hurricane control was a national priority of the government in the 1960s and they had the ability to do it at that time – 40 years ago. Around 1954—after three major hurricanes slammed into 12 northeastern states—the U.S. Government allotted some $30 million to the U.S. Weather Bureau “for weather modification and weather control practices to the tune of about 30 million dollars,” Livingston stated. The resulting Project Storm Fury is well documented. As Jimmy Patterson reported for the Midland Reporter Telegram : “In the 1960s, a national priority of our government was hurricane control,” Livingston said. “Silver iodide is used as a nuclei that causes rai ndrops to form. The original hypothesis is that if you get enough rain or cool air into a hurricane y ou can diminish its velocity and strength. When I left the military in the 1960s, we had the ability to do that, and reduce wind velocity in hurricanes by 25% and damage caused by a hurricane by 63%.” As Livingston went on to explain, “Basically the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was formed to take that responsibility...Their charge wa s to employ the most brilliant scientists around the world, and meteorologists and physicists, to work out a concept for reducing damages from hurricanes.” “Livingston revealed that on the 18th August 1969, five seedings at two-hour intervals on Hurricane Debbie, researchers deduced that the wind speed had decreased from 115mph to 80 mph. That is a 30% reduction and a 45% reduction in damages,” the Watsons wrote. “On August 20th a second seeding decreased the wind speed again to just under 100 mph, a reduction of around 15%.” These initial successes were allegedly followed by the inadvertent redirection of a hurricane into Nicaragua. Project Storm Fury was supposedly shut down because the data obtained was not conclusive enough to prove that storm modification techniques were responsible for altering the tracks of giant circular storms that often change direction erratically, anyway. But many observers believe that the project – like so many others – went “black” at that time. And continues today. Because hurricanes are so dynamically unstable, this weather control expert maintained that just two seeding aircraft could change its path. “We’re carrying more cloud seeding material on one airplane now – over 800% more on each plane than we had during Project Storm Fury,” Livingston told Jones. Livingston has personally flown on 265 missions into the eyes of hurricanes and has gone on record as \"most disgusted\" with Hurricane Katrina, which he insists could have been minimized. With his hurricane control research confirmed by the Stanford Research Institute, Livingston currently works with scientists and pilots at Weather Modification Inc. in Fargo, North Dakota. SUE THEM ALL If weather modification is admitted, financial liabili ty will be a big issue. According to the Stanford Research Institute, which joined Project Storm Fury in the late ‘Sixties, tinkering with hurricanes could result in major lawsuits if an accidentally strengthened or misdirected storm caused extensive damage and loss of life."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":" PLAYING WITH DYN-O-MITE Peter Cordani doesn’t agree. Cordani is the CEO of a Florida-based company that claims it can sap the strength of hurricanes with a super-absorbent product that absorbs the moisture in their storm cells, causing the rapidly spinning cells to break apart. Successful, independently verified demonstrations that disintegrated clouds and storms off Palm Beach, Florida was followed in late 2001 by active involvement from a U.S. Air Force already committed to “Owning The Weather”. That year, a representative for Dyn-O-Mat told Ohio’s Columbus Alive magazine how the company planned to lessen the winds of a hurricane from “135 miles an hour to 110 miles an hour.” Specializing in absorbent materials to soak up spills from pets to jets and automobiles, this company based in Jupiter Beach, Florida pledges “to prot ect humanity worldwide from hurricanes and typhoons.” Capable of absorbing nearly 4,000 times its weight in water as it falls through storm clouds, Dyn-O-Gel is said to dissolve in saltwater without contaminating the environment. [Dyno Press Release May 28/00; Columbus Alive June 20/02; Chemtrai ls Confirmed by William Thomas] On July 19, 2001 in an experiment costing just under one million dollars, a chartered B-57 Canberra jet bomber entered a thunderstorm 10 miles off West Palm Beach and released some 9,000 pounds of redesigned Dyn-O-Gel capable of 10-times stronger water absorption. As soon as the Canberra released its load of Dyn-O-Gel, Miami’s Channel 5’s weather radar showed the thunderstorm losing moisture. Within seconds, the buildup vanished as one side of the cloud collapsed “like an avalanche”, according to a chase plane cameraman. [Sun-Sentinel July 20/01] “The people in the tower visually confirmed that there was a tall buildup, and the next moment it was gone,” said control tower supervisor Kevin Sullivan. TechTV confirmed that Dyn-O-Mat had “removed a building thunderstorm completely from the atmosphere, a first-ever feat documented by Doppler radar.” [SF Chronicle July 20/01]"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":" “It worked, brother! This is what we’ve been looki ng for,” declared an ecstatic Dyn-O-Mat CEO Peter Cordani. “Our point is proven.” [NewOrleansChannel.com; Sun-Sentinel] Measured against single storm’s potential losses up to $40 billion, it would cost just over $6 million to drop two doses of Dyn-O-Gel weighing 1.67 million pounds into a fully developed hurricane. Five air force KC-10 tankers could deliver this amount of powder into the western edge of a hurricane. Since 2001, in all press coverage of Cordani’s achievements and ambitions, there has been no mention of government funding, or air force tankers spraying Dyn-O-Gel into tropical storms. The classified Dyn- O-Mat story evaporated like gel-bombed clouds over Palm Beach. But what is the potential downside? Hurricanes redistribute tropical warmth northwards, helping to adjust and balance the climate. And NOAA research meteorologist Robert Black worries, “Such seeding could easily make the storm worse, by removing precipitation faster, thereby unloading the convective updraft and allowing them to create tornadoes, hail, lightning, etc.” [Business 2.0 Jan /02] Hurricane-seeding could also slow these massive st orms down, causing their destructive deluge to linger longer over populated areas. A WALK ON THE BEACH Just before Frances hit, its central eye suddenly expanded from the usual 20 miles across to 70 nautical miles wide. “That is just unbelievably large,” exclaimed a CNN affiliate out of Jacksonville. “And it’s moving unbelievably slow. If it’s going five, they say eight miles an hour, it could take 10 hours for the eye to go through. I mean that’s crazy.” It took 13. WFOR-TVs Dave Malkoff was on hurricane watch at Juno Beach just north of West Palm Beach when he was drawn to something on the water. It was 9:14 Saturday morning and Frances was coming in at a walk as Malkoff strode toward the shoreline to get a closer look. “Gel foam down here on the ocean,” Malkoff told viewers. “Once these waves crash, you’re going to see something interesting. Once the waves crash they instantly mix with foam – watch! That’s the foam right there. And it instantly turns into like a foam that you would have in your bathtub, and it blows away like a solid. Instantly, this foam that’s coming off the ocean mixes with the sand and is blowing down this way.” "},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" Whatever he was seeing was too thick for normal foam. Confirmation came at 11:28 that morning when a CBS-affiliate reported from Pompano Beach: “White foam all across the water. And it is not blowing away.” Those news reports reminded me of an item posted on the environmental website, Moonbow Media: “On July 19, 2001, ABC News reported a similar story of gelatinous ‘goo’ again washing up on beaches in West Palm Beach, Florida. This time it turns out the substance was identified as Dyn-O-Gel.” WHAT HAPPENED TO CHARLEY? As Hurricane Charley approached Jamaica, something strange occurred. “It was following a direct line path through the center of Jamaica, but suddenly it made a perfect arched curve to the south, and ended up back on its original course after it had swung around the island,” observed Michael Edward. “That was just as odd as the sudden right-hand turn it made into Charlotte Harbor. There's no doubt that since hurricane paths have been recorded over the pas t 200 years, no hurricane ever acted like Charley did, or had ever followed such an erratic path. This was one of the biggest reasons Tampa was the predicted landfall area.” As the biggest evacuation in Florida’s history got underway, “the sudden spike in Hurricane Charley’s strength took even forecasters by storm,” the Associated Press reported. “Then Charley started turning to the east, taking aim at the area south of Tampa Bay and officials were quickly looking at an entirely different storm. “At the same time as it turned, Charley rapidly strengthened, going from a Category 2 storm at 110 miles per hour to a Category 4 storm at 145 miles per hour in only three hours. This rapid intensification was outside the official forecast, which called for only a slight strengthening before landfall.” [AP Aug 14/04; Sept 4/04] And something else happened, too. As Michael Edward noted, in the late 1800's Nicola Tesla discovered that the Earth reverberates with a pulsating electrical current in the ELF (Extremely Low Frequency) range. More than half-a-century’s concentrated research by Soviet and U.S. military researchers subsequently showed how artificially- created ELF waves identical to the frequency spectrum of human brainwaves can change thoughts and emotions. 7.83 Hz - Earth's pulse rate – makes people feel good; 10.80 Hz can produce riotous behavior and 6.6 Hz causes depression. 10 Hz puts people into a hypnotic state. This technology has been used in Afghanistan and Iraq, where “poppers” capable of reproducing a smorgasbord of frequencies were directed by the U.S. military against local populations – until severe electromagnetic “blowback” caused the program to be halted. In speaking with everyone he could “who survived the direct path of Hurricane Charley,” Michael Edward learned that “people were not just describing the pressure they felt in their ears or the other physical signs of rapid pressure changes. Rather, they we re describing extreme mental and mood changes they could not control. About an hour before the center of Hurricane Charley passed over, su rvivors have described how they became very tired, depressed, and lethargic. Not the anxiety depression such anticipation would typically invoke. This was an overall mental and physical depression that even affected them with general body aches and a widespread feeling of non-wellbeing. Almost all said it was as if they were drugged with a pain killer, but without the \"goofy side effects.\" They could do the things they needed to do, such as get mattresses into their bathrooms to huddle under, but their thinking seemed \"surreal.\""},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"When the eye passed over, they described feel ing \"numbed, both ment ally and physically.\" While a few took a look outside to see if it was all over, most said they just didn't have a thought to do anything other than sleep and not move an inch from where they were. What is most interesting is what they all described after Charley had finished its fury, from 1 to 3 hours later. Stupor, hypnotized, trance, under a spell, and zombie were the most common descriptions. Even though they were aware that the hurricane had passed, they were mentally not able to do anything. Some knew it was all over, but they just wanted to sleep. Nearly all just stayed put and didn't bother to check their own surroundings. Nothing made sense, it was hard to get words spoken past a mental thought, and there was no fear or care about anything. Personally, Charley was the third hurricane direct hit I have lived through, yet I never felt the same symptoms with the first two as I did with Charley. Edwards feel strongly that extremely low electromagnetic frequencies were used to change Hurricane Charley’s track. As he correctly observes, “Scalar mind and weather manipulation are accomplished in the same ELF range, and that is not just an unproven theory: It is a proven scientific fact.” [world Vision Portal.org Aug 30/04] SEE HURRICANE CHARLEY VIDEO HERE PUNCTURING IVAN Charley’s cousin Ivan also acted weird. Gulf Coast television commentators termed it “strange” when this follow-on hurricane abruptly turned away from making direct hits on Jamaica and the Caymans. As Ivan closed the U.S. Gulf Coast, a “dry air in cursion” opened a wide boulevard into the eyewall, causing it to collapse. As the eye reformed and the storm wobbled slightly toward the east, Ivan’s entire southwestern quadrant became jagged, misshapen and devoid of rain. Located behind dikes below sea-level and expecting a direct hit, the city of New Orleans escaped not only Ivan’s wrath but even its heavy precipitation in what many evacuating residents called a “miracle”. Was this miracle manmade? The Golden Rule of Hurricanes is that they do not always behave as anticipated. But with wildly fluctuating wind velocities, sudden course changes and drastically slowed speed-of-advance, none of these three modern hurricanes behaved as predicted. [AP Aug 14/04; Washington Post Aug 15/04; CNN coverage] A CONVERSATION WITH CORDANI I was lucky t o catch Dyn-O-Mat CEO Peter Cordani between interviews with FOX, CNN and Howard Stern. Everyone, it seemed, wanted to know if his company can defuse future weather bombs. Dyn-O-Mat’s CEO denied any involvement with the U.S. government or military. “We’re not involved with the government,” Cordani said. “We’d like to be. With the exposure we’re getting, we’re hoping the government will have interest, [ and] the insurance companies.” Cordani did confirm that Dyn-O-Mat has recently t eamed up with the world’s biggest aircraft modification company, Evergreen to lease a modified a 747 to spray the storm-busting powder, Cordani said. “Hopefully within the next five, six months we can do the testing.” The hurrica ne hunter claimed that a single modifi ed 747 Supertanker could stop a hurricane from forming. Using Doppler radar to reveal revolvi ng Lows before they turn into tropical storms and"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"eventually hurricanes, Cordani told me, “We want to attack it in its embryo stage, whether off the coast of Africa or wherever, and get it out of the way.” When asked to supply additional information on the ai r force test that dispensed his company’s product into a storm off the South Florida coast in October 2001, Cordani did not respond. But the U.S. Air Force admitted to CNN in July 2004 that it had broken up a storm over the Atlantic using products made by a company called Dyn-O-Mat. The following year, a serving member of the U.S. military confirmed his work with the C-130s used to seed hurricanes Frances, Charles and Ivan as they closed the Florida coast. According to this source, the returning squadron could be resuppplied and refueled in just 10-minutes using the special tracks and containers of the MASS Containerized Cargo Turnaround System to load fresh tanks of hurricane-seeding chemicals into the giant transports while they were being “hot-fueled” with engines running. Conroy Pen ner and his brother Murray helped fabricate the C-130 spray tanks at Conair in British Columbia under a United States Air Force contract specifying 11 special tank systems for use with Hercules C-130s to “spray insects” on USAF bases in the States. According to the air force, specifically modified C-130s are used by the 757th wing based at Youngstown, Ohio - near “chemtrail central” at Wright Patterson - for to spray pesticides on South American cocoa crops. The 757th h as six of Penner’s Modular Aerial Spray Systems to load and reload its four MASS-modified C-130s. Each MASS unit has a 2,000-gallon capacity and flow rate of 232 gallons per minute. [The Officer July 2000] The transports make their spray runs at 200 knots at just 100 feet, laying a 100 foot-wide swath of the UN-banned herbicide glyphosate over Colombian coca plant s. Colombian farmers hit by this new “Agent Orange” complain that wind-drifted fungi banned by the UN are hitting adjacent agricultural fields. “The fumigation has caused damage to our yucca and sugarcane crops and has caused sickness in our children,” said Francisco Tenorio, president of the Regional Indigenous Organization. Across Columbia, communities report that indiscriminate fumigation is causing illnesses, destroying pastures and food crops, poisoning livestock and contam inating water supplies. Photos displayed at a press conference showed food crops destroyed by fumigation alongside thriving coca plants that somehow escaped the herbicide. About 500 bird species also inhabit the region targeted by USAF C-130 spray planes. The Environmental Protection Agency’s own study on the herbicide published in 1993 noted that in California, a state that is required to report pestici de poisonings, glyphosate was ranked third out of the 25 leading causes of illness or injury due to pesticides. [Inter-Press Service November 22/00] “From a global bio-diversity perspective, defoliating and poisoning vast areas of Colombian forests is like dynamiting the Taj Mahal, a global jewel of humanity’s cultural heritage,” protested David Olson, director of the conservation science program at the World Wildlife Fund. "},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Olson said that large areas of forest are being contaminated and stripped of their leaves, causing a loss of wildlife habitat and increased fragmentation of intact forests. Just like the USAF defoliation operations that devastated Vietnam. According to one U.S. Air Force source, other MASS systems are used to spray moisture-absorbing chemicals into weather fronts, including hurricanes. But after helping to fabricate 15 to 18 foot-long pressure tanks and smaller purge tanks using “exotic alloys and specially machined parts,” the Penners quit the project when they decided that such elaborate fabrications did not “add up.” Energy drained from a hurricane doesn’t go away. It just goes somewhere else. TV meteorologist Glen Burns warned that trying to evaporate hurricanes could have catastrophic effects on the world's climate by turning off the planet's air conditioners. Hurricanes pull cold air from the poles to the tropics. Turn them off and the tropics could heat up, eventually feeding even bigger Superstorms, Burns said. [email to the author by a WSB-TV viewer] Concerns were also raised that the hurricane seeding experiments could make a storm change course, smashing people and places it would have otherwise missed. Because sudden changes in intensity can alter a storm's direction, seeding a hurricane and changing its wind strength could easily cause it to veer off its predicted track. But the temptation to tinker is total. Measured against single storm’s potential losses up to $40 billion, it would cost just over $6 million to drop two doses of Dyn-O-Gel weighing 1.67 million pounds into a fully developed hurricane.

This time it turns out the substance was identified as Dyn-O-Gel.” HANK “Hank” and I have been breaking major stories since I firs t interviewed this former military technician and Desert Storm veteran for my book, Bringing The War Home in 1991. The use of mind-and-mood altering “poppers” by the U.S. military in Afghanistan and Iraq, the detonation of at least three “low yield” nuclear bunker-buster bombs in those countries by U.S. forces, and the aborted nuclear strike on Iran by the Israeli Defense Forces F-16s after being intercepted by U.S. Air Force fighters over Iraq – all caused major waves in the U.S. Congress, British Parliament, Israeli Knesset and Iranian Government. And may even have saved some lives. With high-ranking sources on Capitol Hill, as well as inside the Pentagon and the Vatican, in our 18 year collaboration, Hank’s information has always proven accurate. So I was eager to learn what he knew about steering hurricanes. What about the skeptics who claim humans cannot possibly muster enough energy to deflect a hurricane? “It would be like trying to move a car with a pea shooter,” scoffs hydro-meteorologist Matthew Kelsch of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder. “The amount of energy involved in a hurricane is far greater that anything we’re going to impart to it.” [AP Sept 23/05] So why not use a hurricane’s massive energy to redirect it?"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"EVERYTHING IS VIBRATION “How much energy do you need to redirect it? Not a lot,” Hank replied. “It’s all frequency. Everything is waves. Everything is frequency. “They’re playing music to this thing,” he went on. “A hurricane is partly vapor, partly solid water, partly in between the two. Hit it with radar and you get a readout of its frequencies. If you can image something, that means you are interacting with it. If you are interacting with it, you can affect it. If you can affect it, you can control it. If you’ve got an atmospheric reflector and HAARP, you’ve got the right amount of energy in the right frequency.” How much energy at which frequency band? HAARP’s “final expanded stage” envisioned by its inventor, Dr. Bernard Eastlund was reached under the second Bush administration. In July 2006 HAARP’s array was increased from 48 to 180 of ionospheric- heating antennas, boosting HAARP’s power from 960,000 watts to 3.6 million watts. [Business Wire June 10/04] Operating in the ELF (Extreme Low Frequency) band, HAARP’s powerful radio waves can steer weather patterns – including hurricanes. All this powerful transmitter needs is something dumped into the atmosphere to resonate at HAARP’s frequency. [borderlands.com Jan 27/99] HOW TO JUDO-FLIP A HURRIANCE If you want to control a hurricane, said my very-well connected informant, “you turn it into something that can grab a hold of, and hit it with a standing wave.” Special chemtrails provide the “handles”. And the standing wave is beamed by HAARP. So how can a hurricane be judo-flipped 90-degrees? Press the ends of two broomsticks together as hard as you can and they won’t go anywhere. Apply a small force at a right angle to where they meet - and both sticks will fly apart, my friend explained. Now “use the rotating Earth as a force of nature against the force of rotating hurricane” by inducing “a very small standing wave” – using air-dispersed atmospheric reflectors and HAARP. The standing wave works like a fulcrum. Contain the top of the hurricane with part of the standing wave, and it would look like a tongue depressor bent into “C,” Hank visualized. When the hurricane comes in, “the only way it can go is to squish, turn and follow the interior of that ‘C’ – which is a 90-degree angle.” But... And there is always a “but”... “Energy drained from a hurricane doesn’t go away. It just goes somewhere else,” Hank echoed other critics of hurricane manipulation – possibly causing earthquakes, tsunamis or other severe geological stress-releasing events on the opposite side of the globe.

Like US drug manufacturers successfully seeking legal indemnity from the lethal side-effects of their products, a change in federal laws could make it impossible for communities to sue over redirected storm damage. But what about neighboring countries? [Telegraph Oct 24/07] CAUGHT ON CAMERA “It was a perfect storm,” Hank said. “Too perfect. The entire storm moved as one unit.” Look at the track that the Weather Channel showed, he invited. “The bottom and the top stayed the same. You could look straight down to the ocean through the eye.” Meteorologists he spoke with insisted that was impossible. Because the top and bottom of a hurricane move forward at different speeds. “In order to redirect it they had to have the right conditions depth wise, they had to have the right conditions timing wise, he continued. “The water depth has it be right to build a standing wave on the seabed. They had to have it pegged into the dirt.” The Continental Shelf is shallow enough to anchor HAARP and trip Katrina, using the storm’s incredible force against itself. “The bottom half will stay stationary. The top will continue,” Hank explained. “And you will have something like three- to five-times the force slingshot around. SARAN WRAP Hanks sources told him the only cargo plane with the “legs” to fly from distant stateside bases and return were specially modified C-5 Galaxy transports. “They pl astic-coated the interior of these things, so that it’s a silo lying down,” Hank learned. Three aircra ft were used for a single run. “When it got close enough to shore all of them dumped and turned around and ran.” "},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"The big planes could not have remained in the area when HAARP’s standing wave hit. Their electronics would have been fried. But what were they dumping from their cavernous Saran-wrapped interiors? PLAYING WITH POLYMERS When it hit the massive rain cells inside Katrina, the “angel hair” dumped from the three C-5s “polymerized” into long stringy strands that were spun like yarn inside that gigantic cyclone. The cold strands cooled the rainwater, slowing the hurricane and making it easier to grab. “It’s the next best thing to silly string,” Hank told me. Except, just as Dr. Bernard Eastlund had told me, these polymers are tunable. “Now we know the frequency of the hurricane because we introduced it,” Hank continued. “It was planned and orchestrated bounce.” You don’t get that in nature, he added. “Square edges” – slow-curving hurricanes making sudden right- angle turns. “Find one instance where a hurricane of any magnitude Cat 5 on down has ever taken a 90- degree turn. Not a one.” “If it would’ve hit Texas it would gone inland it would've hooked left and down hit Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth and made it almost all the way over to El Paso,” Hank said. “It would have gone right down the center of Texas.” “Some underground silos that nobody knew about” might have been drowned. Oil wells and the national oil reserve. Nuclear storage facilities. “Huston as in ‘Huston, we have a problem,’ as in NASA” and the Johnson Space Flight Center. “Bad,” he observed. “It would have been a big inconvenience for them and they just really didn’t want to go there.” But the Texas panhandle was neither evacuated nor pr epared for Katrina. “No plywood over windows. Nothing. Zee-ro. How is it possible that no one was told to do that?” Hank wanted to know. “Houston is near the coast. There are pictures of people around NASA having a fucking picnic.

While hurricane hunters like Dyn-O-Mat’s Peter Cordani are enthused over the potential of 7847 Super Tankers in this new role, Tom Robinson wouldn’t be caught dead in a converted DC-10 or 747 – mostly because he fears that’s how he’d end up. These are passenger planes, he pointed out – “too slick, too fast” and never made to drop big payloads before returning to a five-mile long runway. The supposed 24,000 gallon drops by converted 747s seen on YouTube are “computer- generated drops,” Robinson told me. Even with just 8,000 gallons onboard, “the wingtips were shaking so violently,” the engineer overseeing that first tentative test flight swore he never wanted to get back on. Serving as Chief operations officer for Global Emer gency Response, Robinson has an ideal alternative. He flies the biggest fire-fighting planes in the world, the mindboggling IL-76 water bomber. Now he wants to use these huge airplanes to put out hurricanes. “I have been asked to participate in a federally-funded experiment in Florida, using the water bomber to attempt to minimize or totally disrupt a forming hurricane,” he emailed me, after listening to my 10 th appearance on Coast To Coast. “Supposedly, if we can drop the temperature of the forming \"eye\" by just one degree we can alter the outcome. I can deliver up to 18,000 gallons of environmentally-friendly coolant on a single flight and \"seed\" the eye with a high-pressure nozzle system capable of delivering the chemicals in a mile-wide swath.” That got this former Cessna driver’s attention. I called him up. The longtime American pilot and dedicated firefighter is a major fan of the Ilyushin-76. In the 15 years Robinson’s been flying IL-76s, there have been zero crashes and no serious accidents. “These are fantastic planes,” he said, rated by Jane’s All The World’s Aircraft and other aviation authorities as one of the safest planes around. It’s also the only airplane on this planet big enough and strong enough to carry 18,000 gallons of fire or hurricane retardant – and release the entire load in seconds without coming apart or diving out of control. "},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":" In contrast, the Ilyushin was built to operate off rough airstrips in Afghanistan. The 220-ton plane's wide and tremendously strong wing, tail and fuselage require no alterations to tangle with hurricanes. Like the American C-130s deployed to drop desiccant into hurricanes off the U.S. Gulf Coast, “all the tanks go in on railroad tracks,” Robinson explained. But the IL-76 has five-times the capacity of the C-130. And its 18,000 gallons of fire water or hurricane coolant can be loaded in just 15 minutes. But don’t try with this with any other airplane. When150,000 pounds of liquid payload are jettisoned in just seconds, an aircraft’s center of balance “gets completely screwy,” Robinson said. It will enter a steep dive or climb, its pilots will over control, and... “You’re going to lose the plane.” Plus, those pregnant water bombers carry their payloads in external tanks just six-inches off the runway, making them extremely tricky to take-off and land. The gigantic IL-76 carries its payload safely sequestered inside a massive cargo bay. Imagine an IL-76 crammed with super cold nitrogen ranging nearly 4,000 nautical miles at a cruising speed of 420 knots to seek out and destroy a newly forming hurricane. Using its heat-seeking gear to mark the core of the hurricane’s forming eye, the plane’s five-person crew cinches their harnesses tight. Making a single run, the king-size cargo plane shoots a mile-long swath of pressurized liquid nitrogen nearly the width of a football field into the budding storm. "},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":" Wouldn’t this chill a baby hurricane instantly? “If you can lower the ambient temperature in a forming hurricane, you can disrupt it,” Robinson says. By delivering 18,000 gallons of super-cool nitrogen mixt ure into a hurricane's newly-forming eye, “we believe we stop hurricanes.” NOAA wants to try. Robinson revealed that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in cooperation with the US Air force and three Florida universities, is offering a multi-million grant to nitrogen-fix hurricanes “If we can do this full scale experiment with universities in Florida with funding from NOAA, I think we’re going to change the world,” Robinson asserted. But when it comes to world-changing, what if someone starts using nitrogen to suppress hurricanes – and gooses global warming? While plain nitrogen is harmless, reactive nitrogen compounds called nitrous oxide are much worse than CO2 in impacting climate. Even today, the unprecedented release of millions of tons of nitrogen fertilizer and vehicle exhaust has been dubbed “the biggest global change that nobody has ever heard of.” When combined with oxygen, a single nitrogen oxide compounds lingers in the atmosphere for a century – and is 300-times more potent a heat-trapping gas than carbon dioxide. “Those of us who are studying it are pretty scared,” says Menlo Park ecologist, Stuart Weisinert. [Inside Bay Area Aug 12/07; University of Virginia Press Release May 15/08] Right now, the money offered by NOAA is not enough to buy, fly and maintain a single Ilyushin. The Bank of China is eager to step in with financing. Why are you going anywhere else, the Chinese asked Robinson? “We are the masters of weather modification. We guaranteed no rain for the Beijing Olympics – and there was no rain. We can start and stop the weather when we want to.” “We need an American flag on our planes,” Robinson responded.

Of course, the Kremlin is also eager to bankroll the efforts of Global Emergency Response to snuff nascent hurricanes. “It scares the hell out of me,” Robinson wrote to me. “I am hoping to make contact with more benign U.S. sources to keep this technology stateside.” Ironically, the big Russian planes that might have extinguished Katrina were used instead to bring in portable hospitals and beds during that disaster. Should we be messing with hurricanes? Just as some forest fires are needed to replenish soil and nurture new growth, hurricanes act as huge atmospheric air conditioners, shifting large masses of rain- cooled air to where it’s needed most. And that rain can be vital. “I look at this with a little apprehension,” Robinson admitted. Drying up hurricanes means that a lot of moisture is not going to fall where it might be needed. You could cause droughts, he warned. “You have to be very careful.” We may never know. At least not in the United States, where chemtrails and HAARP's risky rays remain the hurricane-movers of choice.

WE ARE NOT ALONE While most chemtrail reports originate in the USA, many other sightings are swallowed by time and distance and are rarely recorded outside their anxious, far-flung communities. But thanks to instant electronic messaging and an exponentially expanding worldwide web, the biggest breaking story of the decade can be viewed and verified with a few keystrokes from correspondents reporting to me at willthomas.net from any country. A friend named Hendrik chronicled a visit to Holland in late 1999: The first chemtrails I saw were over Deventer, a town of perhaps 80,000, on October 17. At least five spray planes, one making “dotted line”, the others crossing the short stripes in the middle to make X’s. At one point at least 10 at once. They worked against the setting sun, totally whited out the sky. I saw two black helicopters (my first), a round deep black object, stationary for a while, and an ovoid silvery ‘drone’, spinning around its axis, traversing the sky east to west at the height of the spraying. I stood on my brother’s balcony, went inside when I smelt the acrid, sourish smell asso ciated with the phenomenon. I was shocked and amazed. Even more so, because neither my brother nor sister would come to the window to even look, saying that I was just looking at planes going to Schiphol (A’dam) airport. Whatever I could say, no avail. That surprised me, because my siblings were always pretty smart and curious."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"My brother interpreted my excitement at the sighting as a form of mania, to be corrected with the appropriate pill. My second witnessing of the trails was on October 25, from the town of Heemskerk, 30 km NW of Amsterdam. The lines were very long and parallel, almost N-S, covering a good part of the peninsula of North Holland. The spraying lasted all day long, with nary a let up. There were a few trails crossing; the wind was from the west, and the planes [four or five] were working east to west, ending up over the North Sea, which I watched from a high dune, having gone to the seaside. Striking was a huge S-rune, like the one used by the Nazis. I spoke with a woman who saw me watching in town, and she said this had been going on for at least two months, on most clear days, and the result was a milky white sky. She had complained to Schiphol [airport], but was referred to the Air Pollution Control Branch, which took note but no follow-up. Myself I went to the (now languishi ng) NGO called “Enviro-Defense” [Milieudefensie] in A’dam, but they had never heard of aerial spraying like this. They were aware of bad air quality around the airport, from conventional sources. They evinced no curiosity about chemtrails, did not even take down your website. On the streets the Dutch looked very uniform, or fashionable. All had black or dark gray overcoats, black shiny shoes, mostly jeans; they walked very fast, many carried cell-phones, they hardly looked at anything, let alone at one another. As a visitor, I walked a bit slower, and looked around, and when I caught someone else looking around, there was almost a sense of recognition, as of people among robots. It was definitely a bit eerie. I spoke with several more awake Dutchmen, and they shared my concern. They said the conformity was of the last few years, and seen as the price for economic prosperity. The economy is booming there, with virtually no more serious challenges to the growth model in the press. After my return to B.C., I heard from a recent visitor to Geneva, that he had been struck by the same extreme conformity; same story about Denmark. The speed limit is now increased to 120km/hr in Holland; the youth is smoking tobacco like there is no tomorrow. I can’t draw any definite conclusions, but I am surprised how fast a progressive population can be controlled.

But for nearly two months now I have not seen a single trail, which has persisted for more than a few minutes.

ITALIAN FILMMAKERS HUNT NORTH AMERICAN CHEMTRAILS In the fall 2003, concerned countrymen dispatched two Italian documentary filmmakers to document chemtrails on the other side of the Atlantic. After flying in from Rome, Vincent Gambino and Duce (du- shey) interviewed me on Hornby Island hideout – and were interviewed in turn. Vincent and Duce showed recent video filmed from their 3,500 year old village in northern Italy. Located 500 meters above the sparkling Mediterranean, the descendants of Roman Legions look out on air traffic departing and landing at a major airport to the south. Arriving airliners sometimes scrawl brief contrails in otherwise flawless skies. But most o ften, the predominantly low altitude aircraft leave no contrails at all. But that doesn’t save the town’s airspace from becoming completely obscured by jet trails. “We wake up some days and the whole sky is filled with trails, and there is no good explanation of this,” Vincent said. The pair showed excellent-quality digital footage of extensive criss-crossing plumes coalescing and spreading out over the Italian sky – the unmistakable si gnature of chemtrails. Pointing to the extensive sky grids, Vincent said simply, “Impossible.” Vincent also related how last year, a protest am ong airport workers at Fiumicino received prominent media coverage after a “famous white plane” belonging to the USAF landed at a cordoned off part Rome’s big international airport. “No one was allowed close for two or three days,” Vincent explained. Airport workers were angry at the secrecy, he said, and the fact that they “couldn’t do their jobs.” Working closely with Nexus Italy, Vincent has been investigating chemtrails since becoming aware of them two years ago, after reading an article by the author in Nexus magazine. Hoping to spur awareness and action across a nation intensely interested information overlooked or censored by the mainstream press, the two filmmakers produced a one-hour documentary on chemtrails for Italian audiences. They were especially interested in the experience of Espanola, a tiny Canadian community west of Sudbury, Ontario that was the first to petition a national government after being hammered by photo- identified U.S. Air Forcer tankers spraying sick-making plumes affecting a 50 square mile area in the spring and summer of 1991. In Italy, a “Parliamentary Interrogation” - or in vestigation – into the purpose and composition of chemtrails is also being sought. The country’s former government and now the official Opposition, the Democratic Left is demanding a Parliamentary investigation into chemtrails and their possible connection to HAARP. Although barium is twice as refl ectant as glass, and thus serves well as a sunlight reflector called for in the late Dr. Edward Teller’s “sunscreen” scheme, the opposition notes that this common electrolyte is also an excellent conductor of electricity. Vincent told me that his group is currently raising money for more extensive tests on chemtrail fallout. But after collecting “white material” from the chemclouds, the Italians have already found “barium salts”."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"While many barium salts are non-toxic, other barium compounds have been used as rat poison. While the filmmakers did not know the type of barium identified in Italian chemtrails, we wondered just who are the lab rats in this ongoing secret experiment? Vincent also reported widespread health effects following chemtrail spraying – including sudden nosebleeds suffered by his mother, sister and father in Florence after “many trails” there a year-and-a half ago 18 months ago. A village located in a valley north of Venice has undergone a similar experience. In Fletre, Val Belluna, “People started complaining,” Vincent said, after many took ill following heavy chemtrails there. MORE FROM THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT From Stephen MacGlinchey’s website comes this 2004 report from Italy: I’m a new member from Italy and I’m interesting to know more about contrails and, of course, chemtrails. I saw during last summer many trails in the sky over my head in the middle of Italy (between Venice and Bologne). One day in particu lar I saw in a beautiful sunny day a strange trail from south to north near the sun and a rainbow on the other side(?). At school I’ve learn a rainbow in the sky is formed after the rain and not in a beautiful sunny day... some people told me that result is because of barium and aluminium and maybe other hard metals... I think the problem of chemtrails could be real. The same think is for 2 Italian Parliamentarians [Italo] Sandi & [Piero] Ruzzante. They’ve made 2 interpellations to the Italian Parliament (the same thing of Westminster in England) in 2003 about chemtrails. Until now they have no answers! I read about some interviews to meteorologists here in Italy and about one in Germany but they told chemtrails problem not exists! In Italy is out from October 2004 a DVD titled “Scie Chimiche”(“Chemical Trails”) - macrolibrarsi.it. It’s very interesting and dramatic! But if I visit the NASA web site about contrails everything seems to be normal. Stay tuned, CNJ P.S. Excuse me for my bad English... I hope you understand my words !

The southerbound made the full turn around, forming the sideways U-shape while the other intersected the rounded part and continued on with the other plane. Then both trails stopped at the same time.

Very bad viruses, colds, pneumonia.” “Certainly,” Michael wrote, “a lot of people died. It seemed that this ‘epidemic’ had started around 1993. Since 1998, there seems to have been a huge increase in asthma. Strange considering all the sea air we get here, with virtually no industry.” The Isle of Man is right beneath main airliner routes. Often, you can pick out three or four jetliners in the sky at once, laying down, usually, very long trails. The long trails, in classic Chemtrail fashion, tend to merge and create the wispy and messy “cloud cover”. The Isle of Man is way behind the times. A very sleepy place. Maybe it’s time it woke up. We have a population of about 80,000 – with about a 40% connection to the Internet rate. So a lot of people have Internet access. If Island people see something happening, with a little delay, they might get going. If we get the Isle of Man more interested, we may be able to get news items to the main TV channels ‘across the water’. I’d prefer if you didn’t mention too much too soon on possible alarming connections to Chemtrails – for a while – or we might scare the locals off to hide in their Tholtans.

On April 27, 2000 John Hendricks dashed off a quick Email from El Cafe de Internet: We are on vacation in Spain, and were we surprised to see that the chemtrails are as bad here as they are anywhere, both in Mallorca and in Barcelona. We took plenty of pictures. Then we noticed a postcard we bought which has the location printed below a beautiful picture in which a chemtrail is visible! ADD SWEDEN TO THE LIST Chemtrails are being reported over at least 18 nations – including Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Croatia, France, Germany, Holland, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Russia, Scotland, South Africa, Sweden, Turkey, the United States – and recently, South Korea. From Sweden come these reports: I saw chemtrails over here 5 days ago (and yes, I’ve had my first flu in 4-5 years the past 4 days) but couldn’t believe my eyes at the time. The sky was clear (no clouds, very hot day) apart from 8-10 parallel chemtrails. As I was watching I saw a plane making the first trail orthogonally to the already existing ones. I know the commercial routes, and we have a bunch of them, but not where these trails were. Also, because of the weather conditions any plane passing outside of the normal routes shouldn’t have made any trails. So, whatever the conspiracy is, it’s bigger than just the US. Add Sweden to the list. Two months later, on July 29, 1999, Ulla-Britt wrote from Henån, Sweden: I live on the west coast of Sweden. There is planes spraying the sky with long white contrails. The contrails goes up vertically and after a couple of hours they are very thick and stays in the sky. I have been watching this since November 1998. But then when it was cold the contrails did not stay in the sky. I have also watched this airplane hovering for about 5 minutes. They stand vertically on the contrail. And today when it’s clear and sunny the sky looks like milky. They fly over this area all day almost every day. CROATIAN CHEMTRAILS On June 5, 2000 Jeff Rense posted the following letter from Izakovic Rolando on his website sightings.com. On Ma y 26, 2000, Croatia entered NATO’s ‘Partnership for Peace.’ Immediately, the next day, Saturday morning 5-27-00, heavy aerial spraying of Croatian main port town Rijeka commenced. Being the first time-ever, foreign aeroplane pilots had the worst luck in guessing the direction of local, constantly changing winds, which they partially- compensated for, in a typically Western way, by working hard all day long. "},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Pressed by the forces unknown to us, they had to come again second time next Tuesday afternoon, 5-30-00. They start spraying just one hour after the skies have cleared from the daylong rain. Third spraying, starting Thursday morning, 6-1-00, was shambles. It had all gone wrong right from the start, when the ‘ X’ marking the centre of the chemtrail-laying effort, suddenly found itself downwind. Even the transfer of spraying to the opposite side of the town, at the time upwind, did not help because the wind had swiftly changed direction again. So, during the next Saturday night, 6-3-00, they had to increase their efforts dramatically, and the town of Rijeka woke up with a low, thick chemtrail cover. Operations continued all day long, resulting with incredible chemtrail fog cowering everything from the sea level up to the heavens, if there were any. It was really spectacu lar because, in these parts, anything remotely resembling fog occurs only during the winter, once in a ten-fifteen year period, or so. Locals are totally unaware of the origin, state and ramifications of this whole affair and are content to be a joint member of the Brave New World. WISH YOU WERE HERE IN ST.

"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":" On August 2, 2000, environmental consultant Gary Opit wrote an open letter to the Senior Environmental Health Officer and the Byron Shire C ouncil in Byron Bay, Australia. Opit advised that local residents were concerned after watching “unusual sky patterns” over their community. The chemtrails being laid down in “criss-cross” or “s ingle matchstick” patterns made clear skies overcast. They also appeared to be making many people sick. “A gr eat many members of our community feel that this Chemtrails spraying could pose the most serious public health disaster in the history of Australia. We have already received reports from people suffe ring from symptoms commonly associated with the Chemtrail spraying,” Opit wrote. At least one health professional has informed us that he has had an increase in patients complaining of these symptoms. Dr. Mark Abriel of Byron Bay has observed and photographed many of these Chemtrails (as have I) on several o ccasions, and he is also very familiar with the medical symptoms. He is currently researching na tural herbal cures for Chemtrail toxicity and we would advise that you to consult him too. The spraying appears to be a planned operation occurring in many different parts of Australia. Ms. Julie King and her children, as well as many others in her home town of Pingally, [Western Australia] became very sick with symptoms leading to pneumonia shortly after spraying took place 3 days before the Easter holidays finished. The local school’s entire complement of students were unable to attend for some period of time because of the epidemic of respiratory complaints and the hospital was filled to capacity by patients all suffering from pneumonia. Symptoms include continuous mucus discharges in the nose and throat, with patients repeatedly coughing up green material with blood, followed by short-term memory loss, lethargy and fatigue continuing for several months and pneumonia in those patients with a less than extremely healthy immune system. Of interest is that there is generally no increase in normal body temperature during the infection. Local Doctors in W.A. [Western Australia] have found that only extremely heavy doses of certain antibiotics provide relief, though fatigue will remain a symptom for extended periods of time. We have the urgent responsibility to alert the community to the extreme dangers these illegal high altitude spraying operations may have on the health of the population. Over the last few weeks we have received reports of practically daily Chemtrail spraying over Byron Shire. In the last few days, the usual “lines in the sky” are not always visible. Instead, the spraying seems to be done over the hills to the west in the early morning or night, and it is slowly drifting to Mullumbimby and Byron Bay during the day. This is turning our normally blue sky in the morning to an unnatural “flat carpet” of clouds and haze, which does not raise any suspicions to the untrained eye, and we never have rain. Also , council employees have alerted us that while we have only one flight path, south-north, from Sydney to Brisbane, which we are all familiar with, many Chemtrails are east-west! A few months before, on July 6, 2000, chemtrails were sprayed over Brunswick Heads near Byron Bay during a music festival. According to an Aussie eye-witness, the mayor of Byron Bay and two members of parliament were giving speeches on the beach “when a very large airplane flew overhead at low altitude spraying Chemtrails, with precise paralle l lines that started and stopped abruptly next to each other and at about the same length.” Trees blocked the view of the festival goers – and “in a few minutes, with the wind, they covered all Brunswick Heads in a form of clouds and haze that did not raise any suspicions... A business-woman friend whom I discussed it with today, who was aware of both the chemtrail spraying on July 6 and today [July 19], suggested that this may be the reason she has a ‘flu’ that she ‘cannot shake’. She also suggested that this might be the reason why ‘half of the people in town’ have ‘flu’ or respiratory problems recently.”"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"QUEENSLAND COAST “CHEMTRAILED” On July 6, 2000 during a festival on Australia’s Queensland Coast, low-flying planes were seen spraying chemtrails on the beaches at Brunswick Heads, a port city about 200 kilometers south of Brisbane. Nearly two weeks later, on July 19, “starting at 7:00 AM several large aircraft flying at low altitude crisscrossed the sky in all directions spraying chemtrails. Within a few minutes, the famous clear blue Australian sky turned cloudy and hazy,” Diane Harrison reported. “For the first time in history here, it was almost impossible to see the beautiful mountains to the west.”  Byron Bay was the target of this renewed spraying, Harrison wrote. To our astonishment, the clouds did not disperse, and they were very long, all the way down Australia’s Gold Coast. People stopped on the side of the road and got out of their cars to watch the incredible spectacle. I know of a few people who took photographs. The event resembled a war, as airplanes ‘attacked’ Byron Bay from all directions. The ‘contrails’ were ‘turned’ on just before Byron Bay and ‘turned off’ after the planes passed over us.” The sky “resembled a load of match sticks that was dumped on the floor. These ‘contrails’ did not behave as ordinary contrails. While one side of these contrails remained straight, the other side dispersed, resembling a comb or a feather. “DANGEROUS EXPERIMENTS IN GREEK SKIES” On December 22, 2002 an American named Wayne wrote from the Greek Island of Aigina: There has been aerosol spraying in recent days over Athens, Greece. For a couple of months I guess. But I was up on Mount Pendeli yesterday with a couple of boys who wanted to play in the first snows of winter and I saw four planes system atically going back and forth. One of them was white and unmarked and later descended to a lower altitude, without spraying. I don’t want to get involved with this subject myself. I am a member of ATTAC-Hellas and we are concerned with economic problems and more lately with the European constitution. This chemtrails issue is for ecologists and medical doctors, but I haven’t seen any ecologists here taking an interest in it. Here in Greece where I am we’re having the wettest weather anyone can remember. The drainage system in Athens is not very efficient and we have had bad floods five, six or more times in the last six months, including twice last summer when it usually doesn’t rain much. The consistent bad weather for the last weeks has meant that the aerosol sprayers have been largely invisible until the last days. But now the weather has cleared up, and this morning the sky is a total mess. I was very much looking forward to the opportunity of getting out of the stifling atmosphere of Athens for the Christmas break and at first felt relaxed and liberated on the island of Aigina, amid the fresh air. But then lo and behold the next morning at about ten o’clock the clear morning sky was decorated by the first approaching jet trail. I thought it might have been jets that operate over Athens, on their way to work, but no. Back and forth they went, up and down the Saronic Gulf, at least seven jets, for hours, leaving among other things two gigantic plumes right over the town of Aigina and thoroughly messing up the sky. How many places in Greece is this going on? Everywhere I go: three locations in Athens, and now here, they are operating directly overhead. "},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":" Wayne noticed similar ‘trails, over central Athens, the northern and southern suburbs, Mount Pendeli and the Saronic Gulf. “The trails these planes leave behind often remain visible for a long time. They gradually disperse and become clouds, which again do not look like the natural cumulus clouds we see at lower altitudes in the sky. Often on clear days a few hours of these planes flying backwards and forwards is enough to spoil t he whole appearance of the sky.” On Christmas Eve a huge chemcloud was laid over the town of Aigina. “It was unlike anything I have ever seen before in my life,” Wayne commented, “ and it got me wondering what we would be breathing when the contents of that cloud got down to ground level. Chemtrailing the Greeks turned out to be a major mistake. On Sunday February 16, 2003 the mass circulation Greek newspaper Ethnos headlined its lead story: “Scientists Uneasy: Dangerous experiments in the Greek skies”. The story’s subheading must have turned a few heads: “American aircraft are spraying the atmosphere with chemicals with a view to creating an artificial cloud as an “antidote” to the Greenhouse Effect.” The story by Giannis Kritikos described a vote by the Aigina Island town council to ask their government to explain what is happening in the skies over Greece. A picture taken from the 2004 edition of Chemtrails Confirmed was used to illustrate similar phenomenon observed over Aigina “without any warning” two months previously. The translated caption read: “The white trails left behind by this tanker plane which is used normally for aerial refueling, is not smoke but a cloud of chemicals which provide scientists with the ability to control the climate in an entire geographic region.” A photograph of Leonidas Kardaras, an environmental chemist with a master’s degree in environmental technology was paired with a shot of Katsaros from the Democritus research centre in Athens, with the inscription: “The two scientists point out to our correspondent the dangers to public health entailed in the specific experiments.” A third photo showed former parliamentarian Tasia Andreadaki asking, “Who gave permission for this spraying?” The story noted that Katsaros had been invited to speak about chemtrails on Greek national television a few mornings later. CHEMTRAILS COMMENTARY FROM GREENPEACE Just as th is reporter personally discovered that the threat of massive oil well fires in Kuwait to be too hot politically for Greenpeace’s main headquarters in Amsterdam to warn the world, this world-renowned environmental corporation refuses to recognize chemtrails. On March 15, 2004, Greenpeace Switzerland’s Climate and Transport expert Cyrill Studer wrote an internal memo to his colleagues, stating: I have heard of the chemtrails phenomenon... For the present, Greenpeace... will not be following up the theme of chemtrails. There is not a sufficiently solid scientific basis... Greenpeace is not an organization that can undertake the verification of a supposed phenomenon."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"On the one hand, our independence would not be guaranteed and, on the other, it would overstretch our capacities. In other words, important elements of our climate campaign would suffer, particularly the promotion of energy efficiency and of renewable energies, or our active influence in present-day politics. In the climate debate Greenpeace relies on the insights of the UNO climate research committee, the IPCC. This panel, which comprises around 2000 climate experts, is recognized and independent. The conclusions drawn by them are clear: Global warming represents the greatest danger to humanity. A widespread deployment of chemtrails could hardly remain hidden from the IPCC. Rudolf Rechsteiner – a German Social Democratic member of parliament – replied to the concerns of German citizens: “A number of ideas exist that show how it would be possible to reduce global warming by technical means, at least in the short term... However, these ideas... are no more than theoretical. We are not aware of any practical application of these methods, either at home or abroad.” Greenpeace Germany agreed. Speaking in Hamburg on June 11, 2004, spokeswoman Kristine Läger stated: The idea of reducing global warming by putting chemicals in the atmosphere has been around a long time. There are various proposals in this direction, suggesting the chemicals should be independently sprayed and that they should be mixed wi th the fuel of ordinary passenger aircraft. Whether in Germany such proposals have reached the point of actual realization is highly questionable. So far as we are aware there are no indications from research and observation of weather and climate that these so-called chemtrails exist. Nor are we aware of any project that has been realized in practice. She went on to say: "},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"If these chemicals are meant to have a real effect in terms of changing the climate, they would need to be distributed worldwide, over large areas, and with great frequency. Otherwise it would have no point at all. It would be a costly project, requiring the investment of vast resources, and carrying with it unforeseeable risks. And in all probability this is not happening. As Kristine Läger was refuting a phenomenon seen by many concerned Germans, the July/August 2004 edition of Greenpeace Magazine (published in Hamburg with a circulation of 120,000) devoted five pages to “utopian” technological counter-strategies to mitigate global warming and looming Climate Flip. The October 6, 2004 issue of the Raum + Zeit (Space & Time) contained 16 full color pages illustrating “chemtrails”. The accompanying article by Gabriel Stetter came in response to letters from many readers pleased with his first article on the subject in a previous issue. As Brian Holmes reveals, “Many of these letters are illustrated with color photographs supplied by the readers themselves.” As Stetter himself recounted at holmestead.ca and chemtrailcentral.com: We are told about mirrors in space, golf-balls in the sea, artificial volcanic eruptions; there is even mention of an aluminium micro-balloon project of chemtrail mentor Edward Teller. But concerning the environmental phenomenon which is causing the greatest concern in the German-speaking world at present, and has prompted the sending of countless hundreds of letters to Greenpeace, there is not a single word, no trace whatever. Supposing the word “chemtrails” appeared in print in the Greenpeace Magazine: How many tens of thousands of people more would look up into the sky and recognize that the supposedly Utopian “proposal” has long moved on via “spraying trials” to a systematic, long-term spreading of cloud cover over the whole of Europe? Could Greenpeace have received “from above” the instruction to carry out an exercise in damage-limitation? Not a comfortable thought, but one that is hard to resist in this case. Basel, the present author’s town of residence, is – perhaps unsurprisingly – a stronghold of believers in chemtrails; one in ten people, so opinion polls say, have already heard of them despite the media blackout. Several thousand people in the prosperous town at the bend in the Rhine know that the chemtrails phenomenon suggests that something is seriously wrong. Among the m are well-to-do people, who because of their environmental awareness have been for a long time, in some cases for decades, members of Greenpeace. Veteran anti-nuclear activists, campaigners for animal welfare or against electrosmog; in their alarm they had all turned to Greenpeace because of the chemtrails – which are visible everywhere in the skies above Basel. "},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"But a painful experience awaited all of them: They were palmed off with the same unsatisfactory answers that we have by now grown tired of he aring. : the consequence drawn by these elderly, well-to-do activists from Greenpeace’s lack of interest was the immediate cancellation of membership of many years, the withdrawal of legacies, and the withholding of payments to Greenpeace until further notice. Stetter went on to remark: Greenpeace is not only an environment organization, it is also a fund-raising machine. Remember, therefore, the power of your purse and do not hesitate to let Greenpeace know of it. Ask to be sent information on what Greenpeace is planning to do about chemtrails. Or strike a bargain with Greenpeace: Membership in exchange for a genuine clarification of the chemtrails question. But also point out what will happen to your membership or your donation, if Greenpeace remains inactive. Are you skeptical? Test it yourself: On such a day, get up at sunrise, and you will see that the sky, from horizon to horizon, is covered with a dense network of chemtrails. But hardly has the day begun, than the spraying is over and the planes have disappeared. When then, only a few hours later, people set off in pale halogene sunlight on their way to work – or to church, because Sundays are particularly suitable for the activity described – streaks of whitish chemtrail soup are already spread out over their heads.

RE: Chemtrails (Chemical trails) over Europe Dec20/02 Dear Mr. Gammeltoft, A person who wished to remain anonymous at the European Commission recommended that I contact you by email with my question. I was told that this is how a person living in the European Union poses questions to the E-government. My questions are about the pollution regulations and standards that are in effect in the European Union, particularly those regarding airplanes. It was a clear morning in Berlin with a nice blue sky until the “chemtrail” spraying planes got started (early) messing it up. By midday the sky was covered with artificial cloud cover, in some places thick and in some places thin, but covering 70 percent of the sky it was. These planes are probably emitting aerosol aluminum and/or barium stearate, both of which are toxic to humans and other life forms that still exist in Europe. In any case they are emitting something that disperses into a thin layer that eventually falls to earth - that much is clear. Certainly yo u must be aware of the activities and conditions of which I speak. My question is, what is the position of the European Union on the air pollution being rained down on Europeans from high-flying planes and what is the legal liability of these planes for the impact they cause on the health of the people living below? I know many people who suffer a number of health and psychological complaints due to these “chemtrails”. Thank you for your prompt response. Christopher Bollyn American Free Press (European Desk) GERMAN PARLIMENTARIAN ADMITS CHEMTRAILS PROGRAM Even while Greenpeace Germany was issuing chemtrails denials, a former GP board member and current German Parliamentarian expressed concern over their existence. At least “minimally”. A serving board member of Greenpeace Germany from 1984-1990, Monika Griefahn now chairs the Committee for Culture and Media of the Federal German Parliamen t. On July 8, 2004, this Parliamentarian replied to a letter from two chemtrail activists, stating: I am in basic agreement with your concerns. Instead of making a concerted and determined effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions throughout the world, experiments of various kinds are being carried out in the earth’s atmosphere in order to cure the symptoms...” I share your concern over the use of aluminium or barium compounds which have a considerable toxic potential. However, so far as I am aware the extent of their use is so far minimal. In any case it would be much more sensible (in the logic of such experiments) to place compounds of this kind not in the troposphere, but in the stratosphere, where their exit from the atmosphere would occur far less rapidly.”"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":" Chapter 17. NANO CHEMTRAILS & MORGELLONS If you do not enjoy “traditional” chemtrail chemicals raining down on you, you are not going to like the new version, which the United States Air Force promises will feature aerial dumps of programmable “smart” molecules tens of thousands of times smaller than the particles already crowding emergency rooms with patients suffering from sudden, otherwise inexplicable respiratory, heart and gastrointestinal complaints. Under development since 1995, the military’s goal is to install microprocessors incorporating gigaflops computer capability into “smart particles” the size of a single molecule. Invisible except under the magnification of powerful microscopes, these nano-size radio-controlled chips are now being made out of mono-atomic gold particles. Networked together on the ground or assembling in the air, thousands of sensors will link into a single supercomputer no larger than a grain of sand. Brought to you by the same military-corporate-banking complex that runs America’s permanent wars, Raytheon Corp is already profiting from new weather warfare technologies. The world's fourth largest military weapons maker acquired E-Systems in 1995, just one year after that military contractor bought APTI, holder of Bernard Eastlund’s HAARP patents. Raytheon also owns General Dynamics, the world’s leading manufacturer of military UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are commonly called drones).

According to researcher Brendan Bombaci of Durango, Colorado, these Raytheon computers are directly linked with their UAV weather modification drones. Bombaci reports that NOAA paid Raytheon more than $300 million for this “currently active, 10-year project.” She goes on to describe the Joint Environmental Toolkit used by the U.S. Air Force in its Weather Weapons System. Just the thing for planet tinkerers. GREEN LIGHT For public consumption, nano-weather control jargon has been sanitized. “Microelectric Mechanical Sensors” (MMS) and “Global Environmental Mechanical Sensors” sound passively benign. But these ultra-tiny autonomous aerial vehicles are neither M&Ms nor gems. [Space.com Oct 31/05] According to a U.S. military flier called Military Progress , “The green light has been given” to disperse swarms of wirelessly-networked nano-bots into the troposphere by remotely-controlled UAV drones for \"global warming mitigation.\" U.S. Army Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, as we ll as U.S. Air Force drones “are slated to deploy various payloads for weather warfare,” Military Progress asserts. This dual mission – to slow global warming and use weather as a weapon – seems somewhat contradictory. FIGHTING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE U.S. Military Inc. is already in the climate change business big time. The single biggest burner of petroleum on this planet, its high-flying aircraft routinely rend Earth’s protective radiation shielding with nitrous oxide emissions, while depositing megatons of additional carbon, sulfur and water particles directly into the stratosphere – where they will do three-times more damage than CO2 alone. Go figure. A single F-15 burns around 1,580 gallons an hour. An Apache gunship gets about one-half mile to the gallon. The 1,838 Abrams tanks in Iraq achieve five gallons to the mile, while firing dusty radioactive shells that will continue destroying human DNA until our sun goes supernova. A single non-nuclear carrier steaming in support burns 5,600 gallons of bunker fuel in an hour – or two million gallons of bunker oil every 14 days. Every four days, each carrier at sea takes on another half- million gallons of fuel to supply its jets. The U.S. Air Force consumed nearly half of the Department of Defense’s entire fuel supply in 2006, burning 2.6 billion gallons of jet fuel aloft. While flying two to five-hour chemtrails missions to reflect incoming sunlight and slow global warming, a single KC-10 tanker will burn 2,050 gallons of highly toxic jet fuel every hour. The larger and older KC- 135 Stratotanker carries 31,275 gallons of chemtrails and burns 2,650 gallons of fuel per hour. The EPA says that each gallon of gasoline produces 19.4 pounds of CO2. Each gallon of diesel produces 22.2 pounds of CO2... Total it up and routine operations by a military bigger than all other world militaries combined puts more than 48 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year. Nearly half that total could be eliminated by ending the wars against Iraq and Afghanistan.

Though a small, buzzing drone can’t carry much payload, more sub-microscopic weather modification particles can be crammed into a UAV Predator than all the chemtrail slurry packed into a tanker the size of a DC-10. Owning The Weather 2025 was publi shed in 1995 and discussed only non-classified military weather modification projects. Hall’s Overview of Nanotechnology also appeared in 1995, when nanotech was in its Frankenstein infancy. Since then, many sources document, nanotech has gone exponential. [nanotech- now.com] According to Owning The Weather, clouds of these extremely teeny machines will be dropped into hurricanes and other weather systems to blend with storms and report real time weather data to each other and a larger sensor network. Then these smart particles will be used to increase or decrease the storm’s size and intensity – and \"steer\" it to “specific targets”. The air force report boasted that nano-chemtrails “will be able to adjust their size to optimal dimensions for a given seeding situation and make adjustments throughout the process.” Instead of being sprayed into the air at the mercy of the winds aloft, as is t he fate of normal chemtrails, nano versions will be able to “enhance their dispersal” by “adjusting their atmospheric buoyancy” and “communicating with each other” as they steer themselves in a single coor dinated flock within their own artificial cloud. Nano-chemtrails will even “change their temperature and polarity to improve their seeding effects,” the air force noted. [Daily Texan July 30/07] Rutgers University scientist J. Storrs Hall held out the military’s hope that these new nano weather- warrior bots: “Interconnected, atmospherically buoyant, and having navigation capability in three dimensions – clouds of microscopic computer particles communicating with each other and with a control system, could provide tremendous capability.” Sounds expensive. “It is potentially relatively inexpensive to do,” Hall clarified. “About the same price per pound as potatoes.” Why so cheap? Because nano particles can be potentially self-replicating. That is, they can be made to reproduce themselves until programmed to stop. Hopefully. Maybe. Sometimes . Owning The Weather goes on to say that the USAF will “manage and employ a weather-modification capability by the Weather Force Support Element.” "},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":" These weather forces will use real-time updates from swarms of the nano-size “smart sensors” to model developing weather patterns with a super-duper computer. Based on continually updated forecast, the weather warriors will fly follow-on missions as needed to tweak the storm. It’s perfect, crows the air force. “The total weather-modification process becomes “a real-time loop of continuous, appropriate, measured interventions, and feedback capable of producing desired weather behavior.” Really? Weather modification did not work too well with Katrina. If the notion of inserting Autonomous Intelligence nanobot s into weather systems to monitor, steer and mess with them seems risky, just wait. Around the next cloud corner are coming swarms of airborne nano-bots to optimize wind dispersal patterns for germ warfare. Or chemtrails. But there’s one small hitch. Nobody knows how Earth’ s atmosphere works. It is so big, so complex and so unpredictable, even real-time nano-snapshots are ancient history as soon as they are taken. This is why the air force said, “Advances in the science of chaos are critical to this endeavor.” Good luck. After a decade of trying, not even a 48-hour weather forecast can be made without constant surprises. Because they cannot be graphed in a cause-and-effect straight line, chaotic “non-linear” weather processes can morph unexpectedly, defying predicted w eather modification inputs. Just ask Beijing. Then there’s the matter of “accidental” genocide. NANO PARTICLES IN YOUR BRAIN As we have already seen, very small particulates such as the highly reflective aluminum oxide commonly found in chemtrails can make people very ill. If micro-size chemtrail fallout one-tenth the width of a human hair can cause death among the most susceptible hearts and lungs, what will be the effects of fallout from nano-size chemtrails 80,000-times smaller than the width of a human hair? As soon as they are inhaled, nanoparticles make a beeline for the brain. Not surprisingly, they tend to clump in the area that deals with smell. Too big to pass back through the blood-brain barrier, they become trapped there. [Nature.com Jan 5/04] Dr. Celine Filippi has also observed that nanoparticles inhaled into the lungs are so mall they easily cross the lung barrier and enter the blood. “Particles in the blood can reach the liver, amongst other organs,” he warns. [globalresearch.ca Oct 21/07] HANK CALLS The term “nano-chemtrails” on my homepage prompted my trusted military informant I’ve dubbed “Hank” to call. “They have them,” he confirmed. According to his sources, the U.S. Air Force has occasionally added nanoparticles to the chemtrail mix to demonstrate proof of concept. “We’re way beyond science fiction,” Hank confirmed. “You can hide just about anything you want in a chemtrail – including nanotubes. Chemtrails are being altered for whatever spectrum of wavelength they’re trying to bounce off of them.” How much nanocrap has been sprayed so far?"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"“Tens of tons,” he replied. Tens of tons of molecules ? “Much of it is still up there,” Hank went on to explain. This is because nanoparticles are so light and small they tend bind to bind with oxygen molecule s. And piggybacking on oxygen particles makes them buoyant. “It travels worldwide,” Hank continued. “Some of it comes down. Whatever it’s exposed to up there it brings down here. We get exposed to it. We breathe it in, we ingest it. It accrues in the same spot every time. And attracts more of it... “ In the liver. And the brain. A JAR FULL OF TROUBLE On No vember 17th, 2005, Jeff Chandler collected a sample of chemtrails fibers in Northern Highlands, California. While playing outside with his son in the early afternoon, Chandler had noticed very low fibrous clouds lingering in the wakes of chemtrails spray aircraft. Soon afterwards, white fibrous material began to land on the ground, trees, and cars. Chandler's son collected some of the fallen the aerosol material with a stick and sealed it in a jar. Within minutes, the remaining fibrous aerosol material which had landed on trees and cars began to decompose. “Outside, it had all melted, evaporated, or just dissipated,” Jeff Chandler reported. The EPA refused to acknowledge receipt of the sample. “It was most disappointing to learn that there was no chance of having a chemical analysis done on the material. Imagine my surprise to find out that the Federal Environmental Protection Agency has no interest in dealing with samples like my son had collected,” Chandler wrote to chemtrails investigator Clifford Carnicom. “This is the US government agency chartered to protect citizens from hazardous chemicals in the air, water, and land! One has to wonder why this tax-supported ‘agency representing the interests of the people’ refuses to investigate allegations, from tax-paying citizens, that someone is spraying the skies with chemicals detrimental to the environment we all live in. Adding insult to injury, they flatly refuse to even examine physical samples of the alleged chemicals! Who do these people think they work for? ” After further consultation with Carnicom, Jeff Chandler decided to examine the sample himself using an Intel QX3 digital microscope to which he had access. Five days after the aerosol fibers fell from the sky, he opened the jar. “I was not prepared for what happened when I popped the cap off the jar,” he emailed Carnicom. “It seems that when we sealed the jar with the packing tape, it did build up a concentration of whatever this material becomes when it breaks down. I was hit in the face with some sort of extremely noxious gas! My eyes burned fiercely, and I began coughing desperately. There was a very strong metallic taste on my tongue as well. It took several minutes to recover from this terrible bout. I worry what the long-term effects might be, but in the short term I did not get sick or feel any incapacitation.” "},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Chandler continued his micrographic analysis of the aerosol fibers: The 'chemtrail' aerosol is composed of a boundi ng filament form, which itself contains an extensive sub-micron filament structure.

These aerosol fibers are simply something mainstream science has not seen before.

When the itching becomes intolerable, there is no way to resist clawing at my own flesh. This daily affliction began almost two years ago. While pulling grasses and weeds with my bare hands from my small island garden in British Columbia, I felt a burning sensation in my left hand, almost like coming into contact with nettles.

I would have missed it if I had n't really been looking and studying the sky as the plane passed. There is nothing around here but houses.

I mean that's what \"hangs in the air\" But it's all houses here like I said, there's no open parks or even big yards to go running to get a kite up, but who knows what kids can do. I had the windows open all day since it was warm and there wasn't more than a tiny, occasional stir of breeze let alone enough wind outside to get a kite up in the air. The object was a flat, dull black but I could sort of see a kind of dot - pattern on the bottom - more like indentations or shadows and light, making shadows in a barely seeable \"row pattern\". It was such a flat, dull color it looked almost like a cardboard cutout. I thought maybe it was a US Flag Kite? Maybe the pattern was stripes on the bottom and I'm just not seeing colors because of the sun's angle... you know how your brain just tries to make sense out of something? I just stood at the window looking at this, took a few snaps of the airplane, and continued to study \"it\" and the rest of the sky and the chemtrails that went off to the North (right). It was a nice day so birds were flying all over and neighbors were in yards doing work. Every so often I'd look back to the section of sky that held the \"kite\", expecting it to be gone.

It wasn't bobbing or dipping like a kite or balloon (or even a hawk...I was really grasping for an explanation!) and it was too high to be something attached to a TV antennae or anything. Then I realized it didn't have a tail like a kite would (duh!). To my eye, it was a perfect, straight edged, tria ngle, slightly \"long\", sitting on corner tip. The \"peak\" would have been pointing North. I stood there until the planes disappeared and I actually got bored - probably 45 minutes! I did know by then it was not a kite. It never moved at all the entire time I watched it. The sun changed direction in this time and those \"dimples\" on the object became a tiny bit more visible to me but again, it remained a flat, dull, one-dimensional-looking black. I finally went to go do things I had to do around the house. I checked back in another 15 minutes - and it was still there! I checked back 10 minutes after this, and it was gone. It doesn't show up as a crisp triangle in the photos for some reason so I drew a picture of what it looked like to my eye.

He used to work for the CIA (confirmed by other family members, he wasn't kidding about this part). Claimed he was sent to the area well inland of where Hurricane Hugo was expected to make landfall. Was told to watch the sky for anything \"unusual\". He then says he suspects weather control/modification had something to do with this. I ridiculed him endlessly for a time, then forgot about it. 1998-1999 - At this time, I was spending a lot of time on the interstate. One day late in '98 I noticed a jet in the sky leaving a thick billowing trail behind it, which aroused my curiosity. Over the next year, watching planes became even more perplexing. There were odd patterns being formed. Pointed this out to several others, who concurred that something strange was going on. The substance left behind these planes would often have a rainbow effect when directly between my viewpoint and the sun. Like the back of a CD. There were quite a few striking examples during that time that proved to me that this was not normal passenger air traffic. The most notable; two planes in level flight approaching each other at about a 45 degree angle. Both went into a steep climb well before they met, and crossed paths leaving a giant \"upright\" X in the sky. At the top of each leg of the X, there was a ball of this smoke, or whatever these trails were made of. At this point I became convinced that the government was preparing to conduct biological warfare on us, presumably to maintain control of the population when the impending Y2K disaster hit. Began warning friends and family, tryi ng to convince them of the certain doom that awaited us. Y2K came and went. -redface 2000-2003 -- Continued to watch the planes. Didn't notice near as many obvious patterns. Spring of 2002 did have one memorable event. I was headed to the store with a friend. Remarked about the clouds, how they looked beautiful. They were all similar in size, low, rather small, and somewhat evenly spaced. Far as the eye could see. While watching I noticed 3-4 small balls of light moving rapidly around one of the clouds. They were following what I can only describe as a bumblebee flight path, maintaining a constant (and rapid) rate of speed. They did not strike me as a type of aircraft, more like some kind of... (shrug), energy? Friend verified it was not a hallucination on my part. A firm :tin , he still will not engage in a discussion about what it might have been to this day. 2004 - This year has been particularly odd. Feb - Noticed some extreme patterns again. Observed two planes flying along side by side, close to each other, about the same altitude. One was leaving a trail, one was not. "},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Mar - Observed a massive circular pattern, took up nearly half the sky. I would need to sketch it to really offer an accurate description. The fact t hat it was so symmetrical and large, completely rule out normal air traffic in my mind. This was done with intent. Apr-May - Took note of a weather system that produced a large bow of clouds, stretching from into Canada down to Cuba. Anybody else notice that? After it passed, the sky was clear blue with not a cloud in sight for 4-5 days. A week later, another front of clouds moved through. Giant bow again, from Canada down to Cuba. It was nearly identical to the one the previous week. Followed by 4-5 days of clear blue skies, not a cloud or funky airplane emission in sight. In my area (east coast) there was something else strange about these two systems. They were forecasting rain. We got it, but in an unusual manner (a very brief, absolutely torrential downpour). The rest of the time, not a drop. Now things get very odd. I was heading east on the interstate. There were clouds very high in the atmosphere (resembling cirrus clouds, but different somehow), and at the same time a wall of low puffy clouds ahead of me (due east). They were so low it almost resembled a fog bank. They came rushing past me (moving very fast), headed west. Soon as I got home, I checked the local Doppler and satellite visual. Nothing headed west. Checked it later. Nothing. :confused Then... A coworker of mine related a story to me about something she overheard in a bar/restaurant three weeks ago. At another table, a group of people were talking about planes, chemtrails and weather control. One of the people had videotaped some of the activity in our area, and sent a copy to our congressmen, demanding to know what was going on (like it will do any bloody good). And as if that wasn't enough... Last week another co-worker of mine, who is also a close friend, went out to her car. She had left her radio on FM oldies station. When she went to start her car, the radio was on an AM talk show, I'm guessing Coast To Coast or Rense. Guess what they were talking about. To date, her and her boyfriend have tried to tell me this chemtrail/weather control mess I have been speculating about is my imagination (much to my frustration). Now they know I am not a lone nut.

For the Last three years at least I have been taking notice of the chemtrails in Gippsland/latrobe Valley area in Victoria, Australia. It is almost daily and I believe at Night also due to the fact sometimes there air smells somewhat that is foreign to the usual smells. I have lived in this region for 7 years. I will if you like when I can take some snaps. As opposed to some areas they are singular trails although multiple through out the day. The crafts dropping these trails range from small to large planes as well as invisible and bright glowing light craft... I am appalled at people apathy and/or lack of interest and lack of belief. These trails certainly must be affecting something in the mindset of the sheeples so to speak, of which is entirely frustrating. Hope this helps.

My wife saw it first, said, \"What’s that a chopper\", I looked it was between two spread out trails when we first saw it coming toward us. As it entered the trail, it seemed to dance around.

Nola30: My first contrail experience happened in November 99. I was driving my kids to church when we noticed a bright light falling from the sky. At first we thought it was a small meteor. It had a contrail coming from it, the strange thing is that nothing ever fell to the ground. I went on to church, all the while watching the sky. I dropped the kids off and returned home. I looked out my kitchen window and saw the contrail still lingering in the same place. Other clouds were moving in the sky, but this thing did not move. I called my husband in and told him what we had seen and showed him the contrail. We kept watching and saw a round nickel colored object start flying in and around this contrail.

This chapter is intended as information only – not as diagnosis or treatment. If you are ill, please seek the advice of a naturopath or MD. The good news is that chemtrails – as well as most mystery pathogens currently responsible for chronic allergies, low energy, headaches and year-round “flu” – do not prey on people with fully functioning immune systems. When healthy people do succumb, thei r illness is usually short-lived and much less severe than among those with weakened immunity. Stress is the single biggest cause of dis-ease. Because we become what we think, and attract what we fear, the first step in protecting ourselves, our families and loved ones from disease-causing microorganisms is to support and love the heck out of one another. It is also essential to cultivate a positive mental attitude that recognizes real threats without succumbing to fear. The best way to do this is not being attached to the outcome. And by giving thanks for each human- and heaven-sent gift. Instead of putting ourselves down, it’s wiser not to do the would-be controller’s work by celebrating each victory – from paying the rent or saving a last stream or stand of life-giving trees, to airing chemtrail clips on local TV. Engaging in enjoyable outdoor exercise, love, touch and a good diet are as vital for staying centered and connected as taking daily time out for contemplation and prayer. Knowing that fungal infections are the most common culprit lurking behind a complex array of symptoms gives us a further edge in rebalancing bodily chemistry. [For more on alternative healing, please see my book Alt. Health .] "},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"SAY SO LONG TO FUNGAL INFECTIONS After identifying fungal in fections as a primary cause of illness and general malaise, the Idaho Observer observed how naturopaths “found great success in treating the illnesses with anti-fungal herbs such as black walnut in conjunction with blood purifiers such as yarrow and garlic. Dr. Joseph Puleo has successfully treated many extremely ill patients complaining of chemtrail-related symptoms. He recommends that all of us “Detox, deacidify, boost immunity and eliminate dairy products and sugars that form mucus and grow fungus while reducing blood pH.” We can avoid molds in our daily environment by making sure our living and workspaces are clean and dry. Start taking Cayenne capsules daily. Combinations of hot sauce at mealtime also work well to improve circulation and overall health. It is vital that we eat alkaline foods as much as possible, avoiding acidic “fun foods” – as well as caffeine and alcohol. See Dr. Matsen’s marvelous book Eating Alive for more insight – and helpful lists of acidic and alkaline food groups. Dr. Matsen’s program of careful food combining saved my ravaged immune system after I returned from the minefields, oil rain and blazing deserts of Kuwait. So did the highest quality supplementation I could find. With chemically contaminated soils depleted of essential minerals, and factory foods devoid of natural nutrition, quality vitamin, herbal and mineral supplementation is also essential to rejuvenate and shield cells. HOROWITZ ON HEALING In an interview with The Konformist , Dr. Len Horowitz outlined “five critical steps” in counteracting the new pandemics: The first step is detoxification, because we’ve all virtually eaten of Babylon’s harvest, we’ve all eaten the garbage that comes from Monsanto and Dow Chemical and Archer Daniel and all their genetically engineered foods and the chemicals and the fluorides and the chlorines. Step two is deacidification, to change your body’s chemistry, making it more alkaline. It’s only in the acid state that your body gets into that causes the growth of bacteria, viruses, fungus, molds, and cancer cells. They cannot grow in an environment, a terrain that is more alkaline. And what causes your body chemistry to go acidic and become a breeding ground for the bacterial and infectious agents? The main lifestyle risks are caffeine, nicotine, sugar, refined carbohydrates, alcohol, and pharmaceuticals – virtually all of them, including antibiotics. And then, red meats. That, plus stress, are the seven factors that cause your body chemistry to become more acidic. So you want to eliminate those or reduce them as much as possible. And then that, along with some nutrients, water – like you saw when I sat down, I took this lemon and squeezed this lemon into this water. The reason I did that is because by doing that, because the lemon has a lot of calcium in it, it turns to calcium hydroxide in drinking water. That’s alkalizing. It raises the pH of that water from about 7 to about 8. So now I’m drinking pH 8 water instead of pH 7 water. That’s step two, deacidification. So step three, then, is boosting your immune system in every way possible. In other words, step one is detoxification, step two is deacidification, and now you can go out and spend your money effectively with your vitamins and your minerals and your supplements. "},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":" You can get the value out of co-enzymes, you know. You can get the value out of the olive leaf extract. Out of the variety of other vital nutrients and botanicals. There’s a revolution in that health science. People think that all they have to do is take those supplements. But if they’re throwing those supplements into an intoxicated terrain and an acidified terrain, it’s a waste of your dollar. It’s so much less expensive to go through an easy detoxification program using fresh squeezed lemonade that you make with maple syr up and fresh squeezed lemons and cayenne pepper. Then, if you’re sick and ailing, you go on to steps four and five. Steps four and five have both been heavily suppressed by the same Rockefeller-directed international banksters, blood banksters and medical monopolists. They are oxy genation therapies and bioelectric therapies. There’s a product called Body Oxygen, which is one of the products that I have developed. It’s an excellent product. Most people who are involved in oxygen treatment use 35 percent of food grade hydrogen peroxide: between 4 and 24 drops in an 8-ounce glass of water. That oxygenates the water. But the problem is, it’s really caustic to touch. It burns your skin. And it tastes horrible. If you drink it, it’s horrible. We put it into a cold press, organic aloe vera and then we added additional immune boosters, so you’re getting your oxygen, you’re ge tting your aloe, which is great for your gut, and you’re getting hawthorn berry, Ginkgo and St. Johns Wart – excellent for immunity. OXYGEN It is virtually impossible for disease-causing orga nisms to survive and proliferate in fully oxygenated blood. The 2nd International Symposium on Ozone Applications, held in Havana in March, 1997 heard how ozone inactivates Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and E- Coli. Ozone is a potent germicidal agent. Though Pseudomonas Aeruginosa is the most resistant pseudomonas strain, ingestion of extremely diluted food-grade hydrogen peroxide or other liquid oxygen preparations can completely knock out pseudomonas bacte ria. It can also knock you out! See your local health food store for instructions on proper dilution. Manuel wrote from Tampa: Now the 4th week, I have been suffering from upper respiratory problems. I have been experiencing flu like symptoms, specifically a so re throat. The symptoms seem to go away when I take mega-doses of vitamins and supplements – Echinacea, Ester C, Vitamin C, Golden Seal Root, and Magnesium.

These were my worst symptoms, not the respiratory stuff.” Then she “came across a wonderful detox for taking toxins and metals out of the system. It is called Herbal D-Tox from Wild Rose. It is a liver cleanse, intestinal cleanse, blood, muscle and lymphatic cleanse. It was recommended to me by a doctor. I have my whole family doing this cleanse and I believe it is good for anyone who feels they have been affected by the chemtrails.” This healer would also “recommend Nettle, Marshmallow and Fenugreek. They are for joint pains, low energy, convalescence, balances sugar/insulin, dry ness and inflammation. Then, of course, we know that this stuff has bacteria, etc. – so are you doing Colloidal Silver?” COLLOIDAL SILVER The best colloidal silver is freshly made at home. This correspondent believes that the best available machine is the CS Pro HVAC: I made a batch that day and started taking it, 1 oz. about every 4 hours. It cleared up the stomach in the first 4 hours, I gargled about a half oz. every 3 hours to clear up the hacking cough, that took all day, the nose I sprayed some in three times, it cleared up. The headache and weakness took another two days to clear up. The cat came home sneezing and make strange sounds the same day. I put 1 oz. in his water bowl and he drank the whole bowl, he had never done that before. He was well the next day. Another person sick with CRI advises a Colloidal Silver dosage of: One tablespoon, 3 times a day for three days, and then one a day the last day and then stop. We did. My husband still has the cough but this stuff worked miracles on me. After the first day, my sinus was completely cleared up. Herb writes, “After weeks of antibiotics I was still sick, had to have emergency ventilation twice. Then I remembered colloidal silver. I used 4 oz of 500ppm over a 5-day period; I killed whatever this stuff was. I continued taking a maintenance dose. TEA TREE OIL AND COLLOIDAL SILVER Advising that her daughter has suffered Chemtrail-Related Illness for months now, a mother named Judy commends colloidal silver water made at home wi th a $30 kit. “She takes it internally and puts it on the sores.” Her daughter: uses tea tree oil on the skin and puts drops of it in her shampoo, plus uses the tea tree oil soap and toothpaste. She also uses it in a spray bottle along with some aloe vera, colloidal silver water and distilled water to mist the skin. She has put a little [food grade] hydrogen peroxide in the mixture, too. Should try and stay away from sugars because they [fungi] like it. She mixes borax and vinegar and puts it into her bath water. She also puts some vinegar into her shampoo and some tea tree oil.

This is normal reaction when toxin is getting out of body - any Oriental medicine doctors will tell you this is normal phenomena. But it worked really well and it still works well. Herb is taken as tea and the name of the tea is Jason Winters tea. It comes in either bulk or tea bag. If you ever buy one, I strongly recommend tea bag because it’s easier to brew and there is no difference in quality between bulk and tea bag. I also recommend raspberry flavor rather than plain because that taste is the best. Before you use it, make sure you read instruction at jasonwinters.com thoroughly. Otherwise it may not be effective and also waste tea somewhat as it can be brewed three times. If any of your friends or family suffers from chemtrail I recommend this along with other methods.

ORIGINAL OREGANO “Oil of Oregano rivals modern antibiotic drugs,” writes health journalist Bill Sardi. Oil pressed from oregano leaves that contain the ac tive ingredient carvacrol may be an effective treatment against sometimes drug-resistant ba cterial infection. Georgetown University researchers have found that oil of oregano appears to reduce infection “as effectively as traditional antibiotics.” Considering the many Staph outbreaks across the USA... Oil of oregano at relatively low doses was found to be efficacious against Staphylococcus bacteria and was comparable in its germ-killing properties to antibiotic drugs such as streptomycin, penicillin and vancomycin. [Science Daily 10/11/01] The oregano oil was obtained from North American Herb and Spice Company, a Waukegan, Illinois company that sponsored the study and mark ets their non-prescription products in retail stores under the trade names Oregamax and Oregacyn. Early in 2004, researchers at the Department of Food Science at the University of Tennessee reported that, among various plant oils, oil of oregano exhibited the greatest antibacterial action against common pathogenic germs such as Staph, E. coli and Listeria.

[Journal Applied Microbiology, June 1999] The carvacrol in oil of oregano also kills anthrax spores. [ Archives Microbiology, October 2000; Quarterly Review Biology, March 1998] Sardi says it’s crucial to note, “Oil of oregano is not to be confused with common oregano in the kitchen spice cupboard, which is usually marjoram ...rather than true oregano (Origanum vulgare). COME CLEAN WITH CILANTRO Our bodies know best. Frequent trips to the pesticide- free section of my grocery’s veggie section have seen me reaching for cilantro. I learned later that Dr. Yoshiaki Omura discovered that the leaves of the coriander plant can accelerate the excretion of mercury, lead and aluminum from the body. While treating patients for Chlamydia, Herpes and Cytom egalovirus infections, Omura found that their symptoms would clear up after an initial course of antibiotics - only to recur within a few months. Taking a closer look, Omura found these infectious organisms flourishing in bodily concentrations of heavy metals such as mercury, lead and alumi num. Somehow the organisms appeared to be using the toxic metals to fend off antibiotics. But mercury levels in the urine increased after patients consumed a Vietnamese soup containing cilantro (or coriander). Further testing revealed that eating cilantro increased the urinary excretion of lead and aluminum. When cilantro was used with natural antiviral agents and “good” fatty acids, infections could be eliminated for good. While awaiting further tests to confirm the presence of aluminum in chemtrails, James and Phyllis Balch write in Prescription For Nutritional healing that aluminum accumulated in body tissues can be offset and eliminated by taking apple pectin, calcium/magnesium , garlic and kelp to detox. Also recommended is lecithin to heal brain and cell membranes, as well as minerals and multivitamins “high in vitamin-B”. (Given the current controversy surrounding soy products, a good source of lecithin is organic eggs.) PULLING YOUR HAIR OVER CHEMTRAILS? Try hair analysis. Janet Starr Hull suggests that anyone concerned about chemtrail poisoning - or contamination from other sources - get a simple hair analysis. “Hair has the advantage of long-term memory,” Hull writes. “It’s a permanent record, like tree rings. A three-inch strand of human hair will give a six-month history of what’s going on in the body since head hair grows at a rate of about a half an inch a month. “Drugs and chemical residues, toxins, heavy metals, and radiation all embed in hair fiber protein as it grows,” she explains. “Clinical research indicates that hair levels of specific elements, particularly toxic elements, correlate with pathological disorders. For such elements, the levels in the hair provide a superior indication of body stores opposed to blood or urine specimens. Thi s is one reason hair element tests are preferred for drug testing and forensics.”"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":" Janet Starr Hull states flatly, “Hair analysis identifies the root of illness. Americans alone are exposed to more than 70,000 chemicals daily, with 14,000 of those chemicals in our food supply. The hair analysis is an excellent tool to identify specific chemic al toxins within the human body, and vitamin and mineral deficiencies caused by them. [hairanalysisprogram.com ; directlabs.com] SOFT SOAP Brian Holmes suggests “the routine use of Emu Oil soap that should be found in the average health store. It has done much good for a number of people I know who suffered from the typical chemtrail itch. Also as a matter of routine perhaps avoid the use of anti-bacteriological soaps as they may kill some bugs but leave others to multiply and build genetic resistance.” [holmestead.ca] RAISING LOW PLATELET COUNTS When the immune system attacks the body’s platelets, bright purple and red bruise-like spots can appear on the skin. Some chemtrail sickness sufferers will immediately recognize this symptom. The spontaneous nosebleeds, bruising and rashes report ed by many chemtrail ey ewitnesses – are also marked by abnormally low platelet production. Anyone lab-tested and found to have a low platelet count can consider the advice of Naturopathic Doctor Bradley Bongiovanni. The Director of the Naturopathic Medicine Center recommends: “There is one cell salt that is renowned for its ability to raise platelet levels. It’s called Ferrum phosphorous. It comes as a 6X potency. Typical dose would be 5 pellets, twice per day, away from food.” Remember, aspirin interferes with platelet function. YOUR BODY CRIES FOR WATER Dr. Feyedoon Batmanghelidj is a London-educated Iranian medical doctor who made revolutionary discoveries about the water metabolism in the human body while confined to a Teheran prison – which enabled him to follow up on his captive patients! While conventional medicine seeks to profit from ill ness by “treating” and “controlling” maladies – and often obstructing natural cures – Dr. “Batman” was able to affect complete cures for ulcers, dyspeptic pain, stress and depression, high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, excess body weight, chronic fatigue, arthritis, asthma and allergies, insulin-independent diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, back problems and a host of lesser complaints – by prescribing water. Dr. Feyedoon Batmanghelidj identifies chronic dehydrat ion as the fundamental stressor from which most human dis-ease emerge. The ingrained North American custom and conditioning of not drinking sufficient water and guzzling gallons of diuretic soft drinks and coffee reinforce chronic dehydration as our biggest health menace. At least 75% of Americans are chronically dehydrated. In 37% of Americans, the thirst mechanism is so weak that it is often mistaken for hunger. One glass of water shut down midnight hunger pangs for almost 100% of the dieters studied in a U-Washington study. Lack of water is the #1 trigger of daytime fatigue. Even mild dehydration will slow down metabolism as much as 3%, robbing energy and vitality. The brain is an electro-chemical battery requiring frequent topping up with healthy water. A mere 2% drop in body water can trigger fuzzy short-term memory, trouble with basic math, and difficulty focusing on the computer screen or on a printed page. The only way out is by drinking water.

Eight 8-ounce glasses daily is the regimen recommended by doctors and dolphins. (At least, according to those human who purport to converse with cetaceans.) For each cup of coffee or other caffeinated drink, an additional compensating eight-ounce glass of water is required. Research indicates that 8-10 glasses of water a day could significantly ease back and joint pain for up to 80% of sufferers. Flushing toxins is always efficacious. Drinking 5 glasses of water daily decreases the risk of colon cancer by 45%, breast cancer by 79%, and bladder cancer by 50%. Coke is not water! The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. Its Ph is 2.8. This means that Coke will dissolve a nail in about four days. (Timing may vary with other soft drinks.) You can put a T-bone steak in a bowl of coke and it will be gone in two days. To clean a toilet: Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl and let the \"real thing\" sit for one hour, then flush clean. To clean corrosion from car battery terminals: Pour a can of Coca-Cola over the terminals to bubble away the corrosion. To loosen a rusted bolt: Applying a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the rusted bolt for several minutes. To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of coke into a load of greasy clothes, add detergent, and run through a regular cycle. The Coca-Cola will help loosen grease stains. It will also clean road haze from your windshield. To carry Coca-Cola syrup (the concentrate) the commercial truck must use the Hazardous material place cards reserved for highly corrosive materials. In many states, the highway patrol carries two gallons of Coke in the truck to remove blood from the highway after a car accident – while the distributors of coke have been using it to clean the engines of their trucks for about 20 years!

SURPRISE ENDING Since beginning my chemtrails investigations in late 1998, this reporter has occasionally received email communications from anonymous sources purporting to be chemtrails “insiders”. Perhaps some of them were. But in no case was I able to verify either their credentials, or the reliability of their information. Anyone can send an email. But when an extremely well-connected source, with whom this reporter has closely collaborated on breaking stories for the past 15 years—a military te chnician with expertise in chemical warfare and microelectronics whom I have come to call “Hank”—call ed me just as this book was going online to brief me on a remarkable visit, I had to “stop presses” and reconsider darker aspects of this story that I have long resisted. Hank was used to seeing the same pair of U.S. military intelligence agents on his front steps, or waylaying him in parking lots after we had gone public with detailed reports on electromagnetic mind- and-emotion-altering “poppers” deployed by the Office of Naval Intelligence in Iraq. Or Israel’s abortive nuclear air strike on Iran. We had both been warned, and than ked by agents Hank called “Bob” and “Dave” for making certain vital information known to the world—and its leaders—through my website, willthomas.net. So far, the site’s 75,000 visitors a day have included high-ranking members of the U.S. and overseas military and intelligence communities, the British Parliament, Israel’s Knesset and even the Vatican."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":" Which was why the twins were back. They knew that Hank would relay their latest briefing to me - hopefully in time to prevent a biological apocalypse. This time, Bob and Dave had brought along an elderly gentleman “with a slight accent” from a small, distant, hot, beleaguered and closely allied country, who had wanted to meet Hank ever since reading his three-page fictional scenario back in 1995. OPEN AIR Prepared for the U.S. Army, Hank’s extrapolation of then-current classified research imagined a night attack on an enemy camp by two American helicopters hovering in whisper-mode “over jungle treetops”. Receiving a green light, the pilot of the lead Apache fired a pair of Hellfires that hit “on either side of a camp with a poof instead of a boom .” As the grass starts to whither, and people inside the camp start falling over, their infrared signatures goes “darker, darker gone.” A second green light sends the trailing Huey to land inside the camp. Protected by a prophylactic pill similar to the “PB” tablets swallowed by GIs during Desert Storm, the team “goes walking around in their jocks and socks kicking bodies over.” Proceeding to the “head shed” they gather valuable “Intel”—which they fax from the Huey on their way home” so that the contaminated documents can be destroyed in flight. When Bob and Dave introduced them, Hank’s new friend was carrying his copy of the “The Mission”. As Hank relayed to me, “He was upset by it because it followed and tracked what they actually did accomplish in 1996.” Because I had previously drawn on congressional testimony and military sources to extensively document more than a decade of illegal “Open Air” test s of biological simulants on Americans, coast-to- coast during the 1970s and early ‘80s, I was surprised when Hank confirmed that the U.S. Army Medical Material Development Command (USMDA) at Fort Dietrich still issues final project grants for bio- simulants still being released over U.S. cities 20 years after this program was supposedly stood down. “It’s bad crap, but not the worst crap,” Hank told me, explaining how “at least one out of five or more genetically altered molecules” will eventually release their material to “bind with something more compatible”—such as living human cells. “This will turn your crank,” Hank said next. “If you take a more than moderately heavy metal and out it into a liquid or foam into the atmosphere it will cause a visible streak in the sky.” He was right! It turned out that Hank’s informant with an accent—an individual I will name “Ezekiel”—is closely involved with a previously unconfirmed aspect of the chemtrails program. . This confirmed “insider” disclosed that military applications occasionally piggybacked on some chemtrail missions, are adding supposedly benign biological agents to chemtrails to see if these slightly sick-making agents will be absorbed and by the atmosphere, or carry to the ground where—as in previous “Open Air” experiments—crowded emergency rooms can attest to t heir effectiveness. Or as Hank put it, “You can pretty much tell what the target saturation will be”—if more lethal variants are eventually used against a targeted population. “The things people are seeing worldwide are part and parcel of a larger experiment,” Hank was told. “The real kicker is that it’s more than a ‘dual use’ kind of thing.” As he went on to explain, chemtrails are being used to bounce radiation from radar and radio transmissions “over the horizon,” clear around the globe if necessary. This artificial “aerial obscuration” as the Air Force officially terms it, is also being used to keep radiation from penetrating it—deflecting electronic spy satellite sweeps “without destroying said satellite,” Hank was told."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"“Unlike frying the sat with a directed energy pulse, blo cking its sensors with a temporary chemtrail shield to mask military deployments below is not considered an act of war. After all, Hank noted, if a chemtrail is “opaque enough to bounce a signal off of, it’s opaque enough to block a signal going through it.” In the briefing provided by his accented chemtrails source, Hank learned, “This stuff has a specific dispersal rate; a specific descent rate. Once we spray it, we are learning that it will cover X area in X amount of time.” Once these variables are known by looking for specific biological markers in chemtrails—or in people sickened enough to see their doctors—“you can say it will ht the ground with plus or minus” concentrations. But he stressed that biological simulants do not have to be inserted into chemtrails for this program to proceed. “There’s another level to this that if exploited could accomplish the mission. “The fungus, the viruses, the bacteria”—living and reproducing harmlessly in the upper atmosphere—“they don’t have to be something that’s put it in. There’s some that they do. But mostly they are passively receiving information on what this material would hold onto.” Brought to the ground by latching onto falling chemtr ails, pathogens that naturally exist in the upper atmosphere are easily identified because they have been mutated by unfiltered ultraviolet sunlight into strikingly distinguishable variants of their earthbound kin. In this manner, Hank was told, mad scientists experimenting with the most diabolical weapons ever conceived are determining how biological gents built in a weapons lab and spread by the same high-flying spray aircraft could be distributed to “take out” an entire country . Knowing that this secret program would be revealed worldwide through this book, and my website— willthmas.net—which currently receives more t han 75,000 often highly placed visitors every day—was why Bob and Dave had introduced Hank to a fan of his earlier report. They had chosen well. As the first reporter to document the hidden chemical and biological war waged during Desert Storm I finally recognized the feasibility of this threat. To recap: Chemtrails are being used for climate modification, as air traffic controllers across North America are being told, and as lab tests and documents attest. Chemtrails laden with barium are also being used to bounce radar and radio waves long distance. Spe cific frequencies beamed by HAARP or other transmitters may—underline may —be used to further disrupt the minds and moods of target populations already blitzed on drugs, fluoride, aspartame and television. Finally, as this writer has long maintained, chemtrails are not deliberate biological warfare aimed at culling entire populations. Yet. Instead, in a covert continuation of Open Air experiments conducting on unsuspecting citizens and wildlife in the USA, Canada and Britain since the 1970s, perhaps as many as one in 100 chemtrails are being laid down over the USA and most likely other unnamed nations in deliberate biological ex periments aimed at sickening enough people to track the effectiveness of organisms delivered for the first time from high altitudes over entire regions. The chemtrails events over outdoor gatherings descri bed in this book, as well as many others reported upwind of cities, over sports stadiums and major parades... now appear to be confirmed as deliberate biowar experiments. "},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":" BRINGING THE WAR HOME In a book that reads like fiction but isn’t, I described how “dusty agents” and biological warfare “starter cultures” provided to Saddam Hussein by the United States government in the late 1980s during the Iran-Iraq war were later used against U.S. forces widely encamped in Saudi Arabia at al-Jubayl prior to launching a Desert Storm. Bringing The War Home also documents other chemical-biological- radiological exposures from chemical mines, Depleted Uranium munitions, and a massive open-air demolition and dispersal of those deadly agents at Khamisiyah under the direct orders of General Schwarzkopf, who retired before he could b charged and court-martialed for treason and war crimes against his own troops. Like more than 200,000 other Gulf War veterans, Hank still suffers from that Gulf War Syndrome—and his government’s betrayal. The only good news in the bleakness of biological warfare is that, until now, bioagents could only be spread at low altitude and at night to prevent their dilution and degradation by wind, sunlight and rain. Now, the chemtrail program is being used to take this evil technology into high-altitude air releases for maximum effect. When you’re talking this kind of an ai r release, Hank told me, “You’re talking a release of several orders of magnitude difference in dusty agent persistence and dissemination.” Whether released at 20-feet or 20,000 feet, there is no longer any difference in the survival rates of air- released pathogens. “We spray your country with so mething we’re protected against. We own your country and you’re dead,” Hank said. What readily available organism could fell an entire population? “You use S-Atris,” Hank was told. “ Facia batra atris (phonetic), commonly known to cause diaper rash. But the Japanese did a huge amount of experimentation with this during World War II. The refined diaper rash bug is lethal not in microgram or even submolecular nano size, he stated. “We’re talking in the picogram level.” As detailed in my unhap py book, Scorched Earth, this mass-killing germ warfare agent was developed by the infamous, Ishii, the Japanese “researcher” who experimented on Korean and Chinese civilians, as well as American and other allied prisoners of war, much as Mengele did in Nazi concentration camps."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Unlike the infamous Mengele, Ishii was spared immediate execution in exchange for delivering his secrets to the Pentagon for further “refinement” at Fort Dietrich. Mad Cow Disease is just one disease investigated by a special U.S. field team after Ishii isolated it among brain-eating cannibals in the New Guinea highlands. As Dr. Len Horowitz so thor oughly documents, HIV human immune deficiency disease was also developed at Fort Dietrich with supplemental Congressional funding approved in the 1970s. “Add on top of that, you have something that is genetically altered,” Hank continued. Forget individual, air-delivered doses of fatal organisms. “We’re talking about a self-replicating pathogen... the gift that goes on giving.” DOWN TO EARTH The late Dr. Edward Teller’s notion was that light-refracting chemtrails would remain high in the sky for days, even weeks, deflecting incoming sunlight and cooling a greenhouse planet. But Hank revealed that the heavy metals being found in chemtrails “hav e a higher mass,” which mean they “will go straight down, avoiding eddies and hitting the target with higher absorption” of the bio-tracers beryllium and cesium. “Beryllium is specifically used for only one thing, as a neutrino concentrator in the soccer ball used to blow up a thermonuclear device,” Hank said. It’s not something that gives you a beryllium concentration “in your backyard from the local Wal-Mart.” In order to be turning up in chemtrail lab samples, “it had to be mined, refined, segregated from all the other chemical elements,” he went on. “It is a traceable thing, like Iodine 13. But once it breaks down, it will go into the human body like any other halogen and do recognizable damage. The barium used in chemtrails to conduct radar and radio beams reflected underneath it—or to similarly deflect electronic emissions aimed down through it fr om satellites and aircraft—“is considered a heavy metal,” Hank explained. “Because it is considered reacti ve only with certain items, it is considered very neutral, very stable. You can get a trivalent bond with this, which means that you have to try really hard to break this down.” The good news for air-breathing mammals on the ground is that once barium is bound with other chemicals in chemtrails, “it will stay bound.” “There is currently a barium medical shortage...” I pointed out. “This seems to correlate with California state environmental statistics showing a sharp rise in barium concentrations since chemtrail spraying began in earnest in late ‘98, early ‘99.” "},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Hank confirmed that because of its heavy use in chemtrails, “The medical community has to use something else to give to people to image their innards.” Just like beryllium and any other substance that has a specific use, there is a open, standard market for it that uses a certain amount every year—certain people who produce it on a regular basis and certain people who use it on a regular basis,” Hank explained. And because there are only a few places where barium is mined and refined, he was able to start tracking shipments back to their origins. Hank said that he had “gotten to the last 5 steps out of 20” when he was told through his chain of command “to mind my own fucking business—in those exact words.” Chemtrails researchers not under military orders who do not particularly feel like minding their own business can easily track beryllium or barium move ments. Because the Department of Transport and the Environmental Protection Agency must issue permi ts for over the ground transport of both chemicals licensing, “just ask for those licenses for the last five years,” Hank suggests. Ever meticulous in his crosschecking, Hank had “l earned about chemtrails from several sources.” But the visiting foreign scientist introduced to him in early February 2007 was special. “This elderly gentleman was someone who had had hand’s on experience with what I am talking about,” Hank told me. It was Ezekiel who learned how to mill solidified chemical warfare agents into “ingots” that can be easily and safely transported to distribution sites, where the dusty agents are put through an impellor before being loaded into aircraft dispersal canisters or rocket nosecones. “The one brought with the Bobbsy Twins gave credentials I consider unbreachable,” Hank told me. “He was one of the first people that had come forward” to U.S. intelligence agents “and mention that they were tying things together”—specifically, chemtrails and region-wide dispersal of bioagents. TRAILS IN THE SKY Because this writer has consistently refused to report unproven biowar speculation concerning chemtrails, I queried Hank closely on his disturbing revelations. He reiterated that the scientist with a n accent “specifically mentioned trails in the sky when they talking about dusty agents. He was quit families with the use of them.” Going into more detail, he relayed how solidified chemical compounds experimentally spread in chemtrails are being hit with an intense burst of energy “to send it back to its initial components.” A second pulse is then used to “repulverize” those clumps of chemicals. “Pfft – pfft” he said, mimicking an initial energy “burster” followed after “a small lag” by a second blast. “From HAARP,” I exclaimed into a phone suddenly jamm ed with static from unseasonal monsoon rains. “Exactly,” Hank confirmed."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Because the frequency of each bioagent is known, H ank’s visitor “knew the exact vibratory frequency required to shatter all of the dust into its smallest components,” Hank said. And this was back in the ‘Fifties. As Ezekiel told Hank, “I was doing this before you before you were born, son.” With high-altitude dispersal capabilities now assur ed, this explained my second longstanding objection to biowar chemtrails—namely, that there are not enough biological warfare agents on the planet to fill a squadron of tanker planes. Using HAARP’s tightly focused beams of very hi gh energy to pulverize small amounts of lethal bioagents into smaller-than-nano-size particles ensures that a very little nastiness goes a very long way. “Everything is wave. Everything is frequency,” Hank repeated several times. “As long as you understand the physics of sound, and know frequencies and how to reproduce them, you’re good to go.” This includes the ability “to hit a dusty agent cloud with a frequency, and put everything [back] into its base component,” he said. When it comes to chemtrails’ deadliest purpose, Hank emphasized, “The word ‘compartmentalized’ does not even come close. It’s not that the hand doesn’t know it’s attached to a body, but that the hand doesn’t even know it’s a hand. Or that it has a useful opposable thumb. “Wright Patt, the Skunk Works and the SR-71—all them boys, they all fit into the same category. One person will work on the bolt to hold the plate in. It has to have 7 1/2 turns to handle 25 G’s stress. What the hell is that for? He doesn’t know. This guy, his entire career, he has a master’s degree in physics. He makes that bolt. That’s his entire reason for existing. “Chemtrails are same way. Person A puts together 50 gallons of this material. Before loading it into the plane, “Person B does not know if it’s been altered.” If anyone wants to know about how this works, Hank recommended viewing the film, “Three Days Of The Condor”. “These guys may go out and spray area A thinking they’re spraying what they’re spraying. One hundred times they may be right.” Then, his foreign visitor and alli ed scientists “put all the key pieces into place to get a specific effect,” Hank disclosed. “These are the folks who determine what the material would be to use in the chemtrails in the first place... It’s a secret, not a top secret. You can see it, but you don’t know what it is. Otherwise, they’re use for it in the way of their choosing, at the time of their choosing would be a Top Secret thing.” Instead, they are hiding it in plain sight. RULING FAMILY RENEGADE While I was still reeling from Hank’s relayed information, a second informant—a person unknown to this writer and using English as a second language—called to offer further insights. “I’m from one of the families that does this stuff,” this now-independent medical researcher told me. “I worked for one of the first and biggest think tanks,” she elaborated, before quitting over the implications of their research. "},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":" Well-spoken in the arcane argot of medicine, physi cs and metaphysics, she described how, during in the last century, at an institute in a country redacted at her request, “the emphasis they were putting was on nanotech. We had priorities we were given to brainstorm on, and the top one was population.” The foundations funding institutes like hers were most concerned with overpopulation. “Henry would come in once a month and ask how we were getting along,” she told me, referring to Henry Kissinger. “The second emphasis—nanotechnology. How would you go about it if you had infinite resources? What would you do if you had control of individual self-replicating molecule machines?” her team was asked. Begun with eugenics techniques pioneered in the United States in the 1930’s and copied by Adolph Hitler, the foundations funding ongoing research to construct a “super race” by tinkering with the human genome are “all the same guys: Rockefeller, Mellon, Carnegie, Roschild,” she said. “I call it the ‘World Order’ because there’s nothing new about it... They look at things differently. It’s almost like an overlay of a conscious reality by a technical reality. The ones in charge—it’s as if they have lost some of their genuine [conscience] ability. Or why else would they work there?” Echoing Hank’s subsequent remarks regarding “compartmentalization”, she said that even while working with a colleague on the same experiments, “at the institute we couldn’t discuss what we were both working on.” Later in a follow-up interview, this intriguing informant added, “They went to great lengths to bury Tesla.” I informed her that his blueprints and patents are now sequestered at Wright Patterson Air Force Base— home to the HAARP and chemtrails projects. How can we protect ourselves from folks who follow a “light-bearer” called Lucifer, I wanted to know. “If you’re following your heart, excitement, staying a step ahead of yourself in what interests you,” you will remain safe and healthy, she replied. "},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":" “The need to discover—curiosity, exploration” is key, added a person who claimed to have once playing duets with a comet-grazing Velikovsky—whom she described as “a noble creature with this white hair and this big bulbous head. And he played Mozart pretty well.” Unknowingly anticipatin g Hank’s next call, she said that her former teacher—a “brutal” and “schizophrenic” Sufi named Gurdjieff—“was actually discharged by the order. A branch headed by a British lord took over in this country, and he took over our training. It’s all the same people. It’s amazing. This order has many names but it’s the same tradition.” Long before chemtrails coalesced into the Father of the H-Bomb’s last Earth-altering scheme, she had known and worked with a man she described as a brilliant and charismatic maniac. “Eddie Teller? He even scared me.” Given the dark forces arrayed against us, I pressed, how can concerned people of conscience prevail? By not cooperating, my caller replied. “This is a c onsensus reality. Once the consensus ends, this ends. I don’t think the structure could hold out against the shift. If it shifted suddenly, there wouldn’t be anything else to work with.” HIDDEN ELITE CONFIRMED Why are such outrageous but sugge stive remarks from an unverified caller being included at the end of this book? First, because there are no coincidences. Again and again, I have found over 40 years as a reporter that anyone who tracks a story with unbending intention becomes a “strange attractor” for guidance and assistance from many sources. More importantly, it is a journalistic rule to publish information from an anonymous source only when it is independently corroborated by other known sources. Less than one week after the interview excerpted above purported to confirm the machinations of a hidden elite, I received another urgent message from Hank. I returned his call after passing through his elaborate phone security screen. This time, Hank informed that the twins had shown up to ask his help in determining whether the entire United States war machine is at risk after military technicians discovered that millions of supposedly “hardened” computer chips are actually “Made In Ch ina”—and susceptible to catastrophic melting by either an electromagnetic pulse from a nuclear detonation—or a directed microwave pulsed on the same frequencies as the Trojan chips. After a long and troubling briefing, Hank rendered his verdict: Affirmative. "},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"But the two military intelligence agents long known to my friend and informant were much more frightened by something else. As they expressed i t, they now realized that they, their government, and major antagonists in the Middle East are being manipulated by elements as yet unknown, to the detriment of all involved. They had always believed that they and their government were “at the top of the food chain,” Hank saw. “Bob and Dave, they thought they were autonomous—you know, the men in black kind of thing. They know who signs their check, and who signs their check, and who signs the checks above them. Then they come to find out that there’s somebody w ho doesn’t need a frickin’ paycheck! When you think you’re king shit of the hill, and then you find out, not so much—that’s what unnerved them to the point that they came to me.” Which is “scarier than heck,” Hank stated. “You haven’t seen that high yet. And you don’t want to see that high. But you know that somebody else turns the knob, and it’s not you. The twins don’t have a clue of who they might be, which made them exceedingly nervous. This goes beyond borders, beyond any political system with an ‘ism’ after it; beyond religion,” added this former Jesuit novitiate who chose to take different orders. “These are the people who have ascended past that, a behind-the-scenes cabal bunch of people. Bilderberger doesn’t come close to touching the folks I’m talking about. These are people the Masons don’t know about. They thought up the idea to put out the Masons and the Knights Templar to go forth and fight other groups. These are the guys who are doing that.” And because they have “no building, no signs, no designator, no nametag, they are totally autonomous, outside the realm,” he said. “When you get to the point where you actually see the shadow of the person behind the curtain, it’s should you run or not? How do you approach something like that? It’s kind of like waking up one day and finding that you rea lly are in the frickin’ matrix.” LOVE IS THE ANSWER How “high” do chemtrails really go? Even as we ra lly to stop these risky experiments, and regain our democracy and the destiny of the offspring of all species, there is only one way forward, one way out. As my classical music-loving caller had said, the transfor mative shift that will set us truly free comes only from love made manifest as compassion. "},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"It was time to check in with higher guidance. Finishing this book’s unexpectedly extended upload, it was midnight when I called Rich to ask one of his “highly connected” sources to suggest a way forward. An hour and a half later he called back to report: \"They said to make sure you stay focused with the love energy. It’s the one thing they can’t do anything about. And that’s a biggie. We go to the fear energy and we are in their hands. And that’s why we have to stay in that powerful love energy. That’s the most powerful energy in the universe, and it always prevails and can never be conquered or diffused. We need to stay in that energy. “When you stay in your power, you are much more powerful than these energies—much more powerful than these energies right at the top,” he continued. “This is the most important thing that you have to understand right now. You can deal with things at a ve ry high level when you stay in this energy.\" This does not mean that we have to cheer the chemtrailers who assail us; only that we lovingly invite them to refuse to fly missions that are harming the Earth, hurting their own families, and threatening all life with experiments hidden from them that are ultimately aimed at countrywide culls. Remember always to stand together: Our love is strong, not weak. Our love is firm and insistent, never passive. Or love protects the children. Our love sets boundaries. And invites our most frightened enemies to join us in laughter, joy and light. In the choices we make everyday, we will transform the world.

I am an award-winning investigative reporter with over four decades’ experience. My feature writing and photography have appeared in more than 50 publications in eight countries, with translations into French, Dutch and Japanese. Born and raised in the USA, where my father was a career navy pilot, I soloed a Cessna at age 16. At Marquette University, where I majored in philosophy and theology, I joined the U.S. Navy Reserve shortly after the Gulf of Tonkin story broke in headlines across the country. Four years later, having won assignment to Pensacola NAS, I was about to achieve a lifelong dream of flying jets off carriers when the appalling civilian carnage and revelations of the Tonkin fabrication brought me to a personal crisis. Realizing that I could not napalm families whose aspirations and love for their children was no different from my own, I resigned my navy commission. With help from the American Quakers I made my way to Canada in 1970. On the west coast I opened the first photographic gallery, and later won a position as staff photographer for the Vancouver Sun . I also completed construction of backyard-built 31-foot trimaran to sail the South Seas as a freelance photojournalist. Her dreamed named was Celerity . In 1985 I completed an eight-year Pacific circumnavigation under sail with the first nonstop Pacific crossing from Japan to North America by multihull. Now what should I do? During a solo vision quest in the Coast Mountains I was instructed to defend my mother planet and speak for the voiceless ones. Soon after, I co-founded Green Islands and the Save Georgia Straight Alliance. While serving on clear-cut logging blockades on Salt Spring Island, the Tsitika, Walbran and Clayoquot Sound, I pioneered the use of aerial videos and 60-second “spot” TV ads to expose illegal logging practices. After completing the first environmental survey of British Columbia’s Strait of Georgia with SGSA members onboard Celerity , I helped lead successful campaigns to clean up pulp mills dumping dioxins into the strait. As the only video reporter allowed inside the armed native blockade a Gustafson Lake, I later helped avert a military assault that would have shocked Canada and the world. "},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Hoping to make a difference during the oil fires of Desert Storm, while on a peace mission with artist Carl Chaplin in Jordan, I co-founded the Gulf Environmental Emergency Response team. During and immediately after the Gulf War, I served five months in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait as a member of a three-man environmental emergency response team. My video documentary Eco War won the 1991 US Environmental Festival award for “Best Documentary Short” and was excerpted by the CBC, CNN, NBC, as well as the movie, “The Corporation”. My book, Bringing The War Home was the first complete account of the origins of Gulf War Illness. Scorched Earth documented the military’s war against the Earth, in peacetimes as well as during conflicts. In January 1998, soon after breaking the “mystery plumes” story for the Environment News wire service, I made the first of eight guest appearances with Art Bell on Coast To Coast describing a phenomenon I later popularized as “chemtrails”. All Fall Down: The Politics of Terror and Mass Persuasion was the first published book on 9 / 11. My more recently updated Days Of Deception: Ground Zero And Beyond remains the most thorough journalistic account of Black Tuesday and its aftermath. Though it reads lik e a novel, every event is documented. The most recent book of my ongoing chemtrails investigation is Chemtrails Confirmed 2010 . It has now been updated with a revised Chemtrails Timeline to 2013. Recipient of four Canadian feature-writing awards, I have been writing about wireless hazards since the publication of Scorched Earth in 1991. My most recent ebooks include ABCs of Cell Phones And Other Hazards Of The Wireless Age and Smart Meters For Smarties. I am currently active in the local Smart Meter Resistance. You can now find my ebooks on my website. They are available for direct download by donation here. In service to truth and life, thank you a ll for your activism, research and support.
