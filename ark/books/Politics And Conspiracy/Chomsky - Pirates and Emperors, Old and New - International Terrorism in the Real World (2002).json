It captures with some accura cy the current relations between the United States and var ious minor actors on the stage of international ter rorism: Libya, factions of the PLO, and others. More genera lly, St. Augustine's tale illuminates the meaning o f the concept of international terrorism in contemporary Western usage, and reaches to the heart of the fren zy over selected incidents of terrorism currently being orc hestrated, with supreme cynicism, as a cover for We stern violence. The term \"terrorism\" came into use at the end of the eighteenth century, primarily to refer to viole nt acts of governments designed to ensure popular submission. That concept plainly is of little benefit to the pr actitioners of state terrorism, who, holding power, are in a po sition to control the system of thought and express ion. The original sense has therefore been abandoned, and th e term \"terrorism\" has come to be applied mainly to \"retail terrorism\" by individuals or groups.1 Whereas the t erm was once applied to emperors who molest their o wn subjects and the world, now it is restricted to thi eves who molest the powerful - though not entirely restricted: the term still applies to enemy emperors, a categor y that shifts with the needs of power and ideology. Extricating ourselves from such practices, we use the term \"terrorism\" to refer to the threat or use of violence to intimidate or coerce (generally for political, r eligious, or other such ends), whether it is the te rrorism of the emperor or of the thief. The pirate's maxim explains the recently evolved concept of \"international terrorism\" only in part. It is necessary to add a second feature: an act of terror ism enters the canon only if it is committed by \"th eir side,\" not ours. That was the guiding doctrine of the publ ic relations campaign about \"international terroris m\" launched by the Reagan Administration as it came to office. It relied on scholarship claiming to have established that the plague is a \"Soviet-inspired\" instrument, \"aimed at the destabilization of Wester n democratic society,\" as shown by the alleged fact t hat terrorism is not \"directed against the Soviet U nion or any of its satellites or client states,\" but rather occ urs \"almost exclusively in democratic or relatively democratic countries.\"2 The thesis is true, in fact true by definition, g iven the way the term \"terrorism\" is employed by th e emperor and his loyal coterie. Since only acts committed by \"their side\" count as terrorism, it follows that t he thesis is necessarily correct, whatever the facts. In the rea l world, the story is quite different. The major vi ctims of international terrorism3 in the past several decade s have been Cubans, Central Americans, and inhabita nts of Lebanon, but none of this counts, by definition. Wh en Israel bombs Palestinian refugee camps killing m any civilians - often without even a pretense of \"repri sal\" - or sends its troops into Lebanese villages i n \"counterterror\" operations where they murder and de stroy, or hijacks ships and dispatches hundreds of hostages to prison camps under horrifying conditions, this i s not \"terrorism\"; in fact, the rare voices of prot est are thunderously condemned by loyal party liners for th eir \"anti-Semitism\" and \"double standard,\" demonstr ated by their failure to join the chorus of praise for \"a c ountry that cares for human life\" (Washington Post) , whose \"high moral purpose\" (Time) is the object of never- ending awe and acclaim, a country which, according to its admirers, \"is held to a higher law, as interpreted for it by journalists\" (Walter Goodman).4 Similarly, it is not terrorism when paramilitary forces operating from U.S. bases and trained by the CIA bombard Cuban hotels, sink fishing boats and attack Russian ships in Cuban harbors, poison crops and livestock, attempt to assassinate Castro, and so on , in missions that were running almost weekly at th eir peak.5 These and many similar actions on the part of the e mperor and his clients are not the subject of confe rences and learned tomes, or of anguished commentary and diatr ibes in the media and journals of opinion. Standards for the emperor and his court are uniqu e in two closely related respects. First, their ter rorist acts are excluded from the canon; second, while terrorist at tacks against them are regarded with extreme seriou sness, even requiring violence in \"self-defense against fu ture attack\" as we will see, comparable or more ser ious"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"terrorist attacks against others do not merit retal iation or preemptive action, and if undertaken woul d elicit fury and a fearsome response. The significance of such t errorist attacks is so slight that they need barely be reported, surely not remembered. Suppose, for example, that a seaborne Libyan force were to attack three America n ships in the Israeli port of Haifa, sinking one of them and damaging the others, using East German-mad e missiles. There is no need to speculate on the reac tion. Turning to the real world, on June 5,1986, \"a seaborne South African force attacked three Russian ships in the southern Angolan harbour of Namibe, sinking on e of them,\" using \"Israeli-made Scorpion [Gabriel] missi les.\"6 If the Soviet Union had responded to this terror ist attack against commercial shipping as the U.S. would have done under similar circumstances - perhaps by a fir ebombing that would have destroyed Johannesburg, to judge by the action-response scale of U.S. and Israeli \"r etaliation\" - the U.S. might well have considered a nuclear strike as legitimate \"retaliation\" against the Comm unist devil. In the real world, the USSR did not re spond, and the events were considered so insignificant that th ey were barely mentioned in the U.S. press.7 Suppose that Cuba were to have invaded Venezuela in late 1976 in self-defense against terrorist atta ck, with the intent of establishing a \"New Order\" there orga nized by elements under its control, killing 200 Am ericans manning an air defense system, heavily shelling the U.S. Embassy and finally occupying it for several days during its conquest of Caracas in violation of a ce ase-fire agreement.8 Turning again to the real worl d, in 1982 Israel attacked Lebanon under the pretext of protec ting the Galilee against terrorist attack (fabricat ed for the U.S. audience, as tacitly conceded internally), wit h the intent of establishing a \"New Order\" there or ganized by elements under its control, killing 200 Russians wh o were manning an air defense system, heavily shell ing the Russian Embassy and finally occupying it for two da ys during its conquest of West Beirut in violation of a cease-fire agreement. The facts were casually repor ted in the U.S., with the context and crucial backg round ignored or denied. There was, fortunately, no Sovie t response, or we would not be here today to discus s the matter. In the real world, we assume as a matter of cours e that the Soviet Union and other official enemies, most of them defenseless, will calmly endure provocations a nd violence that would elicit a furious reaction, v erbal and military, if the emperor and his court were the vic tims. The stunning hypocrisy illustrated by these and i nnumerable other cases, some discussed below, is no t restricted to the matter of international terrorism . To mention a different case, consider the World W ar II agreements that allocated control over parts of Eur ope and Asia to the several Allied powers and calle d for withdrawal at specified times. There was great outr age over (in fact, outrageous) Soviet actions in Ea stern Europe modeled closely on what the U.S. had done in the areas assigned to Western control under wartim e agreements (Italy, Greece, South Korea, etc.); and over the belated Soviet withdrawal from northern Ir an, while the U.S. violated its wartime agreements to withdra w from Portugal, Iceland, Greenland, and elsewhere, on the grounds that \"military considerations\" make such wi thdrawal \"inadvisable,\" the Joint Chiefs of Staff a rgued with State Department concurrence. There was - and to this day is - no outrage over the fact that West German espionage operations, directed against the USSR, we re placed under the control of Reinhard Gehlen, who had conducted similar operations for the Nazis in Easte rn Europe, or that the CIA was sending agents and s upplies to aid armies encouraged by Hitler fighting in East ern Europe and the Ukraine as late as the early 195 0s as part of the \"roll-back strategy\" made official in NSC-68 (April 1950).9 Soviet support for armies encourage d by Hitler fighting in the Rockies in 1952 might have e licited a different reaction.10 Examples are legion. One of the most notorious is the example regularly offered as the ultimate proo f that Communists cannot be relied upon to live up to agre ements: the 1973 Paris Peace treaty concerning Viet nam and its aftermath. The truth is that the U.S. annou nced at once that it would reject every term of the scrap of paper it had been compelled to sign, and proceeded to do so, while the media, in a display of servilit y that goes beyond the norm, accepted the U.S. version of the t reaty (violating every essential element of-it) as the actual text, so that U.S. violations were \"in accord\" with the treaty while the Communist reaction to these v iolations proved their innate treachery. This example is now regularly offered as justification for the U.S. rej ection of a negotiated political settlement in Central America, demonstrating the usefulness of a well-run propaga nda system.11"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" As noted, \"international terrorism\" (in the speci fic Western sense) was placed in the central focus of attention by the Reagan Administration as it came into office in 1981.12 The reasons were not difficult to disce rn, though they were - and remain - inexpressible within the d octrinal system. The Administration was committed to three related policies, all achieved with considerable success: 1) transfer of resources from the poor to the rich; 2) a large- scale increase in the state sector of the economy i n the traditional way, through the Pentagon system, a dev ice to compel the public to finance high technology industry by means of the state-guaranteed market for the pro duction of high technology waste and thus to contri bute to the program of public subsidy, private profit, call ed \"free enterprise\"; and 3) a substantial increase in U.S. intervention, subversion and international terroris m (in the literal sense). Such policies cannot be p resented to the public in the terms in which they are intended. They can be implemented only if the general popula tion is properly frightened by monsters against whom we mus t defend ourselves. The standard device is an appeal to the threat of what the President called \"the monolithic and ruth less conspiracy\" bent on world conquest - President Kenn edy, as he launched a rather similar program13 - Re agan's \"Evil Empire.\" But confrontation with the Empire it self would be a dangerous affair. It is far safer t o do battle with defenseless enemies designated as the Evil Emp ire's proxies, a choice that conforms well to the t hird plank in the Reagan agenda, pursued for quite independent reasons: to ensure \"stability\" and \"order\" in Wash ington's global domains. The \"terrorism\" of properly chosen pirates, or of such enemies as Nicaragua or Salvado ran peasants who dare to defend themselves against inte rnational terrorist attack, is an easier target, an d with an efficiently functioning propaganda system, it can b e exploited to induce a proper sense of fear and mo bilization among the domestic population. It is in this context that \"international terrori sm\" replaced human rights as \"the Soul of our forei gn policy\" in the 1980s, human rights having achieved this status as part of the campaign to reverse the notable imp rovement in the moral and intellectual climate during the 19 60s - termed the \"Vietnam syndrome\" - and to overco me the dread \"crisis of democracy\" that erupted in the sam e context as large elements of the general populati on became organized for political action, threatening the sys tem of elite decision, public ratification, called \"democracy\" in Western parlance.14 In what follows, I will be concerned with interna tional terrorism in the real world, focusing attent ion primarily on the Mediterranean region. \"Mideast/Mediterranean terrorism\" was selected as the top story of 1985 b y editors and broadcasters - primarily American -poll ed by the Associated Press; the poll was taken befo re the terrorist attacks at the Rome and Vienna airports i n December, which probably would have eliminated remaining doubts.15 In the early months of 1986, co ncern over Mideast/Mediterranean terrorism reached a fever pitch, culminating in the U.S. bombing of Lib ya in April. The official story is that this courag eous action aimed at the leading practitioner of international terrorism achieved its goal. Qaddafi and other majo r criminals are now cowering in their bunkers, tamed by the bra ve defender of human rights and dignity. But despit e this grand victory over the forces of darkness, the issu e of terrorism emanating from the Islamic world and the proper response for the democracies that defend civ ilized values remains a leading topic of concern an d debate, as illustrated by numerous books, conferences, arti cles and editorials, television commentary, and so on. Insofar as any large or elite public can be reached, the di scussion strictly observes the principles just enun ciated: attention is restricted to the terrorism of the thi ef, not the emperor and his clients; to their crime s, not ours. I will, however, not observe these decencies."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Introduction (2002) The impact of the terrorist atrocities of September 11, 2001 was so overwhelming that the identificati on just given is redundant: \"9/11\" suffices. It is widely a greed that the world has entered into a new age in which everything will be different: \"the age of terror.\" Undoubtedly 9/11 will hold a prominent place in the annals of terrorism, though we should think carefully about j ust why this is the case. Anyone familiar with past and current history knows that the reason is not, regre ttably, the scale of the crimes; rather, the choice of innocent victims. What the consequences will be depends subs tantially on how the rich and powerful interpret th is dramatic demonstration that they are no longer immu ne from atrocities of the kind they routinely infli ct on others, and how they choose to react. In this connection, it is useful to consider seve ral facts: 1) The \"age of terror\" was not unanticip ated; 2) The \"war on terror\" declared on September 11 is no inno vation, and the way it was conducted in the very re cent past can hardly fail to be instructive today. As for 1), though no one could have predicted the specific atrocities of 9/11, it had been understoo d for some time that with contemporary technology, the industr ial world was likely to lose its virtual monopoly o f violence. Well before 9/11, it was recognized that \"a well-planned operation to smuggle [weapons of ma ss destruction] into the United States would have at l east a 90 percent probability of success.\"1 Among t he contemplated threats are \"small nukes,\" \"dirty bomb s,\" and a variety of biological weapons. Execution might not require unusual technical proficiency or organi zation. Furthermore, the source of terror might be hard to identify, hence to confront. Nine months after 9/11 and the anthrax scare that many analysts found eve n more terrifying,2 the FBI reported that it still had onl y suspicions about the origins and planning of the 9/11 attacks - basically, those assumed at once, prior to what mus t be the most extraordinary international investiga tions in history, which yielded very little, they acknowledg e; and the FBI reported no progress on identifying the perpetrators of the anthrax terror, though the sour ce had been localized to Federal laboratories withi n the United States, and huge resources had been devoted to the investigation. Turning to point 2), it is important to remember that the \"war on terror\" was not declared by George W. Bush on 9/11, but rather re-declared. It had been declar ed 20 years earlier by the Reagan-Bush (No. 1) Administration, with similar rhetoric and much the same personnel in leading positions. They pledged t o excise the \"cancers\" that are bringing \"a return to barbar ism in the modern age.\" They identified two main ce nters of the \"evil scourge of terrorism\": Central America an d the Middle East/Mediterranean region. Their campa igns to eradicate the plague in these two regions ranked hi gh among the foreign policy issues of the decade. I n the case of Central America, these campaigns quickly led to popular mobilization that was unprecedented in char acter. It had deep roots in mainstream American society, and broke new ground in the actions that were undertake n; during the U.S. wars in Indochina, as in earlier We stern rampages in much of the world, few even thoug ht of going to live in a village to help the victims and, by their presence, to provide some minimal protect ion from the foreign invaders and their local clients. There was also a large literature on the Reagan Administ ration's \"war on terror.\" It found its place within the popu lar movements that sought to counter state-supporte d international terrorism, though it remained virtual ly unmentionable in the mainstream under the conven tion that only crimes of others are to command attention and elicit passionate denunciation. Much of what follow s is drawn from writings of the 1980s on this topic,3 wh ich has considerable relevance for what lies ahead, I believe. Washington's Central American base for countering the plague was Honduras. The official in charge du ring the most violent years was Ambassador John Negropon te, who was appointed by George Bush (No. 2) in 200 1 to lead the diplomatic component of the re-declared \"war on terror\" at the United Nations. Reagan's sp ecial envoy to the Middle East through the period of the worst atrocities there was Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who directs the military component of the new phase of the campaign. Other leading planners in Washington also bring to the new \"war on terror\" th e experience they gained from the first phase. In both regions, the Reagan Administration carrie d out massive terrorist atrocities, vastly exceedin g anything they claimed to be combating. In the Middle East, b y a large margin the worst atrocities trace back to the U.S. and its local clients, who left a trail of bloodshe d and devastation, particularly in the shattered so cieties of Lebanon and in the territories under Israeli milita ry occupation."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" óentral America suffered even worse disasters at the hands of the k-rrorist commanders in Washington and their minions. One of the Inrgets was a state, Nica ragua, which was therefore able to follow the cours e required by law and solemn treaties when a country is attack ed: to appeal to international authorities. The Wor ld Court ruled in favor of Nicaragua, determining that the U .S. was guilty of \"unlawful use of force\" and viola tion of treaties, ordering Washington to terminate its inte rnational terrorist crimes and pay substantial repa rations. The U.S. dismissed the Court ruling with contempt, on t he official grounds that other nations do not agree with us so we must decide for ourselves what lies within our \" domestic jurisdiction\"; in this case, a terrorist w ar against Nicaragua. With bipartisan support, the Administrat ion immediately escalated the crimes. Nicaragua app ealed to the Security Council, where the U.S. vetoed a re solution supporting the Court decision and calling on all states to observe international law, also voting al one (with one or two client-states) against similar General Assembly resolutions. The U.S. escalated the attack further while undermining efforts of the Central A merican presidents to achieve a negotiated settlement. When the population finally succumbed, the national pre ss, while acknowledging the terrorist methods employed, did n ot try to conceal its ecstasy, informing the world that Americans are \"United in Joy\" at this \"Victory for U.S. Fair Play\" (New York Times). Elsewhere in Central America the population had no army to protect it. The atrocities carried out b y the forces armed and trained by the U.S. and the states that j oined its international terrorist network were ther efore considerably more extreme than in Nicaragua, where they were horrifying enough. Conducted with unspeakable barbarism and brutality, the U.S. wars left some 200,000 corpses and millions of refugees and orphans in the shattered countries. One prime targe t of the \"war on terror\" was the Catholic Church, w hich had committed a grievous sin. Abandoning the traditiona l role of service to wealth and power, major segmen ts of the Church adopted \"the preferential option for the poor.\" Priests, nuns, and layworkers sought to org anize people who lived in misery to take some control of their lives, thereby becoming \"Communists\" who must be exterminated. It was more than symbolic that the at rocious decade began with the assassination of a conservative Archbishop who had become \"a voice for the voiceless,\" and ended with the brutal murder o f six leading Jesuit intellectuals, in both cases by Wash ington's favored clients. The events elicited littl e interest among those responsible. Few even know the names of the assassinated intellectuals, in dramatic contra st to dissidents in enemy states; one can imagine the rea ction if they had not merely been jailed and exiled , but had their brains blown out by elite forces trained and armed by the Kremlin, capping a record of horrendou s atrocities. The basic facts are understood. The School of the Americas announces with pride that \"liberation the ology . . . was defeated with the assistance of the U.S. Army,\" thanks in no small measure to the training it prov ided to military officers of the client-states. The \"Victory for U.S. Fair Play\" left more than a trail of mutilated corpses and ruined lives, in th e midst of ecological disaster. After the U.S. took over again in 1990, Nicaragua declined to the rank of poorest country of the hemisphere after Haiti - which, by coincidence, has been the leading target of U.S. intervention a nd violence for a century, and now shares with Cuba th e distinction of enduring a crushing U.S. embargo. Elsewhere in the region, neoliberal economic policies, such as ending price subsidies and increasing sales taxes, have worsened the situation for the poor, the UN believes. Annual soc ial spending in the four drought-hit Central Americ an countries is $100 a head, one sixth of the Latin Am erican average [which is disgraceful enough]. Stati stics compiled for the UN's Food and Agricultural Organiz ation's annual meeting in Rome this week [June 11, 2002] show that the number of people with chronic hunger in Central America has risen by almost a third in t he last decade, from 5 million to 6.4 million of the 28 mil lion population.4 UN agencies are seeking remedies, \"but without ef fective land reform these measures can have only li mited impact.\" The popular organizations that might have led the way to land reform and other measures to be nefit the poor majority were effectively destroyed by Was hington's \"war on terror.\" Formal democracy was instituted, but it impresses mostly ideologues. Pol ls throughout the hemisphere reveal that faith in d emocracy has steadily declined, in part because of the destr uction of the social base for effective democracy, and in part, very likely, because the institution of formal demo cracy was accompanied by neoliberal policies that r educe the space for democratic participation."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" Reviewing the program of \"bringing democracy to Latin America,\" Thomas Carothers, who served in the \"democracy enhancement\" projects of the Reagan Admi nistration, concludes that the policies were \"since re\" but a \"failure,\" of a peculiarly systematic kind. W here Washington's influence was least - in the sout hern cone - successes were greatest, despite the efforts of the Reagan Administration to impede them; where Washin gton's influence was greatest, successes were least. The r eason, Carothers concludes, is that Washington soug ht to maintain \"the basic order of ... quite undemocratic societies\" and to avoid \"populist-based change . . . inevitably [seeking] only limited, top-down forms of democrati c change that did not risk upsetting the traditiona l structures of power with which the United States ha s long been allied.\" He dismisses the \"liberal crit ique\" of this approach because of its \"perennial weak spot\": it offers no alternative. The option of allowing t he population a meaningful voice in running their own affairs is not on the agenda.5 In the reigning culture of terrorism, the crimes of the \"war on terror\" and their aftermath arouse little articulate concern, apart from tactical considerati ons. The facts were amply reported by human rights organizations, church groups, and others, sometimes even the press, but were mostly dismissed with sha meful apologetics. They are to teach us nothing about the \"war on terror.\" Most of the story was excised fro m history, even hailed as \"an inspiration for the triumph of d emocracy in our time\" (New Republic). With the thre at of meaningful democracy and desperately needed reform drowned in blood, the region drifted back to the obscurity of earlier years, when the vast majority suffered bitterly but in silence, while foreign inv estors and \"the traditional structures of power with which the United States has long been allied\" enriched thems elves. The reaction throughout makes good sense on the p revailing assumption that the victims are \"mere thi ngs\" whose lives have \"no value,\" to borrow Hegel's eleg ant term for the lower orders. If they try to \"rais e their heads,\" they must be crushed by international terro rism, which will be honored as a noble cause. If th ey endure in silence, their misery can be ignored. History te aches few lessons with such crystal clarity. Though Central America faded from view in the 199 0s, terror elsewhere remained prominent on the poli cy agenda, and having defeated liberation theology, th e U.S. military was directed to new tasks. In the W estern hemisphere, Haiti and Colombia became the focus of concern. In Haiti, the U.S. had provided ample supp ort for state violence through the 1980s (as before), but n ew problems arose in 1990, when to everyone's surpr ise, Haiti's first democratic election was won overwhelm ingly by a populist priest, thanks to large-scale p opular mobilization in the slums and rural areas that had been ignored. The democratic government was quickly overthrown by a military coup. The junta at once re sorted to atrocious terror to destroy the popular organizations, with tacit support from Bush (No. 1) and Clinton. The elected president was finally res tored, but on condition that he keep to the harsh neoliberal p olicies of the U.S.-backed candidate who had won 14 percent of the vote in the 1990 election. Haiti declined in to further misery, while Washington again was haile d for its inspiring dedication to freedom, justice, and democ racy. Considerably more significant for U.S. policy is Colombia, where the terrible crimes of earlier year s mounted sharply in the 1990s, and Colombia became the leadi ng recipient of U.S. arms and training in the hemis phere, in conformity to a consistent pattern. By the decad e's end political murders were running at about ten a day (since perhaps doubled according to Colombian human rights organizations), and the number of displaced people had risen to two million, with some 300,000 more each year, regularly increasing. The State Dep artment and Rand Corporation concur with human rights organ izations that some 75-80 percent of the atrocities are attributable to the military and paramilitaries. Th e latter are so closely linked to the military that Human Rights Watch refers to them as the army's \"sixth division, \" alongside the five official divisions. The propor tion of atrocities attributed to the six divisions has rema ined fairly constant through the decade, but with a shift from the military to the paramilitaries as terror has be en privatized, a familiar device, employed in recen t years by Serbia, Indonesia, and other terror states that see k \"plausible deniability\" for their crimes. The U.S . is employing a similar tactic, privatizing the trainin g and direction of atrocities, as well as implement ation, as in the chemical warfare operations (\"fumigation\") that have had a devastating impact on much of the peasa nt society under derisory drug war pretexts.6 Increasi ngly, these operations are being transferred to pri vate companies (MPRI, Dyncorps), which are funded by Was hington and employ U.S. military officers, a useful device to escape the limited congressional scrutiny for direct involvement in state terror. In 1999, as atrocities mounted, Colombia became t he leading recipient of U.S. military aid worldwide (apart from the perennials, Israel-Egypt), replacing Turke y. A strategically placed ally, Turkey had received"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"substantial U.S. military aid and training from the 1940s, but there was a sharp increase in the mid-1 980s as Turkey launched a counterinsurgency campaign target ing its miserably repressed Kurdish population. Sta te terror operations escalated in the 1990s, becoming some of the worst crimes of that gory decade. The operations, conducted with rampant torture and unsp eakable barbarism, drove millions of people from th e devastated countryside while killing tens of thousa nds. The remaining population is confined to a virt ual dungeon, deprived of even the most elementary right s.7 As state terror escalated, so did U.S. support for the crimes. Clinton provided Turkey with 80 percent of its arms; in 1997 alone arms flow exceeded the enti re Cold War period combined up to the onset of the counteri nsurgency campaign.8 It is instructive that in the deluge of commenta ry on the second phase of the \"war on terror,\" the very recent and highly relevant history merits no attention. Th ere is also no detectable concern over the fact tha t the second phase is led by the only state to have been condemn ed for international terrorism by the highest inter national authorities, and that the coalition of the just bri ngs together a remarkable array of terrorist states : Russia, China, and others, eagerly joining so as to obtain authori zation for their terrorist atrocities from the glob al leader who pledges to drive evil from the world. No eyebrows a re raised when the defense of Kabul against terror passes from the hands of one terrorist state (Britain) to another, Turkey, which qualified for the post by it s \"positive experiences\" in combating terror, according to the State Department and the press. Turkey has become a \"pivotal ally in Washington's new war against terro rism,\" a Brookings Institution study explains. It h as \"struggled with terrorist violence\" in recent years and \"is thus uniquely positioned to help shape the new global effort to eliminate this threat.\"9 As the few examples cited illustrate - there are many more -Washington's role in state-directed inte rnational terrorism persisted without notable change in the i nterim between the two phases of the \"war on terror ,\" along with the reaction to it. Just as had been true throughout the first phase of the \"war on terror,\" ample information about mor e recent exploits of state-supported international terrorism has been available from the major human rights org anizations and other highly reliable sources, which are eagerl y sought when they have a story to tell that is ide ologically serviceable. Here, that is most definitely not the case. The facts are therefore ignored, or if that i s impossible, dismissed as a minor flaw or inadvertent deviation from our path of righteousness. The performance was particularly impressive in the 1990s, when it was n ecessary to suppress the role of the U.S. and its a llies in Turkey, Colombia, East Timor, the Middle East, and elsewhere, while praising Washington for entering a \"noble phase\" in its foreign policy with a \"saintly glow\" as the leaders of the \"idealistic New World bent on ending inhumanity,\" for the first time in history, dedicated themselves to \"principles and values\" in their zeal to uphold human rights and freedom. That the torrent c ould flow without embarrassment is remarkable enoug h; that it was unimpeded by the crucial participation of the same saintly figures in some of the worst cr imes of the decade would have silenced even a Jonathan Swift.10 The successes of the first phase of the \"war on t error\" in Central America were mirrored in the seco nd major area of concern, the Middle East/Mediterranean regi on. In Lebanon, Palestinian refugees were crushed b y U.S.- backed terror operations, and Lebanese society suff ered further trauma. Some 20,000 were killed during the 1982 Israeli invasion, many more in atrocities of t he Israeli Army (IDF) and its mercenaries in occupi ed Lebanon in the years that followed, continuing thro ugh the 1990s with periodic Israeli invasions that drove hundreds of thousands from their homes, killing hun dreds. The Lebanese government reports 25,000 kille d after the 1982 invasion. There was rarely a credibl e pretext of self-defense, as Israeli authorities c onceded (apart from propaganda directed to the U.S.). U.S. support was consistent and decisive throughout. In the Israeli-occupied territories, terror and r epression increased through the 1980s. Israel barre d development in the occupied territories, taking over valuable l ands and much of the resources, while organizing se ttlement projects in such a way as to leave the indigenous p opulation isolated and helpless. The plans and prog rams relied crucially on U.S. military, economic, diplom atic, and ideological support. In the early days of the 35-year military occupa tion, Moshe Dayan - one of the Israeli leaders most sympathetic to the plight of the Palestinians - adv ised his cabinet colleagues that Israel should tell Palestinians that they will \"live like dogs, and whoever wishes, may leave.\"11 Like many such exercises, the hallma rk of the occupation has been humiliation and degradation of the \"Araboushim\" (the counterpart of \"niggers,\" \"ki kes\"),"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"who must be taught not to \"raise their heads,\" in t he standard idiom. Twenty years ago, reviewing one of the earlier outbreaks of settler/IDF violence, politica l scientist Yoram Peri ruefully observed that three -quarters of a million young Israelis have learned from military s ervice \"that the task of the army is not only to de fend the state in the battlefield against a foreign army, bu t to demolish the rights of innocent people just be cause they are Araboushim living in territories that God promised to us.\" The \"two-legged beasts\" (Prime Minister Men ahem Begin) will then be able only \"to scurry around lik e drugged roaches in a bottle\" (Chief of Staff Rafa el Eitan). Eitan's superior Ariel Sharon, fresh from his invas ion of Lebanon and the Sabra-Shatila massacre, advi sed that the way to deal with demonstrators is to \"cut off t heir testicles.\" The mainstream Hebrew press report ed \"detailed accounts of terrorist acts [by the IDF an d settlers] in the conquered territories,\" which we re presented to Prime Minister Begin by prominent political figu res, including leading hawks. These included regula r exercises of humiliation, such as forcing Araboushi m to urinate and excrete on one another and crawl o n the ground while they call out \"Long Live the State of Israel\" or lick the earth; or on Holocaust day, to write numbers on their own hands \"in memory of Jews in th e extermination camps.\" Such acts have scandalized much of the Israeli public since, again when they w ere repeated during Sharon's April 2002 invasion. The respected human rights activist and legal spe cialist Raja Shehadah wrote 20 years ago that for P alestinians under occupation there are few choices: \"Living lik e this, you must constantly resist the twin temptat ions of either acquiescing in the jailer's plan in numb des pair, or becoming crazed by consuming hatred for yo ur jailer and yourself, the prisoner.\" The only alternative i s to be one of the \"samidin,\" those who silently en dure, controlling their fury. One of Israel's most eminent writers, Boaz Evron, described the technique of the occupation succinct ly: \"to keep them on a short leash,\" to make sure that they recognize \"that the whip is held over their heads. \" That makes more sense than slaughter, because then civil ized folk can \"accept it all peacefully,\" asking \"W hat is so terrible? Is anyone being killed?\" Evron's acid critique is right on the mark. Its a ccuracy has repeatedly been demonstrated, very poin tedly in April 2002, when the latest of Sharon's war crimes was neatly converted by the pro-Israel lobby to a demonstration that outside the U.S., the world is r uled by ineradicable anti-Semitism. The proof is th at early fears of a huge slaughter proved unfounded, and all that happened was the destruction of the Jenin ref ugee camp, the old city of Nablus, and the cultural cent er and other civilian institutions in Ramallah, alo ng with obscene humiliation of the normal variety, brutal c ollective punishment of hundreds of thousands of in nocent people, and other trivialities of the kind that edu cated Americans and many Israelis can \"accept peace fully.\" Surely no one but some hysterical anti-Iraqi racist would object if Saddam Hussein's forces were to ca rry out similar actions in Israel or the U.S. Individual cases often reveal prevailing attitude s towards terror more graphically than the general picture. There is no more vivid and lasting symbol of \"the e vil scourge of terrorism\" than the brutal murder of a crippled American in a wheelchair, Leon Klinghoffer, during the hijacking of the Achille Lauro in October 1985. The atrocity is in no way mitigated by the claim of the terrorists that the hijacking was in retaliation f or the U.S.- backed Israeli bombing of Tunis a week earlier, whi ch had killed 75 Tunisians and Palestinians with no credible pretext. Reactions were quite different when Britis h reporters found \"the flattened remains of a wheel chair\" in the Jenin refugee camp after Sharon's onslaught. \"I t had been utterly crushed, ironed flat as if in a cartoon,\" they reported: \"In the middle of the debris lay a broken white flag.\" A crippled Palestinian, Kemal Zughaye r, \"was shot dead as he tried to wheel himself up the road. The Israeli tanks must have driven over the body, because when [a friend] found it, one leg and both arms wer e missing, and the face, he said, had been ripped i n two.\"12 This apparently did not even merit report in the U. S., and if it were reported, it would be denied alo ng with a flood of accusations of anti-Semitism that would pr obably lead to apology and retraction. If acknowled ged, the crime would be dismissed as an inadvertent error in the course of justified retaliation, quite unlike the Achille Lauro atrocity. Kemal Zughayer will not enter the a nnals of terrorism along with Leon Klinghoffer. It is all too easy to multiply such examples. U.S . allies must be distinguished from the Araboushim they grind under their boots, just as more generally over the centuries, human beings are not to be confused with \"mere things.\""},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" Former Chief of Israeli intelligence Shlomo Gazit , a senior official of the military administration in its early years, described the occupation in 1985 as a \"succe ss story.\" The population was causing no problems. They were samidin who do not raise their heads. The prim ary goal had been achieved: \"to prevent the inhabit ants of the territories from participating in shaping the p olitical future of the territory\" or to \"be seen as a partner for dealings with Israel.\" That entailed \"the absolute prohibition of any political organization, for it w as clearly understood by everyone that if political activism a nd organization were permitted, its leaders would b ecome potential participants in political affairs.\" The s ame considerations require \"the destruction of all initiative and every effort on the part of the inhabitants of the territories to serve as a pipeline for negotiations , to be a channel to the Palestinian Arab leadership outside of the t erritories.\" The guiding principle had been enuncia ted in 1972 by the distinguished Israeli diplomat Chaim Herzog, later President: \"I do not deny the Palestinians a place or stand or opinion on every matter . . . But certainl y I am not prepared to consider them as partners in any respect in a land that has been consecrated in the hands of our nation for thousands of years. For the Jews of this land there cannot be any partner.\"13 For the sponsors, problems arise only if the dru gged roaches become so \"crazed by consuming hatred\" that they do raise their heads and even turn on their ja ilers. In that case punishment is severe, reaching extreme levels of brutality, always with impunity as long a s the paymaster agrees. Until December 1987, when t he first Intifada broke out, Palestinians within the territo ries were remarkably subdued. When they finally rai sed their heads within the occupied territories, the IDF, Bor der Patrol (who resemble paramilitaries), and settl ers exploded in a paroxysm of terror and brutality.14 Reporting in the U.S. was scanty. The press and commentary also generally remained loyal, while Washington valiantly pretended \"not to see\" offers by the PLO and others for a political settlement. F inally, as it was becoming an object of international ridicule , Washington agreed to talk to the PLO, with the ch ildish pretense, accepted without a qualm by the intellect ual community and the media, that the PLO had succu mbed and had now meekly agreed to accept the forthright U.S. stand. In the first meeting (reported in Israe l and Egypt, but not in the U.S., within the mainstream), Washington demanded that the PLO call off the \"rio ts\" within the territories under military occupation, \" which we view as terrorist acts against Israel,\" ai ming to \"undermine [its] security and stability.\" The \"terr orism\" is not that of the occupying army; their vio lence is legitimate, given U.S. government priorities, just as it was in Lebanon. It is those who dare to raise their heads who are culpable. Prime Minister Rabin informed Pea ce Now leaders that the purpose of the \"low-level\" U.S.- PLO negotiations was to provide Israel with ample t ime to crush the Intifada by \"harsh military and ec onomic pressure,\" and assured them that the Palestinians \" will be broken.\" As is commonly the case, violence worked. When th ey were \"broken\" and returned to the state of samid in, concerns in the U.S. abated, as in other cases, dem onstrating again the accuracy of Evron's analysis, cited earlier. So matters proceeded through the 1990s, now withi n the framework of the \"Oslo peace process.\" In the Gaza Strip, a few thousand Jewish settlers live in luxur y, with swimming pools, fishponds, and highly succe ssful agriculture thanks to their appropriation of much o f the region's meager water resources. A million Pa lestinians barely survive in misery, imprisoned behind a wall and barred access to the sea or to Egypt, often com pelled to walk or swim around IDF barriers that serve little if any security function but do impose harsh and de grading punishment. Often they face live fire if they seek to travel within the dungeon. Gaza has become \"the penal colony\" of Israel, its \"devils island, Alcatraz,\" t he prominent columnist Nahum Barnea writes. As in Central America, conditions deteriorated st eadily through the 1990s.15 The Clinton-Barak propo sals of summer 2000 at Camp David were lavishly praised as \"magnanimous\" and \"generous,\" and it is only fair t o say that they did offer an improvement. At the time, Pa lestinians were confined to over 200 enclaves in th e West Bank, most of them tiny. Clinton and Barak magnanim ously offered to reduce the number to three cantons , effectively separated from one another and from the center of Palestinian life, culture, and communica tions in East Jerusalem. The Palestinian entity would then b ecome a \"neocolonial dependency\" that will be \"permanent,\" as Barak's Foreign Minister described the goal of the Oslo process, reiterating the obser vation of Moshe Dayan 30 years before that the occupation is \"permanent.\" On the Gaza model, a wall was being constructed in summer 2002 to imprison the populati on, with internal barriers that will be passable, i f at all, only after long periods of harassment and purposefu l humiliation of people seeking to reach hospitals, visit"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"relatives, go to school, find work, transfer produc e, or otherwise survive within the dungeon. If such measures restore the monopoly of violence and terror previou sly enjoyed by Washington's client regime, the poli cy in the West Bank too will be deemed a success. In mid-2002, the UN World Food Program requested donor support for a program to feed half a million Palestinians suffering from hunger and malnutrition , as \"growing numbers of families in the Israeli-oc cupied territories are being forced to skip meals or reduc e their food intake,\" the WFP warned, anticipating that the situation would deteriorate further as Israel preve nts free movement of goods among the eight cantons it is establishing within the \"penal colony.\"16 Like its Gaza model, the West Bank wall is to be \"semi-permeable.\" The IDF, Jewish settlers, and for eign tourists can flow freely in either direction, but n ot the \"mere things\" whose lives have \"no value\" to the rulers. As long as people whose lives have value are immu ne, the fate of their victims can be ignored. If th ey raise their heads, they must be taught lessons in obedien ce. Violence is typically the first choice, which i s why state- directed international terrorism is such a rampant plague. If that fails, other means must be consider ed. During the first Intifada even extreme supporters of Israe li terror began to call for partial withdrawal beca use of the costs to Israel. In the early days of the second In tifada, the killing of hundreds of Palestinians and large-scale collective punishment did not even impede new shipm ents of helicopters and other terror weapons, but a s the Intifada spun out of control, reaching to Israel it self, new steps were necessary. President Bush even proclaimed his \"vision\" of an eventual Palestinian state, to m uch acclaim, as he approached (from below) the stan d of South African racists 40 years earlier, who not only had a \"vision\" of Black-run states, but actually implem ented it. Just what and where the eventual state should be remained an open question. House Majority Leader Di ck Armey observed that \"there are many Arab nations\" t hat have plenty of \"soil and property and opportuni ty to create a Palestinian state,\" so that Israel should \"grab the entire West Bank\" and \"the Palestinians s hould leave.\" His counterparts point out that there are plenty of Jews in New York and Los Angeles and the richest c ountry in the world would have no problem absorbing a few mil lion more, solving the problem. At the opposite ext reme of the spectrum, Anthony Lewis lauded \"the unsentim ental old soldier\" Yitzhak Rabin, a man of \"sheer intellectual honesty\" who was willing to sign the O slo agreements. But the Israeli right wing, unlike Rabin, \"opposes any solution that would give the Palestini ans a viable state - tiny, disarmed, poor, dominate d by Israel, but their own.\" That is \"the heart of the matter,\" and if Rabin's noble vision fails, the peace proces s will die.17 Meanwhile state terror remains the approved means of control. In the first days of the Intifada, Isr ael used U.S. helicopters to attack civilian targets, killing and wounding dozens of people. Clinton responded with the biggest shipment of military helicopters in a decade, and s hipments continued as Israel began using them for p olitical assassinations and other terrorist acts. The U.S. c onsistently refused to allow international monitors , whose presence is likely to reduce violence. In December 2001, along with vetoing another Security Council resolution calling for dispatch of monitors, the Bu sh Administration took a further step to \"enhance t error\" (Arafat's crime, according to the President) by und ermining the international effort to terminate Isra el's \"grave breaches\" of the Fourth Geneva Convention. The gene ral attitude is well expressed by the President in his major political pronouncement on the Arab-Israel co nflict (June 24, 2002): the guiding principle is th at only \"leaders not compromised by terror\" will be admitte d to the U.S.-run diplomatic process. Ariel Sharon automatically meets the condition, a fact that appe ars to have aroused no comment, though some winced when the President declared him to be \"a man of peace\" - as his 50-year record of terrorist atrocities full y demonstrates. No U.S. leader can be so compromised, by definition. It is the Palestinian leaders only who must satisfy the master's demand that their violence and repression be directed solely against other two-le gged beasts, as in the past, when these practices won su pport and acclaim from the U.S.-Israel alliance thr ough the Oslo years. If they depart from that mission or los e control, they must be eliminated and replaced by more reliable puppets, preferably by elections that will be termed \"free\" if the right person wins. The basic principles concerning terror have been outlined with some candor by honest statesmen: Wins ton Churchill, for example. He informed Parliament befo re World War I that we are not a young people with an innocent record a nd a scanty inheritance. We have engrossed to ourse lves... an altogether disproportionate share of the wealth and traffic of the world. We have got all we want i n territory,"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"and our claim to be left in the unmolested enjoymen t of vast and splendid possessions, mainly acquired by violence, largely maintained by force, often seems less reasonable to others than to us. As the U.S. and Britain emerged victorious in 1 945, Churchill drew the appropriate conclusions fro m his realistic observations: the government of the world must be entrusted to sa tisfied nations, who wished nothing more for themse lves than what they had. If the world-government were in the hands of hungry nations, there would always be danger. But none of us had any reason to seek for a nything more. The peace would be kept by peoples wh o lived in their own way and were not ambitious. Our power placed us above the rest. We were like rich m en dwelling at peace within their habitations.18 Others who have gained \"vast and splendid posses sions,\" also not very politely, understand the Chur chillian principles well. The Kennedy and Reagan Administrat ions are considered to be at opposite poles of the U.S. political spectrum, but in this regard they were al ike. Both recognized the need to resort to terror t o ensure subordination to the rich men who wish to enjoy the ir possessions undisturbed. After only a few months in office, Kennedy ordered that the \"terrors of the ea rth\" must be visited upon Cuba until Fidel Castro i s eliminated. Large-scale terror continued through Ke nnedy's years in office; he approved major new terr or operations ten days before his assassination. The r easons were clear and explicit. Cubans had raised t heir heads; and worse, were providing an \"example and general s timulus\" that might \"encourage agitation and radica l change\" in other parts of Latin America, where \"soc ial and economic conditions.. . invite opposition t o ruling authority.\" It is not what Castro does that is impo rtant; rather, the Kennedy intellectuals recognized that \"the very existence of his regime . . . represents a suc cessful defiance of the U.S., a negation of our who le hemispheric policy of almost half a century,\" based on the principle of subordination to the will of t he Colossus of the North. The threat posed by Castro, Kennedy's advisors warned the incoming President, is \"the sp read of the Castro idea of taking matters into one's own ha nds,\" a grave danger when \"The distribution of land and other forms of national wealth greatly favors the p ropertied classes. . . [and] The poor and underpriv ileged, stimulated by the example of the Cuban revolution, are now demanding opportunities for a decent living .\"19 Even without the threat of a good example, \"succe ssful defiance of the U.S.\" cannot be tolerated. Quite generally, \"maintaining credibilit y\" is a leading principle of statecraft and a standard official justification for policy. If the world is suitably frightened, that is a net benefit. Reagan planners warned Europe that if they did not join Washington's \"war on terror\" with proper enthusiasm, \"the crazy Americans\" might \"tak e matters into their own hands.\" The press lauded the success of this courageous stand i n bringing European \"wimps\" into line. Clinton's Strategic Command (STRATCOM) advised that \"part of the national persona we project\" should be as an \"irrational and vindictive \" power, with some elements \"potentially 'out of control'.\" Prominent international affairs specialists have warned since the 1980s that the U.S. is perceived b y many as a \"rogue superpower\" and a serious threat to their ex istence. But that is all to the good, if it induces fear and subordination. Current policy-makers, many of them carry-overs from the Reagan years, are quite forthright in taki ng this stand. When Saudi Prince Abdullah visited the U.S. in April 2002 to urge Washington to pay some attent ion to the difficulties caused for its allies in the Arab world by its support for Israeli terror and repress ion, he was bluntly informed that his concerns did not matter: \"The idea was, if he thought we were strong in Dese rt Storm, we're ten times as strong today,\" one official said . \"This was to give him some idea what Afghanistan demonstrated about our capabilities.\" The thinking at the top level of the Department o f Defense was outlined by Jay Farrar, a former seni or DOD official who directs special projects at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a centris t Washington think tank: if the U.S. \"was firm, tough, acted wit h resolve, especially in that area of the world, th e rest of the world will come along and respect us for our toughn ess and won't mess with us.\"20"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" In short, get lost. You're either with us or agai nst us, as the President said, and if you're not wi th us you'll be pulverized. That's why we bomb countries like Afgha nistan: to give recalcitrants some idea of what we' re capable of doing if someone gets in our way. The co nsequences for terrorism are of only secondary impo rtance; in fact, U.S. intelligence concludes that bombing o f Afghanistan probably increased the threat by scat tering the al-Qaeda network and spawning others like it. Furth ermore, as noted earlier, nine months after the 9/1 1 attacks U.S. intelligence knew little about their origin, s till only \"believing\" that the idea may have been h atched in Afghanistan, though not the implementation and plan ning.21 Under prevailing norms for the rich and pow erful, that suffices to justify bombing innocent people an d to elicit eloquent pronouncements about the respe ct of our leaders for the highest principles of morality ;md international law. Indications are that the new \"war on terror\" will resemble its predecessor, and many other episodes of state terrorism that did not receive the official Orwelli an designation. Nonetheless, there are crucial diff erences. In the present case, the war was re-declared in respon se to an actual and very serious terrorist atrocity , not concocted pretexts. But institutions remain stable, and the policies that flow from them tend to take similar forms, adapted to new circumstances. One stable fea ture is the Churchillian doctrine: the rich and pow erful have every right to demand that they be left in pea ce to enjoy what they have gained, often by violenc e and terror; the rest can be ignored as long as they suf fer in silence, but if they interfere with the live s of those who rule the world by right, the \"terrors of the earth\" will be visited upon them with righteous wrath, un less power is constrained from within. The first five chapters below are concerned with the first phase of the \"war on terror,\" during the Reagan-Bush (No. 1) Administrations. The preface and the first three chapters constitute the original publication: Pirates and Emperors (Claremont, 1986). Chapter 1 is devoted to the conceptual framework in which these and relate d issues are presented within the reigning doctrinal system. Chapter 2 provides a sample - only a sample - of Middle East terrorism in the real world, along with some discussion of the style of apologetics employ ed to ensure that it proceeds unhampered. Chapter 3 turns to the role played by Libya in the doctrinal syste m during those years. Chapter 4 appears in the 1987 edition of Pirates and Emperors (Black Rose, Montreal); it is a transcript of a keynote address at the Arab Associa tion of University Graduates Convention, November 1 5, 1986. Chapter 5 (July 1989) appears in Alexander Ge orge, ed., Western State Terrorism (1991). Chapter 6 turns to the second phase of the \"war o n terror,\" re-declared after 9/11. It is based on a talk at the Conference of the American Friends Service Committe e and Tufts University's Peace and Justice Studies Program and Peace Coalition on \"After September 11: Paths to Peace, Justice and Security,\" Tufts Unive rsity, December 8, 2001. Chapter 7, like chapter 4, is con cerned with U.S. policies in the Middle East. It is the introduction to Roane Carey, The New Intifada (2001 ). Parts of chapter 1 appeared in the Utne Reader, February-March 1986, Index on Censorship (London, J uly 1986), and // Manifesto (Rome, January 30, 1986). E xcerpts from chapter 2 appear in Race & Class (Lond on, Summer 1986), and another version in Michael Sprink er, ed., Negations: Spurious Scholarship and the Palestinian Question (Verso, 1987). The chapter als o appears in Edward Said and Christopher Hitchens, eds., Blaming the Victims (Verso, 1988). Chapter 3 is a m odified and expanded version of an article in Cover t Action Information Bulletin, Summer 1986. Earlier v ersions of these articles appear in the New Statesm an (London), ENDpapers (Nottingham), El Pais (Madrid), and in Italy, Mexico, Uruguay and elsewhere. Parts of chapters 2 and 3 are also included in my paper \"Int ernational Terrorism: Image and Reality,\" delivered at the Frankfurt conference on International Terrorism, Ap ril 1986, published in Crime and Social Justice 27- 28, 1987, an issue of the journal that reviews these to pics broadly. The chapters have been edited to eliminate matter s no longer relevant, redundancies, etc. Throughout , the words \"currently,\" \"recently,\" etc. refer to the ti me of publication. I have not updated the notes to include the mass of highly relevant material after publication."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Part 1. Thought Control: The Case of the Middle Eas t (1986) From a comparative perspective, the United States i s unusual if not unique in its lack of restraints o n freedom of expression. It is also unusual in the range and eff ectiveness of the methods employed to restrain free dom of thought. The two phenomena are related. Liberal dem ocratic theorists have long observed that in a soci ety where the voice of the people is heard, elite group s must ensure that that voice says the right things . The less the state is able to employ violence in defense of the interests of elite groups that effectively domi nate it, the more it becomes necessary to devise techniques of \" manufacture of consent,\" in the words of Walter Lip pmann over 60 years ago, or \"engineering of consent,\" the phrase preferred by Edward Bernays, one of the fou nding fathers of the American Public Relations industry. In the entry on \"propaganda\" in the Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences in 1933, Harold Lasswell ex plained that we must not succumb to \"democratic dogmatisms about men being the best judges of their own intere sts.\" We must find ways to ensure that they endorse the d ecisions made by their far-sighted leaders - a less on learned long before by dominant elites, the rise of the Pub lic Relations industry being a notable illustration . Where obedience is guaranteed by violence, rulers may ten d towards a \"behaviorist\" conception: it is enough that people obey; what they think does not matter too mu ch. Where the state lacks adequate means of coercio n, it is important to control what people think as well.1 The attitude is common among intellectuals across the political spectrum, and is regularly maintaine d when they shift across this spectrum as circumstances di ctate. A version was expressed by the highly respec ted moralist and political commentator Reinhold Niebuhr when he wrote in 1932 - then from a Christian left perspective - that given \"the stupidity of the aver age man,\" it is the responsibility of \"cool observe rs\" to provide the \"necessary illusion\" that provides the faith th at must be instilled in the minds of the less endow ed.2 The doctrine is also familiar in its Leninist version, as in American social science and liberal commentar y generally. Consider the bombing of Libya in April 1986. We rea d without surprise that it was a public relations s uccess in the United States. It \"is playing well in Peoria\" a nd its \"positive political impact\" should \"strength en President Reagan's hand in dealing with Congress on issues li ke the military budget and aid to Nicaraguan 'Contr as'.\" \"This sort of public education campaign is the esse nce of statecraft,\" according to Dr Everett Ladd, a leading academic public opinion specialist, who added that a president \"must be engaged in the engineering of democratic consent,\" the inspired Orwellism common in public relations and academic circles to refer t o the methods for undermining meaningful democratic parti cipation in shaping public policy.3 The problem of \"engineering democratic consent\" a rises in a particularly sharp form when state polic y is indefensible, and becomes serious to the extent tha t the issues are serious. There is no doubt about t he seriousness of the issues arising in the Middle Eas t, particularly the Arab-Israeli conflict, which is commonly - and plausibly - judged the most likely \"tinderbox\" that might set off a terminal nuclear war as region al conflict engages the superpowers, as has come too close for comfort in the past. Furthermore, U.S. policy has contributed materially to maintaining the state of military confrontation and is based on implicit rac ist assumptions that would not be tolerated if stated o penly. There is also a marked divergence between po pular attitudes, generally supportive of a Palestinian st ate when the question is raised in polls, and state policy, which explicitly bars this option,4 though the divergence is of little moment as long as the politically act ive and articulate elements of the population maintain prop er discipline. To assure this outcome, it is necess ary to conduct what American historians called \"historical engineering\" when they lent their talents to the W ilson Administration during World War I in one of the ear ly exercises of organized \"manufacture of consent.\" There is a variety of ways in which this result is achiev ed. One meihod is to devise an appropriate form of N ewspeak in which crucial terms have a technical sen se, divorced from their ordinary meanings. Consider, fo r example, the term \"peace process.\" In its technic al sense, as used in the mass media and scholarship generally in the United States, it refers to peace proposals advanced by the U.S. government. Right-thinking people hope that Jordan will join the peace process; that is, w ill accept U.S. dictates. The Big Question is whether the PLO will agree to join the peace process, or can be gra nted admission to this ceremony. The headline of a revie w of the \"peace process\" by Bernard Gwertzman in th e New York Times reads: \"Are the Palestinians Ready to Se ek Peace?\"5 In the normal sense of the term \"peace, \" the answer is of course \"Yes.\" Everyone seeks peace, on their own terms; Hitler, for example, surely sough t peace in 1939, on his terms. But in the system of thought control, the question means something else: Are th e"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Palestinians ready to accept U.S. terms for peace? These terms happen to deny them the right of nation al self- determination, but unwillingness to accept this con sequence demonstrates that the Palestinians do not seek peace, in the technical sense. Note that it is unnecessary for Gwertzman to ask whether the United States or Israel is \"ready to se ek peace.\" For the U.S., this is true by definition, and the c onventions of responsible journalism entail that th e same must be true for a well-behaved client-state. Gwertzman asserts further that the PLO has always rejected \"any talk of negotiated peace with Israel .\" That is false, but it is true in the world of \"necessary il lusion\" constructed by the Newspaper of Record, whi ch, along with other responsible journals, has either suppres sed the relevant facts or relegated them to Orwell' s useful memory hole. Of course, there are Arab peace proposals, inclu ding PLO proposals, but they are not part of the \"p eace process.\" Thus, in a review of \"Two Decades of Seek ing Peace in the Middle East,\" Times Jerusalem correspondent Thomas Friedman excludes the major Ar ab (including PLO) peace proposals; no Israeli proposals are listed, because no serious ones have been advanced, a fact not discussed.6 What is the character of the official \"peace proc ess\" and the Arab proposals that are excluded from it? Before answering this question, we must clarify another te chnical term: \"rejectionism.\" In its Orwellian usag e, this term refers exclusively to the position of Arabs wh o deny the right of national self-determination to Israeli Jews, or who refuse to accept Israel's \"right to ex ist,\" a novel and ingenious concept designed to bar Palestinians from the \"peace process\" by demonstrat ing the \"extremism\" of those who refuse to concede the justice of what they see as the robbery of their ho meland, and who insist upon the traditional view - the view adopted by the reigning ideological system in the U nited States as well as prevailing international pr actice with regard to every state apart from Israel - that whil e states are recognized within the international or der, their abstract \"right to exist\" is not. There are elements in the Arab world to which the term \"rejec-tionist\" applies: Libya, the minority Rejection Front of the PLO, and others. But it should not esc ape notice that in official Newspeak, the term is u sed in a strictly racist sense. Abandoning such assumptions, we observe that there are two groups that claim th e right of national self-determination in the former Palestine : the indigenous population and the Jewish settlers who largely displaced them, at times with considerable violence. Presumably, the indigenous population hav e rights comparable to those of the Jewish immigrants (some might argue that this does not go far enough, but I put that issue to the side). If so, then the term \"rejection ism\" should be used to refer to denial of the right of national self-determination to one or the other of the compe ting national groups. But the term cannot be used i n its non- racist sense within the U.S. doctrinal system, or i t will be seen at once that the U.S. and Israel lea d the rejectionist camp. With these clarifications, we can turn to the que stion: what is the \"peace process\"? The official \"peace process\" is explicitly reject ionist, including the United States and both major political groupings in Israel. Their rejectionism is, in fact , so extreme that the Palestinians are not even to be permitted to select their own representatives in eventual negoti ations about their fate - just as they are denied m unicipal elections or other democratic forms under the Israe li military occupation. Is there a non-rejectionist peace proposal on the agenda? In the U.S. doctrinal syste m, the answer is of course \"No,\" by definition. In the real world, matters are different. The basic terms of th is proposal are familiar, reflecting a broad intern ational consensus: they include a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip alongside Israel and the p rinciple that \"it is essential to ensure the security and so vereignty of all states of the region including tho se of Israel.\" The quoted words are those of Leonid Brezhnev in an address to the Soviet Communist Party Congress o f February 1981, expressing the consistent Soviet pos ition. Brezhnev's speech was excerpted in the New Y ork Times with these crucial segments omitted; cuts in a Reagan post-summit statement in Pravda evoked muc h justified indignation. In April 1981, Brezhnev's st atement was unanimously endorsed by the PLO, but th e fact was not reported in the Times. Official doctrine ho lds that the Soviet Union, as always, is concerned only to"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"cause trouble and block peace, and thus supports Ar ab rejectionism and extremism. The media dutifully fulfill their assigned role. One might cite other examples. In October 1977, a joint Carter-Brezhnev statement called for the \"termination of the state of war and establishment of normal peaceful relations\" between Israel and it s neighbors. This was endorsed by the PLO, and withdr awn by (:arter after a furious reaction by Israel a nd its American lobby. In January 1976, Jordan, Syria and Egypt supported a proposal for a two-state settleme nt debated by the Security Council of the United Natio ns. The resolution incorporated the essential wordi ng of UN 242, the core document of relevant diplomacy, guara nteeing the right of every state in the region \"to live in peace within secure and recognized borders.\" The pr oposal was endorsed by the PLO; according to Israel 's President Chaim Herzog (then UN Ambassador), it was \"prepared\" by the PLO. It was backed by virtually the entire world, and vetoed by the United States.7 Much of this has been eliminated from history, in journalism and scholarship. The 1976 international initiative is not even mentioned in the unusually careful revi ew by Seth Tillman in his book The United States an d the Middle East (Indiana, 1982). It is mentioned by Ste ven Spiegel in his The Other Arab-Israeli Conflict (Chicago, 1985, p. 306), a highly regarded work of scholarshi p, along with some interesting commentary. Spiegel writes that the U.S. \"vetoed the pro-Palestinian resolutio n\" so as \"to demonstrate that the United States was willing to hear Palestinian aspirations but would not accede t o demands that threatened Israel.\" The commitment t o U.S.- Israeli rejectionism could hardly be clearer, and i s accepted as quite proper in the United States, al ong with the principle that demands that threaten the Palestinia ns are entirely legitimate, indeed praiseworthy: th e terms of the official \"peace process,\" for example. In publi c discussion, it is a matter of doctrine that the A rab states and the PLO have never veered from their refusal to com e to terms with Israel in any fashion, apart from S adat, with his trip to Jerusalem in 1977. Facts need be n o embarrassment, or even mild annoyance, to a well- functioning system of \"historical engineering.\" Israel's reaction to the 1976 peace proposal back ed by the PLO and the Arab \"confrontation states\" w as to bomb Lebanon (without a pretense of \"retaliation,\" except against the UN Security Council), killing ov er 50 people, and to announce that Israel would enter int o no dealings with any Palestinians on any politica l issue. This was the dovish Labor government headed by Yitz hak Rabin, who, in his memoirs, identifies two form s of \"extremism\": that of the Begin government, and the proposal of \"the Palestinian extremists (basically the PLO),\" namely, \"to create a sovereign Palestinian s tate in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\" Only the Labor Party style of rejectionism departs from \"extremism ,\" a point of view shared by American commentators. 8 We note another pair of Newspeak concepts: \"extre mist\" and \"moderate,\" the latter referring to those who accept the position of the United States, the forme r to those who do not. The American position is thu s by definition moderate, as is that of the Israeli Labo r coalition (generally), since its rhetoric tends t o approximate that of the United States. Rabin thus conforms to a pproved practice in his use of the terms \"moderate\" and \"extremist.\" Similarly, in an anguished review of \" extremism\" and its ascendance, New York Times Israe l correspondent Thomas Friedman includes under this r ubric those who advocate a non-racist settlement in accord with the international consensus, while the Western leaders of the rejectionist camp, who also hold a commanding lead in terrorist operations, are the \"m oderates\"; by definition, one might add. Friedman w rites that \"Extremists have always been much better at ex ploiting the media.\" He is quite right; Israel and the U.S. have shown unparalleled mastery of this art, as his own articles and news reports indicate.9 His conve nient version of history and the conceptual framework of his reporting, as just illustrated, provide a few o f the many examples of the success of extremists in \"exploitin g the media\" - now using the term in its literal se nse. In adopting a conceptual framework designed to ex clude comprehension of the facts and issues, the Ti mes follows the practice of Israeli models such as Rabi n, who achieve the status of \"moderates\" by virtue of their general conformity to U.S. government demands. It i s, correspondingly, entirely natural that when Frie dman reviews \"Two Decades of Seeking Peace in the Mideas t,\" major proposals rejected by the U.S. and Israel are omitted as inappropriate for the historical record. Meanwhile the Israeli leaders are praised by the T imes editors for their \"healthy pragmatism\" while the PLO is den ounced for standing in the way of peace.10"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" It is, incidentally, a staple of the ideological system that the media are highly critical of Israel and the U.S. and are far too forthcoming in their tolerance of Arab extremists. The fact that such statements can even be made without evoking ridicule is another sign of the ext raordinary successes of the system of indoctrinatio n. Returning to the official \"extremists,\" in April- May 1984, Yasser Arafat issued a series of statemen ts calling for negotiations leading to mutual recognition. The national press refused to publish the facts; the T imes even banned letters referring to them, while continuing to denounce the \"extremist\" Arafat for blocking a p eaceful settlement.11 These and many other examples illustrate that the re are non-rejectionist proposals that are widely s upported; with some variations, by most of Europe, the USSR, the non-aligned states, the major Arab states and t he mainstream of the PLO, and a majority of American p ublic opinion (to judge by the few existing polls). But they are not part of the peace process because the U.S. government opposes them. The examples cited ar e thus excluded from the Times review of \"Two Decades of S eeking Peace,\" and from the journalistic and even scholarly literature fairly generally. There are other incidents that do not qualify as part of the peace process. Thus, the Times review d oes not mention Anwar Sadat's offer of a full peace treaty on the internationally recognized borders - in acco rd with official U.S. policy at the time - in February 1971 , rejected by Israel with U.S. backing. Note that t his proposal was rejectionist in that it offered nothing to the Palestinians. In his memoirs, Henry Kissinger expla ins his thinking at that time: \"Until some Arab state showe d a willingness to separate from the Soviets, or th e Soviets were prepared to dissociate from the maximum Arab p rogram, we had no reason to modify our policy\" of \"stalemate.\" The USSR was extremist, in the technic al sense, supporting what happened to be official ( though not operative) U.S. policy, which was remote from \" the maximum Arab program.\" Kissinger was right to s ay that such Arab states as Saudi Arabia refused to \"s eparate from the Soviets,\" though he did not observ e, and appears to have been unaware, that this would have been a logical impossibility: Saudi Arabia did not even have diplomatic relations with the USSR and never h ad. The impressive discipline of the media and scho larship is revealed by the fact that these astonishing stat ements escape comment, just as no responsible comme ntator is likely to point out that Kissinger's blissful ignor ance and insistence on military confrontation were primary factors that led to the 1973 war.12 Sadat's peace offer has been expunged from the hi storical record.13 The standard story is that Sadat was a typical Arab thug, interested only in killing Jews, though he saw the error of his ways after his fail ed attempt to destroy Israel in 1973 and, under the kindly tutela ge of Kissinger and Carter, became a man of peace. Thus in its two-page obituary after Sadat's assassination, the Times not only suppresses the actual facts but explicitly denies them, stating that until his 1977 trip to Je rusalem, Sadat was unwilling \"to accept Israel's ex istence as a sovereign state.\"14 Newsweek refused even to print a letter correcting outright falsehoods on this mat ter by their columnist George Will, though the research de partment privately conceded the facts. The practice is standard. The terms \"terrorism\" and \"retaliation\" also have a special sense within the doctrinal system. \"Terr orism\" refers to terrorist acts by various pirates, partic ularly Arabs. Terrorist acts by the emperor and his clients are termed \"retaliation\" or perhaps \"legitimate preempt ive strikes to avert terrorism,\" quite independentl y of the facts, as will be discussed in the following chapte rs. The term \"hostage\" -like \"terrorism,\" \"moderate,\" \"democratic,\" and other terms of political discour se - also has a technical Orwellian sense within the reigning doctrinal system. In the dictionary sense of the w ords, the people of Nicaragua are now being held hostage in a major terrorist operation directed from the center s of international terrorism in Washington and Miami. Th e purpose of this campaign of international terrori sm is to induce changes in the behavior of the Nicaraguan go vernment: crucially, an end to programs that direct resources to the poor majority and a return to \"mod erate\" and \"democratic\" policies that favor U.S. bu siness interests and their local associates. A powerful ca se can be made that this is the central reason for the U.S.-run terrorist war against Nicaragua, a case that is not rejected but is rather not open for discussion.15 This is a particularly sadistic exercise in terrorism, not on ly because of the scale and the purpose, but also b ecause of the means employed, which go well beyond the usual prac tice of the retail terrorists whose exploits arouse such horror in civilized circles: Leon Klinghoffer and N atasha Simpson were murdered by terrorists, but not first"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"subjected to brutal torture, mutilation, rape, and the other standard practices of the terrorists trai ned and supported by the U.S. and its clients, as the recor d, generally evaded, makes abundantly clear. U.S. p olicy is to ensure that the terrorist attacks continue until th e government yields or is overthrown, while the emp eror's minions utter soothing words about \"democracy\" and \"human rights.\" In the preferred technical usage, the terms \"terr orism\" and \"hostage\" are restricted to a certain cl ass of terrorist acts: the terrorism of the pirate, directed against those who regard terrorism and the holding of host ages on a grand scale as their prerogative. In the Middle Eas t, murderous bombing, piracy, hostage-taking, attac ks on defenseless villages, etc., do not fall under the c oncept of terrorism, as properly construed within t he doctrinal system, when conducted by Washington or its Israeli client. The record of deceit concerning terrorism, to whi ch I will turn in I lie chapters that follow, is hi ghly instructive with regard to the nature of Western cu lture. The relevant point in the present context is that a proper history and appropriate form of discourse have been contrived in which terrorism is the province of Palestinians, while Israelis carry out \"retaliation ,\" or sometimes legitimate \"preemption,\" occasional ly reacting with regrettable harshness, as any state would do u nder such trying circumstances. The doctrinal syste m is designed to ensure that these conclusions are true by definition, regardless of the facts, which are e ither not reported, or reported in such a manner as to confor m to doctrinal necessities, or - occasionally - reported honestly but then dispatc hed to the memory hole. Given that Israel is a loya l and very useful client-state, serving as a \"strategic asset\" in the Middle East and willing to undertake such t asks as support for near-genocide in Guatemala when the U.S . Administration is prevented by Congress from join ing in this necessary exercise, it becomes true, irrespect ive of the facts, that Israel is dedicated to the h ighest moral values and \"purity of arms\" while the Palestinians are the very epitome of extremism, terrorism and ba rbarity. The suggestion that there might be a certain symmet ry both in rights and in terrorist practice is dism issed with outrage in the mainstream - or would be, if the wor ds could be heard. - as barely disguised anti-Semitism. A rational ass essment, giving an accurate portrayal and analysis of the scale and purposes of the terrorism of the emperor and the pirate, is excluded a priori, and would ind eed be barely comprehensible, so remote would it be from r eceived orthodoxies. Israel's services to the U.S. as a \"strategic ass et\" in the Middle East and elsewhere help explain t he dedication of the United States, since Kissinger's takeover of Middle East policy-making in the early 1970s, to m aintaining the military confrontation and Kissingerian \"stalem ate.\"16 If the U.S. were to permit a peaceful settl ement in accord with the international consensus, Israel wou ld gradually be incorporated into the region and th e U.S. would lose the services of a valuable mercenary sta te, militarily competent and technologically advanc ed, a pariah state, utterly dependent upon the U.S. for i ts economic and military survival and hence dependa ble, available for service where needed. Elements of the so-called \"Israeli lobby\" also ha ve a stake in maintaining the military confrontatio n, as the prominent Israeli journalist Danny Rubinstein learn ed on a visit to the United States in 1983.17 In me etings with representatives of the major Jewish organizati ons (B'nai Brith, Anti-Defamation League, World Jew ish Congress, Hadassah, Rabbis of all denominations, et c.), Rubinstein found that his presentations on the current situation in Israel aroused considerable hostility because he stressed the fact that Israel did not fa ce military dangers so much as \"political, social and moral des truction\" resulting from its takeover of the occupi ed territories. \"I am not interested,\" one functionary told him; \"I can't do anything with such an argume nt.\" The point, Rubinstein discovered in many such interchan ges, is that according to most of the people in the Jewish establishment the important thing is to stress agai n and again the external dangers that face Israel . . . the Jewish establishment in America needs Israel only as a vic tim of a cruel Arab attack. For such an Israel one can get support, donors and money. How can one raise money for fighting a demographic danger? Who will give ev en a single dollar to fight what I call 'the danger of annexation'?. . . Everybody knows the official tal ly of the contributions collected by the United Jewish Appeal in America, where the name of Israel is used and a bout half of the sum does not go to Israel but to the Je wish institutions in America. Is there a greater cy nicism? Rubinstein goes on to observe that the Appeal, whic h is managed as a tough and efficient business, has a common language with the hawkish positions in Israe l. On the other hand, the attempt to communicate wi th"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Arabs, the striving for mutual recognition with the Palestinians, the moderate, dovish positions all w ork against the business of collecting contributions. They not only reduce the sum of money that is transferred to Israel. More to the point, they reduce the amount of money that is available for financing the activities of t he Jewish communities. Observers of the regular activities of the though t police of the Israeli lobby, keen to detect the s lightest hint of a suggestion about reconciliation and a meaningful political settlement and to demolish this heresy wi th furious articles and letters to the press, circulation of f abricated defamatory material concerning the hereti cs, etc., will know just what Rubinstein was encountering. Rubinstein's comments bring to our attention yet another Orwellism: the term \"supporters of Israel, \" used conventionally to refer to those who are not troubl ed by \"the political, social and moral destruction\" of Israel (and in the longer term, very possibly its physical destruction as well), and indeed contribute to the se consequences by the \"blindly chauvinistic and narro w-minded\" support they offer to Israel's \"posture o f calloused intransigence,\" as Israeli doves have oft en warned.18 A similar view was reiterated by Israeli militar y historian Col. (ret.) Meir Pail, who condemns the \"idolatrous cult-worship of a Jewish fortress-state\" on the par t of the American Jewish community, warning that by their rejectionism they \"have transformed the State of Is rael into a war-god similar to Mars,\" a state that will be \"a complex compound of the racist state structure of S outh Africa and the violent, terror-ridden social f abric of Northern Ireland,\" \"an original contribution to the annals of 21st century political science: a unique kind of Jewish state that will be a cause for shame for eve ry Jew wherever he may be, not only in the present, but in the future as well.\"19 In the same connection, we may observe the inter esting way in which the term \"Zionism\" is tacitly d efined by those who take on the role of guardians of doctrina l purity. My own views, for example, are regularly condemned as \"militant anti-Zionism\" by people who are well aware of these views, repeatedly and clear ly expressed: that Israel within its internationally r ecognized borders should be accorded the rights of any state in the international system, no more, no less, and tha t in every state, including Israel, discriminatory structures that in law and in practice assign a special status to o ne category of citizens (Jews, Whites, Christians, etc.), granting them rights denied to others, should be di smantled. I will not enter here into the question o f what should properly be called \"Zionism,\" but merely not e what follows from designation of these views as \" militant anti-Zionism\": Zionism is thereby conceived as the doctrine that Israel must be accorded rights beyond those of any other state; it must maintain control of occupi ed territories, thus barring any meaningful form of self- determination for Palestinians; and it must remain a state based on the principle of discrimination ag ainst non- Jewish citizens. It is perhaps of some interest tha t those who declare themselves \"supporters of Israe l\" insist on the validity of the notorious UN resolution declari ng Zionism to be racist. These questions are not merely abstract and theor etical. The problem of discrimination is severe in Israel, where, for example, over 90 percent of the land is placed, by complex law and administrative practice, under the control of an organization devoted to the inter ests of \"persons of Jewish religion, race or origin ,\" so that non-Jewish citizens are effectively excluded. The c ommitment to discriminatory practice is so profound that the issue cannot even be addressed in Parliament, where new laws bar presentation of any bill that \"negate s the existence of the State of Israel as the state of th e Jewish people.\" The legislation thus eliminates a s illegal any parliamentary challenge to the discriminatory chara cter of the state and effectively bars political pa rties committed to the democratic principle that a state is the state of its citizens.20 It is remarkable that the Israeli press and most of educated opinion appear to have perceived nothi ng strange about the fact that this new legislation was couple d with an \"anti-racism\" bill (the four opposing vot es, in fact, were against this aspect of the measure). The Jerus alem Post headline reads: \"Knesset forbids racist a nd anti- Zionist bills\" - without irony, the term \"Zionist\" being interpreted as in the new legislation. Reader s of the Jerusalem Post in the U.S. apparently also found no thing noteworthy in this conjunction, just as they have found no difficulty in reconciling the deeply anti- democratic character of their version of Zionism wi th enthusiastic acclaim for the democratic character o f the state in which it is realized."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" No less remarkable are the ingenious uses of the concept \"anti-Semitism,\" for example, to refer to those who exhibit \"the anti-imperialism of fools\" (a variety of anti-Semitism) by objecting to Israel's role in the Third World in the service of U.S. power - in Guatemala, for example; or to Palestinians who refuse to under stand that their problem can be overcome by \"resettlement and some repatriation.\" lithe remnants of the vill age of Doueimah, where perhaps hundreds were slaughtered b y the Israeli Army in a land-clearing operation in 1948, or residents of the Soweto-like Gaza Strip object t o resettlement and \"repatriation,\" that proves that they are inspired by anti-Semitism.21 One would have to desc end to the annals of Stalinism to find something si milar, but comparable examples in educated discourse in th e United States with regard to Israel are not rare, and pass unnoticed in the U.S., though Israeli doves have no t failed to perceive, and to condemn, the shameful performances. The central device of the system of \"brainwash ing under freedom,\" developed in a most impressive fashion in the country that is perhaps the most free, is to encourage debate over policy issues but within a f ramework of presuppositions that incorporate the basic doctrine s of the party line. The more vigorous the debate, the more effectively these presuppositions are instilled, wh ile participants and onlookers are overcome with aw e and self- adulation for their courage. Thus in the case of th e Vietnam war, the ideological institutions permitt ed a debate between \"hawks\" and \"doves\"; in fact, the debate wa s not only permitted, but even encouraged by 1968, when substantial sectors of American business had turned against the war as too costly and harmful to their interests. The hawks held that with firmness and dedication th e United States could succeed in its \"defense of So uth Vietnam against Communist aggression.\" The doves co untered by questioning the feasibility of this nobl e effort, or deplored the excessive use of force and violence in pursuing it. Or they bewailed the \"erro rs\" and \"misunderstandings\" that misled us in our \"excess o f righteousness and disinterested benevolence\" (Har vard historian John King Fairbank, the dean of U.S. Asia n studies and a noted academic dove) and \"blunderin g efforts to do good\" (Anthony Lewis, probably the le ading media dove). Or sometimes, at the outer reach es of the doctrinal system, they asked whether indeed Nor th Vietnam and the Viet Cong were guilty of aggress ion; perhaps, they suggest, the charge is exaggerated. T he central fact about the war, plainly enough, is t hat the U.S. was not defending the country that \"was essentially the creation of the United States.\"22 Rather, it w as attacking the country, surely from 1962, when the U .S. air force began to participate in bombing South Vietnam, and chemical warfare (defoliation and crop destruction) was initiated as part of the effort t o drive millions of people into camps where they could be \" protected\" from the South Vietnamese guerrillas the y were willingly supporting (as the U.S. government privat ely conceded), after the U.S. had undermined any possibility of political settlement and had install ed a client regime that had already killed tens of thousands of South Vietnamese. Throughout the war, the major U.S . assault was against South Vietnam, and it succeed ed, by the late 1960s, in destroying the South Vietnamese resistance while spreading the war to the rest of I ndochina. When the USSR attacks Afghanistan, we can perceive that this is aggression; when the U.S. attacks Sout h Vietnam, it is \"defense\" - defense against \"interna l aggression,\" as Adlai Stevenson proclaimed at the United Nations in 1964; against the \"assault from the insi de,\" in President Kennedy's words. That the U.S. was engaged in an attack against So uth Vietnam is not denied; rather, the thought cann ot be expressed or even imagined. One will find no hint o f such an event as \"the U.S. attack against South V ietnam\" in mainstream media or scholarship, or even in most of the publications of the peace movement.23 There are few more striking illustrations of the power of the system of thought control under freedo m than the debate that took place over North Vietnamese aggres sion and whether the U.S. had the right under inter national law to combat it in \"collective self-defense agains t armed attack.\" Learned tomes were written advocat ing the opposing positions, and in less exalted terms, the debate was pursued in the public arena opened by th e peace movement. The achievement is impressive: as long as debate is focused on the question of whether the Vietnamese are guilty of aggression in Vietnam, the re can be no discussion of whether the U.S. aggress ion against South Vietnam was indeed what it plainly wa s. As one who took part in this debate, with comple te awareness of what was happening, I can only report that opponents of state violence are trapped, enmes hed in a propaganda system of awesome effectiveness. It was necessary for critics of the U.S. war in Vietnam to become experts in the intricacies of Indochinese affairs; largely an irrelevance, since the issue, always avo ided, was U.S. affairs, just as we need not become specialist s in Afghanistan to oppose Soviet aggression there. It was necessary, throughout, to enter the arena of debate on the terms set by the state and the elite opinio n that serves it, however one might understand that by doing so, one is making a further contribution to the system of"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"indoctrination. The alternative is to tell the simp le truth, which would be equivalent to speaking in some foreign tongue. Much the same is true of the current debate over Central America. The U.S. terrorist war in El Salva dor is not a topic for discussion among respectable people; it does not exist. The U.S. effort to \"contain\" Nicar agua is a permissible subject of debate, but within narrow li mits. We may ask whether it is right to use force t o \"cut out the cancer\" (Secretary of State George Shultz) and prevent the Sandinistas from exporting their \"revol ution without borders,\" a fanciful construction of the st ate propaganda system, known to be a fabrication by journalists and other commentators who adopt the rh etoric. But we may not discuss the idea that \"the c ancer\" that must be excised is \"the threat of a good examp le,\" which might spread \"contagion\" through the reg ion and beyond - a fact sometimes obliquely conceded, as wh en Administration officials explain that the U.S. p roxy army has succeeded in \"forcing [the Sandinistas] to divert scarce resources to the war and away from s ocial programs.\"24 In the first three months of 1986, when debate w as intensifying over the impending Congressional vo tes on aid to the U.S. proxy army (as its most enthusiasti c supporters privately describe it) attacking Nicar agua from its Honduran and Costa Rican bases, the national pr ess (New York Times and Washington Post) ran 85 opi nion pieces by columnists and invited contributors on U. S. policy toward Nicaragua. All were critical of th e Sandinistas, ranging from bitterly critical (the va st majority) to moderately so. That is what is call ed \"public debate.\" The unquestioned fact that the Sandinista government had carried out successful social reform s during the early years, before the U.S. war aborted these efforts, was close to unmentionable; in 85 columns, there were two phrases referring to the fact that there h ad been such social reforms, and the idea that this is the basic reason for the U.S. attack - hardly a great secret -was unmentionable. Alleged \"apologists\" for the Sandinistas were har shly denounced (anonymously, to ensure that they wo uld have no opportunity to respond, minimal as that pos sibility would be in any event), but none of these criminals were permitted to express their views. There was no reference to the conclusion of Oxfam that Nicaragu a was \"exceptional\" among the 76 developing countries in which it worked in the commitment of the political leadership \"to improving the condition of the peopl e and encouraging their active participation in the development process,\" and that among the four Centr al American countries where Oxfam worked, \"only in Nicaragua has a substantial effort been made to add ress inequities in landownership and to extend heal th, educational, and agricultural services to poor peas ant families,\" though the Contra war terminated the se threats and caused Oxfam to shift its efforts from developm ent projects to war relief. It is scarcely conceiva ble that the national press would permit discussion of the sugge stion that the dedicated U.S. effort to excise this \"cancer\" falls strictly within its historical vocation. Deba te may proceed over the proper method for combating this vicious outpost of the Evil Empire, but may not pas s beyond these permitted bounds in a national forum .25 In a dictatorship or military-run \"democracy,\" th e party line is clear, overt and explicit, either a nnounced by the Ministry of Truth or made apparent in other way s. And it must be publicly obeyed; the cost of diso bedience may range from prison and exile under terrible cond itions, as in the USSR and its East European satell ites, to hideous torture, rape, mutilation and mass slaughte r, as in a typical U.S. dependency such as El Salva dor. In a free society, these devices are not available and m ore subtle means are used. The party line is not en unciated, but is rather presupposed. Those who do not accept it are not imprisoned or deposited in ditches after torture and mutilation, but the population is protected fro m their heresies. Within the mainstream, it is bare ly possible even to understand their words on the rare occasion s when such exotic discourse can be heard. In the m edieval period, it was considered necessary to take heresy seriously, to understand it and combat it by ration al argument. Today, it suffices to point to it. A whol e battery of concepts have been concocted - \"moral equivalence,\" \"Marxist,\" \"radical,\". . . - to ident ify heresy, and thus to dismiss it without further argument or comment. These dangerous and virtually inexpressibl e doctrines even become \"new orthodoxies\"26 to be combated (more accurately, identified and dismissed with horror) by the embattled minority who dominat e public expression to something close to totality. B ut for the most part heresy is simply ignored, whil e debate rages over narrow and generally marginal issues amo ng those who accept the doctrines of the faith. Very much the same is true when we turn to our pr esent topic, the Middle East. We may debate whether the Palestinians should be permitted to enter \"the peac e process,\" but we must not be permitted to underst and that the U.S. and Israel lead the rejectionist camp and have consistently blocked any authentic \"peace proc ess,\""},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"often with substantial violence. With regard to ter rorism, a critical scholar warns that we should ref rain from \"oversimplification\" and should \"examine the social and ideological roots of current Middle Eastern an d Islamic radicalism,\" which raises \"intractable but nevertheless real problems\"; we should seek to unde rstand what leads the terrorists to pursue their evil ways .27 The debate over terrorism, then, is neatly dema rcated: at one extreme, we have those who see it as simply a c onspiracy by the Evil Empire and its agents; and at the other extreme, we find more balanced thinkers who a void this \"oversimplification\" and go on to investi gate the domestic roots of Arab and Islamic terror. The idea that there may be other sources of terrorism in th e Middle East - that the emperor and his clients may also ha ve a hand in the drama - is excluded a priori; it i s not denied, but is unthinkable, a considerable achievement. Throughout, the moderates, the liberal doves, pla y a prominent role in ensuring the proper functioni ng of the indoctrination system, by setting firmly the bounds of thinkable thought. In his Journal, Henry David Thoreau, who explaine d elsewhere that he wastes no time reading newspape rs, wrote: There is no need of a law to check the license of t he press. It is law enough, and more than enough, t o itself. Virtually, the community have come together and agr eed what things shall be uttered, have agreed on a platform and to excommunicate him who departs from it, and not one in a thousand dares utter anything else. His statement is not quite accurate. Philosopher John Dolan observes: it \"is not that people will la ck the courage to express thoughts outside the permitted r ange: it is, rather, that they will be deprived of the capacity to think such thoughts.\"28 That is the essential po int, the driving motive of the \"engineers of democr atic consent.\" In the New York Times, Walter Reich of the Woodro w Wilson International Center, referring to the Ach ille Lauro hijacking, demands that strict standards of j ustice be applied to people who have \"committed ter rorist murder,\" both the agents and planners of these acts : To mete out lesser punishment on the grounds that a terrorist believes himself to be a deprived, aggri eved freedom fighter undermines the ground on which just ice stands by accepting terrorists' argument that o nly their concepts of justice and rights, and their suffering s, are valid . . . The Palestinians - and any of th e many groups using terrorism to satisfy grievances - should scut tle terror and find other ways, inevitably involvin g compromise, to achieve their goals. And the Western democracies must reject the argument that any excu se - even one involving a background of deprivation - ca n 'attenuate' responsibility for terrorism against innocents. Noble words, which could be taken seriously if the stern injunction to carry out harsh punitive action were applied to oneself, to the emperor and his clients; if not, these strictures have all the merit of no less high- minded phrases produced by the World Peace Council and other Communist front organizations with regard to atrocities of the Afghan resistance. Mark Heller, deputy director of the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University, expl ains that \"State-sponsored terrorism is low-intensity warfare , and its victims, including the United States, are therefore entitled to fight back with every means at their di sposal.\" It follows, then, that other victims of \"l ow-intensity warfare\" and \"state-sponsored terrorism\" are \"entit led to fight back with every means at their disposa l\": Salvadorans, Nicaraguans, Palestinians, Lebanese, a nd innumerable other victims of the emperor and his clients throughout a good part of the world.29 It is true that these consequences follow only if we accept an elementary moral principle: that we a pply to ourselves the same standards we apply to others (an d if serious, even stricter ones). But that princip le, and what follows from adopting it, is scarcely comprehensibl e in the prevailing intellectual culture, and would hardly be expressible in the journals that demand stern punis hment of others for their crimes. In fact, were any one to draw the logical consequences of these dicta and express them clearly, they might well be subject to prosec ution for inciting terrorist violence against political leade rs of the United States and its allies."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" The most skeptical voices in the U.S. agree that \"Colonel Qaddafi's open support of terrorism is a b latant evil,\" and \"There is no reason to let murderers go unpunis hed if you know their author [sic].

There is agonized debate in the media over whethe r it is proper to permit the pirates and thieves to express their demands and perceptions. NBC, for example, wa s bitterly condemned for running an interview with the man accused of planning the Achille Lauro hijacking , thus serving the interests of terrorists by allow ing them free expression without rebuttal, a shameful depart ure from the uniformity demanded in a properly func tioning free society. Should the media permit Ronald Reagan , George Shultz, Menachem Begin, Shimon Peres, and other voices of the emperor and his court to speak without rebuttal, advocating \"low-intensity warfare \" and \"retaliation\" or \"preemption\"? Are they thereby per mitting terrorist commanders free expression, thus serving as agents of wholesale terrorism? The question cann ot be asked, and if raised, could only be dismissed with distaste or horror.

Middle East Terrorism and the American Ideo logical System (1986) On October 17, 1985, President Reagan met in Washin gton with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who told him that Israel was prepared to take \"bold steps\" i n the Middle East and extend \"the hand of peace\" to Jordan. \"Mr. Peres's visit comes at a moment of unusual Ame rican-Israeli harmony,\" David Shipler commented in the Times, quoting a State Department official who desc ribed U.S. relations with Israel as \"extraordinaril y close and strong.\" Peres was warmly welcomed as a man of peace, and commended for his forthright commitment to \"bear the cost of peace in preference to the price of war,\" in his words. The President said that he a nd Mr Peres discussed \"the evil scourge of terrorism, which has claimed so many Israeli, American and Arab victims and brought tragedy to many others,\" adding that \"We ag reed that terrorism must not blunt our efforts to a chieve peace in the Middle East.\"1 It would require the talents of a Jonathan Swift to do justice to this exchange between two of the world's leading terrorist commanders, whose shared concepti on of \"peace,\" furthermore, excludes entirely one o f the two groups that claim the right of national self-de termination in the former Palestine: the indigenous population. The Jordan Valley is \"an inseparable pa rt of the State of Israel,\" Peres declared while to uring Israeli settlements there in 1985, consistent with his unwa vering stand that \"The past is immutable and the Bi ble is the decisive document in determining the fate of our la nd\" and that a Palestinian state would \"threaten Is rael's very existence.\"2 His conception of a Jewish state, much lauded in the U.S. for its moderation, does not th reaten, but rather eliminates the existence of the Palestinian people. But this consequence is considered of littl e moment, at worst a minor defect in an imperfect world. Neither Peres nor any other Israeli leader has ye t moved an inch from the position of current Presid ent Chaim Herzog in 1972 that the Palestinians can never be \" partners in any way in a land that has been holy to our people for thousands of years,\" though the doves pr efer to exclude West Bank areas of heavy Arab popul ation from the Jewish State to avoid what they euphemisti cally term \"the demographic problem.\" All continue to accept the judgment of Shlomo Cazit (see p. 10) tha t the policies of \"destruction of all initiative\": for political action, democracy, or negotiations have been a \"suc cess story\" and should be continued. Israel's posit ion, with U.S. support, remains that of Prime Minister (now D efense Minister) Yitzhak Rabin, when the PLO and th e Arab states supported a UN Security Council resolut ion calling for a peaceful two-state settlement in January 1976: Israel will reject any negotiations with the PLO even if it recognizes Israel and renounces terr orism, and will not enter into \"political negotiations with Pa lestinians,\" PLO or not. Neither Peres nor Reagan h as been willing even to consider the explicit proposals by the PLO - which both know has overwhelming support among the Palestinians and has as much legitimacy a s did the Zionist organization in 1947 - for negoti ations leading to mutual recognition in a two-state settle ment in accord with the broad international consens us that has been blocked at every turn by the U.S. and Israel f or many years.3 These crucial political realities provide the nec essary framework for any discussion of \"the evil sc ourge of terrorism,\" which, in the racist terms of American discourse, refers to terrorist acts by Arabs, but n ot by Jews, just as \"peace\" means a settlement that honors the right of national self-determination of Jews, but n ot of Palestinians. Peres arrived in Washington to discourse on peace and terrorism with his partner in crime directly a fter having sent his bombers to attack Tunis, where they killed 20 Tunisians and 55 Palestinians, Israeli journali st Amnon Kapeliouk reported from the scene. The target was u ndefended, \"a vacation resort with several dozen ho mes, vacation cottages and PLO offices side by side and intermingled in such a way that even from close by it is difficult to distinguish\" among them. The weapons w ere more sophisticated than those used in Beirut, \" smart bombs\" apparently, which crushed their targets to d ust. The people who were in the bombed buildings were to rn to shreds beyond recognition. They showed me a series of pictures of the dead. 'You may take them, ' I was told. I left the pictures in the office. No newspaper in the world would publish terror photos such as these . I was told that a Tunisian boy who sold sandwiche s near the headquarters was torn to pieces. His father ide ntified the body by a scar on his ankle. 'Some of t he wounded were brought out from under the rubble, apparently healthy and unhurt,' my guide told me. 'Half an hou r later they collapsed in contortions and died. Apparently their internal organs had been destroyed from the p ower of the blast.'4"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" Tunisia had accepted the Palestinians at Reagan's behest after they had been expelled from Beirut in a U.S.- supported invasion that left some 20,000 killed and much of the country destroyed. \"You used a hammer against a fly,\" Israeli military correspondent Ze'e v Schiff was informed by \"a leading Pentagon figure , a general who is familiar with the Israeli military (IDF) and several other armies of the region.\" \"You struck m any civilians without need. We were astounded by your a ttitude to the Lebanese civilians,\" a feeling share d by Israeli soldiers and senior officers, who were appa lled at the savagery of the attack and the treatmen t of civilians and prisoners5 - though support in Israel for the aggression and for the Begin-Sharon team i ncreased in parallel to the atrocities, reaching its very hi gh peak after the terror bombing of Beirut in Augus t.6 Shimon Peres, the man of peace and respected figure in the Socialist International, kept his silence until th e costs to Israel began to mount with the postwar Sabra-Shatil a massacres; and later, the toll taken by the Leban ese resistance, which undermined Israel's plan of estab lishing a \"New Order\" in Lebanon with Israel in con trol of large areas of the south and the remnants ruled by Israel's Phalangist allies and selected Muslim elit es (see note 55, below). There can be no doubt, Kapeliouk concludes, that Arafat was the target of the Tunis attack. In the P LO office to which he was taken, a picture of Arafat stands a midst the ruins with the caption: \"They wanted to k ill me instead of negotiating with me.\" \"The PLO wishes ne gotiations,\" Kapeliouk was told, \"but Israel reject s any discussion\" - a simple statement of fact, effective ly concealed in the U.S., or worse, dismissed as ir relevant given the guiding racist premises. There can also be no serious doubt of U.S. compli city in the Tunis attack. The U.S. did not even war n the victims - American allies -that the killers were on the way. One who credits the pretense that the Six th Fleet and the extensive surveillance system in the region wer e incapable of detecting the Israeli planes refuele d en route over the Mediterranean should be calling for a Cong ressional investigation into the utter incompetence of the American military, which surely leaves us and our a llies wide open to enemy attack. \"News reports now quote government sources as saying the U.S. Sixth fleet w as undoubtedly aware of the coming raid but decided not to inform Tunisian officials,\" the Los Angeles Times r eported. But \"that very significant statement was n ot reported in the two major east coast papers, The Ne w York Times and The Washington Post, nor in the ot her U.S. papers, nor was it used in the overseas servic e\" of Associated Press and UPI, London Economist Mi deast correspondent Godfrey Jansen reported, adding that \"U.S. passive collusion was absolutely certain.\"7 One of the victims of the Tunis bombing was Mahm oud el-Mughrabi, born in Jerusalem in 1960, under detention twelve times by the age of 16, one of the informants for the London Sunday Times investigati on of torture in Israel (June 19, 1977), who \"managed to escape to Jordan after years of increasingly margin al existence under steadily deteriorating conditions o f the military occupation,\" according to a memorial notice by Israeli Jewish friends that was repeatedly denied p ublication in Arab newspapers in East Jerusalem by Israeli military censorship.8 These facts would, of course, be meaningless in the United States, if only becau se the unusually careful Sunday Times study was largely ex cluded from the press, though it was noted in the l iberal New Republic, along with an explicit defense of tor ture of Arabs that elicited no public reaction.9 The United States approved the Israeli bombing of Tunis as \"a legitimate response\" to \"terrorist att acks.\" Secretary of State Shultz confirmed this judgment i n a telephone call to Israeli Foreign Minister Yitz hak Shamir, informing him that the President and others \"had considerable sympathy for the Israeli action. \"10 Washington drew back from such open support after a n adverse global reaction, but it abstained from th e UN Security Council condemnation of this \"act of armed aggression\" in \"flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations, international law and norms of cond uct\" - alone as usual. The intellectual and cultura l climate in the U.S. is reflected by the fact that the abste ntion was bitterly condemned as yet another instanc e of a \"pro- PLO\" and \"anti-Israel\" stance, and a refusal to str ike hard at - carefully selected - terrorists. One might argue that the Israeli bombing does not fall under the rubric of international terrorism b ut rather the far more serious crime of aggression, as the UN Sec urity Council maintained. Or one might hold that it is unfair to apply to Israel the definition of \"international terrorism\" designed by others. To counter the latt er complaint, we may consider its own doctrine, as formulated by Ambassador Benjamin Netanyahu at an International Conference on Terrorism. The distinguishing factor in terrorism, he explained, is \"deliberate and syst ematic murder and maiming [of civilians] designed to inspi re fear.\"11 Clearly the Tunis attack and other Isra eli atrocities over the years fall under this concept, though most acts of international terrorism do not, including the"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"most outrageous terrorist attacks against Israelis (Ma'alot, the Munich massacre, the coastal road atr ocity of 1978 that provided the pretext for invading Lebanon , etc.), or even airplane hijacking or taking of ho stages quite generally, the very topic of the conference h e was attending. The attack on Arafat's PLO headquarters was alleg edly in retaliation for the murder of three Israeli s in Larnaca, Cyprus, by assailants who were captured an d face trial for their crime. \"Western diplomatic e xperts on the P.L.O.\" doubt that Arafat was aware of the plan ned mission. \"The Israelis, too, have dropped their original contention that Mr. Arafat had been involved.\"12 Ap ologists for Israeli terrorism in the U.S., who ass ure us that \"Israel's Tunisian raid precisely targeted people r esponsible for terrorist activities,\" are unimpress ed, explaining that whatever the facts, \"the larger moral responsi bility for atrocities... is all Yasir Arafat's\" bec ause \"he was, and remains, the founding father of contemporary Pa lestinian violence.\" In an address to the Israeli l obbying group AIPAC, Attorney-General Edwin Meese stated th at the U.S. will hold Arafat \"accountable for acts of international terrorism\" quite generally, facts app arently being irrelevant.13 Therefore any act \"agai nst the PLO\" - a very broad category, as the historical rec ord demonstrates - is legitimate. The Tunis attack was consistent with Israeli prac tice since the earliest days of the state: retaliat ion is directed against those who are vulnerable, not the perpetrat ors of atrocities. A standard condemnation of the P LO is that \"Instead of directly attacking security-minded foes like Israel, for example, Palestinians have attack ed softer Israeli targets in Italy, Austria and elsewhere,\"14 another sign of their vile and cowardly nature. Th e similar Israeli practice, initiated long before and vastly greater in scale, escapes notice in the midst of th e general praise for the heroism, military efficiency, and \"purity o f arms\" of a favored U.S. ally. The concept of \"ret aliation\" also raises more than a few questions, a matter to which we turn directly. As 1985 came to an end, the press reviewed the re cord of \"a year of bloody international terrorism,\" including the murders in Larnaca on September 25 and the Achi lle Lauro hijacking and brutal murder of a crippled American tourist, Leon Klinghoffer, on October 7. Israel's October 1 attack on Tunis was not includ ed in the list. In its lengthy year-end review of t errorism, the Times briefly notes the Tunis bombing, but as an ex ample of retaliation, not terrorism, describing it as \"an act of desperation that had little effect on Palestinia n violence and provoked an outcry by other nations. \" Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, condemning Italy for complicity in international terrorism by releasing the man \"who allegedly masterminded the [Achille Lauro] hijacking,\" observed that the U.S. \"would certainl y extradite any Israeli terrorist who had done violen ce to citizens of another country\" - Ariel Sharon, Yitzhak Shamir or Menachem Begin, for example. This stateme nt appeared on the very day that Peres was being fe ted in Washington shortly after the Tunis bombing and l auded for his commitment to peace, and is considere d entirely natural in the prevailing cultural climate .15 Reagan's pronouncements on terrorism are reported and discussed with apparent seriousness in the mainstream, but occasional critics have remarked up on the hypocrisy of those who fulminate about international terrorism while sending their client armies to murder, mutilate, torture and destroy in Nicaragua and - less commonly noted, since these acts are con sidered a grand success - to massacre tens of thous ands in El Salvador in a determined effort to avert the dread threat of meaningful democracy there. Shortly after the Reagan-Peres discourse on peace and terror, a group of 120 doctors, nurses and other health profession als returned from an investigation in Nicaragua endorse d by the American Public Health Association and the World Health Organization, reporting the destructio n of clinics and hospitals, murder of health profes sionals, looting of rural pharmacies leading to critical sho rtage of medicines, and successful disruption of a polio vaccination program, one small part of a campaign o f violence organized in the centers of internationa l terrorism in Washington and Miami;16 Times reporter s in Nicaragua often match their Pravda counterpart s in Afghanistan in their zeal to unearth or check the m assive evidence of Contra atrocities, and this repo rt, like many others, was ignored in the Newspaper of Record . The raid near Tunis yields a measure of the hypoc risy, which is not always easy to grasp. Suppose th at Nicaragua were to carry out bombings in Washington aimed at Reagan, Shultz and other international ter rorists, killing some 100,000 people \"by accident.\" This wou ld be entirely justified retaliation by American st andards, if indeed a ratio of 25 to one is acceptable, as in the Larnaca-Tunis exchange, though we might add fo r accuracy that in this case at least the perpetrators would b e targeted and there is no question about who initi ated the"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"terror, and perhaps the appropriate number of death s should be multiplied by some factor in considerat ion of the relative population sizes. \"Terrorists, and those w ho support them, must, and will, be held to account ,\" President Reagan declared,17 thus providing the mor al basis for any such act of retaliation, with his harshest critics in the mainstream press in full accord, as we have seen. Peres had already distinguished himself as a man of peace in Lebanon.18 After he became Prime Minist er, Israel's \"countertenor\" programs against civilians in occupied southern Lebanon intensified, reaching their peak of savagery with the Iron Fist operations of early 1985, which had \"the earmarks of Latin American dea th squads,\" Curtis Wilkie commented, affirming reports of other journalists on the scene. In the village of Zrariya, for example, the IDF carried out an operation well to the north of its then current frontline. After s everal hours of heavy shelling of Zrariya and three nearby villa ges, the IDF carted off the entire male population, killing 35- 40 villagers, some in cars crushed by Israeli tanks ; other villagers were beaten or murdered, a tank s hell was fired at Red Cross workers who were warned to stay away, and Israeli troops miraculously escaped witho ut casualties from what was officially described as a gun battle with heavily armed guerrillas. The day b efore, twelve Israeli soldiers had been killed in a suicid e attack near the border, but Israel denied that th e attack on Zrariya was retaliation. The Israeli denial is duti fully presented as fact by commentators in the U.S. , who explain that \"intelligence had established that the town had become a base for terrorists... No less t han 34 Shi'ite guerrillas were killed in the gun battle and more t han 100 men were taken away for questioning - from one small village\" (Eric Breindel), which indicates the scale of the Shi'ite terror network. Unaware of th e party line, Israeli soldiers painted the slogan \"Revenge of the Israeli Defense Forces\" in Arabic on walls of the town, reporters on the scene observed.19 Elsewhere, Israeli gunners shot at hospitals and schools and took \"suspects,\" including patients in hospital beds and operating rooms, for \"interrogation\" or to Israeli concentration camps, among numerous other atrocities that a Western diplomat who often travel s in the area described as reaching new depths of \" calculated brutality and arbitrary murder.\"20 The head of the IDF liaison unit in Lebanon, Gene ral Shlomo Ilya, \"said the only weapon against terr orism is terrorism and that Israel has options beyond those already used for 'speaking the language the terrori sts understand'.\" The concept is not a novel one. Gesta po operations in occupied Europe also \"were justifi ed in the name of combating 'terrorism',\" and one of Klaus Ba rbie's victims was found murdered with a note pinne d to his chest reading \"Terror against Terror\" - inciden tally, the name adopted by an Israeli terrorist gro up, and the heading of the cover story in Der Spiegel on the U. S. terror bombing of Libya in April 1986. A UN Secu rity Council resolution calling for condemnation of \"Isr aeli practices and measures against the civilian po pulation in southern Lebanon\" was vetoed by the United States o n the grounds that it \"applies double standards\"; \" We don't believe an unbalanced resolution will end the agony of Lebanon,\" Jeane Kirkpatrick explained.21 Israel's terror operations continued as its force s were compelled to withdraw by the resistance. Isr aeli troops and their South Lebanon Army (SLA) mercenaries brou ght the \"year of bloody international terrorism\" to an end on December 31, 1985 as they \"stormed a Shi'ite Moslem village [Kunin] in southern Lebanon and for ced its entire population of about 2,000 to leave,\" blo wing up houses and setting others on fire and round ing up 32 young men; old men, women and children from the vil lage were reported to be streaming into a town outs ide the Israeli \"security zone,\" where the UN force had a command post.22 This report, based on witnesses quoted by the Leb anese police, a journalist from the conservative Be irut journal An Nahar, and the Shi'ite Amal movement, is filed from Beirut. From Jerusalem, Joel Greenberg provides a different version, not on the basis of a ny identified sources, but as simple fact: \"village rs fearful of an SLA reprisal fled the Shi'ite village of Kunin a fter two SLA soldiers were slain in the village.\"23 The comparison, which is standard, is instructive . Israeli propaganda benefits greatly from the fact that the media rely overwhelmingly on Israel-based correspon dents. This yields two crucial advantages: first, t he \"news\" is presented to the American audience throug h official Israeli eyes; second, on the rare occasi ons when U.S. correspondents carry out independent inquiry i nstead of simply relying on their cooperative hosts , the Israeli propaganda system and its numerous U.S. aff iliates can complain bitterly that Arab crimes are ignored while Israel is subjected to detailed scrutiny for any minor imperfection, given the density of report ing."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" Inability to manage the news in the usual fashio n sometimes creates problems, for example, during t he 1982 Lebanon war, when Israel had no way to control the eyewitness reports by Lebanon-based journalists. Th is evoked an impressive outcry of protest over alleged atrocity-mongering and fabrication in a \"broad-sca le mass psychological war\" waged against pitiful little Isr ael, another sign of the inveterate anti-Semitism o f world opinion; Israel became the victim, not the aggresso r. It is easily demonstrated that the charges are f alse, often merely comical, and that the media predictably bent over backwards to see things from the Israeli poin t of view, not an easy matter for journalists attempting to su rvive Israeli terror bombing. Testimony from Israel i sources was often far harsher than what was reported in the U.S. press, and what appeared in U.S. journals was often a considerably watered-down version of what journalis ts actually perceived.24 But the charges are taken very seriously despite their manifest absurdity, while a ccurate critique of the media for its subordination to the U.S.- Israeli perspective and suppression of unacceptable facts is ignored. Typically, a study of \"Published Analyses of Media Coverage of the 1982 War in Lebanon\" inclu des numerous denunciations of the press for an alle ged anti-Israel stance and a few defenses of the media against these charges, but not even a reference to the fact that there were extensive, and quite accurate, critical analyses of exactly the opposite phenomenon.25 With in the narrow constraints of the highly ideological U.S. i ntellectual climate, only the former criticism can even be heard. This is quite a typical phenomenon, easily d emonstrated in connection with the Indochina wars, the Central America wars, etc., and serving as yet anot her device of thought control. The Iron Fist operations, which the Israeli comma nd is happy to describe as \"terrorism\" (see General Ilya's remarks, cited above), had two main purposes. The f irst, John Kifner observes (from Lebanon), was \"to turn the population against the guerrillas by making the cos t of supporting them too high\"; in short, to hold t he population hostage to terrorist attack, unless they accept the arrangements Israel intends to impose b y force. The second purpose was to exacerbate internal confl icts in Lebanon and to implement a general populati on exchange after intercommunal strife, much of which appears to have been incited by the occupier since 1982, in the classic manner. \"There is a great deal of evide nce,\" Lebanon-based correspondent Jim Muir observes , \"that the Israelis helped fuel and encourage the Christia n-Druze conflict\" in the Chouf region. In the south , a senior international aid official said: \"Their dirty trick s department did everything it could to stir up tro uble, but it just didn't work.\" \"Their behaviour was wicked,\" a view \"shared by the international relief community as a whole.\" \"Local eyewitnesses reported that Israeli soldiers frequently shot into the Palestinian camps from nea rby Christian areas in an effort to incite the Palestin ians against the Christians,\" and residents in the Christian villages reported that Israeli patrols forced Chris tians and Muslims at gunpoint to punch one another among other forms of \"bizarre humiliation.\" The technique s finally worked. Israel's Christian allies attacke d Muslims near Sidon in a manner guaranteed to elicit a respo nse from considerably more powerful forces, initiat ing a bloody cycle of violence that ultimately led to the flight of tens of thousands of Christians, many to the Israeli- dominated regions in the south, while tens of thous ands of Shi'ites were driven north by Peres's Iron Fist operations.26 The pretense in the United States was that Israel was always planning to withdraw so that the Shi'it e terrorists were simply indulging in the usual Arab pleasure in violence for its own sake, delaying the planned wi thdrawal. But as Jim Muir correctly observes, \"it is a histor ical fact beyond serious dispute that the Israelis would not be withdrawing now were it not for the attacks and the casualties they have caused,\" and the extent of th e withdrawal would be determined by the intensity of the resistance.27 The Israeli high command explained that the victi ms of the Iron Fist operations were \"terrorist vill agers\"; it was thus understandable that 13 villagers were mass acred by SLA militiamen in the incident that elicit ed this observation. Yossi Olmert of the Shiloah Institute, Israel's Institute of Strategic Studies, observed that \"these terrorists operate with the support of most of the local population.\" An Israeli commander complained that \"the terrorist... has many eyes here, because he lives h ere,\" while the military correspondent of the Jerus alem Post described the problems faced in combating the \"terr orist mercenary,\" \"fanatics, all of whom are suffic iently dedicated to their causes to go on running the risk of being killed while operating against the IDF,\" which must \"maintain order and security\" in occupied southern Lebanon despite \"the price the inhabitants will hav e to pay.\" He expressed his \"admiration for the way in which t hey were doing their job.\" Leon Wieseltier explained the difference between \"Shi'ite terrorism\" against the occupying army and Palestinian terrorism, each a manifestation of the evil Arab nature: \"The Palestinians had murderers w ho wished to kill. The Shi'ites have murderers who wis h to die,\" conducting actions \"inspired by a chilia stic"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"demand of the world for which there can be no merel y political or diplomatic satisfaction,\" nothing so simple as removing the occupying army from their land. Rather , their \"secret army\" Amal has been \"consecrated\" t o \"the destruction of Israel\" since its founding in 1975 - a discovery that goes well beyond the tales concoc ted in Israel's Hasbara system.28 The same concept of terrorism is widely used by U.S. officials and commentators. Thus the press rep orts, without comment, that Secretary of State Shultz's c oncern over \"international terrorism\" became \"his p assion\" after the suicide bombing of U.S. Marines in Lebano n in October 1983, troops that much of the populati on saw, not too surprisingly, as a foreign military force s ent to impose the \"New Order\" established by the Is raeli aggression. Barry Rubin writes that \"The most impor tant use of Syrian-sponsored terrorism within Leban on was to force the withdrawal of Israeli troops and U .S. Marines,\" while both Iran and Syria have suppor ted \"terrorist activity\" by \"Shi'ite extremist groups\" in southern Lebanon, such as attacks on \"the Israel i-backed South Lebanese Army.\" For the advocate of state ter ror, resistance to an occupying army or its local mercenaries is terrorism, meriting harsh reprisal. Times Israel correspondent Thomas Friedman routinel y describes attacks in southern Lebanon directed agai nst Israeli forces as \"terrorist bombings\" or \"suic ide terrorism,\" which, he assures us, is the product of \"psychological weaknesses or religious fervor.\" He reports further that residents of Israel's \"security zone\" who violate the rules established by the occupiers are \"shot on the spot, with questions asked later. Some of those shot have been innocent bystanders.\" But this prac tice is not state terrorism. He also notes that Israel \"has tak en great pains to limit the flow of news out of the area\": \"No reporters have been allowed to cover the aftermath of suicide attacks, and virtually no information is released about them.\" This fact does not prevent him from re porting with much confidence about the background a nd psychological states and disorders of those designa ted \"terrorists\" by the occupiers.29 As Reagan and Peres were congratulating one anoth er on their principled stand against \"the evil scou rge of terrorism\" before their admiring audience, the pres s reported yet another terrorist act in southern Le banon: \"Terrorists Kill 6, Demolish U.S.-Owned Christian R adio Station in S. Lebanon,\" the headlines read on the same day.30 Why should Lebanese terrorists destroy \"the Voice of Hope,\" run by American Christian missionaries? The question was barely raised, but l et us look into it, in the interest of clarifying t he concepts of terrorism and retaliation. One reason is that the station \"speaks for the So uth Lebanon Army,\"31 the mercenary force establishe d by Israel in southern Lebanon to terrorize the populat ion in its \"security zone.\" The location of the sta tion, near the village of Khiam, is also worthy of note. Khiam has a history, well known in Lebanon and Israel, if no t in the U.S. Ze'ev Schiff alluded to this history in the mi dst of Peres's Iron Fist operations. He observed th at when Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, the village of Khia m was \"empty of inhabitants,\" though now it has 10, 000, and that the Lebanese town of Nabatiya had only 5,0 00 inhabitants, today 50,000. \"These and others wil l once again be forced to abandon their homes if they perm it extremists in their community or Palestinians to attack Israeli settlements,\" Schiff explained.32 That will be their fate if they mimic the IDF, which was the n attacking Lebanese villages, randomly murdering civilians and destroying in defense against the \"terrorism [that ] has not disappeared\" as \"Israeli soldiers are harassed dail y in southern Lebanon.\"33 For the Lebanese to whom the warning was addresse d, and for at least some better-informed elements o f his Israeli audience, Schiff did not have to explain wh y the population of Nabatiya had been reduced to 5, 000 and Khiam emptied by 1982. The population of Khiam had been driven out, with hundreds killed, by Israeli t error bombardment from the early 1970s, and the handful w ho remained in Khiam were slaughtered during the 19 78 invasion of Lebanon, under the eyes of the elite Go lani brigade, by Israel's Haddad militia, which \"su cceeded in establishing relative peace in the region and preve nting the return of P.L.O. terrorists,\" the man of peace explained.34 Khiam is also the site of a \"secret jail\" maintai ned by \"Israel and its local militia allies in sout h Lebanon ... where detainees are held in appalling conditions an d subjected to beatings and electric-shock torture, according to former inmates and international relief official s in the area.\" The Red Cross reported that \"Israel is were running the center\" and that it had been refused en try by the IDF.35 Confirming these reports, Horowit z adds that Israel has learned \"the lesson of Ansar,\" the concentration camp run by the IDF. It has therefore arranged for its SLA mercenaries to run the Khiam torture ch amber so as to deflect criticism. Extensive reports of torture by former prisoners have been ignored in the U.S., but not elsewhere. Citing this evidence, Paul Kessl er (of the"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"College de France, co-founder of the French Physici ans Committee on Soviet Jewry) observes that most o f the prisoners \"were picked up as suspects during search operations or were villagers arrested for refusing to cooperate with the occupying power, and in particul ar, for refusing to join the Israeli-led 'South Leb anese Army militia'\"; none has been indicted or tried, though some had then been detained for over a year. Khiam is the principal, but not the only center. Kessler reports systematic torture by SLA guards, who operate the prisons \"under the direction of Israeli officers.\"36 There might have been more to say, then, about th e terrorist attack by \"fanatics\" at Khiam on Octobe r 17, 1985, were matters such as these considered fit to become part of historical memory alongside of other acts of terror of greater ideological serviceability. Nabatiya too has further stories to tell. The fli ght of 50,000 of its 60,000 population \"mostly beca use of fear of the [Israeli] shelling\" was reported by two Jerusal em Post correspondents who were touring southern Le banon in an effort to unearth evidence of PLO terror and atrocities, finding little, though there was ample evidence of Israeli terror and its effects.37 One such bombardm ent was on November 4, 1977, when Nabatiya \"came un der heavy artillery fire from [Israeli-supported] Leban ese Maronite positions and also from Israeli batter ies on both sides of the frontier - including some of the six I sraeli strongpoints inside Lebanon.\" The attacks co ntinued the next day, with three women killed among other casua lties. On November 6, two rockets fired by Fatah guerrillas killed two Israelis in Nahariya, setting off an artillery battle and a second rocket attack that killed one Israeli. \"Then came the Israeli air raids in which some 70 people, nearly all Lebanese, were killed.\"3 8 This Israeli-initiated exchange, which threatened to lead to a major war, was cited by Egyptian Pres ident Sadat as a reason for his offer to visit Jerusalem a few days later.39 These events have entered historical memory in a different form, however, not only in journalism but in scholarship: \"In an effort to disrupt the movement towards a peace conference,\" Edward Haley writes (c iting no evidence), \"the PLO fired Katyusha rockets into the northern Israeli village of Nahariya, on November 6 and 8, killing three,\" and eliciting \"the inevitable Israe li reprisal\" on November 9, with over 100 killed in attacks \"in and around Type and two small towns to the south.\"4 0 As is the rule, in sanitized history Palestinians carry out terrorism, Israelis then retaliate, perhaps too har shly. In the real world, the truth is often rather different, a matter of no small significance for the study of te rrorism in the Middle East. The torment of Nabatiya was rarely noted by the W estern press, though there are a few exceptions. On e of the Israeli attacks was on December 2, 1975, when the I sraeli air force bombed the town killing dozens of Lebanese and Palestinian civilians, using antipersonnel weap ons, bombs and rockets.41 This raid, unusual in tha t it was reported, aroused no interest or concern, perhaps b ecause it was apparently a \"retaliation\": namely, r etaliation against the UN Security Council, which had just agr eed to devote a session to the peace proposals back ed by Syria, Jordan, Egypt and the PLO, discussed in chap ter 1. The story continues with little change. In early 1986, while the eyes of the world were focused in h orror on the lunatic terrorists in the Arab world, the press rep orted that Israeli tank cannon poured fire into the village of Sreifa in southern Lebanon, aiming at 30 houses fro m which the IDF claimed they had been fired upon by \"armed terrorists\" resisting their military actions in the course of what they described as a search f or two Israeli soldiers who had been \"kidnapped\" in the Israeli \"s ecurity zone\" in Lebanon. Largely kept from the Ame rican press was the report by the UN peace-keeping forces that Israeli troops \"went really crazy\" in these o perations, locking up entire villages, preventing the UN troop s from sending in water, milk and oranges to the vi llagers subjected to \"interrogation\" - meaning brutal tortu re of men and women by Israeli forces, and by their local mercenaries with IDF troops standing by. The IDF th en departed, taking away many villagers including pregnant women, some brought to Israel in further v iolation of international law, destroying houses an d looting and wrecking others, while Shimon Peres said that I srael's search for its kidnapped soldiers \"expresse s our attitude towards the value of human life and dignit y.\"42 A month later, on March 24, Lebanese radio report ed that Israeli forces, either IDF or SLA mercenari es, shelled Nabatiya killing three civilians and woundi ng 22 as \"shells slammed into the marketplace in th e center of town at daybreak as crowds gathered for trading. \" The attack was allegedly in retaliation for an at tack on Israel's mercenary forces in southern Lebanon. A le ader of the Shi'ite Amal vowed that \"Israeli settle ments and"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"installations will not be beyond the blows of the r esistance.\" On March 27, a Katyusha rocket struck a schoolyard in northern Israel, injuring five people , and eliciting an Israeli attack on Palestinian re fugee camps near Sidon, killing ten people and wounding 22, whi le Israel's northern commander stated over Israeli Army radio that the IDF had not determined whether the r ocket had been fired by Shi'ite or Palestinian guer rillas. On April 7, Israeli planes bombed the same camps and a neighboring village, killing two and wounding 20, claiming that terrorists had set out from there wit h the intent of killing Israeli citizens.43 Of all these events, only the rocket attack on no rthern Israel merited anguished TV coverage and gen eral outrage at \"the evil scourge of terrorism,\" though this was somewhat muted because of the mass hysteri a then being orchestrated over a Nicaraguan \"invasion\" of Honduras, as the Nicaraguan Army exercised its lega l right of hot pursuit in driving out of its territory terr orist gangs dispatched by their U.S. directors in a show of force just prior to the Senate vote on Contra aid; recall that the only serious issue under debate in the te rrorist state is whether the proxy army can accomplish the goals ass igned them by their master.44 Israel, in contrast, was not exercising a legal right of hot pursuit in shelling and bombing towns and refugee camps, nor have its acts of wholesale terrorism and outright aggression in Leba non ever fallen under this concept. But as a client -state, Israel inherits from the emperor the right of terro rism, torture and aggression. And Nicaragua, as an enemy, plainly lacks the right to defend its territory fro m U.S. international terrorism. Consequently, it is natural that Israel's actions should be ignored, or dismissed as legitimate retaliation, while Congress, across the narrow spectrum, denounced the \"Nicaraguan Marxist-Leninis ts\" for this renewed demonstration of the threat th ey pose to regional peace and stability. The Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June 1982 too is regularly presented in properly sanitized form. Shimon Peres writes that the \"Peace for Galilee\" operation was fought \"in order to insure that the Galilee wi ll no longer be shelled by Katyusha rockets.\" Eric Breindel expl ains that \"of course, the principal aim of the Isra eli invasion in 1982\" was \"to protect the Galilee region . . . f rom Katyusha-rocket attacks and other shelling from Lebanon.\" The news pages of the Times inform us that the inva sion began \"after attacks by Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas on Israel's northern settle ments,\" and (without comment) that Israeli leaders \"said they wanted to end the rocket and shelling attacks on Is rael's northern border,\" which \"has been accomplish ed for the three years the Israeli Army has spent in Lebanon.\" Henry Kamm adds that \"For nearly three years, the people of Qiryat Shemona have not slept in their bomb shel ters, and parents have not worried when their child ren went out to school or to play. The Soviet-made Katyusha rockets, which for many years struck this town near the Lebanese border at random intervals, have not falle n since Israel invaded Lebanon in June 1982.\" And T homas Friedman observes that \"If rockets again rain down on Israel's northern border after all that has been expended on Lebanon, the Israeli public will be outraged\"; \" . . . right now there are no rockets landing in nor thern Israel. . . and if large-scale attacks begin afresh on Israel 's northern border that minority [that favors keepi ng the army in Lebanon] could grow into a majority again.\" \"Operat ion Peace for Galilee - the Israeli invasion of Leb anon - was originally undertaken\" to protect the civilian population from Palestinian gunners, Friedman repor ts in one of the numerous human interest stories on the trava il of the suffering Israelis. Political figures reg ularly expound the same doctrine. Zbigniew Brzezinski writ es that \"the increased Syrian military presence and the use of Lebanon by the Palestine Liberation Organization for incursions against Israel precipitated the Isr aeli invasion [of 1982],\" and Ronald Reagan, in a yet an other display of moral cowardice, asks us to \"remem ber that when [the invasion] all started, Israel, because of the violations of its own northern border by the P alestinians, the P.L.O., had gone all the way to Beirut,\" where it was \"10,000 Palestinians [!] who had been bringi ng ruin down on Beirut,\" not the bombers whom he was suppor ting.45 These and innumerable other accounts, many with v ivid descriptions of the torment of the people of t he Galilee subjected to random Katyusha bombardment, h elp create the approved picture of Soviet-armed Palestinian fanatics, a central component of the Ru ssian-based international terror network, who compe l Israel to invade and strike Palestinian refugee camps and other targets, as any state would do, to defend its people from merciless terrorist attack. The real world, once again, is rather different. David Shipler writes that \"In the four years betwee n the previous Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon in 19 78 and the invasion of June 6, 1982, a total of 29 people were killed in northern Israel in all forms of atta cks from Lebanon, including shelling and border cro ssings by terrorists,\" but that for a year before the 1982 in vasion, \"the border was quiet.\"46 This report is un usual in at least approaching half-truth. While the PLO refrain ed from cross-border actions for a year prior to th e Israeli"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"invasion, the border was far from quiet, since Isra eli terror continued, killing many civilians; the b order was \"quiet\" only in the racist terms of U.S. discourse, once again. Furthermore, neither Shipler nor his a ssociates recall that while 29 people were killed in northern Israel from 1978, thousands were killed by Israeli bombardments in Lebanon, barely noted in the U.S., and rarely \"retaliatory.\" The bombardments from 1978 were a central element of the Camp David \"peace process,\" which, predicta bly, freed Israel to extend its takeover and repression in the occupied territories while attacking its nor thern neighbor, with the main Arab deterrent (Egypt) now removed from the conflict and U.S. military support rapidly increasing. William Quandt notes further th at \"the Israeli operational planning for the invasi on of Lebanon against the PLO [in 1981-2] seems to coinci de with the consolidation of the Egyptian-Israeli p eace treaty.\" It should be noted that the obvious signif icance of the Camp David agreements, though virtual ly inexpressible in the U.S. at the time and since, is understood by competent American journalists. Thus in an interview in Israel, David Shipler says that \"On th e Israeli side, it seems to me that the peace treat y set up the situation for the war in Lebanon. With Egypt no lon ger a confrontation state, Israel felt free to init iate a war in Lebanon, something it probably would not have dared to do before the peace treaty ... It is an irony t hat the war in Lebanon could not have taken place without the p eace treaty\"; hardly an irony, but an intrinsic par t of the process.47 To my knowledge, he did not write that i n the Times during his five years as its correspond ent in Israel, ending in June 1984, or since. Shipler adds, \"I think there would not have been such tremendous opposition to the war among Israeli s without this same peace treaty.\" Having been in Isr ael at the time, he can hardly fail to know that th e \"tremendous opposition to the war\" is a post hoc pr opaganda fabrication designed to restore the image of \"the beautiful Israel.\" Opposition was in fact slight un til the postwar Sabra-Shatila massacres (when suppo rters of the war in the U.S. too deserted the sinking ship, constructing a fraudulent history of \"earlier oppos ition,\" much as in the case of the Indochina war), and later the mounting costs of the occupation.48 Turning to the real world, consider first the imm ediate background of the \"Peace for Galilee\" operat ion. The PLO observed the U.S.-arranged cease-fire of July 1 981 despite repeated Israeli efforts to evoke some action that could be used as a pretext for the planned inv asion, including bombardment in late April 1982 kil ling two dozen people, sinking of fishing boats, etc. The on ly exceptions were a light retaliation in May after Israeli bombardment, and a response to heavy Israeli bombin g and ground attacks in Lebanon in June that had ca used many civilian casualties. These Israeli attacks wer e in \"retaliation\" for the attempted assassination of the Israeli Ambassador in London by Abu Nidal, a sworn enemy of the PLO, who did not even have an office in Lebano n - again, the familiar story of \"retaliation.\" It wa s this assassination attempt that was used as the p retext for the long-planned invasion. The New Republic informs us that the successes of UN negotiator Brian Urquhart \"have been minor, somehow forgettable: his negotiation of a PLO cease -fire [sic] in southern Lebanon in 1981, for instan ce.\"49 That strict party line journals should prefer to \"f orget\" the facts is not surprising, but the prevale nce of such convenient lapses of memory is noteworthy. The events of July 1981 follow pretty much the sa me pattern. On May 28, Ze'ev Schiff and Ehud Ya'ari write, Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Chief-of-Staff Ra fael Eitan \"took another step that would bring thei r country appreciably closer to a war in Lebanon with an action that was essentially calculated towards that end\"; namely, they broke the cease-fire with bombing of \" PLO concentrations\" (a term commonly used to refer to Israeli targets, whatever they are) in southern Leb anon. The attacks continued from air and sea until June 3, Schiff and Ya'ari continue, while \"the Palestinians responded gingerly for fear that a vigorous reacti on would only provoke a crushing Israeli ground operation.\" A cease-fire was again established, broken again by Israel on July 10, with renewed bombardments. This time th ere was a Palestinian reaction, with rocket attacks that caused panic in the northern Galilee followed by he avy Israeli bombing of Beirut and other civilian ta rgets. By the time a cease-fire was declared on July 24, some 450 Arabs - nearly all Lebanese civilians - and si x Israelis were killed.50 Of this story, all that is remembered is the torm ent of the northern Galilee, subjected to random Ka tyusha bombing by PLO terrorists that finally provoked Isr ael to retaliate in its June 1982 invasion of Leban on. This is sometimes true even of serious journalists who do n ot simply provide a pipeline for official propagand a."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Edward Walsh writes that \"the repeated rocket attac ks in 1981 had put [Qiryat Shemona] once again unde r siege,\" describing the \"distraught parents\" and the terror caused by \"the pounding of artillery and ro cket barrages from the nearby Palestinian bases\" in 1981 , with no further word on what was happening. Curti s Wilkie, one of the more skeptical and perceptive of American journalists in the Middle East, writes th at Qiryat Shemona \"came under withering fire from Palestinian Liberation Organization forces in 1981; the rain o f Soviet-made Katyusha rockets was so intense at one point that those residents who had not fled were fo rced to spend eight consecutive days and nights in bomb she lters\"; again, with no further word on the reasons for this \"withering fire\" or on the mood in Beirut and other civilian areas where hundreds were killed in the m urderous Israeli bombardment.51 The example gives some further insight into the c oncepts of \"terrorism\" and \"retaliation,\" as interp reted within the U.S. ideological system, and into the assumptio ns which, as a matter of course, exclude the suffer ing of the primary victims, for the usual reasons. The official story that \"the rocket and shelling attacks on Israel's northern border\" were ended tha nks to the \"Peace for Galilee\" operation (NYT; see above) is d oubly false. First, the border was \"quiet\" for a ye ar prior to the invasion apart from Israeli terror attacks and provocations; and the major rocket attacks, in July 1981, were a response to Israeli terror which in this incident alone exacted a toll almost 100 times greater than the PLO response. Second, in sharp contrast to the precedin g period, rocket attacks against Israel began short ly after the invasion ended, from early 1983, and continued. A g roup of dissident Israeli journalists report that i n two weeks of September 1985, 14 Katyusha rockets were fired a t the Galilee. Furthermore, \"terrorist attacks\" inc reased by 50 percent in the West Bank in the months following the war, and by the end of 1983 had increased by 7 0 percent since the war in Lebanon, becoming a severe threat by 1985, not a surprising consequence of sa vage atrocities and the destruction of the civil society and political system of the Palestinians.52 The real reason for the 1982 invasion was not the threat to the northern Galilee, as sanitized histo ry would have it, but rather the opposite, as was plausibly explained shortly after the invasion was launched b y Israel's leading specialist on the Palestinians, Hebrew Univ ersity Professor Yehoshua Porath (a \"moderate\" in I sraeli parlance, who supports the Labor Party's \"Jordanian solution\" for the Palestinians). The decision to i nvade, he suggests, \"flowed from the very fact that the cease -fire had been observed.\" This was a \"veritable cat astrophe\" for the Israeli government, because it threatened t he policy of evading a political settlement. \"The g overnment's hope,\" he continued, \"is that the stricken PLO, lac king a logistic and territorial base, will return t o its earlier terrorism; it will carry out bombings throughout th e world, hijack airplanes, and murder many Israelis ,\" and thus \"will lose part of the political legitimacy it has gained\" and \"undercut the danger\" of negotiati ons with representative Palestinians, which would threaten t he policy -shared by both major political groupings - of keeping effective control over the occupied territo ries.53 The plausible assumption of the Israeli leadershi p was that those who shape public opinion in the Un ited States - the only country that counts, now that Isr ael has chosen to become a mercenary state serving the interests of its provider - could be counted on to obliterate the actual history and portray the terro rist acts resulting from Israeli aggression and atrocities as random acts of violence ascribable to defects in A rab character and culture, if not racial deficiencies. Subsequent U.S. commentary on terrorism fulfills th ese expectations with some precision, a major propagand a coup for state terrorists in Jerusalem and Washin gton. The basic points are understood well enough in I srael. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir stated over Is raeli television that Israel went to war because there wa s \"a terrible danger . . . Not so much a military o ne as a political one,\" prompting the fine Israeli satirist , B. Michael, to write that \"the lame excuse of a m ilitary danger or a danger to the Galilee is dead,\" once we \"have removed the political danger\" by striking first; no w, \"Thank God, there is no one to talk to.\" Columnist Aaron B achar comments that \"it is easy to understand the m ood of the Israeli leadership. Arafat has been accused of steadily moving towards some kind of political accommodation with Israel\" and \"in the eyes of the Israeli Administration, this is the worst possible threat\" - including Labor as well as Likud. Journalist/histor ian Benny Morris observes that \"the PLO held its fi re along the northern border for a whole year, on a number o f occasions omitting completely to react to Israeli actions (designed specifically to draw PLO fire on the Nort h).\" For the senior IDF officers, he continues, \"th e war's inevitability rested on the PLO as a political thre at to Israel and to Israel's hold on the occupied t erritories,\" since \"Palestinian hopes inside and outside the occ upied territories for the maturation of nationalist aspirations"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"rested on and revolved about the PLO.\" Like every s ane commentator, he ridicules the hysterical talk a bout captured weapons and the PLO military threat, and p redicts that \"the Shi'ites of West Beirut, many of them refugees from previous Israeli bombardments of Sout hern Lebanon in the 1970s, will probably remember t he IDF siege of June-August [1982] for a long time,\" w ith long-term repercussions in \"Shi'ite terrorism a gainst Israeli targets.\"54 On the right wing, Likud Knesset member Ehud Olme rt commented that \"the danger posed by the PLO to Israel did not lie in its extremism, but in the fic titious moderation Arafat managed to display withou t ever losing sight of his ultimate aim, which is the dest ruction of Israel\" (arguably true, in the sense in which David Ben-Gurion, while in power, never lost sight of his ultimate aim of expanding to \"the limits of Zionis t aspirations,\" including much of the surrounding cou ntries and on some occasions, the \"biblical borders \" from the Nile to Iraq, while the native population would somehow be transferred). Former West Bank Administ rator Professor Menachem Milson states that \"it is a mist ake to think that the threat to Israel represented by the PLO is essentially a military one; rather, it is a poli tical and ideological one.\" Defense Minister Ariel Sharon explained just before the invasion that \"quiet on t he West Bank\" requires \"the destruction of the PLO in Lebanon,\" and his ultra-right cohort, Chief of Staf f Rafael Eitan, commented afterwards that the war w as a success, because it severely weakened \"the politica l status\" of the PLO and \"the struggle of the PLO f or a Palestinian state\" while enforcing Israel's capacit y \"to block any such purpose.\" Commenting on such statements, Israeli military historian Uri Milshtei n (a supporter of Labor's \"Jordanian solution\") obs erves that among the goals of the invasion in the Sharon-Eitan conception were: \"to establish a New Order55 in Le banon and the Middle East,\" \"to advance the process of Sa datization in several Arab states,\" \"to guarantee t he annexation of Judea and Samaria [the West Bank] to the state of Israel,\" and \"perhaps a solution of th e Palestinian problem.\" Knesset Member Amnon Rubinstein, much admired in the U.S. for his liberal and dovish stance, writes that even though the ceasefire had been observed \"more o r less\" (to translate: observed by the PLO but not by Israel), nevertheless the invasion of Lebanon was \" justified\" because of a potential, not actual milit ary threat: the arms and ammunition in southern Lebanon were in tended for eventual use against Israel. Consider th e implications of this argument in other contexts, ev en if we were to take seriously the claims about a potential PLO military threat to Israel.56 Note that Rubinstein anticipated the interesting doctrine enunciated by the Reagan Administration in justifying its April 1986 bombing of Libya in \"self-defense ag ainst future attack,\" to which we turn in the next chapter. American supporters of Israeli atrocities occasio nally acknowledge the same truths. Just before the invasion, New Republic editor Martin Peretz, echoing Sharon a nd Eitan, urged that Israel should administer to th e PLO a \"lasting military defeat\" in Lebanon that \"will cla rify to the Palestinians in the West Bank that thei r struggle for an independent state has suffered a setback of many years,\" so that \"the Palestinians will be turned i nto just another crushed nation, like the Kurds or the Afgha ns.\" And Democratic Socialist Michael Walzer, who s ees the solution for Palestinian Arabs - within Israel as well -in transfer of those \"marginal to the nati on\" (essentially, the position of the racist Rabbi Kaha ne; see chapter 1, note 7), explained in the New Re public after the war that \"I certainly welcome the political def eat of the PLO, and I believe that the limited mili tary operation required to inflict that defeat can be de fended under the theory of just war.\"57 It is of some interest to observe the convergence on these issues between the Israeli ultra-right an d American left-liberalism. In short, the goals of the war were political, th e occupied territories being one prime target, the \"New Order\" in Lebanon being another. The tale about protecting the border from terrorism is Agitprop. If Palestin ian terrorism can be revived, so much the better. And i f we can't pin the blame on Arafat, he can at least be stigmatized as \"the founding father of contemporary Palestinian violence\" (New Republic) so that his e fforts at political settlement can be evaded. The problem of evading a political settlement did not, however, end with the destruction of the poli tical base for the PLO, as had been hoped, so it remained nece ssary to be on the alert to combat the threat and d efend the doctrinal truth that the U.S. and Israel seek peace but are blocked by Arab rejectionism. Thus, in Apr il-May"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"1984, Arafat made a series of statements in Europe and Asia calling for negotiations with Israel leadi ng to mutual recognition. The offer was immediately rejec ted by Israel, ignored by the U.S. A UPI story on A rafat's proposals was the featured front-page story in the San Francisco Examiner, and the facts were reported without prominence in the local quality press. The national press suppressed the story outright, apart from a bare mention in the Washington Post some weeks later. Th e New York Times even banned letters referring to t he facts, while continuing (along with others) to deno unce Arafat for his unwillingness to pursue a diplo matic course. In general, the more influential the journa l, the more it was determined to suppress the facts , an entirely natural stance given the position of the U.S. gover nment on the issues.58 Knowledgeable Israelis are of course aware of Ara fat's stand. Former chief of military intelligence General (ret.) Yehoshaphat Harkabi, an Arabist and well-kno wn hawk for many years, notes that \"the PLO wishes a political settlement because it knows that the alte rnative is terrible and will lead to total destruct ion.\" \"Arafat, like Hussein and the Arabs of the West Bank, is afr aid that if there will not be a settlement, Israel will explode, and with it all its neighbors, including the Palest inians.\" Therefore \"Arafat adopts relatively modera te positions with regard to Israel.\"59 These observations underscore several points: 1) there is a crucial political context in which terro rism must be understood, if we are to be serious about it; 2) it is the other fellow's crimes, not our own comparab le or worse ones, that constitute \"terrorism\" - in this case, P alestinian but not Israeli or American crimes; 3) t he concepts of \"terrorism\" and \"retaliation\" are used as terms of propaganda, not description. Crucially, the hysteri a fanned over carefully selected acts of terrorism - those b y Arabs, whether Palestinians, Lebanese Shi'ites, L ibyans, Syrians, or even Iranians, who can count as Arabs f or this purpose since 1979 - is designed to achieve certain specific political goals. Further inquiry reinforce s these conclusions. Consider again the matter of retaliation. The fir st post-1981 rocket attack by Shi'ites against Qiry at Shemona was in December 1985, after over three years of a m ilitary occupation of extreme brutality, which reac hed its peak during the Iron Fist operations under Shimon P eres in early 1985. But the occasionally reported s avagery of the occupiers fails to convey anything like the full story, since it ignores the day-to-day reality ; the same is true of the occasional reporting of Israeli atrocit ies in the occupied territories, which fails to con vey the true picture of brutal degradation, repression, exploita tion of cheap (including child) labor, harsh contro l over political and cultural life and curtailment of econ omic development. A more instructive picture is giv en by Julie Flint, recounting \"the story of life, and death, in one southern Lebanese village\" of Shi'ites a month before the rocket attack. Kfar Roummane had been \"a prosperous agricultural town of 8,000 people\" near Nabatiya d uring the period when southern Lebanon was subjected only to PLO terror, according to official history (see note 37). After what the New York Times called its \"liberatio n\" from PLO rule, it was surrounded by \"two huge fortifications built by the Israelis and their Leba nese proxy, the South Lebanon Army,\" from which the re is constant sniping and shelling, \"sometimes from dawn to dusk, sometimes only for a few hours,\" with man y casualties, leading to the flight of 6,000 people a nd leaving three-fourths of the town uninhabitable in this \"dying village\" where there is no sign of resistanc e activities, and little likelihood of it among the apolitical farmers on a bare expanse of flat hillside.60 Was the shelling of Qiryat Shemona \"unprovoked te rrorism\" or \"retaliation,\" even putting aside the m urderous atrocities of the Peres-Rabin Iron Fist operations? A look at the lives of the terrorists is also ins tructive. One was interviewed by the Washington Pos t in a five- part series on terrorism, selective in the conventi onal way. Serving an 18-year sentence in an Israeli jail, he was chosen as \"in many ways typical of terrorists now i n jail from London to Kuwait.\" \"In his life, a pers onal tragedy (the death of his father in a bomb blast in Jerusalem in 1946) combined with the discovery of a system of belief (Marxism) to plunge him into a world of c old-blooded political murder.\" \"The bomb that kille d his father and more than 90 other persons was set by th e Irgun Zionist underground group, led by Menachem Begin, at British military headquarters in what is now the King David Hotel\" - as it was then.61 He \"w as introduced to Marxism, he said, by the 'reality' of conditions in Palestinian camps\" in the occupied W est Bank. The \"reality\" of the occupied territories, not only in the camps, is quite real, and is bitter and cru el, outside of the editorial pages of the nation's press, where we can learn that the occupation was \"a model of futu re cooperation\" and an \"experiment in Arab-Israeli coe xistence.\"62 To explain is not to justify, but plai nly some questions arise about the easy use of such terms as \"retaliation.\""},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" Or consider Suleiman Khater, the Egyptian soldier who murdered seven Israeli tourists on a Sinai bea ch on October 5, 1985. The Egyptian press reported that h is mother said she was \"happy that these Jews had d ied\" and a doctor in his village of Baher al-Bakr descri bed the shootings as a warning against the \"illusor y peace\" between Egypt and Israel. Why this shocking reactio n to an unspeakable crime? The Tunis bombing a few days earlier might suggest a reason, but there may be ot hers. In 1970, Israeli warplanes bombed Baher al-Ba kr, killing 47 schoolchildren, during the \"war of attri tion,\" when extensive Israeli bombing, some deep in side Egypt, drove a million and a half civilians from th e Suez Canal area, threatening general war when Sov iet- piloted MIGs defending inner Egypt were shot down b y newly acquired Israeli Phantom jets over Egyptian territory.63 Something is perhaps missing, then, when the Tim es Israel correspondent blandly reports that Khater \"acted out of motives that were nationalist and anti-Israe l\"64 - something that would surely not have been ig nored had the situation been reversed. David Hirst observes that \"the main, or the real ly significant center of international terrorism [i n the Western sense of the term] is Lebanon. It either breeds its own terrorists, or serves as a congenial home for imported ones,\" either Palestinians, who \"have known little but bombardment, murder, massacre and mutilation, encircling hatred, fear and insecurity,\" or Lebanes e whose society was given its final blow by the U.S .-backed Israeli aggression and its aftermath; \"... one conv iction is rooted in the minds of the youth of today \" among these groups: \"that under President Reagan, who has carried his country's traditional partisanship wit h Israel to unprecedented lengths, the U.S. is the incorrigible upholder of a whole existing order so intolerable that any means now justifies its destruction. The terrorist impulse may be strongest among the Palestinians, bu t it can also be Lebanese, Arab, or - in its most spectacula r manifestation - Shi'ite.\" The essential point was expressed by Yehoshaphat Harkabi: \"To offer an honorable solution to the Palestinians respecting their right to self-determi nation: that is the solution of the problem of terr orism. When the swamp disappears, there will be no more mosquit oes.\"65 U.S.-Israeli wholesale terrorism and aggression h ave surely contributed to the situation Hirst descr ibes, predictably and perhaps consciously so (see above), and both terrorist states are presumably satisfied with-the outcome, which provides them with a justification t o persist in their course of rejectionism and viole nce. Furthermore, the retail terrorism to which they hav e contributed can be exploited to induce a proper s ense of fear and mobilization among the population, as requ ired for more general ends. All that is necessary i s a doctrinal system that will shriek in chorus when ne cessary and suppress any understanding of U.S. init iatives, their pattern, their sources, and their motivation. On this score, policy-makers need have few concern s, the record shows. Terrorist acts are characteristically described b y their perpetrators as \"retaliatory\" (or, in the c ase of U.S. and Israeli terrorism, as \"preemptive\"). Thus the bombi ng of Tunis was in alleged retaliation for the murd ers in Larnaca, as noted, though there was barely a preten se that the victims of the Tunis bombing had any co nnection with the Larnaca atrocity. The latter was also just ified as \"retaliatory,\" a response to Israeli hijac king of ships travelling from Cyprus to Lebanon.66 The former cla im was accepted in the U.S. as legitimate, the latt er ignored or derided, a distinction based on ideologi cal commitment, as is the norm. Putting aside the justifications offered for terr orist violence and keeping to the factual record, t here is no doubt that Israel has been carrying out hijacking operati ons and kidnapping at sea for many years, with litt le notice and no concern in the U.S. over this crime, which a rouses great passion and anger when the perpetrator s are Arabs. It was not even deemed necessary to report t he fact that the Israeli High Court in effect gave its stamp of approval to this procedure. In the case of an Arab who appealed against his imprisonment on grounds th at he was captured outside of Israeli territorial waters, the High Court ruled that \"the legality of sentenc ing and imprisonment is unaffected by the means whereby the suspect was brought to Israeli territory,\" and hel d (once again) that an Israeli court may sentence a person for actions outside of Israel that it regards as cr iminal. In this case, the Court stated that \"security reasons\" made it necessary to keep the appellant in prison.67 Turning to the historical record, in 1976, accord ing to Knesset member (General, ret.) Mattityahu Pe led, the Israeli Navy began to capture boats belonging to Le banese Muslims - turning them over to Israel's Leba nese"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Christian allies, who killed them - in an effort to abort steps towards conciliation that had been arr anged between the PLO and Israel. Prime Minister Rabin co nceded the facts but said that the boats were captu red prior to these arrangements, while Defense Minister Shimon Peres refused to comment. After a prisoner exchange in November 1983, a front-page story in th e Times mentioned in its eighteenth paragraph that 37 of the Arab prisoners, who had been held at the notori ous Ansar prison camp, \"had been seized recently by the Israeli Navy as they tried to make their way from C yprus to Tripoli,\" north of Beirut, an observation that merited no comment there or elsewhere.68 By the sam e logic, British forces could have sent agents to k idnap Zionists in the United States or on the high seas i n 1947, placing them in prison camps without charge or convicting them of support for terrorism. In June, 1984, Israel hijacked a ferryboat operat ing between Cyprus and Lebanon five miles off the L ebanese coast with a burst of machinegun fire and forced it to Haifa, where nine people were removed and held, eight Lebanese and the ninth Syrian. Five were freed afte r interrogation and four held, including one woman and a schoolboy returning from England for a holiday in B eirut; two were released two weeks later, while the fate of the others remains unreported. The matter was consi dered so insignificant that one has to search for t iny items in the back pages even to learn this much about the fate of the kidnapped passengers. The London Obser ver suggested a \"political motive\": to compel passenger s to use the ferry operating from the Maronite port of Jounieh instead of Muslim West Beirut or to signal to the Lebanese that they are \"powerless\" and must come to terms with Israel. Lebanon denounced this \"act of p iracy,\" which Godfrey Jansen described as \"another item\" in Israel's \"long list of international thuggery.\" \"To maintain the maritime terrorist fiction,\" he adds, \"the Israelis then bombed and bombarded a small island off Tripol i which was said to be a base for PLO seaborne operations,\" a claim that he dismisses as \"absurd.\" The Lebanese police reported that 15 were killed, 20 wounded and 20 missing, all Lebanese, fishermen and children at a Sunni boy scout camp which was the \" worst hit\" target.69 In its report on the Israeli \"interception\" (more accurately, hijacking) of the ferryboat, the Times observes that prior to the 1982 war, \"the Israeli Navy regularly intercepted ships bound for or leaving the ports of Tyre and Sidon in the south and searched them for guerrillas ,\" as usual accepting Israeli claims at face value; Syrian \"interception\" of civilian Israeli ships on a simil ar pretext might be regarded a bit differently. Sim ilarly, Israel's hijacking of a Libyan civilian jet on February 4, 1 986 was accepted with equanimity, criticized, if at all, as an error based on faulty intelligence.70 On April 25, 1985, several Palestinians were kidnapped from civi lian boats operating between Lebanon and Cyprus and sent to se cret destinations in Israel, a fact that became pub lic knowledge (in Israel) when one was interviewed on I sraeli television, leading to an appeal to the High Court of Justice for information; presumably there are other s, unknown.71 None of these cases, most of them known only thro ugh incidental comment, arouses any interest or con cern, any more than when it is reported in passing that A rab \"security prisoners\" released in an exchange wi th Syria were in fact \"Druze residents of villages in the Is raeli-annexed portion of the strategic Golan Height s.\"72 It is considered Israel's prerogative to carry out hijack ing of ships and kidnappings, at will, as well as b ombardment of what it will call \"terrorist targets,\" with the approval of articulate opinion in the United States , whatever the facts may be. We might tarry a moment over the Israeli attack o n the island off Tripoli north of Beirut, in which Lebanese fishermen and boy scouts at a camp were killed. Thi s received scant notice, but that is the norm in th e case of such regular Israeli terrorist atrocities, of which this is far from the most serious. Palestinian att acks fare differently. None is remembered with more horror th an the atrocity at Ma'alot in 1974, where 22 member s of a paramilitary youth group were killed in an exchange of fire after Moshe Dayan had refused, over the ob jections of General Mordechai Gur, to consider negotiations on the terrorists' demands for the release of Pales tinian prisoners.73 One might ask why the murder of Lebane se boy scouts is a lesser atrocity - in fact, none at all, since it was perpetrated by \"a country that cares f or human life\" (Washington Post) with a \"high moral purpose\" (Time) perhaps unique in history.74 Two days before the Ma'alot attack, Israeli jets had bombed the Lebanese village of El-Kfeir, killin g four civilians. According to Edward Said, the Ma'alot at tack was \"preceded by weeks of sustained Israeli na palm bombing of Palestinian refugee camps in southern Le banon,\" with over 200 killed. At the time, Israel w as engaged in large-scale scorched earth operations in southern Lebanon, with air, artillery and gunboat attacks"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"and commando operations using shells, bombs, anti-p ersonnel weapons and napalm, with probably thousand s killed (the West could not be troubled, so no accur ate figures are available here) and hundreds of tho usands driven north to slums around Beirut.75 Interest was slight and reporting scanty. None of this is recor ded in the annals of terrorism; nor did it even happen, as far as sanitized history is concerned, though the murd erous Palestinian terrorist attacks of the early 1970s we re (rightly of course) bitterly condemned, and stil l stand as proof that the Palestinians cannot be a partner to negotiations over their fate. Meanwhile the media a re regularly condemned as overly critical of Israel and even \"pr o-PLO\" - a propaganda coup of quite monumental proportions. We might note the interpretation of these events offered by Israeli leaders honored as moderates, fo r example Yitzhak Rabin, who was Ambassador to Washington and then Prime Minister during the period of the worst Israeli atrocities in Lebanon, pre-Camp David 1978: \"we could not ignore the plight of the civil popul ation in southern Lebanon ... It was our humanitarian duty t o aid the population of the area and prevent it fro m being wiped out by the hostile terrorists.\"76 Reviewers o f Rabin's memoirs found nothing amiss in these word s, so effectively has an ideologically serviceable histor y been constructed, and so profound is anti-Arab ra cism in the West. It should also be noted that Israel is not alone in enjoying the right of piracy and hijacking. A T ass report condemning the Achille Lauro hijacking in October 1 985 accused the United States of hypocrisy because two men who hijacked a Soviet airliner, killing a stewa rdess and wounding other crew members, were given r efuge in the U.S., which refused extradition.77 The case is not exactly well known, and the charg e of hypocrisy might appear to have a certain merit . The case is also not unique. Abraham Sofaer, legal advisor t o the State Department, observes that \"During the 1 950s, despite America's strong opposition to aircraft hij ackings, the United States and its Western allies r efused requests from Czechoslovakia, the U.S.S.R., Poland, Yugoslavia and other communist regimes for the ret urn of persons who hijacked planes, trains and ships to es cape.\" Sofaer claims that the U.S. \"reexamined its policy\" in the late 1960s and early 1970s \"when aircraft hijac king reached epidemic proportions\" and was posing \" too serious a problem and too great a threat to the saf ety of innocent passengers to be tolerated.\"78 Fill ing in the blanks, hijacking began to be directed against the U.S. and its allies and thus fell under the categor y of terrorism instead of heroic resistance to oppression. One might also mention the first airplane hijack ing in the Middle East, which is also not familiar fare. It was carried out by Israel in December 1954, when a Syri an airways civilian jet was intercepted by Israeli fighters and forced to land at Lydda airport. Chief of Staff Moshe Dayan's intent was \"to get hostages in order to obtain the release of our prisoners in Damascus,\" Prime Mi nister Moshe Sharett wrote in his personal diary. T he prisoners were Israeli soldiers who had been captur ed on a spy mission inside Syria; it was Dayan, we recall, who, 20 years later, ordered the rescue attempt tha t led to the death of Israeli teenagers in Ma'alot who had been taken hostage in an effort to obtain the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israel. Sharett wrote pri vately that \"we had no justification whatsoever to seize the plane\" and that he had \"no reason to doubt the truth of t he factual affirmation of the U.S. State Department that our a ction was without precedent in the history of inter national practice.\" But the incident has disappeared from hi story, so that Israeli UN Ambassador Benjamin Netan yahu, now a much-admired commentator on international ter rorism, may appear on national television and accus e the PLO of \"inventing\" the hijacking of airplanes and e ven the killing of diplomats, with no fear of contr adiction.79 As for the killing of diplomats, we might only re call the assassination of UN Mediator Folke Bernado tte in 1948 by a terrorist group led by Netanyahu's immedi ate superior, Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir, one of the three commanders who gave the orders for the assass ination (a second, now dead, was a respected commen tator in the Israeli press for many years, as is the thir d). A close friend of David Ben-Gurion privately co nfessed that he was one of the assassins, but Ben-Gurion kept it secret, and the Israeli government arranged for th e escape from prison and departure from the country of those responsible. In his eyewitness account, Zionist hi storian Jon Kimche writes that \"there was no nation-wide ou tcry or determination to catch the perpetrators\" an d \"not much moral indignation.\" \"The attitude of the major ity was that another enemy of the Jews had fallen b y the wayside.\" The assassination \"was condemned, regrett ed and deplored because it would cast reflections o n Israel, and make the work of her diplomats more dif ficult; not because it was wrong in itself to resor t to assassination.\"80"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" Honoring of terrorists who took part in national struggles is quite standard, of course, in the U.S. as well. But in the contrived selective memory, only the actions of enemies find a place as \"the evil scourge of te rrorism.\" After the hijacking of the Achille Lauro in retal iation for the Tunis bombing, the issue of ship hij acking became a major Western concern. A study by Reuters news agency concluded that \"there have been just a handful of ship hijackings since 1961,\" giving a fe w examples by Muslims; the Israeli hijackings were not on the list.81 Hijacking is not the only form of terrorism that escapes this category when it is carried out by our friends. UN Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick explained that the blo wing up of the Greenpeace anti-nuclear protest ship Rainbow Warrior by French agents with one man murde red was not terrorism: \"I'd like to say that the Fr ench clearlydid not intend to attack civilians and bysta nders and maim, torture or kill,\" an appeal that ot her terrorists could offer with ease. In its lead editorial, under the title \"Mitterrand's Finest Hour,\" the Asian Wa ll St. Journal wrote that \"The Greenpeace campaign is fundamentall y violent and dangerous . . . That the French gover nment was prepared to use force against the Rainbow Warri or . . . suggests that the government had its prior ities straight.\" In the New York Times, David Housego rev iews a book on the affair, criticizing the French f or \"blunders\" and \"a bad mistake\"; \"there was no need\" to blow up the ship and the French could have \"gai ned the same objective with far less unfavorable publicity. \" There is no hint that some harsher words might be in order. Given these \"blunders,\" Housego concludes that \"it was difficult to justify not incriminating [Defense Minister] Mr. Hernu and hard to blame the New Zealanders for imprisoning the French officers.\"82 Housego discuss es the comparison with Watergate, missing the major an alogy: in that case too there was a great hullabalo o about \"blunders\" and petty criminality, and much self-con gratulation on the part of the media, while both Co ngress and the media ignored as irrelevant the far more se rious crimes of the Nixon Administration and its predecessors revealed at the same time.83 The emper or is exempt from the charge of terrorism or other crimes, and his allies often share the same privilege. They are guilty at worst of \"blunders.\" George Shultz may well deserve a prize for hypocr isy on this score. While urging an \"active\" drive o n terrorism, he described as \"insidious\" the claim th at \"one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fi ghter\": Freedom fighters or revolutionaries don't blow up b uses containing non-combatants. Terrorist murderers do. Freedom fighters don't assassinate innocent busines smen or hijack innocent men, women and children. Te rrorist murderers do ... The resistance fighters in Afghani stan do not destroy villages or kill the helpless. The Contras in Nicaragua do not blow up school buses or hold ma ss executions of civilians. In fact, the terrorists Shultz commands in Nicaragu a, as he knows, specialize precisely in murderous a ttacks on civilians, with torture, rape, mutilation; their od ious record of terror is well documented, though ig nored and quickly forgotten, even denied by terrorist apologi sts (see note 16). The resistance fighters in Afgha nistan have also carried out brutal atrocities of a sort that w ould evoke fevered denunciations in the West if the attacking forces (who would then be called \"liberators\" actin g in \"self-defense\") were American or Israeli. Only a few months before he spoke, Shultz's UNITA friends in A ngola were boasting of having shot down civilian ai rliners with 266 people killed and had released 26 hostages who had been held as long as nine months, includin g 21 Portuguese, and Spanish and Latin American missiona ries; they had also announced \"a new campaign of ur ban terror,\" Associated Press reported, noting a bombin g in Luanda in which 30 people were killed and more than 70 injured when a jeep loaded with dynamite explode d in the city. They had also captured European teac hers, doctors, and others; some 140 foreigners the press reported, including 16 British technicians \"taken h ostage,\" Jonas Savimbi stated, and not to \"be released until Prime Minister Thatcher offered his organization s ome kind of recognition.\" Such actions continue regularly, e .g., the blowing up of a hotel in April 1986 with 1 7 foreign civilians killed and many wounded. Savimbi \"is one of the few authentic heroes of our times,\" Jeane Kirkpatrick declaimed at a Conservative Political A ction convention where Savimbi \"received enthusiast ic applause after vowing to attack American oil instal lations in his country,\" a plan to kill Americans t hat did not prompt the U.S. to invoke the doctrine of \"self-def ense against future attack\" employed to justify the bombing of \"mad dog\" Qaddafi, just as there was no bombing of Johannesburg when South African mercenaries were captured in May 1985 in northern Angola on a missio n to destroy these facilities and kill Americans. A terrorist state must exercise subtle judgments.84 Savimbi qua lifies as a freedom fighter for Shultz, Kirkpatrick and other leading terrorist commanders and advocates primaril y because \"UNITA is the most extensively backed of South Africa's client groups used to destabilise th e neighbouring states.\"85 As for Shultz's Contra ar mies, their"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"prime task, as noted earlier, is to hold the entire civilian population of Nicaragua hostage under the threat of sadistic terror to compel the government to abandon any commitment to the needs of the poor majority, in preference to the \"moderate\" and \"democratic\" polic y of addressing the transcendent needs of U.S. busi ness and its local associates as in more properly behaved st ates under the U.S. aegis. But in the cultural clim ate in which terrorist commanders and apologists thrive, Shultz' s statements and others like them pass with barely a raised eyebrow. Taking of hostages plainly falls under the rubric of terrorism. There is no doubt, then, that Israel was guilty of a serious act of international terrorism when it re moved some 1,200 prisoners, mainly Lebanese Shi'ite s, to Israel in violation of international law in the cou rse of its retreat from Lebanon, explaining that th ey would be released \"on an unspecified schedule to be determin ed by the security situation in southern Lebanon\" - that is, making it quite clear that they were to be held as hostages, pending a demonstration of \"good behavior \" on the part of the local population kept under guard by Is raeli forces and their mercenaries in the \"security zone\" in southern Lebanon and in surrounding areas. As Mary McGrory observed in a rare departure from general conformity, the prisoners were \"hostages in Israeli jails\"; \"They are not criminals; they were scooped up as insurance against attack when the Israelis were fin ally quitting Lebanon.\" In fact, there was no inten tion to quit southern Lebanon, where Israel retained its \"securi ty zone,\" and even the partial withdrawal was the achievement of the Lebanese resistance. One hundred and forty prisoners had been secretly removed to I srael in November 1983 in violation of an agreement with the Red Cross to release them in a prisoner exchange, after the closing (temporary, as it turned out) of the An sar prison camp, the scene of brutal atrocities, fr equently described as a \"concentration camp\" by Israelis who served or visited there and were sickened by the b arbarous behavior of the captors. The prisoners were refused even Red Cross visits until July 1984. Israeli Def ense Ministry spokesman Nachman Shai stated that 400 of the 766 still in custody in June 1985 had been arre sted for \"terrorist activities\" - meaning resistance to the Israeli military occupation - while \"the rest were arrested for less violent forms of political activism or organiz ing activities designed to undermine the Israeli Ar my presence in Lebanon, Mr. Shai indicated.\"86 Israel had promised to release 340 of the hostage s on June 10, \"but canceled the release at the last minute for security reasons that were never fully explained.\"8 7 Four days later, Lebanese Shi'ites, reported to b e friends and relatives of the Israeli-held hostages,88 hijac ked TWA flight 847, taking hostages in an attempt t o free the hostages held by Israel, evoking another bout of we ll-orchestrated hysteria in the United States, with overt racist undertones and numerous condemnations of the media for allowing the hijackers an occasional opportunity to explain their position, thus interfe ring with the discipline deemed appropriate within a free society. The Israeli kidnappers needed no special a ccess to the U.S. media, which were delighted to de liver their message for them, often as \"news.\" The media are commonly condemned for \"supporting terrorism\" by allowing terrorists to express their position; the reference is not to the regular appea rance of Ronald Reagan, George Shultz, Elliott Abra ms and other leading commanders or advocates of terrorism, who present their messages without any rebuttal or comment, providing the framework of concepts and as sumptions for news reporting and commentary. The press dismissed with ridicule the statements of the TWA 847 hijackers that they wished to secur e the release of the Israeli-held hostages - who were not hostages in U.S. parlance, since they were held by \"our side.\" The absurdity of the Shi'ite pretense was ea sily exposed. The distinguished commentator Flora L ewis explained that \"it is out of character for militant Shi'ites, who extol martyrdom and show little relu ctance to take the lives of others, to be so concerned with the ti ming of the prisoners' return,\" another version of the useful concept that the lower orders feel no pain. Citing no evidence, the Times editors alleged that \"Israel had planned to appease the resentful Shi'ites last week [that is, a few days prior to the TWA hijacking], but was delayed by the kidnapping of some Finnish U.N. troo ps in Lebanon\"; in a 90-word news item, the Times h ad noted the charge by Finland that during this entire ly unrelated event, \"Israeli officers had watched L ebanese militiamen beat up kidnapped Finnish soldiers servi ng with the United Nations in Lebanon, but had done nothing to help them\" while they \"were beaten with iron bars, water hoses and rifles by members of the South Lebanon Army.\" \"There are crimes aplenty here,\" the Times thundered, denouncing the TWA hijackers, the Greek authorities (for their laxity), and even the United States - for \"having failed to punish Iran f or sheltering the killers of two Americans in a hijacking last ye ar\" (see note 77). But the Israeli hostage-taking w as not one of these crimes.89"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" Princeton Middle East historian Bernard Lewis, h is scholarly reputation rendering evidence irreleva nt, asserted unequivocally that \"the hijackers or those who sent them must have known perfectly well that the Israelis were already planning to release the Shi'i te and other Lebanese captives, and that a public c hallenge of this kind could only delay, rather than accelerate, their release.\" They could proceed \"to challenge A merica, to humiliate Americans\" because they knew that the sup ine media would \"provide them with unlimited public ity and perhaps even some form of advocacy.\" Recall tha t this is the voice of a respected scholar in a res pected journal, a fact that once again yields some insight into the reigning intellectual culture. The editor s of the New Republic dismissed the Shi'ite plea for release of the Israeli-held hostages as \"perfect rubbish\": \"Hi jacking, kidnapping, murder, and massacre are the way Shi'it es and other factions in Lebanon do their political business,\" and \"Everyone knew\" that the Israeli-hel d prisoners were scheduled for release - when Israe l was good and ready, if ever. President Reagan escalated the hysteria yet another notch, explaining that th e \"real goal\" of the terrorists is \"to expel America from t he world,\" no less. Norman Podhoretz, noting that u se of force would probably have led to the death of American ho stages, denounced Reagan for failing \"to risk life itself [namely, the lives of others] in defense of the nat ional honor\"; New York Mayor Edward Koch called for the bombing of Lebanon and Iran, and others struck appr opriate heroic poses.90 Meanwhile, the careful reader could discover buri ed in news reports on the hostage crisis that 2,000 Lebanese Shi'ites, including 700 children, fled their homes under shelling by Israel's South Lebanon Army, who also shot at jeeps of the UN peacekeeping forces, while \"a co mbined force of Israeli troops and Christian-led mi litiamen swept into a south Lebanese village today and seize d 19 Shi'ite men, a United Nations spokesman announced.\"91 After the hijacking, Israel began to release its hostages according to its own timetable, perhaps ac celerated because the TWA hijacking had focused international attention on its own vastly more significant kidna pping operations. When 300 were released on July 3, Assoc iated Press reported their testimony that they were tortured and starved, while Thomas Friedman of the Times hea rd only that \"we were treated well by the Israelis ...\" Reagan wrote a letter to Shimon Peres \"saying that the Beirut hostage crisis has strengthened relation s between their countries\"; nothing was said about the other \"hostage crisis,\" which has been deleted from offic ial history.92 The Israeli actions would qualify as hostage-taki ng were it not that as a client of the emperor who molests the world, Israel is exempt from this charge. But it is important to stress, repeatedly, the nature of the Orwellian concepts of contemporary political discourse, in wh ich such terms as \"terrorism\" and \"hostage\" are con strued so as to exclude some of the most extreme examples, as in Nicaragua or southern Lebanon, where entire populations are held hostage to ensure obedience to the foreign master. Keeping just to the Middle East, we should recog nize that at some level the matter is well understo od by the organizers of international terrorism. The reason f or the savage attack on southern Lebanon through th e 1970s was explained by the Israeli diplomat Abba Eban, co nsidered a leading dove: \"there was a rational pros pect, ultimately fulfilled, that affected populations wou ld exert pressure for the cessation of hostilities. \" Translating into plain language: the population of southern Leb anon was being held hostage to exert pressure on th em to compel the Palestinians to accept the status assign ed to them by the Labor government represented by E ban, who had declared that the Palestinians \"have no rol e to play\" in any peace settlement.93 Chief of Staf f Mordechai Gur explained in 1978 that \"For 30 years ... we have been fighting against a population that lives in villages and cities.\" He noted such incidents as th e bombing of the Jordanian city of Irbid and the ex pulsion by bombing of tens of thousands of inhabitants of the Jordan valley and a million and a half civilians fr om the Suez Canal, among other examples, all part of the p rogram of holding civilian populations hostage in a n effort to prevent resistance to the political settlement t hat Israel imposed by force, and then proceeded to maintain while rejecting the possibility of political settle ment, for example, Sadat's offer of a full peace tr eaty on the internationally recognized Egypt-Israel border in 1 971. Israel's regular practice of \"retaliation\" aga inst defenseless civilian targets unrelated to the sourc e of terrorist acts (themselves, often retaliation for earlier Israeli terrorism, and so on, through the familiar, ugly cycle) also reflects the same conception, a d eparture, by the early 1950s, from Ben-Gurion's earlier dictum t hat \"reaction is inefficient\" unless it is precisel y focused: \"If we know the family - [we must] strike mercilessly, women and children included.\"94"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" Gur's understanding of Israel's wars is widely s hared among the military command. During the Iron F ist operations of early 1985, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin warned that if necessary, Israel would conduc t \"a policy of scorched earth as was the case in the Jor dan Valley during the war of attrition\" with Egypt. \"Lebanon is a more serious source of terror than it was in 1 982,\" he added, with Shi'ite terrorists now holding Western Europe in fear (they did not do so prior to the Isr aeli invasion of 1982, for unexplained reasons), so that Israel must maintain a zone in the south in which \"we may intervene.\" The veteran paratroop commander Dubik Tamari, who gave the orders to level the Palestinia n camp of Ain el-Hilweh by air and artillery bombar dment \"to save lives\" of troops under his command (anothe r exercise of the fabled \"purity of arms\"), justifi ed the action with the comment that \"the State of Israel h as been killing civilians from 1947,\" \"purposely ki lling civilians\" as \"one goal among others.\"95 Tamari cited as an example the attack on Qibya in 1953, when Ariel Sharon's Unit 101 killed some 70 Arab villagers in their homes in alleged retaliation for a terrorist attack with which they had no connecti on whatsoever; Ben-Gurion pretended on Israeli radio t hat the villagers were killed by Israeli civilians enraged by Arab terror, \"mostly refugees, people from Arab cou ntries and survivors from the Nazi concentration ca mps,\" dismissing the \"fantastic allegation\" that Israeli military forces were involved - a brazen lie which, furthermore, placed Israeli settlements under threat of retaliat ion for this cold-blooded massacre. Less known is t he fact that a month before the Qibya massacre, Moshe Dayan had sent Unit 101 to drive 4,000 Bedouins of the Azzazm a and Tarbin tribes across the Egyptian border, anoth er step in expulsions that had been proceeding from 1950, shortly after the cease-fire. In March 1954, eleven Israelis were murdered in an ambush of a bus in th e Eastern Negev by members of the Azzazma tribe (\"unprovoked terrorism\"), evoking an Israeli raid on the complet ely unrelated Jordanian village of Nahaleen with nine v illagers killed (\"retaliation\"). In August 1953, Sh aron's Unit 101 had killed 20 people, two-thirds of whom were w omen and children, at the al-Bureig refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, in \"retaliation\" for infiltration.96 The cycle of \"retaliation\" (by Israel) and \"terro r\" (by Palestinians) can be traced back step-by-ste p for many years, an exercise that will quickly reveal that th e terminology belongs to the realm of propaganda, n ot factual description. Here too we might note how effectively history ha s been reconstructed in a more serviceable form. Th us Thomas Friedman, reviewing \"Israel's counterterrori sm\" strategy, writes that \"the first period, from 1 948 to 1956, might best be described as the era of counter terrorism-through-retaliation, or negative feedback ,\" though \"at least one of these retaliations became highly c ontroversial, involving civilian casualties,\" the r eference presumably being to Qibya. The record of scholarshi p on terrorism is often hardly different.97 The Iron Fist operations of the Israeli Army in s outhern Lebanon in early 1985 were also guided by t he logic outlined by Eban. The civilian population were held hostage under the threat of terror to ensure that they accept the political arrangements dictated by Israel in so uthern Lebanon and the occupied territories. The wa rnings remain in effect; the population remain hostages, w ith no concern in the superpower that finances thes e operations and bars any meaningful political settle ment. While wholesale terrorism, including the holding of hostages, is exempt from censure when conducted by an approved source, the same is true of smaller-scale operations, as already illustrated. To mention a fe w other cases, in November-December 1983, Israel \"made it c lear that it would not allow Arafat's forces to eva cuate the city [Tripoli, in northern Lebanon, where they were under attack by Syrian-backed forces] as long as t he fate of the Israeli prisoners was in doubt.\" Israel therefo re bombed what were called \"guerrilla positions,\" p reventing the departure of Greek ships that were to evacuate Arafat loyalists. Druze spokesmen reported that a h ospital was hit during the bombing and strafing of \"what we re described as Palestinian bases,\" east of Beirut, while in Tripoli, \"One already-gutted cargo ship took a dire ct hit and sank\" and \"a freighter burst into flames when it was hit.\"98 Here too the population, as well as foreign vess els, were held hostage to ensure the release of Isr aeli prisoners captured in the course of Israel's aggression in Le banon. There was no comment in the U.S. on this fur ther atrocity."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" In Lebanon and the Mediterranean Sea Israel carr ies out attacks with impunity and abandon. In mid-J uly 1985, Israeli warplanes bombed and strafed Palestin ian camps near Tripoli, killing at least 20 people, most of them civilians, including six children under twelve . \"Clouds of smoke and dust engulfed the Tripoli re fugee camps, home to more than 25,000 Palestinians, for s everal hours after the 2:55 p.m. attack,\" which was assumed to be retaliation for two car-bomb attacks a few days earlier in Israel's \"security zone\" in s outhern Lebanon by a group aligned with Syria. Two weeks la ter, Israeli gunboats attacked a Honduran-registere d cargo ship a mile from the port of Sidon, delivering ceme nt according to its Greek captain, setting it ablaz e with 30 shells and wounding civilians in subsequent shore b ombardment when militiamen returned the fire. The mainstream press did not even bother to report that the following day Israeli gunboats sank a fishing boat and damaged three others, while a Sidon parliamentarian called on the UN to end U.S.-backed Israeli \"pirac y.\" The press did report what Israel called a \"surgical\" op eration against \"terrorist installations\" near Baal bek in the Bekaa valley in January 1984, killing about 100 peo ple, mostly civilians, with 400 wounded, including 150 children in a bombed-out schoolhouse. The \"terroris t installations\" also included a mosque, a hotel, a restaurant, stores and other buildings in the three Lebanese vi llages and Palestinian refugee camp that were attac ked, while Beirut news reported that a cattle market and an in dustrial park were also struck with scores of house s destroyed. A Reuters reporter in the bombed village s said that a second round of bombing began ten min utes after the first, \"adding to the number of those kil led or wounded\" since men and women had begun dragg ing dead and wounded from the wrecked buildings. He saw \"lots of children\" in hospitals while witnesses re ported men and women rushing to schools in a frantic searc h for their children. The leader of Lebanon's Shi'i tes denounced \"Israeli barbarism,\" describing the attac ks on \"innocent civilians, hospitals and houses of worship\" as an attempt \"to terrorize the Lebanese people.\" B ut the incident passed without comment, in no way a ffecting Israel's status as \"a country that cares for human life\" (Washington Post), so we may conclude again t hat the victims of this surgical bombing were less than hum an.\" One may, again, imagine what the reaction would be in the West, including the \"pro-Arab\" media, if the PLO or Syria were to carry out a \"surgical strike\" agai nst \"terrorist installations\" near Tel Aviv, killin g 100 civilians and wounding 400 others, including 150 children in a bombed-out schoolhouse along with other civilian victims. While the standard version in the United States i s that Israeli violence, perhaps excessive at times , is \"retaliation\" for Arab atrocities, Israel, like the United States, claims much broader rights: the rig ht to carry out terrorist attacks to prevent potential actions agai nst it, as in the justification for the Lebanon war by the dovish Knesset member Amnon Rubinstein cited earlier. Isra eli troops carry out what they call \"preventative g unfire\" as they patrol in Lebanon, spraying the terrain wit h machinegun fire, leading Irish peacekeeping force s to block the road in protest. Quite commonly, Israeli attack s in Lebanon were described as \"preventive, not pun itive,\" for example, the bombing and strafing of Palestinia n refugee camps and nearby villages by 30 Israeli j ets on December 2, 1975, apparently in retaliation for the decision of the UN Security Council to debate a pe ace proposal vetoed by the U.S., accordingly excised fr om history.100 Similarly, when Israeli airborne and amphibious forces attacked Tripoli in northern Leba non in February 1973, killing 31 people (mainly civ ilians) according to the Lebanese authorities, and destroyi ng classrooms, clinics and other buildings, Israel justified the raid as \"intended to forestall a number of planned terrorist attacks against Israelis overseas.\"101 The pattern is regular, and the justifications ar e accepted as legitimate, again reflecting the stat us of Israel as a useful client-state and the subhuman status of its victims. The last case mentioned occurred on the day that Israel shot down a Libyan civilian airliner lost i n a sandstorm two minutes' flight time from Cairo, towa rds which it was heading, with 110 people killed. T he U.S. officially expressed its sympathy to the families o f those involved, but the press spokesman \"declined to discuss with reporters the Administration's feelings about the incident.\" Israel blamed the French pilot, with the New York Times dutifully in tow, accepting the Israeli claim that the pilot knew he had been ordered to la nd but instead resorted to \"highly suspicious\" evasive act ion -the justification offered by the USSR for down ing KAL 007102 - so that the Israeli act was \"at worst... a n act of callousness that not even the savagery of previous Arab actions can excuse.\" The official Israeli reaction was given by Prime Minister Golda Meir: \"the government of Israel exp resses its deep sorrow for the loss of human life and is sorry that the Libyan [sic] pilot did not respond to the warnings"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"given him in accordance with international practice ,\" while Shimon Peres added that \"Israel acted in a ccordance with international laws.\" Israel falsely claimed th at the pilot was not authorized to fly the jet plan e. \"The press was forbidden to publish pictures of the destroyed plane, of the dead and the wounded,\" Amiram Cohen observes in a detailed analysis of the Israeli reac tion (undertaken after the KAL 007 atrocity), and \" journalists were not allowed to visit the hospital in Beersheba and to interview survivors,\" all part of a \"disinf ormation\" effort. The international reaction was dismissed by the Israeli press as yet another demonstration tha t \"the spirit of anti-Semitism flourishes\" in Europe, virtually a reflex response, in the U.S. as well, when someone dares to mention or criticize an Israeli crime. The Israeli press insisted that \"Israel is not responsible\" and that \"one must blame the [French] pilot.\" It was \"a mobilized pres s,\" firm in support of the justice of Israel's acti ons, Cohen observes. After numerous fabrications, Israel confi rmed that there had been an \"error of judgment,\" ag reeing to make ex gratia payments to the families of victims \"in deference to humanitarian considerations\" while denying any \"guilt\" or Israeli responsibility.103 The incident was passed over quickly in the Unite d States, with little criticism of the perpetrators of the crime. Prime Minister Golda Meir arrived in the U.S. four days later; she was troubled by few embarrassing qu estions by the press and returned home with new gifts of mi litary aircraft. The reaction was slightly differen t when the Russians shot down KAL 007 in September 1983,104 th ough it was comparable when Washington's UNITA friends claimed to have shot down two civilian airl iners at the same time. It is not difficult to disc ern the criteria for \"international terrorism.\" The record of Israeli terrorism goes back to the origins of the state - indeed, long before - includ ing the massacre of 250 civilians and brutal expulsion of 7 0,000 others from Lydda and Ramie in July 1948; the massacre of hundreds of others at the undefended vi llage of Doueimah near Hebron in October 1948 in an other of the numerous \"land-clearing operations\" conducte d while the international propaganda apparatus was proclaiming, as it still does, that the Arabs were fleeing at the call of their leaders; the murder of several hundred Palestinians by the IDF after the conquest of the Gaza strip in 1956; the slaughters in Qibya, Kafr Kassem, and a string of other assassinated villages ; the expulsion of thousands of Bedouins from the demilitarized zones shortly after the 1948 war and thousands more from northeastern Sinai in the early 1970s, their villages destroyed, to open the region for Je wish settlement; and on, and on. The victims, by de finition, are \"PLO partisans,\" hence terrorists. Thus the respect ed editor of Ha'aretz, Gershom Schocken, can write that Ariel Sharon \"made a name for himself from the earl y 1950s as a ruthless fighter against Palestine Lib eration Organization (PLO) partisans,\" referring to the sla ughter of civilians he conducted at Al-Bureig and Q ibya in 1953 (long before the PLO existed). And the victims in Lebanon and elsewhere are also \"terrorists,\" as must be the case, or they could not have been killed by a s tate that is so devoted to \"purity of arms\" and is held to a \"higher law\" by the \"pro-Arab\" American press. The terrorist commanders are honored. When the le ading contemporary U.S. terrorist took over the Pre sidency in 1981, Israel's Prime Minister and Foreign Minist er were both notorious terrorist commanders while t he highest position in the Jewish Agency was held by a man who had murdered several dozen civilians he wa s holding under guard in a mosque in a Lebanese town during yet another land-clearing operation in 1948, to be quickly amnestied, all trace of the crime removed f rom the record, and granted a lawyer's license on t he grounds that \"no stigma\" could be attached to his a ct.105 Even terrorism against Americans is tolerable. T he Israeli terrorist attacks against U.S. installat ions (also, public places) in Egypt in 1954 in an attempt to ex acerbate U.S.-Egyptian relations and abort secret p eace negotiations then in progress were ignored at the t ime and are barely remembered, much as in the case of the attempt to sink the U.S. spy ship Liberty in intern ational waters in 1967 by Israeli bombers and torpe do boats that even shot lifeboats out of the water in an eff ort to ensure that no one would escape, with 34 cre wmen killed and 171 injured, the worst peacetime U.S. naval dis aster of the century, but dismissed as an \"error\" - a transparent absurdity - and barely known.106 Simila rly, torture of Americans by the Israeli Army in th e West Bank and southern Lebanon is barely noted in the me dia, with Israeli denials highlighted and verificat ion by the U.S. Ambassador in Israel ignored.107 The fact that the victims were Arab-Americans no doubt serves as justification, by the operative standards. What is striking about this record, which includ es ample terrorism against Jews as well from the ea rliest days, is that it in no way sullies Israel's reputation in the United States for moral standards unequalled i n history."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Each new act of terrorism, if noted at all, is quic kly dismissed and forgotten, or described as a temp orary deviation, to be explained by the hideous nature of the enemy which is forcing Israel to depart, if on ly for a moment, from its path of righteousness. Meanwhile t he media are regularly denounced for their \"double standard\" as they ignore Arab crimes while holding Israel to impossible standards, and respected schol ars inform us soberly that \"numerous public figures in the West, even a number of Western governments\" (naturally, all unnamed) have encouraged the PLO to destroy Israel.108 Across the political spectrum i n the United States and among the educated classes with r emarkable uniformity and only the most marginal of exceptions, the prevailing doctrine is that it is t he terrorism of the Palestinians and their Arab all ies, urged on by the Kremlin, their unremitting commitment to kill J ews and destroy Israel and their refusal to conside r any political settlement, that is the root cause of the endless Arab-Israeli conflict, of which Israel is the pathetic victim. As for the United States, it is courageousl y struggling against \"the evil scourge of terrorism ,\" from Central America to Lebanon and beyond.

But the recent co mmentary on \"terrorism\" in the \"civilized countries \" reeks of hypocrisy, and can only be an object of contempt among decent people."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Part 3. Libya in U.S. Demonology (1986) Within the American doctrinal system, no one so epi tomizes \"the evil scourge of terrorism\" as Muammar Qaddafi, the \"mad dog\" of the Arab world; and Libya under his leadership has become the very model of a terrorist state. The description of Libya under Qaddafi as a terro rist state is certainly just. Reviewing the major a cts of terrorism plausibly attributed to Libya, the latest Amnesty International (AI) Report lists the killin gs of 14 Libyan citizens by this terrorist state, four abroa d, through 1985.l In the course of the hysteria orc hestrated to serve other ends, all sorts of charges have been ma de, but the record confirms the April 1986 statemen t of a senior U.S. intelligence official that until \"a few weeks ago, [Qaddafi] had used his people primarily to assassinate Libyan dissidents.\"2 \"A few weeks ago,\" this intelligence official continues, Qaddafi \"mad e a clear decision to target Americans.\" This alleged decisio n, which has assumed the aura of indubitable fact t hough no credible evidence has yet been provided to substant iate it, followed the Gulf of Sidra incident, when a U.S. air and naval armada sank Libyan vessels off the coast of Libya with many killed. Furthermore, the alleged Libyan decision would be entirely legitimate, indeed lauda ble and much belated, under the doctrines professed by the U.S. executive and endorsed by respected commentato rs, some already cited, others to which we turn dir ectly. AI reports that Libya's terrorist killings began in early 1980, at the time when Jimmy Carter was ov erseeing the escalation of the terrorist war in El Salvador, with Jose Napoleon Duarte joining as a cover to en sure that arms would flow to the killers. While Libya was kil ling 14 of its own citizens, along with a handful o f others, the U.S. client regime of El Salvador killed some 5 0,000 of its citizens in the course of what Bishop Rivera y Damas, who succeeded the assassinated Archbishop Ro mero, described in October 1980, after seven months of terror, as \"a war of extermination and genocide aga inst a defenseless civilian population.\"3 The secur ity forces who perform these necessary chores were hailed by D uarte, a few weeks later, for their \"valiant servic e alongside the people against subversion\" while he c onceded that \"the masses were with the guerrillas\" when this exercise began under the Carter-Duarte allianc e. Duarte expressed this praise for the mass murder ers as he was sworn in as President of the Junta in an effort to lend it legitimacy after the murder of four Ame rican churchwomen, an act generally regarded as improper, though justifications were offered even for that c rime by Jeane Kirk-patrick and Alexander Haig. Meanwhile th e media assured us that \"There is no real argument that most of the estimated 10,000 political fatalities i n 1980 were victims of government forces or irregul ars associated with them\" (Washington Post), though it was later quietly conceded that at the time, offici als of the Carter Administration were informing the media that \"security forces were responsible for 90 percent o f the atrocities,\" not \"'uncontrollable' right-wing bands \" as the press had been reporting.4 From the earlie st days of the Carter-Reagan terrorist operations in El Salvad or, Duarte's primary role had been to ensure that t here will be no impediment to the slaughter while denying well-d ocumented atrocities or justifying them on the grou nds that the victims are \"Communists.\" He played this role t o mounting applause in the United States as the sav age assault against the civilian population had its int ended effect of destroying the threat of meaningful democracy that had arisen in the 1970s with the rise of churc h-based self-help groups, peasant associations, uni ons, and other \"popular organizations.\" The conservative Cen tral America correspondent of the London Spectator observes that the death squads \"did exactly what th ey were supposed to do: they decapitated the trade unions and mass organisations\" and caused the survivors \"e ither to flee the country or to join the guerrillas ,\" at which point the U.S. war against the rural population mov ed into high gear, with ample terror and massacre. It is only natural, then, that the editors of the New Republic , who had urged Reagan to pursue the slaughter with no concern for human rights (\"there are higher America n priorities\") and \"regardless of how many are murd ered,\" should look with pleasure at these accomplishments in El Salvador, which is \"the real model for suppor ting the push toward democracy in our sphere.\" The continuin g terror, documented by Americas Watch, AI, and - v ery rarely - by the media, is a matter of indifference. 5 The slaughter in El Salvador is not mere state te rrorism on a remarkable scale, but international te rrorism, given the organization, supply, training and direct participation by the ruler of the hemisphere. The same is true of the massacre of some 70,000 Guatemalans in the s ame years, when U.S. arms to the murderers flowed a t close to the normal level contrary to what is commo nly alleged, though it was necessary to call in U.S . proxies - neo-Nazi Argentine generals, Taiwan, and Israel - t o implement the slaughter more efficiently; the U.S . government also constructed an arms pipeline involv ing Belgium and other collaborators, under the ille gal direction of the Pentagon and the CIA, as a supplem ent. Meanwhile, as the terror reached its peak of s avagery,"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Reagan and his associates extolled the killers and torturers for their human rights improvements and \" total dedication to democracy,\" dismissing the flood of d ocumentation on atrocities as a \"bum rap.\"6 U.S. international terrorism in El Salvador is h ailed as a substantial achievement because it laid the basis for the preferred version of \"democracy\": the rule of g roups serving U.S. requirements with the public red uced to occasional ratification of elite decision now that the popular organizations, which might have provide d a basis for meaningful democracy, have been \"decapitated\" a nd decimated. In 1982 and 1984 the United States organized what Edward Herman and Frank Brodhead cal l \"demonstration elections\" to pacify the home fron t, carried out in an atmosphere of \"terror and despair , macabre rumor and grisly reality,\" in the words o f the observers of the British Parliamentary Human Rights Group, while U.S. commentators lauded this demonstration of commitment to democracy.7 Guatemal a is also considered a success, for similar reasons . When half the population is virtually marched to th e polls after it has been properly traumatized by U .S.-backed violence, enlightened commentators are overjoyed at this renewed demonstration of our love for democra cy, untroubled by the rise in death squad killings and the open recognition by the newly elected president that he can do nothing given the roots of actual power in t he military and the oligarchy and that the civilian government are merely \"the managers of bankruptcy a nd misery.\"8 These two examples represent only a part of the U .S. role in international terrorism during the 1980 s, and the grisly record goes back many years. \"The striking feature of Libyan atrocities,\" two commentators observe in reviewing the AI study of state terror, \"is that they are the only ones whose numbe rs are sufficiently limited that the individual cas es can be enumerated,\" in striking contrast to Argentina, Ind onesia, or the Central American states where the em peror molests the world.9 In short, Libya is indeed a terrorist state, but in the world of international terrorism, it is a bi t player. Those who believe that it is possible to find a l evel of vulgarity and apologetics for mass slaughte r and terror that will not be reached in respectable Western pub lications can be disabused of such illusions by con sideration of numerous examples during the worst years of the terror in Central America,10 or by turning to the n eo- conservative journal The National Interest, where t hey can read, in a critique of the Washington Post for being soft on Libya, that \"There is no doubt that if, for example, the government of Jose Napoleon Duarte in El Salvador or any recent government in Turkey had car ried out anywhere near the number of executions tha t Qaddafi has, the Post would have provided us with g reat detail, and would have reported the existence of considerable opposition.\"11 Not only is \"terrorism\" defined for ideological s erviceability, as discussed earlier, but standards of evidence are also set so as to achieve the emperor's goals. To demonstrate Libya's role as a state terrorist, t he flimsiest evidence, or none at all, will suffice. The headlin e of a New York Times editorial justifying the terr orist attack that killed some 100 people in Libya (according to press reports from the scene at the time) reads: \"T o Save the Next Natasha Simpson.\" The reference is to the elev en-year-old American girl who was one of the victim s of the terrorist attacks in the Rome and Vienna air te rminals on December 27, 1985; these victims entitle us to bomb Libyan cities \"to discourage state-supported t errorism,\" the editors of the Times solemnly declar e. It is only a minor defect that no evidence has been prese nted to implicate Libya in these actions. The Itali an and Austrian governments stated that the terrorists wer e trained in Syrian-controlled areas of Lebanon and had come via Damascus, a conclusion reiterated by Israe li Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Four months late r, in response to U.S. claims about Libyan involvement in the Vienna attack, the Austrian Minister of Interi or stated that \"there is not the slightest evidence to implic ate Libya,\" again citing Syria as the connection an d adding that Washington had never presented the evidence of Liby an complicity it had promised to provide to the Aus trian authorities. He also added the correct but - in the U.S. - inexpressible comment that the problem of L ebanese- based terrorism lies largely in the failure to solv e the Palestine problem, which has led desperate pe ople to turn to violence, the result perhaps intended by U.S.-Is raeli terrorism, as discussed in chapter 2.12 A few months later, Italy's Interior Minister, wh ile signing an agreement with the U.S. for cooperat ion in \"the fight against terrorism,\" reiterated the position e xpressed by Italy \"since January\" that they suspect ed a Syrian"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"source for the Rome and Vienna attacks. The Times r eported his statement without, however, feeling any need to comment on the righteous blow of retaliation aga inst Libya that they had applauded in April.13 If an individual implicated in a terrorist act o nce paid a visit to Libya, or is alleged to have re ceived training or funds from Libya in the past, that suffices for condemnation of Qaddafi as a \"mad dog\" who must be eradicated. The same standards would implicate the CIA in the murderous exploits of Cuban exiles, amon g numerous others. Keeping just to 1985, one of the s uspects in the bombing of the Air India jumbo jet n ear Ireland that was the year's worst terrorist act, ki lling 329 people, was apparently trained in a train ing camp for mercenaries in Alabama. U.S. Attorney-General Meese , visiting India nine months later, made a barely r eported statement that the U.S. was taking steps \"to preven t terrorists from obtaining training or resources i n the United States,\" referring to the private military training camps that India has charged have trained Sikh ext remists; no evidence has been produced to support Meese's promi se, nor has there been any investigation, to my knowledge.14 The terrorist action that took the mos t lives in the Middle East was a car-bombing in Bei rut in March that killed 80 people and wounded several hun dred, carried out by a Lebanese intelligence unit t rained and supported by the CIA, in an effort to kill a Sh i'ite leader who was believed to have been involved in \"terrorist attacks against U.S. installations\" in B eirut;15 the term \"terrorism\" is commonly used by f oreign forces in reference to actions against them by the local population that sees them as occupiers attemp ting to impose a detested political settlement instituted b y a foreign invasion, in this case, Israel's \"New O rder.\" By the standards of evidence used in the case of Libya, on e would have to conclude that the U.S. was once aga in the world's leading terrorist power in 1985, even if we exclude the wholesale terrorism ruled ineligible b y the doctrinal system. Continuing to 1986, among the most serious terro rist acts in the Middle East/Mediterranean region a s of the time of writing, apart from Israel's continuing ter rorism in southern Lebanon, are the U.S. bombing of Libya and the bombings in Syria which, according to the r adio station of Lebanon President Amin Gemayel's Phalangist party, killed more than 150 people in Ap ril, blamed by Syria on Israeli agents with no repo rted evidence, but no less credibility than similar U.S. charges against whoever happens to be the villain of the day - and, incidentally, not falling within \"the evil sco urge of terrorism.\"16 The U.S., of course, disclaims responsibility for the actions of terrorists it has trained: Cubans, Lebanese, mass murderers such as Rios Montt in Guatemala, and nume rous others in Latin America and elsewhere. In the case of the Lebanon bombing, for example, the CIA denied involvement though this denial was \"disputed by so me Administration and Congressional officials who said that the agency was working with the group at the time of the bombing,\" a conclusion also drawn by a Washingt on Post inquiry, which determined that Washington cancelled the covert operation after the bombing, c onducted without CIA authorization.17 Even if we ac cept the claim that the CIA did not authorize the bombin g and was no longer involved with the terrorist gro up it had trained, the government's excuse is readily dismiss ed by the standards applied to official enemies by apologists for U.S. and Israeli terrorism, both in the governm ent and the media. Recall that \"the larger moral re sponsibility for atrocities ... is all Yasir Arafat's\" because \" he was, and remains, the founding father of contemp orary Palestinian violence,\" and thus the U.S. will hold Arafat \"accountable for acts of international terro rism\" quite generally, whether he is involved or not.18 By the same logic, we must conclude that \"the larger moral responsibility\" in the cases mentioned and much els e is \"all Washington's,\" which must be held account able whatever the facts about direct involvement. As noted in the preface, the Reagan campaign agai nst \"international terrorism\" was a natural choice for the doctrinal system in furtherance of its basic agenda : expansion of the state sector of the economy, tra nsfer of resources from the poor to the rich, and a more \"ac tivist\" foreign policy. Such policies are facilitat ed if the public can be frightened into obedience by some ter rible enemy threatening to destroy us, though it is necessary to avoid, as too dangerous, direct confrontation wi th the Great Satan himself. International terrorism by the Evil Empire's proxies is an obvious candidate, and the A dministration's PR specialists turned at once to th e task of concocting the appropriate web of half-truths and d eceit, anticipating that the charade would be taken seriously. Libya fits the need perfectly. Qaddafi is easy to hate, particularly against the background of rampa nt anti-Arab racism in the United States and the commitment of t he political class and articulate Intellectuals to U.S.-Israeli rejectionism. He has created an ugly and repressive society, and is indeed guilty of terrorism, primar ily against Libyans, so it appears. Qaddafi's execution of Liby an dissidents, his major recorded terrorist acts, m ight have"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"been prevented according to U.S. and Israeli intell igence analysts, but with the possible consequence of revealing that the (apparently quite transparent) L ibyan codes had been broken. \"An Israeli analyst pu t it more bluntly: 'Why expose our sources and methods for th e sake of some Libyans?'\"19 Furthermore, Libya is w eak and defenseless so that martial flourishes and, whe n needed, murder of Libyans can be conducted with impunity. The glorious military victory in Grenada, a culmination of the hostility and aggressiveness of the Carter-Reagan Administrations after the Bishop gove rnment threatened to consider the needs of the poor majority, served similar ends. The point is readily perceived abroad. American journalist Donald Neff, writing in a British publication about the March 1986 Gulf of Sidra incident, comments that this was less of a Rambo-style operation than a dem onstration of the bully on the block picking a figh t. It was typical of Reagan. In his five years in office, he has repeatedly got away with lording it over little guys. He did this time too. It is an interesting fact that this regular show of cowardice and two-bit thuggery seems to strike a responsive chord, sometimes abroad as well. British commentato r Paul Johnson denounces the \"distasteful whiff of pure cowardice in the air\" as \"the wimps\" raise doubts a bout the U.S. bombing of \"terrorist bases\" (that is , civilian targets) in Libya. He gushes with admiration for \"t he strength of the Cowboy,\" who demonstrates his co urage by sending his bombers to murder defenseless civili ans.20 The PR specialists of the Reagan Administration u nderstood the utility of the Libyan enemy and waste d little time in confronting this ominous foe. Libya was at once designated as a prime agent of the Soviet-insp ired \"terror network,\" and in July 1981, a CIA plan to o verthrow and possibly kill Qaddafi with a paramilit ary campaign of terror within Libya was leaked to the p ress.21 We may note parenthetically that by U.S. standard s, this plan authorized Qaddafi to carry out acts o f terror against American targets in \"self-defense against f uture attack,\" the words of White House spokesman L arry Speakes presenting the official justification for t he bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi. The same justif ication was reiterated at the United Nations by Vernon Walt ers and Herbert Okun. The Administration even went so far as to argue that this stance - which if adopted by other violent states would tear to shreds what litt le remains of global order and international law - is in accord w ith the United Nations Charter. No form of legal so phistry can bridge that gap, but the Administration assumed tha t \"it would play well in Peoria\" - or at least in C ambridge, New York and Washington. At the extreme left-libera l end of the permissible spectrum, Reagan was duly acclaimed by New York Times legal specialist Anthon y Lewis for his reliance \"on a legal argument that violence against the perpetrators of repeated viole nce is justified as an act of self-defense.\" The reason why the U.S. justified the bombing of Libya \"on the basis of pre-empting an attack, which could be seen as a form of self-defense, [rather] than as a retaliatory action\" was explained by a State Dep artment official, who noted that the UN Charter expressly f orbids the use of force except in self-defense - mo re accurately, self-defense until the UN acts after a formal request to the Security Council by the count ry that regards itself as the victim of a sudden and overwh elming armed attack. While the \"legal argument\" was admired at home, it was generally dismissed abroad, where few could be found who would disagree with Canada's former UN Ambassador George Ignatieff, a m ember of Canada's first delegation to the UN and no w Chancellor of the University of Toronto, who reject ed the appeal to the right of self-defense establis hed in the UN Charter as without merit.22 In August 1981, the anti-Qaddafi message \"was rei nforced by the trap laid for Libya in the Gulf of S idra,\" a trap \"elaborately planned on the U.S. side\" with th e intent of a confrontation in which Libyan jets co uld be shot down, as they were, Edward Haley observes in his bi tterly anti-Qaddafi study of U.S. relations with Li bya. One specific purpose, Haley plausibly argues, was to \"e xploit the 'Libyan menace' in order to win support for steps [the Administration] wished to take in pursuit of S ecretary Haig's 'strategic consensus' against the S oviet Union, and as an element in the arrangements necessary for the creation of a Rapid Deployment force,\" an inte rvention force targeted primarily at the Middle East. In November, the Administration concocted an amus ing tale about Libyan hit-men roaming the streets o f Washington to assassinate Our Leader, eliciting fev erish media commentary along with some skepticism, quite limited at the time. When questioned about the plot , Reagan stated: \"We have the evidence, and [Qaddaf i]"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"knows it.\"23 The story faded away when its purpose had been served, and the press was sufficiently dis ciplined so as not to report the exposure that the \"assassin s\" on the official U.S. list, leaked in England, we re prominent members of the (passionately anti-Libyan) Lebanese Amal, including its leader Nabih Berri and the elde rly religious leader of the Shi'ite community.24 Other dramatic discoveries included a Libyan thr eat to invade the Sudan across 600 miles of desert (with the Egyptian and U.S. air forces helpless to impede thi s outrage) and a plot to overthrow the government o f the Sudan in February 1983, unearthed at a moment when the Administration's reactionary constituency was charging it with insufficient militancy - a plot so subtle that Sudanese and Egyptian intelligence kne w nothing about it, as quickly discovered by U.S. reporters w ho took the trouble to go to Khartoum to investigat e. The U.S. responded to this awesome plot with an elabora te show of force, enabling Secretary of State Shult z, who had been denounced as too faint-hearted, to strike heroic poses on television while announcing that Qa ddafi \"is back in his box where he belongs\" because Reagan ac ted \"quickly and decisively\" against this threat to world order, demonstrating again \"the strength of the cow boy.\" This episode too was forgotten once its purpo ses had been served. There have been a series of similar ex amples. The media have generally played their appoi nted role, with only occasional demurrers.25 The events of March-April 1986 fit the familiar p attern. The Gulf of Sidra operation in March was pl ainly timed to stir up jingoist hysteria just prior to th e crucial Senate vote on Contra aid, coinciding wit h a fabricated Nicaraguan \"invasion\" of Honduras, an inspired PR o peration that succeeded brilliantly as demonstrated by the enraged reaction of Congressional doves and the med ia fairly generally, and the Senate vote (see chapt er 2). The charade also permitted the Administration to pr ovide $20 million of military aid to Honduras, whic h Honduras officially maintains that it did not reque st, and which has no doubt been conveniently \"lost\" in the Contra camps, yet another method by which the lawle ss band in Washington evades the weak Congressional restrictions on their thuggery.26 The Gulf of Sidra provocation was at least a part ial success as well, enabling U.S. forces to sink s everal Libyan boats, killing more than 50 Libyans, presuma bly with the expectation that it might incite Qadda fi to acts of terror against Americans, as was subsequently cl aimed. The effort is reported to have caused consid erable frustration in Washington over Qaddafi's failure to rise to the bait with some terrorist atrocity that could be used as a pretext for the next phase in the terrorist ca mpaign against Libya.27 While U.S. forces were successful in killing man y Libyans, they were singularly unable to rescue su rvivors. The task was apparently not impossible; 16 survivor s of the U.S. attack were rescued from a lifeboat b y a Spanish oil tanker.28 The official purpose of the U.S. military operat ion was to establish the right of passage in the Gu lf of Sidra. Dispatch of a naval flotilla was hardly the necessa ry or appropriate means to achieve this end: a decl aration would have sufficed. Were further steps deemed nece ssary for some reason, lawful means were readily available. If someone has a dispute with his neighb or over rights to some property, there are two ways to proceed: one is to take the matter to the Courts, t he second is to pick up a gun and kill the neighbor . The first option was surely available in the case of the Gulf of Sidra. Since there is plainly no urgency, it wa s possible to resort to legal means to establish the right of inn ocent passage. But a lawless and violent state will naturally observe different priorities. Asked why the U.S. di d not take the issue to the World Court, Brian Hoyl e, director of the Office of Ocean Law and Policy at the State Department, said that the case \"would have taken ye ars and years. I don't think we could live with this\"29 - g iven the evident necessity for U.S. naval armadas t o operate in the Gulf of Sidra, at once, if the United States is to survive as a nation. The U.S. position is dubious on narrower grounds. The press continually speaks of \"the law of the se a,\" but the United States is hardly on firm grounds in appe aling to this doctrine if only because the Reagan Administration rejected the Law of the Sea Treaty. Furthermore, Libya shot at U.S. planes, not U.S. sh ips, and \"the law of the air\" is far from well established. States make various claims in this regard. The U.S. , for example, claims a 200-mile Air Defense Identificati on Zone within which it has the right to exercise \" self- defense\" against intruding aircraft judged to be ho stile. There is no doubt that U.S. aircraft were we ll within 200 miles of Libyan territory - 40 miles, the Pentagon claims - and that they were hostile, so that by U.S . standards, Libya was within its rights to intercept them. The point was noted by the conservative legal scholar A lfred"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Rubin of the Fletcher School at Tufts University, w ho commented that \"by sending in aircraft we went b eyond what we were clearly authorized to do under the Law of the Sea\" in \"an unnecessary provocation.\"30 But for a gangster state, such matters are irrelevant, and th e exercise was a success, among the intended domest ic circles at least. The extent and meaning of the provocation in the Gulf of Sidra were made clear by Pentagon spokesman Robert Sims, who \"said that U.S. policy is to shoot at any Libyan boat that enters international water s in the Gulf of Sidra for as long as the U.S. naval exercis e in that region continues - no matter how far away the boat might be from U.S. ships.\" \"Given the 'hostile inte nt' displayed by Libya when it tried to shoot down U.S. warplanes,\" Sims stated, any Libyan military vessel is \"a threat to our forces.\"31 In short, the U.S. maintains the right to fire in \"self-defense\" at any Libyan vesse l that approaches its naval armada off the Libyan c oast, but Libya does not have a right of self-defense in air space off its own coast, even a fraction of that de clared by the U.S. for itself. There is more to the story. British correspondent David Blundy interviewed British engineers in Trip oli who were repairing the Russian-installed radar system t here. One, who says he was monitoring the incident throughout on the radar screens (which, contrary to Pentagon claims, were not rendered inoperative), r eports that he \"saw American warplanes cross not only into the 12 miles of Libyan territorial waters, but ove r Libyan land as well.\" \"T watched the planes fly approximat ely eight miles into Libyan air space,' he said. T don't think the Libyans had any choice but to hit back. In my o pinion they were reluctant to do so.'\" The engineer added, \"American warplanes made their approach using a nor mal civil airline traffic route and followed in the wake of a Libyan airliner, so that its radar blip would mas k them on the Libyan radar screen.\"32 No hint of this information appeared in the U.S. media, to my knowledge, apart from an informative report by Alexander Cockburn, playing his usual role of perso nal antidote to media subservience and distortion. Blundy's article was not mysteriously missed by the U.S. pre ss. It was cited by Joseph Lelyveld of the Times, b ut with its crucial contents omitted.33 One likely - and probably eagerly awaited - cons equence of the Gulf of Sidra operation was to elici t acts of Libyan terrorism in retaliation. These would then h ave the effect of inducing a state of terror in the United States and, with some luck, in Europe as well, sett ing the stage for the next escalation. The bombing of the \"La Belle\" discotheque in West Berlin on April 5, with one black American soldier and one Turk killed,34 w as immediately blamed on Libya, then used as the prete xt for the April 14 bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi , with many Libyans killed, apparently mostly civilians (a bout 100, according to the Western press; 60 accord ing to the official Libyan report). The bombing was neatly timed the day before the expected House vote on Co ntra aid. In case the audience missed the point, Reagan' s speechwriters made it explicit. Addressing the Am erican Business Conference on April 15, Reagan said: \"And I would remind the House voting this week that this arch- terrorist has sent $400 million and an arsenal of w eapons and advisers into Nicaragua to bring his war home to the United States. He has bragged that he is helpin g the Nicaraguans because they fight America on its own ground.\"55 The idea that the \"mad dog\" is bringing his war h ome to the U.S. by providing arms to a country the U.S. is attacking with its terrorist proxy army was a nice touch, which passed without notable comment, but th e PR operation did not, for once, succeed in steamroller ing Congress, though the bombing of Libya did enfla me chauvinist passions, a consequence largely attribut able, perhaps, to the prevailing anti-Arab racism a nd the relative absence of any sane reaction to earlier ep isodes of manufactured hysteria over Qaddafi's real or alleged crimes. The April 14 attack was the first bombing in hist ory staged for prime time television. The bombing r aids were carefully planned so that they would begin precisel y at 7 p.m. Eastern Standard Time;36 that is, preci sely at the moment when all three national television channels broadcast their major news programs, which were preempted as agitated anchor men switched to Tripol i for direct eyewitness reports of the exciting eve nts. That was no small logistical feat for a seven-hour fligh t from London. As soon as the raids ended, the Whit e House had Larry Speakes address a press conference, follo wed by other dignitaries, ensuring total domination of the information system during the crucial early hours."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" One might argue that the Administration took a ga mble in this transparent PR operation, since journa lists might have asked some obvious questions, but the Wh ite House was confident that nothing untoward would occur and its faith in the self-discipline of the m edia proved to be warranted. Quite apart from matters of timing and advance no tice, other questions could have been raised. To me ntion only one, Speakes stated that the U.S. knew on Apri l 4 that the East Berlin Libyan \"People's Bureau\" h ad informed Tripoli that an attack would take place in Berlin the following day, and that it then informe d Tripoli that the \"La Belle\" discotheque bombing had taken p lace, as planned. Thus the U.S. knew on April 4-5 - with certainty, the While House declared - that Libya wa s directly responsible for the disco bombing. One m ight have asked, then, why the reports of U.S. and West German investigations from April 5 to the moment of the attack consistently stated that there were at most suspicions of Libyan involvement. In fact, every jo urnalist listening to the Administration story had in his or her hands - unless we assume the most astonishing incompetence on the part of the news rooms - an Ass ociated Press report from Berlin which came across the wires at 6:28 p.m. EST, a half-hour before the bomb ing, stating that \"the Allied military command [in West Berlin] reported no developments in the investigati on of the disco bombing\" and that \"U.S. and West Ge rman officials have said Libya - possibly through its em bassy in Communist-ruled East Berlin - is suspected of involvement in the bombing of the La Belle nightclu b\" (my emphasis).37 Someone might have asked, then, how it is that a few minutes prior to the attack, t he U.S. and West Germany still had at most suspicio ns of Libyan involvement - as throughout the preceding pe riod - while on April 4-5, ten days earlier, they h ad certain knowledge of it. But no embarrassing questions were asked, and the relevant facts have been largely suppressed. Reagan stated on the evening of April 14 that \"ou r evidence is direct, it is precise, it is irrefuta ble\" - just as \"We have the evidence, and [Qaddafi] knows it\" in t he case of the Libyan hit-men prowling the streets of Washington, not to speak of the Sandinista involvem ent in drug-peddling, their announcement of a \"revo lution without frontiers,\" the support of Helmut Kohl and Bettino Craxi for the Libyan attack (angrily denied by \"shocked\" officials in Germany and Italy),38 and nu merous other productions of an Administration that has well surpassed the usual standards of deceit, and c ontinues \"to commit any crime, to lie, to cheat\" - in the words of the titular leadership, referring to his officia l enemy - to achieve its ends, confident that the o ccasional exposure in the small print, well after the fact, w ill not prevent the regular stream of lies from set ting the terms of debate and leaving the appropriate impressions f irmly implanted. Beyond the borders, discipline did not reign, how ever. In Germany, a week after Washington had state d its certain knowledge ten days earlier (April 4-5) of L ibyan responsibility for the disco bombing, Der Spi egel (April 21) reported that the famed telephone interc epts apparently do not exist and that West Berlin i ntelligence has only suspicions about Libyan involvement, also suspecting \"rival groups of drug dealers\" among oth er possibilities (including Klan or neo-Nazi groups, s ome suspected; the disco was frequented by black GI s and Third World immigrants). Washington's war is \"a mea ns of politics,\" Der Spiegel continued, \"insofar as the enemy is as small as Grenada and Libya - and the ad versary is as ideal a scoundrel as Qaddafi\"; and no European leader should have any illusions that Euro pe's concerns or interests will be considered if th e U.S. decides to escalate international violence, even to the level of a final World War, editor Rudolf Augs tein added.39 In an interview on April 28 with a reporter for t he U.S. Army journal Stars And Stripes, Manfred Gan schow, chief of the Berlin Staatschutz (domestic intellige nce) and head of the 100-man team investigating the disco bombing, stated that \"I have no more evidence that Libya was connected to the bombing than 1 had when you first called me two days after the act. Which is no ne.\" He agreed that it was \"a highly political case \" and hinted at considerable skepticism about what \"the politici ans\" were saying and would say about it.40 The U.S. press concealed the doubts expressed in Germany by the media and the investigating team, bu t the discerning reader will be able to detect them in th e reports of the continuing investigation, as suspe cts alleged to have Syrian and other connections are investigated, and Washington's claims of \"certain knowledge\" on April 4-5 were qualified with such terms as \"reportedly\" and \"alleged.\"41 The hesitancy, the qualifications, the backing off from the former confident assertion, an d the indirect citation of evidence that undermines Administration claims - these are the devices used by the media to signal that they are well aware tha t there was little merit to the case they enthusiastically endo rsed when called upon to rally round the flag."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" In the New York Review of Books, Shaul Bakhash a sserts that the Jordanian Hindawi brothers were \"responsible for the bombing of the night club in W est Berlin\" and that \"there is now persuasive evide nce\" that they \"were recruited by Syria (not by Libya as one might have thought from some official statements at the time).\"42 Apart from the fact that he goes well bey ond available evidence, this is a curious formulati on. It was not a matter of \"some official statements\" from whi ch \"one might have thought\" that Libya was involved ; rather all official statements, presented with certainty a nd no qualifications and repeated in this manner by the media until the case began to unravel, confidently assert ed Libyan responsibility and justified the bombing and killing of Libyan civilians on this basis. Furthermore, nei ther the media backtracking nor this statement draw the immediate conclusion: if the Reagan Administration was lying about its \"direct,\" \"precise\" and \"irrefu table\" evidence, then the bombing was simply unprovoked st ate terrorism (instead of state terrorism with a pr etext) - covered up by the loyal media, which avoided the ob vious questions at the time of their enthusiastic endorsement of the attack while offering absurd pre texts (e.g., the Times editors' tale about \"the nex t Natasha Simpson\") in justifying their complicity in terrori sm. The PR operation was surely a success, at least i n the short term, at home, \"playing well in Peoria\" as the press put it, hence a successful example of \"the engineer ing of democratic consent\" that should \"strengthen President Reagan's hand in dealing with Congress on issues li ke the military budget and aid to Nicaraguan 'contr as.'\"43 For much of the world, the U.S. has become an ob ject of considerable fear, as the \"bizarre cowboy l eader\" who so enraptures Paul Johnson and the like engages in acts of \"madness\" in organizing a \"band of cut- throats\" to attack Nicaragua and playing mad bomber elsewher e, in the words of Canada's leading journal, genera lly restrained and quite pro-U.S. in tendency.44 The Re agan Administration is cultivating these fears, exp loiting the \"madman\" strategy attributed to Richard Nixon. At the Tokyo Summit of the advanced industrial democracies in May, the Administration circulated a position paper in which it stated that one reason why Europe would be wise to line up in the U.S. crusade is \"the need to do something so that the crazy Ame ricans won't take matters into their own hands again.\" The threat succeeded in eliciting a statement against terrorism mentioning only Libya by name.45 This explicit thre at was ignored as commentators exulted in the succe ss of the Libya bombing in bringing European \"wimps\" fina lly to take the measures required to counter the Li byan threat to Western civilization. The reaction to the bombing of Libya was sharply different at home and abroad. The twelve-member European Economic Community called upon the U.S. to avoid \"further escalation of military tension in t he region with all the inherent dangers.\" A few hours later, U.S. warplanes struck, as West German Foreig n Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher was on his way to W ashington to explain the EEC position. His spokesma n stated that \"We want to do everything we can to avo id a military escalation.\" The bombing aroused exte nsive protest throughout most of Europe, including large- scale demonstrations, and evoked editorial condemna tion in much of the world. Spain's major newspaper El Pais condemned the raid, writing that \"The military acti on of the United States is not only an offense against in ternational law and grave threat to peace in the Me diterranean, but a mockery of its European allies, who did not f ind motives for economic sanctions against Libya in a meeting Monday, despite being previously and unsucc essfully pressured to adopt sanctions.\" The South C hina Morning Post in Hong Kong wrote that \"President Rea gan's cure for the 'mad dog of the Middle East' may prove more lethal than the disease,\" and his action \"may also have lit the fuse to a wider conflagrati on\" in the region. In Mexico City, El Universal wrote that the U.S. \"has no right to set itself up as the defende r of world freedom,\" urging recourse to legal means through th e United Nations. There were many similar reactions . The U.S. press, in contrast, was overwhelmingly f avorable. The New York Times wrote that \"even the m ost scrupulous citizen can only approve and applaud the American attacks on Libya,\" describing this as a j ust verdict and sentence: \"the United States has prosec uted [Qaddafi] carefully, proportionately - and jus tly.\" The evidence for Libyan responsibility for the disco bo mbing has been \"now laid out clearly to the public, \" at least to the satisfaction of the editors, though they did not see fit to publish it. \"Then came the jury, th e European governments to which the United States went out of its way to send emissaries to share evidence and ur ge concerted action against the Libyan leader.\" It is irrelevant, apparently, that the jury was hardly co nvinced, and issued a \"judgment\" calling on the executioner to r efrain from any action -just as it is unnecessary t o comment editorially on the fact, later tacitly recognized, that the evidence was of little merit."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" Most governments also condemned the action, thoug h not all. Britain and Canada went along, though th e public response was sharply different, and there wa s support from France in its current mood of Reagan ite enthusiasm. The government-controlled South African Broadcasting Corporation said the attack \"underlin es the commitment the leader of the Western world has made to taking positive action against terrorism\"; the U.S. was justified in attacking Qaddafi, \"whose name is virt ually synonymous with international terrorism.\" In Israel, Prime Minister Shimon Peres stated that the U.S. ac tion was clearly justified \"in self-defense\": \"If t he Libyan c Government issues orders to murder American soldier s in Beirut in cold blood, in the middle of the nig ht, what do you expect the United States to do? Sing Hallelu jah? Or take action in her defense?\" The idea that the U.S. was acting in \"self-defense\" against an attack on h er forces in Beirut two and a half years earlier is an intriguing innovation, even putting aside the circumstances of that earlier act.46 In the U.S., Senator Mark Hatfield, one of the f ew political figures in the country who merits the honorable term \"conservative,\" denounced the U.S. bombing rai d \"on a nearly deserted Senate floor,\" and in a let ter to the Times. Leaders of several major Christian denominat ions condemned the bombing, but Jewish leaders generally praised it, among them Rabbi Alexander Sc hindler, president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, who \"said the U.S. government 'prope rly and vigorously responded' to the 'mindless terr orism'\" of Qaddafi. Harvard international affairs professor Joseph Nye said Reagan had to respond \"to the smok ing gun of that Berlin thing. What else do you do about sta te-supported terrorism?\" - such as U.S.-supported t errorism in Central America and southern Lebanon, for exampl e, where the \"smoking gun\" is rather more clearly i n evidence. Eugene Rostow supported the bombing as \"i nevitable and overdue\" as part of a \"more active de fense against the process of Soviet expansion.\" The \"forc ible removal of the Qaddafi regime,\" he explained, \"would be fully justified under the existing rules of inte rnational law,\" since Qaddafi \"has flagrantly and c ontinually violated these rules.\" \"That being the case, every state injured by Libya's actions has the right, alo ne or with others, to use whatever force is reasonably necessa ry to put an end to Libya's illegal behavior. Libya is in the legal position of the Barbary pirates.\"47 He urged NATO to \"issue a declaration on the responsibility of states for illegal acts committed from their territory.\"48 A fortiori, then, NATO should condemn the emperor , not just the pirate, and states from Indochina to Central America to the Middle East, among others, should or ganize to use whatever force is necessary to attack the United States, Israel and other terrorist states, f ollowing the Rostow doctrine. For ABC correspondent Charles Glass, who reported the bombing and aftermath from the scene, the even t was symbolized by the handwritten letter of a seven-yea r-old girl, dug out of the rubble of her home, whos e American-educated family he visited. The letter rea ds: Dear Mr Reagan Why did you kill my only sister Rafa and my friend Racha, she is only nine, and my baby doll Strawberr y. Is it true you want to kill us all because my father is P alestinian and you want to kill Kadafi because he w ants to help us go back to my father's home and land. My name is Kinda A facsimile of the original was submitted to the press in the U.S. as a letter to the editor, but no t considered fit for publication. It was published by Alexander Cock burn, with a suggestion to President and Mrs. Reaga n that since they \"are fond of reading out messages from s mall children, they might care to deliver this one on the next appropriate occasion.\"49 Others saw the matter differently. Michael Walzer took issue with Europeans who criticized the bombi ng of Libya as a case of \"state terrorism.\" It was not, h e declared, \"for it was aimed at specific military targets, and the pilots took some risks in their effort to hit t hose targets and nothing else,\" as he presumably kn ows from secret Pentagon briefings. If night bombing of a ci ty happens to strike densely populated residential sections of Tripoli, killing Rafa and Racha and many other civi lians, that is just the way the cookie crumbles.50 Perhaps this is what we should expect from the highly regar ded moralist and theorist of just war who assured u s that the Israeli invasion of Lebanon can be defended under t his concept, that Israel's military operations in s outhern"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Lebanon were \"a good example of proportionate warfa re,\" and that if civilians were \"at risk\" during th e Israeli bombing of Beirut, then \"the responsibility for the risks lies with the PLO.\"51 Media complicity in this act of state terrorism d id not end with the patriotic behavior at the time of the bombing, a natural sequel to earlier endorsement of whatever tales the Administration chose to concoct , k was also necessary to show that the bombing was a succe ss in curbing Libyan terrorism, as proven by the ab sence of terrorist actions attributed to Qaddafi after the b ombing. To establish the thesis, it is necessary to suppress the fact that there were also no credible attributions prior to the bombing apart from those mentioned ear lier, which are clearly irrelevant. No such problems interfered with the task at hand. The editors of the Washington Post extolled the L ibya bombing on the grounds that \"No new acts of te rrorism have been attributed to\" Colonel Qaddafi, who has n ow been reduced to a \"subdued policy.\" Still more important is the impact on Western allies, most of whom \"needed the shock\" delivered by \"the example o f decisiveness, the undeniable precision of the intel ligence, the subsequent demonstration of Libya's is olation and, not least, the fall in tourism\" - not to speak of the threat that the \"crazy Americans\" might fla il away with abandon somewhere else, a threat underscored by the dispatch of U.S. naval vessels to within a few mil es of the Soviet coastline in the Black Sea at the same time; 52 note that the editors still find it possible to refer to \"the undeniable precision of the intelligence,\" which th e journal had ample reason to question, and later p roceeded to reject, as noted. David Ignatius writes that the bombing \"worked surprisingly well against Libya's Moammar Gadhafi,\" accomplishing \"some startling - and very beneficial - changes in Libya, the Mideast and Euro pe.\" It proved that Qaddafi was \"weak, isolated and vulnera ble,\" \"so vulnerable, in fact, that American warpla nes were able to operate freely within his own, heavily defe nded airspace\" -a glorious victory indeed, and a mo st surprising discovery about the Libyan colossus. To demonstrate \"the psychology that had allowed Gadhaf i to intimidate much of the world,\" Ignatius cites no ac ts - for there are no credible examples - but rathe r states that even if \"Libyans may engage in terrorism again, it won't be on the scale they seemed to be embarking o n early this year,\" when \"U.S. intelligence learned that Li bya had ordered its 'Peoples Bureaus' to mount terr orist attacks in about a dozen cities.\" A highly competen t journalist, Ignatius knows that government claims about what intelligence had \"learned\" are worthless; his demonstration of the \"success\" of the operation in terms of alleged plans aborted is his circumspect way of say ing that the consequences were undetectable.53 Similarly, George Moffett noted that Libyan terro rist attacks \"have all but ceased\" - that is, they have reduced from near zero to near zero - one of the \"positive developments\" that \"appear to vindicate the Reagan Administration's policy of military retaliation.\" H is colleague John Hughes observed triumphantly that \"since the punitive air strikes against Libya . . . there have been no major terrorist attacks on Americans d irected by Col. Muammar Qaddafi\" - just as there were none bef ore, so far as is known.54 The message to the state terrorists in Washington is clear: We will follow your dictates when you co ncoct a record of enemy terrorism that you claim has intimi dated the world, when you carry out a major terrori st act to punish the outrage you have constructed, and when y ou announce that as a result of your heroism, the f earsome monster is subdued. Mere facts will never deter us from our obedient service. For the record, \"there have been some 18 anti-Ame rican terrorist incidents in Western Europe and the Middle East in the three months since the Libyan raid, com pared with about 15 during the 3Vz months before it \" while \"In the world as a whole, the rate of anti-American terrorism looks like being little different from l ast year,\" the Economist observed (while lauding Reagan's act of c ourage); and the Rand Corporation's leading special ist on terrorism noted that terrorist attacks after the ra id persisted at about the same level as before.55 Completing the record, on July 3 the FBI released a 41-page report reviewing terrorist incidents wit hin the United States in 1985. Seven were listed, with two people killed. In 1984, there had been 13 terrorist acts. The number has dropped each year since 1982, when 51 te rrorist incidents were recorded.56 The FBI report received some coverage. The Toront o Globe & Mail ran an Assoicated Press story under the headline: \"Jewish extremists blamed in 2 deaths.\" T he lead paragraph reads: \"Jewish extremists committ ed four of the seven terrorist acts that killed two people in the United States in 1985, the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported yesterday.\" The report goes on to provide details of the \"incidents attributed to Jewish extremists\" which \"killed two people and injured ni ne, the report said,\" along with the other incident s. The New"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"York Times ran no story on the FBI report, though t here is a reference to it in the llth paragraph of a column several weeks later, reading: \"According to the F.B .I.'s annual report on terrorism, four of seven ins tances of domestic terrorism in 1985 were believed to involve 'Jewish terrorist groups.' No indictments have res ulted from any [of] the investigations.\" The second natio nal newspaper, the Washington Post, ran a story on the FBI report headlined \"Domestic Terrorism Declined Last Year, FBI Report Shows.\" It is noted within that \"b oth killings and nine of the injuries were attributed t o four terrorist acts by Jewish extremists\" (of the seven reported); this is repeated in a later story on the FBI investigation of the murder of Alex Odeh, noti ng that \"Jewish extremist groups are suspects.\"57 These three sentences constitute the coverage in the national press of the conclusions of the FBI re port on sources of domestic terrorism in 1985.1 noticed no editorials or other comments calling upon the Unite d States to bomb Tel Aviv or Jerusalem to excise the \"cancer \" and \"subdue\" the \"mad dogs\" who have brought \"the evil scourge of terrorism\" to our own shores. One may as k why not. Quite properly, Israel disclaims respons ibility for the actions of \"Jewish extremists.\" It also con demns the terrorist actions, as does Knesset Member Rabbi Kahane, whose former associates of the Jewish Defen se League are suspected by the FBI of carrying out the actions. With rather less warrant, Washington discl aims responsibility for the terrorist acts of those it has trained and encouraged. But as I have already menti oned, these excuses amount to naught by the standar ds applied to Muammar Qaddafi and Yasser Arafat, who a lso condemn terrorist actions and deny responsibili ty for them. Recall again the doctrine that \"the larger mo ral responsibility for atrocities ... is all Yasir Arafat's\" because \"he was, and remains, the founding father o f contemporary Palestinian violence,\" and thus the U.S. will hold Arafat \"accountable for acts of international terrorism\" quite generally, whether he is involved or not.58 By the same logic, \"the larger moral responsibility \" for the acts of Zionist extremists is all Israel' s. The press has regularly dismissed Arafat's condem nation of Palestinian terrorist actions. To mention one critical case, on June 3,1982, the terrorist group headed by Abu Nidal, who was at war with the PLO an d had been condemned to death by them years earlier, atte mpted to assassinate Israeli Ambassador Shlomo Argo v in London, the event that precipitated Israel's invasi on of Lebanon, a \"retaliation\" considered legitimat e by the U.S. government, the media, and educated opinion ge nerally. The Washington Post commented that the Arg ov assassination attempt was an \"embarrassment\" for th e PLO, which \"claims to represent all Palestinians, but. . . tends to be selective about accepting responsibilit y for acts of Palestinian violence.\"59 If a terrori st act by a Palestinian group at war with the PLO is an \"embarr assment\" for the PLO on these grounds, then plainly terrorist acts by Zionist extremists in the U.S., k illing two and wounding nine, are an \"embarrassment \" for Israel, which is, by law, \"the State of the Jewish people,\" including those in the Diaspora (not the s tate of its citizens, one-sixth of whom are non-Jews). Hence by the logic of the U.S. government, noted commentato rs, and the media quite generally, the U.S. is certainl y entitled, if not obligated, to bomb Tel Aviv \"in self-defense against future attacks.\" One may imagine the reaction had the majority of terrorist actions in the U.S., including all fatali ties, been committed by Arab-Americans associated with extremi st elements of the PLO or suspected of being part o f a terrorist group founded by a member of the Libyan g overnment. The U.S. bombing of Libya had nothing to do with \"terrorism,\" even in the cynical Western sense of t he word. In fact, it was clear enough that the Gulf of Sidra operation and the bombing of Libyan cities would i f anything incite such retail terrorism, one major reason why the likely targets in Europe pleaded with the U.S. to refrain from such action. This is hardly the first time that violent action s have been executed with the expectation that they would incite retail terrorism. The U.S.-backed Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 is another case, as discussed in chapter 2. The attack on Libya may also sooner or later inspir e terrorist acts, which will serve to mobilize dome stic and foreign opinion in support of U.S. plans at home an d abroad. If Americans react by general hysteria, i ncluding fear of travelling to Europe where visitors will be far safer than in any American city, this too is a net benefit, for the same reasons. The real reasons for the U.S. attack on Libya hav e nothing to do with self-defense against \"terroris t attacks\" on U.S. forces in Beirut in October 1983, as Shimon Pe res would have it, or any of the other actions attr ibuted rightly or wrongly to Libya, or \"self-defense again st future attack\" in accord with the doctrine procl aimed by"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"the Reagan Administration to much domestic acclaim. Libya's terrorism is a minor irritant, but Qaddafi has stood in the way of U.S. plans in North Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere.

This article is an attack on th e United States, the United States Government, and the Unite d States press by Noam Chomsky. You probably know about Chomsky: he is a fanatica l defender of the PLO who has set new standards for intellectual dishonesty and personal vindictiveness in his writings about the Middle East.

Can it be that, fully familiar with him, they neverthel ess decided to give him this platform? If so, why? Signed \"Elliott,\" that is, Elliott Abrams, Assistan t Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, Ju ly 29, 1986, on official State Department stationery, and theref ore counts, I presume, as a public document (some p ersonal remarks omitted). I cite this letter for two reasons. One, because I naturally treasure it, just as I treasure, for pr ecisely the same reasons, the efforts of Soviet advisors in the Thir d World to have my books banned (as they have been for years in the USSR)2 and the rejection of my only visa app lication to Eastern Europe. The reactions of the co mmissars often indicate that one is probably on the right co urse. But beyond that, the letter is germane to our topic. It gives a revealing (and not untypical) insight into the mentality of the Reagan Administration and also of the Israeli lobby -1 should mention that Abrams's lette r was only one part of an impressive barrage launch ed against the journal for daring to publish remarks o n the U.S. and Israel that were deemed improper by the guardians of the faith.3 These are phenomena with w hich many of you have personal familiarity, a fact also germane to our topic, for obvious reasons. Let me put aside the remarkable lack of a sense o f irony; recall that this is a journal devoted to c ensorship, now under attack because it permitted brief express ion of fact and analysis that is not to the taste o f the commissars. What the letter reveals is the deep tot alitarian streak in the mentality of leading figure s in the Reagan Administration: not even the tiniest opening must be allowed to unacceptable thought. I do not want to suggest that it is outside the spectrum of American politics. Unfortunately, it is not. But in its pra ctices, its style and its commitments, the Reagan Administration does represent an extreme position within this spectrum , an extreme of reactionary jingoism - which has misappr opriated the honorable term \"conservative\" - marked by dedicated lying, lawlessness, enhancement of state power and violence, attacks on personal freedom and civil liberties, all developments that are ominous in cha racter and important for the future of American pol itics and society, hence for the Middle East, and for the wor ld, given the awesome scale of American power. These features of the Reagan Administration have not gone unnoticed, and have naturally aroused conc ern among genuine conservatives here - of whom there ar e very few in government or the media - and abroad. Three years ago, David Watt, Director of the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London, writi ng in Foreign Affairs, commented on the chasm that lies between current American percep tions of the world and the world's perception of Am erica . . . [W]ith the possible exceptions of the Israelis, t he South Africans, President Marcos of the Philippi nes and a few right-wing governments in Central and South Ame rica, [most of the world believes] that the Reagan administration has vastly overreacted to the Soviet threat, thereby distorting the American (and hence the"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"world) economy, quickening the arms race, warping i ts own judgment about events in the Third World, an d further debasing the language of international inte rcourse with feverish rhetoric. He adds that \"it is in my experience almost impos sible to convey even to the most experienced Americ ans just how deeply rooted and widely spread the critical vi ew has become\" - also an important fact. As if to c onfirm this judgment, in a companion article on the curren t international scene, Foreign Affairs editor Willi am Bundy writes that with regard to the \"degree of threat fr om the Soviet Union . . . the Reagan administration 's broad view seems to this observer nearer to reality than the often excessively sanguine and parochial stated positions of other major nations.\"4 Watt in fact exaggerates the \"chasm.\" European el ites are not so removed from Reaganite hysteria as he indicates, and the \"exceptions\" go beyond those he mentioned, including particularly France, where man y Paris intellectuals have adopted Reaganite fanaticism as their current fad. Furthermore, as Bundy's comment indicates, what Watt is describing represents elite opinion in the U.S. well beyond the Reagan Adminis tration; Bundy writes from near the opposite end of the elit e spectrum. Watt is describing the extreme version of a general elite reaction to the problems caused by th e Vietnam war, including the harm caused to the U.S . economy and the benefits to its industrial rivals, and the breakdown of discipline both in the Third W orld and at home, factors that require stern state action and t hus an appeal to the ever-useful Russian threat, re gularly invoked in such situations. But Watts's essential p oint is accurate enough. The isolation of the U.S. has since increased, as revealed for example by votes in the United Nation s on a wide range of issues. Within just the last few weeks, th e General Assembly voted 124 to 1 in favor of a Sou th Atlantic zone of peace and 94 to 3 calling on the U .S. to comply with the World Court ruling ordering cessation of the U.S. attack against Nicaragua; in the latter case, the U.S. was joined by two client-states, El Salvador (which is \"independent\" in the sense in which Polan d is independent of the USSR) and Israel, which has chosen to become an armed mercenary of the United States. U.S. isolation on Middle East votes is notorious, b ut the phenomenon is much more general. In 1980-85 alone t he U.S. resorted to 27 vetoes in the Security Counc il, as compared to 15 in the earlier history of the UN (al l since 1966) and four vetoes for the USSR in the 1 980s.5 The reaction is interesting. In the early days of the UN, when it was firmly under U.S. control and could be used for Cold War purposes, the general attitude to wards the organization was highly favorable and the re was much earnest debate over what caused the USSR, then almost isolated, to be so negative; perhaps this r esulted from the use of swaddling clothes for infants, whic h reinforced \"negativism,\" some suggested - a doctr ine that a few skeptics called \"diaperology.\" As U.S. global d ominance declined from its quite phenomenal postwar peak and the relative independence of members of the UN increased, attitudes towards the UN became more cri tical, and by now are extremely hostile. We no longer read disquisitions on the curious negativism of the Rus sians, but rather on the equally curious fact that the wor ld is out of step, as New York Times UN corresponde nt Richard Bernstein thoughtfully explains.6 Opinion polls in Europe show similar results. A r ecent classified USIA poll shows that outside of Fr ance, European opinion trusts Mikhail Gorbachev on arms c ontrol far more than Reagan, by four to one in Engl and and seven to one in Germany.7 The international isolation is of little concern to the Reagan Administration. They have shown a shr ewd understanding of the efficacy of violence and intim idation. Like some of their predecessors and models elsewhere in the world, they are well aware that ch eap victories over weak and defenseless enemies can be manipulated to arouse jingoist sentiments and popul ar enthusiasm at home, if the population can be pro perly terrified by grave threats to its existence; among earlier examples that come to mind are Hitler's war nings of the encirclement of Germany by hostile states bent on i ts destruction, the Czech \"dagger pointed at the he art of Germany,\" the aggressiveness and terror of the Czec hs and Poles, and above all, the threat of the inte rnational Jewish conspiracy. The Reaganites understand very w ell what H. L. Mencken called \"the whole aim of pra ctical politics\": \"to keep the public alarmed (and hence c lamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with a n endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary.\" As fo r the rest of the world, U.S. cultural hegemony is sufficiently great so that doctrines contrived for domestic purp oses will be adopted or taken seriously, however lu dicrous they may be; and if not, the threat of escalated vi olence if U.S. allies prove intransigent, and its p otential costs to them, remain credible and have been effectively exploited."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" The propaganda campaign about international terro rism is one example of the skillful use of these te chniques, both at home and abroad. Policy-makers of the Reaga n Administration know that liberal elements in Cong ress and the media can easily be cowed by the charge tha t they are soft and insufficiently militant in the face of whatever hobgoblin happens to be the monster of the day, and hence will line up obediently in the \"cru sade against terrorism.\" They also understand that the o verwhelming resources of violence at their command allow disdain for world opinion. In fact, they regularly exploit concerns over their violence, as in the Tok yo summit after the Libya bombings, when the Reaganites ralli ed Western elites by warning them that unless they fell in line, there is no telling what the \"crazy Americans \" might do next.8 The disdainful attitude towards Congress as well is revealed at every turn. For example, last month, in the military authorization bill, both houses of Congres s insisted upon wording that called upon the Execut ive to comply with SALT II, in the interest of national se curity. A few weeks later, the Administration annou nced that it was proceeding to exceed the SALT II limits. An Administration spokesman explained that \"Congress i s out of town and the summit in Iceland is past. [Gorbach ev] is not expected to come here for some time. So what's holding us back?\"9 In other words, the cop is looki ng the other way, so why not rob the store? In actu al fact, Congress has been out of town even when it is in to wn, as the Administration knows very well, and it h as not proven too difficult for a gang of street toughs to ride roughshod over the generally pathetic opposit ion. The attitude towards the public is revealed by wh at one Reagan official called \"a vast psychological warfare operation\" designed to set the agenda for debate ov er Nicaragua - a disinformation campaign called \"Op eration Truth\"; Goebbels and Stalin would have been amused. 10 Disinformation has been an Administration specia lty since the earliest days, though the media and Congr ess always profess to be shocked when a new example is exposed, recently during the 1986 disinformation ca mpaign concerning Libya (see chapter 3). In this ca se, the display of outraged surprise necessitated a slight case of amnesia; as early as August 1981, Newsweek had reported a government \"disinformation program desig ned to embarrass Qaddafi and his government\" along with assorted acts of U.S. terrorism within Libya t o try to \"demonstrate that Qaddafi was opposed by a n indigenous political force.\" There have also been e xtensive disinformation campaigns, quite successful thanks to media cooperation, on the arms race and numerous other matters.11 We derive further insights from current revelati ons about the sophisticated program to evade Congre ssional restrictions on military aid to the terrorist proxy army attacking Nicaragua - or the \"resistance,\" as it is termed by the government and the loyal press, a \"resistanc e\" organized by the Hemispheric Enforcer to attack Nicaragua from bases established outside its border s (the term \"proxy army,\" in contrast, is used in i nternal White House documents, and its terrorism is also no t concealed in secret reports). To mention one illu stration of the careful planning that lies behind the terror ist operations, consider the decision of the Reagan Administration to sell (probably quite useless) AWA Cs to Saudi Arabia in 1981. This was a politically unpopular move, and it was not clear at the time wh y the Administration was so determined to pursue it . Some likely reasons have since emerged. The Reagan plann ers evidently anticipated potential difficulties in funding their proxy army, and when Congress, responding to public pressure, later sought to limit the terroris t war against Nicaragua, Saudi Arabia was called upon to repay its debt and to fund shipments of arms to the contras, apparently Soviet arms that Israel had captured dur ing its Reagan-backed aggression in Lebanon.12 These are the machinations of sophisticated inter national terrorists, with a global vision. Now that they have finally surpassed the point where they can be easil y suppressed, the partial exposures will elicit the pretense that the Reagan policy-makers are incompetent bunglers; the invariable elite response to failure of state p lans is to focus attention on alleged personal inadequacies, s o as to avert the threat that the public may come t o understand the systematic nature of policy, the gen eral support for it within elite circles (tactics a side), and the institutional roots of these commitments. But no on e should be deluded into believing that we are witn essing the operations of fools and bunglers; their achieve ments in organizing efficient international terrori sm are impressive, from the Middle East to Central America , and beyond. Another crucial fact should also be kept in mind: the current scandals are a great tribute to the po pular movements of the 1960s and since, which forced the state to resort to clandestine operations to concea l its terrorism and violence, operations so complex that finally they could not be entirely kept from public view. Had the public been apathetic and quiescent, as in earl ier years, Reagan could have emulated the practices of John F. Kennedy when he simply sent the U.S. Air Force to c arry out large-scale bombing and initiated defoliat ion and"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"crop destruction missions in South Vietnam from 196 1-62, or Lyndon Johnson when he escalated the aggression against South Vietnam by land and air, e xtending it to the north as well, and sent 23,000 M arines to the Dominican Republic to avert the threat of democ racy there, all in early 1965, with very little pro test at the time. Clandestine operations carry the risk of expo sure, and of undermining the rhetorical pose of the government (for example, \"combating terrorism\"). Th is may inhibit the terrorist commanders, for a time at least. These facts serve to show that even in a gen erally depoliticized society like the United States , with no political parties or major media outside of the nar row business-based elite consensus, significant pub lic action is quite possible and may influence policy, though indirectly, as during the Vietnam years and since. These are important facts to bear in mind in connection with the Middle East as well. One element of the U.S.-organized international t error network is the World Anti-Communist League, a collection of Nazis, anti-Semites, death squad assa ssins, and some of the worst killers and thugs arou nd the world, mobilized by the Reagan Administration into an effective network of murderers and torturers, wo rldwide in scope. Last month, the League attracted some att ention in the course of the Hasenfus affair in Nica ragua. The New York Times, as usual reporting government propa ganda as fact, claimed that the League had been pur ged of its more nefarious elements when General Singlau b took it over in the 1980s. The World Anti-Communi st League had just then completed its annual conferenc e in Europe (not reported in the media here to my knowledge). The leading Nazis were present, given r espectful applause when their leaders - Nazi killer s from the days of Hitler - mounted the podium to address the audience. The Latin American death squad leader s, allegedly expelled in 1984, reappeared at once in 1 984-85 conferences sponsored by the U.S. affiliate - a tax- exempt \"educational\" organization. The League conti nues to include Nazis, racists of various assortmen ts and killers from around the world. It is supported by t he U.S. and several of its client-states, particula rly Taiwan and South Korea, but also reportedly by Syria and other Arab states; and its workings are concealed by the Israeli lobby here. In the introduction to their recent boo k on the League, Scott Anderson and John Anderson c omment that the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith, a l eading component of the domestic Israeli lobby, ref used to provide them with information on this notorious col lection of anti-Semites, who now serve a useful pur pose within the Reaganite international terror network t hat they generally support.13 All of this, and much more, reveals a sophisticat ed understanding of how to conduct international te rrorism, on a scale with few historical precedents. The sordid record of the World Anti-Communist Le ague should remind us that while Reaganite thuggery is unusual, it is not unique in U.S. history. Immediat ely after World War II, the U.S. turned to the task of suppressing the anti-fascist resistance throughout much of the world, often in favor of fascists and collaborators. One component of this global program was the recruitment of Nazi gangsters such as Klau s Barbie, \"the Butcher of Lyons,\" who had been respon sible for horrendous atrocities in France and was d uly placed in charge of spying on the French for Americ an intelligence. A far more important example was Reinhard Gehlen, in charge of Hitler's East Europea n intelligence operations and quickly assigned the same tasks under the CIA, in West German intelligence. H is organization was responsible for U.S. support fo r military actions within the USSR and Eastern Europe , in conjunction with armies that had been encourag ed by Hitler. These operations were run out of George Ken nan's office in the State Department according to J ohn Loftus, who investigated these matters for the U.S. Justice department. Later, when many of these usef ul folk could no longer be protected in Europe, the U.S. au thorities brought them here or to Latin America wit h the aid of the Vatican and fascist priests. They have conti nued to serve U.S. government interests, training t orturers in methods devised by the Gestapo, helping establish t he neo-Nazi National Security states in Latin Ameri ca and the Central American death squad apparatus within t he framework of the U.S.-trained security forces, a nd so on.14 We will understand very little about the world if we neglect the relevant historical context, common ly ignored or suppressed in official doctrine. The same is true when we turn directly to the Mid dle East. Consider U.S. relations with Iran, now in the news, but with the historical context largely excised, as is usually the case when it teaches inconvenient l essons. The Reagan Administration argues that the recently repo rted arms shipments to Iran via an Israeli connecti on are part of an effort to establish contacts with \"moder ate\" elements in Iran. There is a sense in which th is claim is true; namely, if we enter the domain of conventiona l Newspeak, in which the term \"moderate\" is used to refer"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"to elements that are properly obedient to U.S. orde rs and demands; it is counterpoised to \"radical,\" u sed to refer to those who do not follow orders properly. Notice that the terminology has nothing to do with the com mitment to violence and terror of these groups, or even the ir social and political goals, apart from the cruci al defining feature; thus the mass murderer Suharto in Indonesi a is a respected \"moderate,\" but a peasant self-hel p group organized by the Church in El Salvador is \"radical, \" and must be exterminated by Pol Pot-style terror conducted by the U.S. mercenary forces. In Iran, the U.S. restored \"moderates\" to power w ith a CIA coup in what the New York Times (August 6,1954) described as an \"object lesson\" to \"underde veloped countries with rich resources,\" an \"object lesson in the cost that must be paid by one of their number w hich goes berserk with fanatical nationalism\" and t ries to take control of their own resources, thus becoming \"radical.\" Iran remained \"moderate\" until the fall of the Shah in 1979 while compiling one of the worst human righ ts records in the world, as Amnesty International a nd other human rights groups regularly documented, not affec ting the classification of the Shah as a \"moderate\" or the applause for him among U.S. elites. The Shah was su pported by the Carter Administration to the very en d of his bloody rule. The U.S. then apparently looked into t he possibility of a military coup, but without succ ess. Since that time, a flow of arms to Iran has been maintain ed, in part via Israel, which had very close relati ons with the Shah and his military. Notice that very much the same was true in the ca se of Somoza in Nicaragua, who fell at about the sa me time. The Carter Administration also backed him until the end, with Israel providing the arms, surely with t acit U.S. backing, while he was killing tens of thousands in a last paroxysm of fury. Carter attempted to impose the rule of the National Guard when Somoza could no longer b e maintained. Shortly after, remnants of the Guard were reestablished in Honduras and Costa Rica with the a id of U.S. proxies such as Argentina (then under th e neo- Nazi generals, and thus a useful \"moderate\" client- state), and were then taken over directly by the U. S. and organized as a terrorist proxy army dedicated to pr eventing the threat of social reform in Nicaragua. Meanwhile, U.S. elites underwent a magical conver sion; they became profoundly concerned, for the fir st time, with human rights and \"democracy\" in Nicaragua and Iran, a sudden moral awakening that failed to elici t the contempt it richly merits.15 Returning to Iran, according to Israel's Ambassad or to the U.S. Moshe Arens, in October 1982, Israel 's supply of arms to Iran after the fall of the Shah was carr ied out \"in coordination with the U.S. government.. . at almost the highest of levels.\" The objective \"was to see i f we could not find some areas of contact with the Iranian military, to bring down the Khomeini regime,\" or at least \"to make contact with some military officers who some day might be in a position of power in Iran.\" Yaakov Nimrodi, the Israeli arms salesman and intel ligence official who was under cover as military attache in Iran during the Shah's reign, described this plan in a BBC broadcast in 1982. Former Israeli de facto Ambassad or to Iran Uri Lubrani of the Labor Party added fur ther details, in the same program: I very strongly believe that Tehran can be taken ov er by a very relatively small force, determined, ru thless, cruel. I mean the men who would lead that force wil l have to be emotionally geared to the possibility that they'd have to kill ten thousand people. - demonstrating that they are \"moderates,\" in the t echnical sense. Similar ideas were expressed by Dav id Kimche, head of Israel's Foreign Office and former deputy director of the Mossad. Kimche and Nimrodi a re now identified in the media as among those who init iated the mid-1980s program of U.S. military aid to Iran via Israel in connection with U.S. hostages and the \"search for moderates.\" The publicized views of the Israelis concerned with these programs - long before there were any hostages - are suppres sed, however. At the same time - early 1982 - these plans were generally endorsed, with varying degrees of sk epticism as to their feasibility, by Richard Helms (ex- director of the CIA and former Ambassador to Iran), Robert Komer (a leading candidate for war crimes t rials in the late 1960s and a high Pentagon official under C arter, one of the"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"architects of the Rapid Deployment Force which, he suggested, could be used to support \"moderates\" aft er a military coup), and others.16 All this too is now s uppressed. Essentially the same facts were also reported mor e recently, though ignored, well before the scandal s erupted, for example, by Israeli senior Foreign Ministry spo kesman Avi Pazner, who confirmed in an interview th at in 1982 Israel had sent Iran military supplies with th e approval of the U.S., including spare parts for U .S.-made jet fighters.17 The arms flow to Iran through Israel (and probabl y other avenues) has very likely continued at a lev el sufficient to keep contacts with the proper element s of the Iranian military, though the U.S. is oppos ed to sending sufficient arms to enable Iran to win the I ran-Iraq war, which would be a disaster for the U.S . policy of support for Saddam Hussein. Thus the U.S. blocked a major Iranian arms deal with Israel last April, ar resting an Israeli ex-general, among others.18 None of this is a discovery of late 1986, as thes e earlier references indicate. In 1982, a front-pag e story by current New York Times editor Leslie Gelb reported that half of the arms to Iran were \"being supplied or arranged by Israel\" - surely with U.S. knowledge an d at least tacit authorization - \"and the rest by f ree-lance arms merchants, some of whom may also have connecti ons with Israeli intelligence,\" while the CIA was carrying out covert actions against the Khomeini re gime from its bases in eastern Turkey.19 And Arens' s disclosures were prominently reported in the Boston Globe on successive days, among other cases. In mo re recent months, well before the \"scandals,\" addition al information surfaced. Thus in May, Patrick Seale reported that \"Israeli and European arms dealers are rushing war supplies to Iran\" as Israel now dispenses with \"the usual roundabout arms routes\"; \"for example, a ship now a t sea, carrying more than 25,000 tonnes of Israeli artillery, ammunition, gun barrels, aircraft parts and other w ar supplies\" was ordered to proceed directly to Ira n instead of transshipping through Zaire.20 It is hard to tak e very seriously the current show of surprise on th ese matters. Note again the continuing similarity between U.S. policy towards Iran and towards Nicaragua. There t oo, it is difficult to take seriously the current show of sur prise over the fact that the Reagan Administration has been actively engaged in arranging military support for its proxy army, circumventing Congressional legisla tion, not to speak of the World Court ruling, irrelevant to a terrorist state, and laws going back to the eighte enth-century Neutrality Act. We can learn more about these matters by attendin g to recent history. Notice first that the pattern of arms sales to Iran is a classic one, another crucial fact evad ed in current commentary. For example, relations be tween the U.S. and Indonesia became bitterly hostile 30 years ago, so much so that the CIA sponsored a failed mi litary rebellion in Indonesia in 1958. During the period o f hostility, the U.S. continued to provide arms to the Sukarno regime. In late 1965, the pro-American General Suha rto carried out a military coup, leading to the sla ughter of several hundred thousand people, mostly landless pe asants, and the destruction of the only mass-based political organization in Indonesia, the Indonesian Communist Party. Indonesia was thus restored to the Free Wor ld, opened to robbery and exploitation by U.S., Canadia n, European and Japanese corporations, impeded only by the rapacity of the ruling generals, who imposed a corrupt and brutal dictatorship. These developments were warmly welcomed by enligh tened opinion in the West, and regarded as a vindication of U.S. aggression against South Vietna m (called \"defense of South Vietnam\" within the propaganda system), which provided a \"shield\" that encouraged the generals to carry out the necessary purge of their society. In Senate testimony after the slaugh ter, Defense Secretary McNamara was asked to explai n the supply of arms to Indonesia during the period of in tense hostility between the two countries. He was a sked whether this arms supply had \"paid dividends\" and a greed that it had - including some 700,000 corpses at that point according to his Indonesian friends. A Congre ssional report held that training and maintaining communication with military officers paid \"enormous dividends\" in overthrowing Sukarno. Similarly, according to Pentagon sources, \"United States milit ary influence on local commanders was widely consid ered as an element in the coup d'etat that deposed Brazi l's leftist President Joao Goulart in 1964,\"21 inst alling a National Security State complete with torture, repr ession, and profits for the foreign investor, also greeted with acclaim by Kennedy liberals. The story was reenacte d in Chile a few years later. During the Allende re gime, the U.S. continued to supply arms while doing its best to bring down the regime, and was rewarded with the Pinochet coup, which again it welcomed."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" The Iranian operations conform to a familiar patt ern of policy planning, which is understandable and sometimes realistic. One can understand easily why it was publicly endorsed by Richard Helms and other s in 1982. The nature of U.S.-Iran relations under the Shah must also be recalled, in this connection. Iran was assigned a central role in controlling the Middle East under t he Nixon doctrine, which was based upon the recogni tion that the U.S. did not have the capacity to enforce its w ill everywhere and must therefore rely on local \"co ps on the beat\" (as Defense Secretary Melvin Laird put it), l ocal proxies that would carry out their \"regional responsibilities\" within the \"overall framework of order\" maintained by the United States, in Henry Ki ssinger's phrase at the time. A (partially tacit) tripartite alliance was constructed linking Iran, Saudi Arabia and Israel under the U.S. aegis, committed to \"defending\" U.S. domination of the world's major energy reserves an d protecting them from the primary enemy, the indigen ous population, which might be infected with the \"r adical\" idea that they should have a share in controlling o ur resources which happen to be in their lands. Thi s is, incidentally, only one example of a worldwide patte rn.22 It is in this context that the \"special relation ship\" with Israel developed as well. In 1958, the N ational Security Council noted that a \"logical corollary\" of opposit ion to radical Arab nationalism (in the technical s ense of the term) \"would be to support Israel as the only stron g pro-West power left in the Near East.\" According to David Ben-Gurion's biographer, Michael Bar-Zohar, at that time Israel concluded a \"periphery pact,\" which wa s \"long-lasting,\" with Iran, Turkey and Ethiopia, enc ouraged by U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dull es. Through the 1960s, U.S. intelligence regarded Israe l as a barrier to \"radical nationalist\" pressures a gainst Saudi Arabia, and the conception of Israel as a \"strategi c asset\" became institutionalized in U.S. policy af ter the U.S.- backed Israeli victory in 1967, and particularly af ter Israel's moves to block Syrian support for Pale stinians being massacred in Jordan in 1970 at a time when th e U.S. was unable to intervene directly for domesti c reasons. The fall of the Shah enhanced Israel's rol e as a \"strategic asset\" serving as a base for enfo rcing U.S. interests in the region. Meanwhile, Israel increasi ngly provided subsidiary services to the U.S. in so uthern Africa, Asia and Latin America.23 About 1970, a split developed among U.S. elites o ver U.S. policy in the region. This was symbolized by the controversy between Secretary olState William Roger s, who advanced a plan for a political settlement o f the Arab-Israel conflict along the lines of the interna tional consensus of the time, and Henry Kissinger, who argued that we must maintain a \"stalemate,\" his reason for backing Israel's rejection of Sadat's February 197 1 offer of a full peace settlement along the general lines of of ficial U.S. policy. Kissinger's views prevailed. Si nce that time his confrontationist, hard-line opposition to a gen uine political settlement has dominated U.S. policy , which has preferred to see an Israeli \"strategic asset\" playi ng its role in U.S. control of the region by the th reat or use of force. This explains the continued U.S. commitment to block a political settlement, that would probabl y lead to Israel's integration into the region.24 The U.S. has consistently sought to maintain the military confrontation and to ensure that Israel re mains a \"strategic asset.\" In this conception, Israel is to be highly militarized, technologically advanced, a pariah state with little in the way of an independent economy ap art from high tech production (often in coordinatio n with the U.S.), utterly dependent on the United States a nd hence dependable, serving U.S. needs as a local \"cop on the beat\" and as a mercenary state employed for U.S . purposes elsewhere, for example, in support of ne ar- genocide in Guatemala when domestic factors prevent ed Washington from participating as fully as it wou ld have liked in this enterprise.25 What about U.S. relations with the Arab world? Fi rst, the U.S. will act to ensure that it controls t he major energy resources of the Arabian peninsula: this is a central principle of U.S. foreign policy, as it h as been throughout the post-World War II period. The U.S. w ill therefore support \"moderate nationalists,\" such as the ruling elites in Saudi Arabia, well known for their \"moderation.\" Saudi Arabia too is called upon to e nlist in support of U.S. international terrorism, as already noted, and there should be little surprise at the revelation that it is deeply involved in the supply of arms to Iran along with its tacit Israeli ally and in U.S. terr orist activities in Central America, and probably elsewhere as well: southern Africa, for example. At the same time, th e U.S. will consistently oppose \"radical nationalists\" who stand in the way of U.S. objectives. Libya is a ca se in point. While the U.S. appears to have supported Qaddafi's effort to raise oil prices in the early 1970s \"in o rder to strengthen the position of the 'moderates/ such as Iran, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia,\"26 Libya has increa singly"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"been an obstacle to U.S. objectives, and was design ated as a prime target from the earliest days of th e Reagan Administration under the pretext of a \"war against international terrorism.\"27 In this connection, we should bear in mind that the Reagan Administration faced a rather serious pr oblem, from the outset. Contrary to many illusions, its ma jor policies have quite generally been unpopular. T he population continues, as before, to support social rather than military spending and to oppose the pro gram of enhancing state power and converting the state, eve n more than before, into a welfare state for the ri ch - one major function of the Pentagon system, which provid es a forced public subsidy to high technology indus try in the system of public subsidy and private profit cal led \"free enterprise.\" The public has also generall y opposed the \"activist\" foreign policy of subversion, interv ention, international terrorism and aggression hail ed as \"the Reagan doctrine.\" There is a classic means to deal with the problem of bringing a reluctant population to accept policies to which it is opposed: induce fear, in ac cord with Mencken's dictum, quoted earlier. Therefo re, we must have confrontations with the Evil Empire bent on our destruction, \"the monolithic and ruthless conspiracy\" committed to thwart our global benevole nce and to destroy us, in John F. Kennedy's phrase during a rather similar period of U.S. history. But a prob lem arises: confrontations with the Evil Empire are too dangerous. They might be costly to us, and therefor e cannot be undertaken. The solution to the dilemma is to create \"proxies\" of the Evil Empire, which can be a ttacked with impunity, since they are weak and defe nseless. Libya is perfect for the role, particularly against the background of rampant anti-Arab racism in the United States, and within the general context of the \"camp aign against international terrorism\" - that plague of the modern age from which the terrorist commanders in W ashington must defend us, according to various \"Operation Truths\" conducted by the ideological ins titutions. It is quite easy to kill many Libyans wi thout cost to ourselves - indeed with many cheers at home, inc luding enlightened liberal opinion -as we defend ou rselves against the \"evil scourge of terrorism.\" The next two years could be dangerous. The Reagan ites want to leave a permanent stamp on American politics, whatever the outcome of the next election s. They want to prove that violence pays. They want to overcome \"the sickly inhibitions against the use of military force\" (Norman Podhoretz). The propaganda system has constructed a series of demons: the Sandinistas , who are a \"cancer\" that must be destroyed (George Shultz); Qaddafi, the \"mad dog of the Middle East\"; Arafat, \"the father of modern terrorism\"; Castro, who threa tens to take over the Western Hemisphere in the service of the USSR; etc. If they can be destroyed by violence , the long-term effects on American culture will be profo und. There will be no more \"wimps\" making treaties and entering into negotiations, no concern for politica l settlement, international law and similar tommy r ot. Rather, the political system will be dominated by men lacki ng \"sickly inhibitions\" who get their kicks out of sending their client military forces and goon squads to tor ture people who cannot fight back -what is called \"conservatism\" in contemporary Newspeak."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Part 5. International Terrorism: Image and Reality (1989) There are two ways to approach the study of terrori sm. One may adopt a literal approach, taking the to pic seriously, or a propagandis-tic approach, construin g the concept of terrorism as a weapon to be exploi ted in the service of some system of power. In each case it is clear how to proceed. Pursuing the literal approac h, we begin by determining what constitutes terrorism. We then seek instances of the phenomenon - concentrat ing on the major examples, if we are serious - and try to determine causes and remedies. The propagandists ap proach dictates a different course. We begin with the thes is that terrorism is the responsibility of some off icially designated enemy. We then designate terrorist acts as \"terrorist\" just in case they can be attributed (whether plausibly or not) to the required source; otherwise they are to be ignored, suppressed or termed \"reta liation\" or \"self-defense.\" It comes as no surprise that the propagandistic approach is adopted by governments generally, and b y their instruments in totalitarian states. More interestin g is the fact that the same is largely true of the media and scholarship on terror in the Western industrial dem ocracies, as has been documented in extensive detai l.1 \"We must recognise,\" Michael Stohl observes, \"th at by convention - and it must be emphasised only b y convention - great power use and the threat of the use of force is normally described as coercive dipl omacy and not as a form of terrorism,\" though it commonly inv olves \"the threat and often the use of violence for what would be described as terroristic purposes were it not great powers who were pursuing the very same ta ctic.\"2 Only one qualification must be added: the term \"gre at powers\" is restricted to favored states; in the Western conventions under discussion here, the Soviet Union is granted no such rhetorical license, and indeed can be charged and convicted on the flimsiest evidence, th e mirror-image of Soviet practice. Terrorism became a major public issue in the 1980 s. The Reagan Administration took office announcing its dedication to stamp out what the president called \" the evil scourge of terrorism,\" a plague spread by \"depraved opponents of civilization itself\" in \"a return to b arbarism in the modern age\" (Secretary of State Geo rge Shultz). The campaign focused on a particularly virulent for m of the plague: state-directed international terro rism. The central thesis attributed responsibility to a Sovie t-based \"worldwide terror network aimed at the dest abilization of Western democratic society,\" in the words of Cla ire Sterling, whose highly praised book The Tenor N etwork became the Bible of the Administration and the foun ding document of the new discipline of terrorology. It was taken to have provided \"ample evidence\" that terror ism occurs \"almost exclusively in democratic or rel atively democratic societies\" (Walter Laqueur), leaving lit tle doubt about the origins of the plague. The book was soon exposed as a worthless propaganda tract, but the th esis remained intact, dominating mainstream reporti ng, commentary and scholarship. Concern over international terrorism peaked in th e mid-1980s. Mideast/Mediterranean terrorism was se lected by editors as the lead story of 1985 in an Associat ed Press poll, and a year later the tourism industr y in Europe collapsed as Americans stayed away in fear of Arab terrorists infesting European cities. The plague th en subsided, the monster having been tamed by \"the str ength of the cowboy,\" according to the approved ver sion. Shifting to the literal approach, we first define the concept of terrorism, and then investigate its application, letting the chips fall where they may. Let us see w here this course leads. THE CONCEPT OF TERRORISM Concepts of political discourse are hardly models o f clarity, but there is general agreement as to wha t constitutes terrorism. As a point of departure we m ay take the official United States Code: \"'act of t errorism' means an activity that - (A) involves a violent act or an act dangerous to h uman life that is a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or any State, or that would be a criminal vi olation if committed within the jurisdiction of the United States or of any State; and (B) appears to be inten ded (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian populati on; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidatio n or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by assassination or kidnapping.\"3"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" The concept is not precisely delimited. First, th e boundary between international terrorism and aggr ession is not always clear. On this matter, let us give the benefit of the do ubt to the United States and its clients: if they r eject the charge of aggression in the case of some act of internatio nal violence, we will take it to fall under the les ser crime of terrorism. There is also disagreement over the dist inction between terrorism and retaliation or legiti mate resistance, to which we return. U.S. sources also provide more succinct definitio ns of \"terrorism.\" A U.S. Army manual on countering terrorism defines it as \"the calculated use of viol ence or threat of violence to attain goals that are political, religious, or ideological in nature. This is done t hrough intimidation, coercion, or instilling fear.\" Still simpler is the characterization in a Pentagon-commissioned stu dy by noted terrorologist Robert Kupperman, which r efers to the threat or use of force \"to achieve political objectives without the full-scale commitment of re sources.\"4 Kupperman, however, is not discussing terrorism; rather, low intensity conflict (LIC), a central doc trine of the Reagan Administration. Note that as the description indicates and practice confirms, LIC - much like i ts predecessor \"counterinsurgency\" - is hardly more th an a euphemism for state-directed international ter rorism, that is, reliance on force that does not reach the level of the war crime of aggression. The point is recognized within the scholarly disc ipline, though with the usual doctrinal twist. One leading Israeli specialist, Professor Yonah Alexander, obse rves that \"state-sponsored terrorism is a form of l ow- intensity conflict that states undertake when they find it convenient to engage in 'war' without being held accountable for their actions.\"5 Alexander restrict s his attention to the Kremlin conspiracy to destab ilize the West with \"surrogate groups,\" offering such example s as \"an extensive PLO training programme . . . pro vided for Nicaragua.\" In this conception, \"the PLO, which maintains a special relationship with Moscow,\" ser ves its Soviet master by passing on the \"specialized traini ng\" in terrorism it acquires in the Soviet Union to Nicaragua, which is therefore able to conduct LIC against the United States and its interests. He also suggests w ays in which \"the Eastern Bloc's sincerity must be tested\" ; for example, \"Showing willingness to stop propaga nda campaigns linking the U.S. and its allies to terror ism.\" As the examples illustrate, it would take a ferti le imagination to conjure up a thought so outlandis h as to ruffle the composure of the fraternity, as long as doctrin al purity is preserved. TERRORISM AND THE POLITICAL CULTURE There are many terrorist states in the world, but t he United States is unusual in that it is officiall y committed to international terrorism, and on a scale that puts i ts rivals to shame. Thus Iran is surely a terrorist state, as Western governments and media rightly proclaim. Its major known contribution to international terroris m was revealed during the Iran-Contra inquiries: namely, Iran's perhaps inadvertent involvement in the U.S. proxy war against Nicaragua. This fact is unacceptable, there fore unnoticed, though the Iranian connection in U. S.- directed international terrorism was exposed at a t ime of impassioned denunciation of Iranian terroris m. The same inquiries revealed that under the Reagan Doctrine, the U.S. had forged new paths in interna tional terrorism. Some states employ individual terrorists and criminals to carry out violent acts abroad. Bu t in the Reagan years, the U.S. went further, not only const ructing a semi-private international terrorist netw ork, but also an array of client and mercenary states - Arge ntina (under the Generals), Taiwan, South Korea, Is rael, Saudi Arabia, and others - to finance and implement its terrorist operations. This advance in internat ional terrorism was revealed during the period of maximal anguish over the plague, but did not enter into th e discussion and debate. The U.S. commitment to international terrorism re aches to fine detail. Thus the proxy forces attacki ng Nicaragua were directed by their CIA and Pentagon c ommanders to attack \"soft targets,\" that is, barely defended civilian targets, and not to \"duke it out\" with the army. The State Department specifically a uthorized attacks on agricultural cooperatives - exactly what we denounce with horror when the agent is Abu Nida l. Media doves expressed thoughtful approval of this s tand. New Republic editor Michael Kinsley, at the l iberal extreme of mainstream commentary, argued that we sh ould not be too quick to dismiss State Department"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"justifications for terrorist attacks on farming coo peratives: a \"sensible policy\" must \"meet the test of cost- benefit analysis,\" an analysis of \"the amount of bl ood and misery that will be poured in, and the like lihood that democracy will emerge at the other end.\" It is unde rstood that U.S. elites have the right to conduct t he analysis and pursue the project if it passes their tests.6 When a Contra supply plane was shot down in Octob er 1986 with an American mercenary on board, it bec ame impossible to suppress the evidence of illegal CIA supply flights to the proxy forces. The Iran-Contra hearings ensued, focusing much attention on these topics. A few days after they ended, the Central American pre sidents signed the Esquipulas II peace agreement. The U.S. undertook at once to subvert it. The agreement iden tified one factor as \"an indispensable element to achievin g a stable and lasting peace in the region,\" namely , termination of any form of aid \"to irregular forces or insurgent movements\" on the part of \"regional o r extraregional\" governments. In response, the U.S. m oved at once to escalate the attacks on soft target s in Nicaragua. Congress and the media kept their eyes s crupulously averted from the rapid increase in CIA supply flights to several a day, while cooperating with th e White House program of dismantling the unwanted a ccords, a goal finally achieved in January 1988, though fur ther steps were required to subvert a follow-up agr eement of the Central American presidents in February 1989.7 As supply and surveillance flights for the proxy forces increased, so did violence and terror, as i ntended. This too passed largely unnoticed, though an occasional reference can be found. The Los Angeles Times repor ted in October 1987 that \"Western military analysts say th e Contras have been stashing tons of newly airdropp ed weapons lately while trying to avoid heavy combat. . . Meanwhile, they have stepped up attacks on easy government targets like the La Patriota farm cooper ative . . . where several militiamen, an elderly wo man and her year-old grandson died in a pre-dawn shelling.\" To select virtually at random from the many cases deemed unworthy of notice, on November 21, 150 Contras att acked two villages in the southern province of Rio San Juan with 88 mm mortars and rocket-propelled grenad es, killing six children and six adults and injurin g 30 others. Even cooperatives of religious pacifists wh o refused to bear arms were destroyed by the U.S. t errorist forces. In El Salvador too, the military forces arm ed and trained by the U.S. attack cooperatives, kil ling, raping and abducting members, among routine terrorist atro cities.8 The decision of the International Court of Justic e in June 1986 condemning the United States for the \"unlawful use of force\" and illegal economic warfare was dism issed as an irrelevant pronouncement by a \"hostile forum\" (New York Times). Little notice was taken when the U.S. vetoed a Security Council resolution endorsing the ruling and calling on all states to observe interna tional law, and voted against General Assembly reso lutions to the same effect (with Israel and El Salvador in 198 6; with Israel alone in 1987). Also ignored was the Court ruling that all aid to the Contras is military, not humanitarian; it continued to be designated \"human itarian aid\" in the media. The guiding principle, it appears, is that the U.S. is a lawless terrorist state and thi s is right and just, whatever the world may think, whatever intern ational institutions may declare. A corollary is the doctrine that no state has the right to defend itself from U.S. attack. The broad acquiescence in this remarkable doctrine was revealed as Reagan Administration Agitprop floated periodic stories ab out Nicaraguan plans to obtain jet interceptors. There was some criticism of the media for uncritically sw allowing the disinformation, but a more significant fact was ignored: the general agreement that such behavior on the part of Nicaragua would be entirely unacceptable. W hen the tale was concocted to divert attention from the Nicaraguan elections of 1984, Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, with the support of other leading doves, warned that the U.S. would have to bomb Nicaragua i f it obtained vintage 1950s MIGs, because \"they're also capable against the United States,\" hence a threat to its security9 - as distinct, say, from U.S. nucl ear missiles on alert status in countries surrounding Russia, no threat to it because they are purely for defensive purposes. It is understood that jet interceptors might enable Ni caragua to protect its territory from the CIA suppl y flights that keep the U.S. proxy forces in the field and th e surveillance flights that provide them with up-to -the-minute information on the disposition of Nicaraguan troops , so that they can safely attack soft targets. Unde rstood, but scarcely mentioned.10 And it seems that no one in t he mainstream released the open secret that Nicarag ua would happily accept French planes instead of MIGs if the U.S. had not pressured its allies to bar mil itary aid so that we might cower in fear of \"the Soviet-suppl ied Sandinistas.\" The same issue arose in August 1988, when congre ssional doves effusively supported the Byrd Amendme nt on \"Assistance for the Nicaraguan Resistance.\" Thre e days before, the Contras had attacked the passeng er"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"vessel Mission of Peace, killing two people and wou nding 27, all civilians, including a Baptist minist er from New Jersey who headed a U.S. religious delegation. The incident was unmentioned in the Senate debate o n the Byrd Amendment. Rather, congressional doves warned that if the Nicaraguan Army carried out \"an unprovo ked military attack\" or \"any other hostile action\" agai nst the perpetrators of such terrorist atrocities, then Congress would respond with vigor and righteousness by renew ing official military aid to them. Media coverage a nd other commentary found nothing odd or noteworthy in this stance. The message is clear: no one has the right of sel f-defense against U.S. terrorist attack. The U.S. i s a terrorist state by right. That is unchallengeable doctrine, s o firmly established that in responsible discourse it cannot even be discussed, only presupposed, much like the doctrine that the U.S. attack against South Vietnam was the \"defense of South Vietnam\" against \"internal aggres sion,\" perhaps unwise, the doves came to believe. Accordingly, organization of a terrorist proxy ar my to subdue some recalcitrant population is a legi timate task. On the right, Jeane Kirkpatrick explained that \"for ceful intervention in the affairs of another nation \" is neither \"impractical\" nor \"immoral\" - merely illegal, a cri me for which people were hanged at Nuremberg and To kyo with ringing declarations that this was not \"victor 's justice\" because, as Justice Robert Jackson stat ed: \"If certain acts and violations of treaties are crimes, they ar e crimes whether the United States does them or whe ther Germany does them. We are not prepared to lay down a rule of criminal conduct against others which we would not be willing to have invoked against us.\"11 Countering any such thoughts, Irving Kristol exp lains that \"The argument from international law lac ks all credibility.\" True, \"a great power should not ordin arily intervene in the domestic affairs of a smalle r nation,\" but this principle is overcome if \"another great po wer has previously breached this rule.\" Since it is \"beyond dispute\" that \"the Soviet Union has intervened in N icaragua\" by providing arms and technicians \"in bot h the military and civilian spheres,\" then the U.S. has t he right to send its proxy army to attack Nicaragua . By the same argument, the Soviet Union has a perfect right to attack Turkey or Denmark - far more of a securi ty threat to it than Nicaragua is to the United States - sinc e it is \"beyond dispute\" that the U.S. provides the m with assistance, and would go well beyond that, surely, if the USSR were to exercise the right of aggressio n accorded it by Kristol's logic. Kristol might, however, counter this argument too by invoking a crucial distinction that he has draw n elsewhere in connection with the right of forceful intervention by the United States: \"insignificant n ations, like insignificant people, can quickly experience delusi ons of significance,\" he explained. And when they d o, these delusions must be driven from their minds by force: \"In truth, the days of 'gunboat diplomacy' are nev er over . . . Gunboats are as necessary for international order as police cars are for domestic order.\" It presuma bly follows, then, that the U.S. is entitled to use violence aga inst Nicaragua, an insignificant nation, though the USSR lacks this right in the case of Turkey or Denmark.12 The overwhelming endorsement for U.S.-directed in ternational terrorism should not be obscured by the wide elite opposition to the Contra war. By 1986, polls showed that 80 percent of \"leaders\" opposed aid to the Contras, and there was vigorous debate in Congress and the media about the program. But it is importan t to attend to the terms of the debate. At the dissident extreme, Tom Wicker of the New York Times observed that \"Mr. Reagan's policy of supporting [the contras] is a clear failure,\" so we should \"acquiesce in some negotiated regional arrangement that would be enforced by Nica ragua's neighbors\" - if they can take time away fro m slaughtering their own populations, a feature of th ese terror states that does not exclude them from t he role of enforcing regional arrangements on the errant Sandi nistas, against whom no remotely comparable charge could credibly be made. Expressing the same thought, the editors of the Washington Post saw the Contras as \" an imperfect instrument,\" so that other means must be sought to \"fit Nicaragua back into a Central Americ an mode\" and impose \"reasonable conduct by a regional standard,\" the standard of Washington's terror stat es. Senate Majority Whip Alan Cranston, a leading dove, recognized that \"the Contra effort is woefully ina dequate to achieve ... democracy in Nicaragua\" (the U.S. ai m by doctrinal fiat, whatever the facts may be), so the U.S. must find other means to \"isolate\" the \"reprehensib le\" government in Managua and \"leave it to fester i n its own juices.\" No such strictures hold for Washington's m urderous clients. In short, there is little deviation from the basi c terms of Michael Kinsley's \"sensible policy.\" The questions have to do with efficacy, not principle. Our own st ate has the right to use violence as deemed appropr iate,13"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" The motivation for the resort to international te rrorism in the case of Nicaragua has been candidly explained. High Administration officials observed that the goa l of the attack was \"forcing [the Sandinistas] to d ivert scarce resources to the war and away from social programs. \" This was the basic thrust of the 1981 CIA program endorsed by the Administration. As outlined by form er CIA analyst David MacMichael in his testimony be fore the World Court, this program had as its purpose: t o use the proxy army to \"provoke cross-border attac ks by Nicaraguan forces and thus serve to demonstrate Nic aragua's aggressive nature,\" to pressure the Nicara guan government to \"clamp down on civil liberties within Nicaragua itself, arresting its opposition, demons trating its allegedly inherent totalitarian nature and thus inc rease domestic dissent within the country,\" and to undermine the shattered economy. Discussing the strategy of m aintaining a terrorist force within Nicaragua after the huge CIA supply operation was theoretically cancelled by Congress in February 1988 (and the proxy forces la rgely fled), a Defense Department official explained: Those 2000 hard-core guys could keep some pressure on the Nicaraguan government, force them to use the ir economic resources for the military, and prevent th em from solving their economic problems - and that' s a plus . . . Anything that puts pressure on the Sandinista regime, calls attention to its lack of democracy, and prevents the Sandinistas from solving their economic problem s is a plus. Viron Vaky, Assistant Secretary of State for Inte ramerican Affairs in the Carter Administration, obs erved that the principal argument for the terrorist attack is that \"a longer war of attrition will so weaken the regime, provoke such a radical hardening of repression, and win sufficient support from Nicaragua's discontent ed population that sooner or later the regime will be overthrown by popular revolt, self-destruct by mean s of internal coups or leadership splits, or simply capi tulate to salvage what it can.\" As a dove, Vaky reg ards the conception as \"flawed\" but in no way wrong.14 The terrorist forces fully understand their direc tives, as we learn from the most important defector of the 1980s, the head of intelligence of the main Contra force (FDN), Horacio Arce, whose nom de guerre was \"Mercenario\"; talk of \"democrats\" and \"freedom figh ters\" is for home consumption. Sandinista defectors are eagerly exploited by the White House and the media, and the Contras generally received extensive cover age. But Contra defectors are another matter, particular ly when they have unwelcome stories to relate. Arce was ignored in the U.S. when he defected in late 1988. In interviews in Mexico before returning to Managua to accept amnesty, Arce described his illegal training in an airforce base in the southern United States, identified by name the CIA agents who provided support for the Contras under an AID cover in the Honduran Embassy in Tegucigalpa, outlined how the Honduran Army provide s intelligence and support for Contra military acti vities, and discussed the immense corruption of the proxy f orces and their sale of arms to the Honduran arms b azaar, where they then reach Salvadoran guerrillas. U.S. i ntelligence on \"non-military targets\" was particula rly useful, he explains, because: \"We attack a lot of schools, health centers, and those sort of things. We have t ried to make it so that the Nicaraguan government cannot pr ovide social services for the peasants, cannot deve lop its project. . . that's the idea.\" The effectiveness of the U.S. training is amply confirmed by the record .15 The Contra war easily qualifies as \"state-sponsor ed terrorism,\" as former CIA director Stansfield Tu rner testified before Congress in April 1985. But one mi ght argue that it should be termed outright aggress ion. That might be taken to be the import of the 1986 World C ourt decision. Let us, however, continue to give th e U.S. the benefit of the doubt, thus assigning its action s against Nicaragua to the category of internationa l terrorism. INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM IN THE 1980S During the 1980s, the primary locus of internationa l terrorism was Central America. In Nicaragua the U .S. proxy forces left a trail of murder, torture, rape, mutilation, kidnapping and destruction, but were i mpeded because civilians had an army to defend them. No co mparable problems arose in the U.S. client-states, where the main terrorist force attacking the civilian pop ulation was the army and other state security force s. In El Salvador, tens of thousands were slaughtered in wha t the Archbishop in October 1980, shortly after the operations moved into high gear, described as \"a wa r of extermination and genocide against a defensele ss civilian population.\" This exercise in state terror sought \"to destroy the people's organizations figh ting to defend their fundamental human rights,\" as Archbishop Osca r Romero warned shortly before his assassination wh ile vainly pleading with President Carter not to send a id to the armed forces who, he continued, \"know onl y how to repress the people and defend the interests of the Salvadorean oligarchy.\" The goals were largely achi eved"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"during the Reagan Administration, which escalated t he savagery of the assault against the population t o new heights. When it seemed that the U.S. might be draw n into an invasion that would be harmful to its own interests, there was some concern and protest in el ite circles, but that abated as state terror appear ed successful, with the popular organizations decimated and \"decap itated.\" After elections under conditions of violen ce and repression guaranteeing victory to privileged eleme nts acceptable to the U.S., the issue largely passe d below the threshold. Little notice was taken of the significant incre ase in state terror after the Esquipulas II accords ; or of an Amnesty International report entitled El Salvador: \"Death Squads\" - A Government Strategy (October 198 8), reporting the \"alarming rise\" in killings by offici al death squads as part of the government strategy of intimidating any potential opposition by \"killing a nd mutilating victims in the most macabre way,\" lea ving victims \"mutilated, decapitated, dismembered, stran gled or showing marks of torture ... or rape.\" Sinc e the goal of the government strategy is \"to intimidate or coe rce a civilian population\" (that is, terrorism, as officially defined in the U.S. Code), it is not enough simply to kill. Rather, bodies must be left dismembered by the roadside, and women must be found hanging from tree s by their hair with their faces painted red and th eir breasts cut off, while domestic elites pretend not to see as they continue to fund, train, and support the murderers and torturers. In the same years, a massacre of even greater sc ale took place in Guatemala, also supported through out by the United States and its mercenary states. Here too, t error increased after the Esquipulas II peace agree ment in order to guard against steps towards democracy, soc ial reform and protection of human rights called fo r in the accords. As in El Salvador, these developments were virtually ignored; the assigned task was to focus attention on Nicaragua and to express vast outrage when Nicar agua occasionally approached the lesser abuses that are regular practice in the U.S. client-states. Since t he goal is to restore Nicaragua to \"the Central Ame rican mode\" and ensure that it observes the \"regional standards \" satisfied by El Salvador and Guatemala, terror in client- states is of no real concern, unless it becomes so visible as to endanger the flow of aid to the kille rs.16 Notice crucially that all of this is internationa l terrorism, supported or directly organized in Was hington with the assistance of its international network of merc enary states. Well after the 1984 elections that were hailed fo r having brought democracy to El Salvador, the Chur ch-based human rights organization Socorro Juridico, operati ng under the protection of the Archdiocese of San S alvador, described the results of the continuing terror, sti ll conducted by \"the same members of the armed forc es who enjoy official approval and are adequately trained to carry out these acts of collective suffering,\" i n the following terms: Salvadoran society, affected by terror and panic, a result of the persistent violation of basic human rights, shows the following traits: collective intimidation and g eneralized fear, on the one hand, and on the other the internalized acceptance of the terror because of th e daily and frequent use of violent means. In gener al, society accepts the frequent appearance of tortured bodies, because basic rights, the right to life, has absol utely no overriding value for society.17 The same comment applies to the societies that over see these operations, or simply look the other way. BEFORE THE OFFICIAL PLAGUE International terrorism is, of course, not an inven tion of the 1980s. In the previous two decades, its major victims were Cuba and Lebanon. Anti-Cuban terrorism was directed by a secret Spe cial Group established in November 1961 under the c ode name \"Mongoose,\" involving 400 Americans, 2,000 Cub ans, a private navy of fast boats, and a $50 millio n annual budget, run in part by a Miami CIA station f unctioning in violation of the Neutrality Act and, presumably, the law banning CIA operations in the U nited States.18 These operations included bombing o f hotels and industrial installations, sinking of fis hing boats, poisoning of crops and livestock, conta mination of sugar exports, etc. Not all of these actions were s pecifically authorized by the CIA, but no such cons iderations absolve official enemies."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" Several of these terrorist operations took place at the time of the Cuban missile crisis of October- November 1962. In the weeks before, Garthoff reports, a Cuba n terrorist group operating from Florida with U.S. government authorization carried out \"a daring spee dboat strafing attack on a Cuban seaside hotel near Havana where Soviet military technicians were known to con gregate, killing a score of Russians and Cubans\"; a nd shortly after, attacked British and Cuban cargo shi ps and again raided Cuba among other actions that w ere stepped up in early October. At a tense moment of t he missile crisis, on November 8, a terrorist team dispatched from the United States blew up a Cuban industrial f acility after the Mongoose operations had been offi cially suspended. Fidel Castro alleged that 400 workers ha d been killed in this operation, guided by \"photogr aphs taken by spying planes.\" This terrorist act, which might have set off a global nuclear war, evoked lit tle comment when it was revealed. Attempts to assassina te Castro and other terror continued immediately af ter the crisis terminated, and were escalated by Nixon in 1 969.19 Such operations continued after the Nixon years. In 1976, for example, two Cuban fishing vessels we re attacked in April by boats from Miami, the main cen ter of anti-Cuban terrorism worldwide. A few weeks later, the Cuban embassy in Portugal was bombed with two k illed. In July, the Cuban mission to the UN in New York was bombed and there were bombings aimed at Cu ban targets in the Caribbean and Colombia, along wi th the attempted bombing of a pro-Cuban meeting at the Academy of Music in New York. In August, two offic ials of the Cuban embassy in Argentina were kidnapped an d Cubana airline offices in Panama were bombed. The Cuban embassy in Venezuela was fired upon in Octobe r and the embassy in Madrid was bombed in November. In October, CIA-trained Cuban exiles bombed a Cuban a civilian airliner, killing all 73 aboard, includi ng Cuba's gold medal-winning international fencing team. One of the agents of this terrorist operation, Bay of P igs veteran Luis Posada Carriles, was sprung from the V enezuelan jail where he was held for the bombing; h e found his way to El Salvador, where he was put to w ork at the Ilopango military airbase to help organi ze the U.S. terrorist operations in Nicaragua. The CIA att ributed 89 terrorist operations in the U.S. and the Caribbean area for 1969-79 to Cuban exile groups, and the maj or one, OMEGA 7, was identified by the FBI as the m ost dangerous terrorist group operating in the U.S. dur ing much of the 1970s.20 Cuba figures heavily in scholarly work on interna tional terrorism. Walter Laqueur's standard work (s ee note 1) contains many innuendoes about possible Cuban spons orship of terrorism, though little evidence. There is not a word, however, on the terrorist operations against Cuba. He writes that in \"recent decades . . . the m ore oppressive regimes are not only free from terror, t hey have helped to launch it against more permissiv e societies.\" The intended meaning is that the United States, a \"permissive society,\" is one of the vict ims of international terrorism, while Cuba, an \"oppressive regime,\" is one of the agents. To establish the co nclusion it is necessary to suppress the fact that the U.S. has undeniably launched major terrorist attacks agains t Cuba and is relatively free from terror itself; and if there is a case to be made against Cuba, Laqueur has sig nally failed to present it. Turning to the second major example of the pre-Re agan period, in southern Lebanon from the early 197 0s the population was held hostage with the \"rational pros pect, ultimately fulfilled, that affected populatio ns would exert pressure for the cessation of hostilities\" an d acceptance of Israeli arrangements for the region (Abba Eban, commenting on Prime Minister Menachem Begin's accou nt of atrocities in Lebanon committed under the Lab or government in the style \"of regimes which neither M r. Begin nor I would dare to mention by name,\" Eban observed, acknowledging the accuracy of the account ).21 Notice that this justification, offered by a r espected Labor Party dove, places these actions squarely und er the rubric of international terrorism (if not ag gression). Thousands were killed and hundreds of thousands d riven from their homes in these attacks. Little is known because the matter was of no interest; PLO attacks against Israel in the same years, barbaric but at a far lesser scale, elicited great indignation and extensive cov erage. ABC correspondent Charles Glass, then a jour nalist in Lebanon, found \"little American editorial interest in the conditions of the south Lebanese. The Israel i raids and shelling of their villages, their gradual exodus fr om south Lebanon to the growing slums on the outski rts of Beirut were nothing compared to the lurid tales of the 'terrorists' who threatened Israel, hijacked ae roplanes and seized embassies.\" The reaction was much the same, he continues, when Israeli death squads were operat ing in southern Lebanon after the 1982 Israeli invasion. O ne could read about them in the London Times, but U .S. editors were not interested. Had the media reported the operations of \"these death squads of plainclot hes Shin Beth [secret police] men who assassinated suspects in the villages and camps of south Lebanon . . . st irring up the Shi'ite Muslim population and helping to make t he Marine presence untenable,\" there mightjiave bee n some"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"appreciation of the plight of the U.S. Marines depl oyed in Lebanon. They seemed to have no idea why th ey were there apart from \"the black enlisted men: almo st all of them said, though sadly never on camera, that they had been sent to protect the rich against the poor. \" \"The only people in Lebanon they identified with were the poor Shi'ite refugees who lived all around their ba se at the Beirut airport; it is sad that it was pro bably one of these poor Shi'ites . . . who killed 241 of them on 23 October 1983.\" If any of these matters had been reported, it might have been possible to avert, or at the ver y least to comprehend, the bombing in which the Mar ines were killed, victims of a policy that \"the press could n ot explain to the public and their information offi cers could not explain to the Marines themselves.\"22 In 1976, Syria entered Lebanon with U.S. approval and helped implement further massacres, the major one at the Palestinian refugee camp of Tel Al-Zaater, wher e thousands were murdered by Syrian-backed Christia n forces with Israeli arms.23 Without proceeding further, it is clear that the plague of state-directed international terrorism wa s rampant well before it was converted into a major issue by the \"public diplomacy\" of the Reagan Administration . THE CANON: RETAIL TERRORISM Wholesale terrorism of the kind reviewed here has l argely been excluded from the discussion of \"the ev il scourge of terrorism.\" Let us then turn to the smal ler-scale acts of terror that fall within the canon . Here too, the record goes back well before the 19 80s, though the literature is too selective to be v ery useful. To mention a few examples not found in Laqueur's st andard source, while he refers to the use of letter bombs and \"a primitive book bomb\" used by approved villai ns, there is no mention of the sophisticated book b omb used by Israeli intelligence to kill General Mustap ha Hafez in Gaza in 1956 at a time when he was resp onsible for preventing Palestinian Fedayeen from infiltrati ng to attack Israeli targets.24 Laqueur's review of the use of letter bombs does not include the testimony of Ya'a kov Eliav, who claims to have been the first to use letter bombs when he served as a commander of the terroris t group headed by the current Prime Minister of Isr ael, Yitzhak Shamir (Lehi, the \"Stern Gang\"). Working fr om Paris in 1946, he arranged to have 70 such bombs sent in official British government envelopes to all mem bers of the British cabinet, the heads of the Tory opposition, and several military commanders. In June 1947, he a nd an accomplice were caught by Belgian police whil e attempting to send these letter bombs, and all were intercepted.25 The standard record of hijacking and bombing of a irliners also avoids some important topics, among t hem, the U.S. refusal of requests from communist countries i n the 1950s to return \"persons who hijacked planes, trains, and ships to escape\" (State Department legal adviso r Abraham Sofaer, who notes that the policy was \"reexamined\" from the late 1960s - when the U.S. an d its allies were targeted). The first airplane hij acking in the Middle East also falls outside the canon: Israe l's hijacking of a Syrian airways civilian jet in 1 954, with the intent \"to get hostages in order to obtain the rele ase of our prisoners in Damascus,\" who had been cap tured on a spy mission in Syria (Prime Minister Moshe Sharett) . Also excluded is the shooting down of an unarmed Egyptian civilian plane by the Israeli air force in October 1956, killing 16 people including four jou rnalists, in a failed attempt to assassinate Field Marshall Abdul Hakim Amar, second to President Nasser, at a time w hen the two countries were not in a state of war. This was a pre-planned operation, thus unlike Israel's downi ng of a Libyan civilian airliner with 110 killed as it was lost in a sandstorm two minutes' flight time from C airo, towards which it was heading. This February 1973 ac tion took place while Israeli airborne and amphibio us forces were attacking Tripoli in northern Lebanon, killing 31 people (mainly civilians) and destroying classrooms, clinics and other buildings in a raid j ustified as preemptive.26 Such matters were (and are) dismissed as insignif icant, if even noticed. The reaction to Arab terror ism is quite different. Turning to the 1980s, consider 1985, when media c oncern peaked. The major single terrorist act of th e year was the blowing up of an Air India flight, killing 329 people. The terrorists had reportedly been trai ned in a paramilitary camp in Alabama run by Frank Camper, w here mercenaries were trained for terrorist acts in Central America and elsewhere. According to ex-merc enaries, Camper had close ties to U.S. intelligence and was personally involved in the Air India bombing, a llegedly a \"sting\" operation that got out of contro l. On a"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"visit to India, Attorney-General Edwin Meese conced ed in a backhanded way that the terrorist operation s originated in a U.S. terrorist training camp.27 Any connection of a terrorist to Libya, however frail, suffices to demonstrate that Qaddafi is a \"mad dog\" who must be eliminated. In the Middle East, the main center of internatio nal terrorism according to the canon, the worst sin gle terrorist act of 1985 was a car bombing in Beirut on March 8 that killed 80 people and wounded 256. \"About 250 g irls and women in flowing black chadors, pouring out of Friday prayers at the Imam Rida Mosque, took the br unt of the blast,\" Nora Boustany reported three years l ater: \"At least 40 of them were killed and many mor e were maimed.\" The bomb also \"burned babies in their beds,\" \"ki lled a bride buying her trousseau,\" and \"blew away three children as they walked home from the mosque\" as it \"devastated the main street of the densely populat ed\" West Beirut suburb. The target was the Shi'ite lead er Sheikh Fadlallah, accused of complicity in terro rism, but he escaped. The attack was arranged by the CIA and its Saudi clients with the assistance of Lebanese intelligence and a British specialist, and specific ally authorized by CIA director William Casey, acco rding to Bob Woodward's account in his book on Casey and the CIA.28 Even under its chosen conventions, then, it seems that the United States wins the prize for acts of international terrorism in the peak year of the official plague. The U.S. client-state of Israel follows closely beh ind. Its Iron Fist operations in Lebanon were without parallel fo r the year as sustained acts of international terro rism in the Middle East, and the bombing of Tunis (with tacit U .S. support) wins second prize for single terrorist acts, unless we take this to be a case of actual aggressi on, as was determined by the U.N. Security Council. 29 In 1986, the major single terrorist act was the U .S. bombing of Libya - assuming, again, that we do not assign this attack to the category of aggression.30 For 19 86 too the United States seems to place well in the competition for the prize for international terrori sm, even apart from the wholesale terrorism it spon sored in Central America, where, in that year, Congress resp onded to the World Court call for an end to the \"un lawful use of force\" by voting $100 million of military ai d to the U.S. proxy forces in what the Administrati on gleefully described as a virtual declaration of war . TERROR AND RESISTANCE Let us turn now to several contentious questions ab out the scope of terrorism, so far avoided. Consider the boundary between terrorism and legit imate resistance. Sometimes, nationalist groups are prepared to describe their actions as terrorism, an d some respected political leaders decline to conde mn acts of terrorism in the national cause. An example particu larly relevant to current discussion is the pre-sta te Zionist movement. Israel is the source of the 1980s \"terror ism industry\" (then transferred to the U.S. for fur ther development), as an ideological weapon against Pale stinians.31 The PLO is anathema in the United State s. A special act of Congress, the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987, \"prohibits American citizens from receiving a ny assistance, funds, or 'anything of value except inf ormational materials' from the PLO,\" which is not p ermitted to establish offices or other facilities to further it s interests.32 Palestinian violence has received wo rldwide condemnation. The pre-state Zionist movement carried out extens ive terror, killing many civilians, mainly Arabs, a lso murdering British diplomat Lord Moyne and U.N. medi ator Folke Bernadotte (whose killers were protected after the state was established). In 1943, current Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir wrote an article enti tled \"Terror\" for the journal of the terrorist organizat ion he headed (Lehi) in which he proposed to \"dismi ss all the 'phobia' and babble against terror with simple, obv ious arguments.\" \"Neither Jewish morality nor Jewis h tradition can be used to disallow terror as a means of war,\" he wrote, and \"We are very far from any m oral hesitations when concerned with the national strugg le.\" \"First and foremost, terror is for us a part o f the political war appropriate for the circumstances of today, and its task is a major one: it demonstrates in the clearest language, heard throughout the world inclu ding by our unfortunate brethren outside the gates of this country, our war against the occupier.\" As has been widely observed in Israel, the British occupation was far less repressive than Israel's rule in the occupied territories and faced a much more violent resistanc e."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" Isaiah Berlin recalls that Chaim Weizmann, first president of Israel and one of the most revered fig ures of the national movement, \"did not think it morally decent to denounce either the acts [of Jewish terrorism] or their perpetrators in public ... he did not propose to sp eak out against acts, criminal as he thought them, which sprang from the tormented minds of men driven to desperati on, and ready to give up their lives to save their brothers from what, he and they were equally convinced, was a betrayal and a destruction cynically prepared for them by the foreign offices of the western powers.\"33 The archives of the mainstream Zionist resistance group, Haganah, contain the names of 40 Jews kille d by Menachem Begin's Irgun and Lehi. Yitzhak Shamir's p ersonal assassination of a Lehi associate is a famo us incident. The official Irgun history, while recalli ng with admiration many acts of terror against Arab civilians, also cites the murder of a Jewish member who, it wa s feared, would give information to the police if c aptured. Suspected collaborators were a particular target, f rom the earliest days. The official history of the Haganah, under \"special activities,\" describes the assassina tion of the Dutch orthodox Jew Jacob de Haan by Hag anah assassins in 1924 because he was seeking \"to constr uct a united front of the old Yishuv [Jewish commun ity] with the Arab Higher Committee against the new Yish uv and the Zionist enterprise.\" In later years the Haganah Special Actions Squads carried out \"punitive action s\" against Jewish informers. A Haganah prison in Ha ifa in the 1940s contained a torture chamber for interroga tion of Jews suspected of collaboration with the Br itish. In a 1988 interview, Dov Tsisis describes his work as a Haganah enforcer, \"following orders, like the Nazis ,\" to \"eliminate\" Jews interfering with the national stru ggle, \"particularly informers.\" He also rejects the familiar charge that the murderous bombing of the King David Hotel was carried out by the Irgun alone, identify ing himself as the special representative of Haganah co mmander Yitzhak Sadeh, who authorized it. He was la ter recommended by Moshe Dayan to replace him as comman der of an elite unit.34 Anti-Nazi resisters also describe the murder of collaborators. Israel Shahak, one of Israel's forem ost civil libertarians and a survivor of the Warsaw ghetto an d Bergen-Belsen, recalls that \"before the Warsaw gh etto revolt . . . the Jewish underground, with complete justification, killed every Jewish collaborator tha t they could find.\" He recalls a vivid childhood memory from Feb ruary 1943, \"when I danced and sang together with o ther children around the body [of a murdered Jewish coll aborator], with blood still flowing from his body, and to the present I have no regrets about that; on the contra ry.\" Citing the memoirs of Yitzhak (Antek) Zuckerma n, the leader of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, Leah Enbal wr ites that \"Nine months before the outbreak of the W arsaw Ghetto uprising the Jewish underground initiated th e systematic extermination of collaborators from th e Judenrat and the Jewish police,\" sometimes with \"co llective killings.\" \"It would have been impossible to fight the Germans without first finishing with the intern al treachery,\" Zuckerman recalled. The killing of collaborators was regarded as legitimate revenge by the ordinary person. German collaborators, sometim es \"Gestapo members,\" had to be \"destroyed to the last one,\" including those \"whose activities were in contradiction to Jewish interests.\" It was a \"histo ric failure\" to \"delay too long\" in killing Jewish collaborators, Zuckerman added: \"Today, for example, I am certain that, wherever there is internal treachery, the war must begin with elimination of the internal treachery. [ Delay in doing this] was our great failure, our dis grace.\"35 These comments appeared during a wave of intense criticism of Palestinians for killing collaborators with the Israeli secret police during the Intifada. While frank avowal of terrorism of the Shamir var iety can occasionally be found, the more normal pat tern is for actions undertaken against oppressive regimes a nd occupying armies to be considered resistance by their perpetrators and terrorism by the rulers, even when they are nonviolent. What the Western democracies considered to be resistance in occupied Europe or A fghanistan, the Nazis and the USSR branded terror - in fact, terror inspired from abroad, therefore internationa l terrorism. The U.S. took the same position toward s the South Vietnamese who bore the brunt of the U.S. att ack. On similar grounds, the Apartheid regime of South Africa surely takes strong exception to the intern ational conventions on terrorism: specifically, to the majo r U.N. General Assembly resolution condemning international terrorism and calling on all states t o act to combat the plague. The reason is that the General Assembly: Considers that nothing in the present resolution co uld in any way prejudice the right to self-determin ation, freedom and independence, as derived from the Chart er of the United Nations, of peoples forcibly depri ved of"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"that right. . . , particularly peoples under coloni al and racist regimes and foreign occupation or oth er forms of colonial domination, nor... the right of these peop les to struggle to this end and to seek and receive support [in accordance with the Charter and other principles of international law].36 While this provision was endorsed by virtually th e entire world, South Africa was not entirely alone in opposing it. The resolution passed 153 to two (Hond uras alone abstaining). Explaining their negative v otes, the U.S. and Israel referred to the cited paragraph, un derstood ±o refer to resistance to their South Afri can ally by the African National Congress (one of the \"more not orious terrorist groups\" in the world, according to official Washington), and to Israel's military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, then entering its third de cade.37 Washington's refusal to endorse the strongest UN re solution condemning the \"return to barbarism in the modern age\" at the peak of concern, and the reasons for it , elicited no comment. The issue came to a head in late 1988 in connecti on with the Israel-Palestinian conflict. In Novembe r, the Palestine National Council (PNC) declared an indepe ndent Palestinian state alongside of Israel, endors ing the UN terrorism resolution and other relevant UN resol utions. Yasser Arafat repeated the same positions i n subsequent weeks in Europe, including a special ses sion of the UN General Assembly convened in Geneva when he was barred from New York, in violation of l egal obligations to the United Nations, on the grou nds that his presence there would pose an unacceptable threa t to the security of the United States. The reitera tion by the PNC and Arafat of the UN terrorism resolution was d enounced in the United States on the grounds that t he Palestinian leadership had failed to meet Washingto n's conditions on good behavior, including \"Rejecti on of terrorism in all its forms\" without qualification. The editors of the New York Times ridiculed the P NC endorsement of international conventions on terr orism as \"the old Arafat hedge.\" Anthony Lewis, who is at the outer limits of tolerable dissent on these mat ters, wrote that Arafat was progressing, but not sufficiently: \"the United States says correctly that the PLO must unambiguously renounce all terrorism before it can take part in negotiations,\" and this proper conditi on had not yet been met. The general reaction largely fell wit hin these bounds. The reasoning is straightforward. The PLO failed to join the U.S., Israel and Apartheid South Africa off the spectrum of world opinion, and therefore merits eit her derision (from the hardliners) or encouragement for its limited but insufficient progress (from the disside nts). When the U.S. became isolated diplomatically by D ecember 1988, Washington moved to a fallback positi on, pretending that Arafat had capitulated to U.S. dema nds, though his position had not changed in any sub stantive way - for years, in fact. With Arafat's capitulatio n to U.S. demands now official, by U.S. stipulation , he could be rewarded by discussions with the U.S. Ambassador in Tunis. As was underscored by Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the U.S.-PLO discussions we re designed to deflect diplomatic pressures for set tlement and to grant Israel a year or more to suppress the Palestinian uprising (Intifada) by \"harsh military and economic pressure\" so that \"they will be broken.\"38 The issue of terrorism versus resistance arose at once during the U.S.-PLO discussions. The protocol s of the first meeting were leaked and published in the Jeru salem Post, which expressed its pleasure that \"the American representative adopted the Israeli positions,\" stat ing two crucial conditions that the PLO must accept : the PLO must call off the Intifada, and must abandon the id ea of an international conference. With regard to t he Intifada, the U.S. stated its position as follows: Undoubtedly the internal struggles that we are witn essing in the occupied territories aim to undermine the security and stability of the State of Israel, and we therefore demand cessation of those riots, which we view as terrorist acts against Israel. This is especially t rue as we know you are directing, from outside the territories, those riots which are sometimes very violent.39 Once this \"terrorism\" is called off and the prev ious conditions of repression restored, the U.S. an d Israel can proceed to settle matters to their satisfaction. Ag ain, the resistance of an oppressed population to a brutal military occupation is \"terror,\" from the point of view of the occupiers and their paymaster."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" The same issue arose during the operations of the Israeli Army in southern Lebanon. These too were g uided by the logic outlined by Abba Eban, cited earlier. The civilian population was held hostage under the threat of terror to ensure its acceptance of the political ar rangements dictated by Israel for southern Lebanon and the occupied territories. The threat can be realized at will, and is, with extreme brutality.40 But it doe s not count as terror, given the agent and its backer. Nor does it even merit mild reprimand. The acts fall under leg itimate self- defense, by definition. Adopting the same concepts, it is reasonable to report, without comment, that Secretary of State Sh ultz's concern over international terrorism became \"his pa ssion\" after the suicide bombing of U.S. Marines in Lebanon in October 1983. There was no need to call upon witnesses from Nicaragua, Angola, Lebanon, the occupied territories, and elsewhere, to testify to Shultz's \"passion,\" either then, or when renewing t he praise for his \"visceral contempt for terrorism\" and \"personal crusade\" against it in explaining his refusal to a dmit Arafat to speak at the United Nations.41 Doubtless Syria too regards the Lebanese who resi st its bloody rule as \"terrorists,\" but such a clai m would evoke the ridicule and contempt it merits. The reac tion shifts along with the cast of characters. TERROR AND RETALIATION The concept of retaliation is a useful device of id eological warfare. Throughout a cycle of violent in teraction, each side typically portrays its own acts as retali ation for the terrorism of the adversary. In the Mi ddle East, the Israeli-Arab conflict provides many examples. Israe l being a client-state, U.S. practice uncritically adopts the Israeli conventions. To illustrate, consider the hijacking of the Ach ille Lauro and the murder of Leon Klinghoffer in 19 85, doubtless a vile terrorist act. The hijackers, howe ver, regarded their action not as terror but as ret aliation for the Israeli bombing of Tunis a week earlier with U.S. s upport, either an \"act of armed aggression\" (as the Security Council determined) or only murderous international terrorism (giving the benefit of the doubt to the U.S. and its client). But for the perpetrators, the Tunis bo mbing was not terror or aggression, but rather legi timate retaliation for the cold-blooded murder of three Is raelis in Larnaca, Cyprus (with no suspected connec tion to Tunis or the victims there). The perpetrators of th e Larnaca killings, in turn, regarded their act not as terrorism, but as retaliation in response to Israeli terrorism in international waters for many years. The facts are not contested, and are even occasionally reported, but they do not constitute \"terrorism\" by definition, s o the Larnaca crimes cannot be retaliation, as claimed. T he Israeli operations are little discussed, and do not fall within the canon.42 There are many similar cases. The concepts of ter rorism and retaliation are supple instruments, read ily adapted to the needs of the moment. FROM LITERALISM TO DOCTRINAL NECESSITY This review of state-directed international terrori sm suffers from a serious flaw: it has adhered to n aive literalism and is thus irrelevant to contemporary d ebate over the plague of the modern age. The review is, furthermore, very far from compreh ensive. It barely scratches the surface even for Ce ntral America and the Middle East, and international terr orism is by no means limited to these regions. But it does suffice to raise a few questions. One stands out pa rticularly: How is it possible for scholars and the media to maintain the thesis that the plague of the modern a ge is traceable to the Soviet-based \"worldwide terr or network aimed at the destabilization of Western democratic society\"? How is it possible to identify Iran, Liby a, the PLO, Cuba and other official enemies as the leading practitioners of international terrorism? The answer, as we have seen, is very simple. We m ust abandon the literal approach and recognize that terrorist acts fall within the canon only when conducted by o fficial enemies. When the U.S. and its clients are the agents of terrorist atrocities, they either disappear from the record or are transmuted to acts of retaliatio n and self- defense in the service of democracy and human right s. Then all becomes clear."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" Turning finally to possible remedies for the plag ue, the standard literature offers some proposals. Walter Laqueur urges that \"the obvious way to retaliate\" a gainst international terrorism \"is, of course, to p ay the sponsors back in their own coin,\" though such legit imate response may be difficult for Western societi es, which fail to comprehend that others do not share their \" standards of democracy, freedom and humanism.\" Befo re those afflicted with incurable literalism draw the wrong conclusions, however, it should be stressed t hat legitimate response does not include bombs in Washi ngton and Tel Aviv, given the careful way in which the concept of terrorism has been crafted. The New York Times called upon an expert on terro rism to offer his thoughts on how to counter the pl ague. His advice, based upon long experience, was straigh tforward: \"The terrorists, and especially their com manders, must be eliminated.\" He gave three examples of succ essful counterterrorist actions: the U.S. bombing o f Libya, the Israeli bombing of Tunis, and Israel's invasion of Lebanon. He recommends more of the same \"if the civilized world is to prevail.\" The Times editors g ave his article the title: \"It's Past Time to Crush the Terrorist Monster,\" and they highlighted the words: \"Stop the slaughter of innocents.\" They identify the author as \"Israel's Minister of Trade and Industry.\"43 The author's name is Ariel Sharon. His terrorist career, dating back to the early 1950s, includes th e slaughter of 69 villagers in Qibya and 20 at the al-Bureig re fugee camp in 1953; terrorist operations in Gaza an d northeastern Sinai in the early 1970s including the expulsion of some 10,000 farmers into the desert, their homes bulldozed and farm lands destroyed in prepara tion for Jewish settlement; the invasion of Lebanon undertaken in an effort - as now widely conceded - to overcome the threat of PLO diplomacy; the subseq uent massacre at Sabra and Shatila; and others. Some might feel that the choice of Sharon to prov ide \"the civilized world\" with lessons on how to \"s top the slaughter of innocents\" may be a little odd, perhap s perverse, possibly even hypocritical. But that is not so clear. The choice is not inconsistent with the valu es expressed in action, and in the intellectual cul ture expressed in words, or in silence. In support of this conclusion, we may observe tha t the remedy for international terrorism - at least , a substantial component of it - lies within our grasp , and is extremely simple: stop participating in it . But no action is taken to this end, and indeed the matter is scarcely even discussed. Rather, one finds accol ades to our benevolent intentions and nobility of purpose, our elevated \"standards of democracy, freedom and human ism,\" sometimes flawed in performance. Elementary facts c annot be perceived and obvious thoughts are unthink able. Simple truths, when expressed, elicit disbelief, ho rror and outrage - at the fact that they are voiced . In a moral and intellectual climate such as this, it may well be appropriate for the world's greates t newspaper to select Ariel Sharon as our tutor on the evils of terrorism and how to combat it."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Part 6. The World after September 11 (2001) I am sure I am not the only one to have been remind ed in the past months of some wise and prescient wo rds of one of the most impressive figures of twentieth-cen tury America, the radical pacifist AJ. Muste. As th e U.S. entered World War II 60 years ago, he predicted wit h considerable accuracy the contours of the world t hat would emerge after the U.S. victory, and a little l ater, observed that \"the problem after a war is wit h the victor. He thinks he has just proved that war and violence pay. Who will now teach him a lesson?\" Far too many people around the world were to lear n the bitter meaning of these words. It is only in folk-tales, children's stories, and the journals of intellectua l opinion that power is used wisely and well to des troy evil. The real world teaches very different lessons, and it t akes willful ignorance to fail to perceive them. These are, unfortunately, leading themes of histo ry. In his major study of European state-formation, Charles Tilly observed, accurately enough, that over the la st millennium, \"war has been the dominant activity of European states,\" for an unfortunate reason: \"The c entral tragic fact is simple: coercion works; those who apply substantial force to their fellows get compliance, and from that compliance draw the multiple advantag es of money, goods, deference, access to pleasures denied to less powerful people.\"1 These are close to hist orical truisms, which most of the people of the world have learned the hard way. The deference commonly inclu des the acclaim of the educated classes. Resort to over whelming means of violence to destroy defenseless e nemies with impunity tends to win particular admiration, a nd also to become natural, a demonstration of one's virtue; again, close to historical-cultural universals. One normal concomitant of easy victories over def enseless enemies is the entrenchment of the habit o f preferring force over the pursuit of peaceful means . Another is the high priority of acting without au thority. The incarnation of the god who comes to Earth as the \"p erfect man\" with the mission of eradicating evil fr om the world needs no higher authority. What is true of th e most ancient Indian epics from millennia ago hold s as well for the plagiarists of today. The preference for fo rce, and rejection of authorization, have been nota ble features of the past decade of overwhelming and unchallenged power and crushing of much weaker adversaries, in accord with policy recommendations. As the first Bu sh Administration came into office, it undertook a National Security Policy Review dealing with \"Third World th reats.\" Parts were leaked to the press during the G ulf war. The Review concluded that \"In cases where the U.S. confronts much weaker enemies\" - that is, the only kind one chooses to fight - \"our challenge will be not s imply to defeat them, but to defeat them decisively and rapidly.\" Any other outcome would be \"embarrassing\" and might \"undercut political support,\" understood to be thin.2 With the collapse of the sole deterrent a fe w months later, the conclusions became even more fi rmly established, not surprisingly. These are, I think, some of the considerations that should be at the ba ck of our minds when we contemplate the world after September 11. Whatever one's judgment about the events of the p ast weeks, if we want to reach a reasonable assessm ent of what may lie ahead, we should attend carefully to s everal crucial factors. Among them are: 1. The premises on which policy decisions have been based. 2. Their roots in stable institutions and doctrines in very recent history, to a large extent involvin g the same decision-makers. 3. The ways these have been translated to specific actions. I would like to say a few words about each of the se topics. The new millennium quickly produced two terrible new crimes, added to the gloomy record of persistin g ones. The first was the terrorist attacks of September 11 ; the second, the response to them, surely taking a far greater toll of innocent lives, Afghan civilians who were t hemselves victims of the suspected perpetrators of the crimes of September 11.1 will assume these to be Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaeda network. There has been a p rima facie case from the outset, though little credible evidence has been produced despite what must be the most intensive investigations ever by the coordinated in telligence services of the major powers.3 Such \"lea derless resistance\" networks, as they are called, are not e asy nuts to crack."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" An inauspicious sign is that in both cases the cr imes are considered right and just, even noble, wit hin the doctrinal framework of the perpetrators; and in fac t are justified in almost the same words. Bin Laden proclaims that violence is justified in self-defense against the infidels who invade and occupy Muslim lands and against the brutal and corrupt governments they sustain the re - words that have considerable resonance in the region even among those who despise and fear him. Bush and Blair proclaim, in almost identical words, that vi olence is justified to drive evil from our lands. The proc lamations of the antagonists are not entirely ident ical. When bin Laden speaks of \"our lands,\" he is referring to Muslim lands: Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Chechnya, Bosni a, Kashmir, and others; the radical Islamists who were mobilized and nurtured by the CIA and its associat es through the 1980s despise Russia, but ceased their terrorist operations in Russia from Afghan bases af ter the Russians withdrew. When Bush and Blair speak of \"ou r lands\" they are, in contrast, referring to the wo rld. The distinction reflects the power that the adversaries command. That either side can speak without shame of eradicating evil in the light of their records - th at should leave us open-mouthed in astonishment, un less we adopt the easy course of effacing even very recent history. Another fact with grim portent is that, in both c ases, the perpetrators insist on underscoring the c riminality of their acts. In the case of bin Laden, no discussion is needed. The U.S. pointedly rejected the framewo rk of legitimacy that resides in the UN Charter. There ha s been much debate over whether the ambiguous Secur ity Council declarations, or Article 51 of the UN Chart er, provide authorization for the resort to force. It is, in my opinion, beside the point. To resolve the debate would have been simple enou gh, had there been any wish to do so. There is scar cely any doubt that Washington could have obtained entirely unambiguous Security Council authorization, even if not for attractive reasons. Russia is eager to join the \"coalition against terror\" to gain U.S. support fo r its own massive terrorist crimes. China hopes to be admitte d to the coalition of the just for the same reasons , and in fact, states throughout the world recognized at onc e that they could now enlist the support of the glo bal superpower for their own violence and repression, a lesson not lost on the global managers either. Bri tish support is reflexive; France would have raised no o bjections. There would, in brief, have been no veto . But Washington preferred to reject Security Counc il authorization and to insist on its unique right to act unilaterally in violation of international law and solemn treaty obligations, a right proclaimed by th e Clinton Administration and its predecessors in clear and ex plicit words - warnings that we and others may choo se to ignore, but at our peril. Similarly, Washington con temptuously dismissed the tentative offers to consi der extradition of bin Laden and his associates; how re al such possibilities were we cannot know, because of the righteous refusal even to consider them. This stand adheres to a leading principle of statecraft, call ed \"establishing credibility\" in the rhetoric of diplo macy and scholarship. And it is understandable. If a Mafia Don plans to collect protection money, he does not firs t ask for a Court order, even if he could obtain it . Much the same is true of international affairs. Subjects mus t understand their place, and must recognize that t he powerful need no higher authority. Thucydides remarked that \"large nations do what t hey wish, while small nations accept what they must .\" The world has changed a great deal over several thousan d years, but some things stay much the same. The atrocities of September 11 are regarded as a historic event, which is true, though not, regretta bly, because of their scale. In its civilian toll, the crime is not unusual in the annals of violence short of war. To mention only one example, so minor in context as to be a mere fo otnote, a Panamanian journalist, condemning the cri mes of September 11, observed that for Panamanians the \"si nister times\" are not unfamiliar, recalling the U.S . bombing of the barrio Chorrillo during \"Operation J ust Cause\" with perhaps thousands killed; our crime s, so there is no serious accounting.4 The atrocities of September 11 are indeed a historic event, but becau se of their target. For the U.S., it is the first time since th e British burned down Washington in 1814 that the n ational territory has been under serious attack, even threa tened. There is no need to review what has been don e to others in the two centuries since. For Europe, the reversal is even more dramatic. While conquering mu ch of the world, leaving a trail of terror and devastation, E uropeans were safe from attack by their victims, wi th rare and limited exceptions. It is not surprising, then, tha t Europe and its offshoots should be shocked by the crimes of September 11, a dramatic breach of the norms of acc eptable behavior for hundreds of years."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" It is also not surprising that they should remain complacent, perhaps mildly regretful, about the ev en more terrible suffering that followed. The victims, afte r all, are miserable Afghans - \"uncivilized tribes, \" as Winston Churchill described them with contempt when he orde red the use of poison gas to \"spread a lively terro r\" among them 80 years ago, denouncing the \"squeamishn ess\" of the softhearted ninnies who failed to under stand that chemical weapons were just \"the application of modern science to modern warfare\" and must be used \"to procure a speedy termination of the disorder which prevails on the frontier.\"5 Similar thoughts are heard today. The editors of the New Republic, who not long ago were calling fo r more military aid for \"Latin-style fascists ... regardle ss of how many are murdered\" because \"there are hig her American priorities than Salvadoran human rights,\" now explain that \"Operation Enduring Freedom is not a humanitarian intervention.\" From that accurate obse rvation they conclude that \"If we leave behind a co untry in chaos that can no longer serve as a base of operati ons against us, then we will have accomplished a ne cessary objective,\" and should \"lose the obsession with nat ion-building\" to try to repair what we have done to Afghanistan for 20 years, which is no concern of ou rs.6 While few are willing to sink to that level, it r emains true that atrocities committed against Afgha ns carry little moral stigma, for one reason, because such practice s have been so familiar throughout history even whe n there has been no pretext other than greed and domination . And retribution knows no bounds. For that there i s ample historical precedent, not to speak of authority in the holiest texts we are taught to revere. Another aspect of the complacent acceptance of at rocities was described by Alexis de Tocqueville in his report of one of the great crimes of ethnic cleansing of t he continent, the expulsion of the Cherokees. He wa s particularly intrigued to see how Americans were ab le not only \"to exterminate the Indian race\" after \"wholly depriving it of its rights,\" but to do so \"with sin gular felicity, tranquilly, legally, philanthropica lly, without shedding blood, and without violating a single grea t principle of morality in the eyes of the world.\" \"It is impossible to destroy people with more respect for the laws of humanity,\" he observed with wonder.7 That is a fair enough description of what has bee n unfolding before our eyes. For example, in the re fugee camp of Maslakh near Herat, where hundreds of thous ands of people are reported to be starving, dozens dying every night from cold and starvation. They were liv ing on the edge of survival even before the bombing , which deprived them of desperately needed aid. It remains a \"forgotten camp\" as we meet, three months after September 11. Veteran correspondent Christina Lamb reports scenes more \"harrowing\" than anything in he r memory, after having \"seen death and misery in refu gee camps in many parts of Asia and Africa.\" A mont h later, the reported death toll had doubled to 100 a day and aid officials warned that the camp is \"on the brink of an Ethiopian-style humanitarian disaster\" as the fl ight of refugees to the camp continued to increase, an estimated three-quarters of its population since Se ptember.8 The destruction of lives is silent and mostly inv isible, and can easily remain forgotten, by choice. An even sorrier sight is denial -or worse, even ridicule - of the efforts to bring these tragedies to light so that pressures can be mounted to relieve them. The easy tolerance of the \"vivid awfulness\" that Lamb recounts merely reflects the fact that this is how the powerful deal with th e weak and defenseless, hence in no way remarkable. We have no right to harbor any illusions about th e premises of the planning for the war in Afghanist an, and of the accompanying commentary. These were based on th e unchallenged assumption that the threat of bombin g, then its realization, would considerably increase t he number of Afghans at risk of death from starvati on, disease, and exposure. The press blandly reported t hat the numbers were expected to increase by 50 per cent, to about 7.5 million: an additional 2.5 million people .9 No comment was elicited by the report that Washi ngton had \"demanded [from Pakistan] the elimination of tr uck convoys that provide much of the food and other supplies to Afghanistan's civilian population,\"10 m illions of them already on the brink of starvation. Pleas to stop the bombing to allow delivery of food and othe r aid were rebuffed without comment, mostly without even report. These came from high UN officials, major re lief and aid agencies, and others in a good positio n to know. Afghan specialists concurred, warning that th e withdrawal of aid workers and severe reduction in food supplies left \"millions of Afghans... at grave risk of starvation.\" By late September, the Food and Ag ricultural Organization (FAO) had warned that more than seven million people would face starvation if the threate ned military action were undertaken, and after the bomb ing began, advised that the threat of \"humanitarian"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"catastrophe\" was \"grave,\" and that the bombing had disrupted the planting of 80 percent of the grain s upplies, so that the effects next year could be even more se vere.11 What will happen we cannot know. But we know well enough the assumptions on which plans were based a nd executed, and commentary produced. As a simple matt er of logic, it is these assumptions that inform us about the shape of the world that lies ahead, whatever th e outcomes might be in the present case. The basic facts have been casually reported, including the fact that lit tle is being done to bring food and other aid to ma ny of those dying in refugee camps and the countryside, though supplies have long been available and the primary f actor hampering delivery is lack of interest and will. Furthermore, the longer-term effects will remain unknown, if history is any guide. Reporting is scan ty today, and the consequences will not be investigated tomor row. It is acceptable to report the \"collateral dam age\" by bombing error, the inadvertent and inevitable cost of war, but not the conscious and deliberate destru ction of Afghans who will die in silence, invisibly - not by design, but because it doesn't matter, a deeper le vel of moral depravity; if we step on an ant while walking, we h ave not purposely killed it. People do not die of starvation instantly. They c an survive on roots and grass, and if malnourished children die of disease, who will seek to determine what factors lie in the background? In the future, the topic is off the agenda by virtue of a crucial principle: We must de vote enormous energy to meticulous accounting of cr imes of official enemies, quite properly including not only those literally killed, but also those who die as a consequence of their policies; and we must take equ ally scrupulous care to avoid this practice in the case of our own crimes, adopting the stance that so impressed d e Tocqueville. There are hundreds of pages of detai led documentation of the application of these principle s. It will be a welcome surprise if the current cas e turns out differently. And we should remember that we are not observing all of this from Mars, or describing the crimes of Attila the Hun. There is a great deal that we can do right now, if we choose. To explore what is likely to lie ahead from a dif ferent perspective, let's ask whether there were al ternatives to the resort to devastating force at a distance, a de vice that comes naturally to those with overwhelmin g might at their command, no external deterrent, and confidenc e in the obedience of articulate opinion. Alternatives were prominently suggested. By the V atican, for example, which called for reliance on t he measures appropriate to crimes, whatever their scal e: if someone robs my house and I think I know who did it, I am not entitled to go after him with an assault rif le, meanwhile killing people randomly in his neighb orhood. Or by the eminent military historian Michael Howard, w ho delivered a \"scathing attack\" on the bombardment of Afghanistan on October 30, not on grounds of succes s or failure, but its design: what is needed is \"pa tient operations of police and intelligence forces,\" \"a p olice operation conducted under the auspices of the UN on behalf of the international community as a whole, a gainst a criminal conspiracy, whose members should be hunted down and brought before an international cou rt.\"12 There certainly are precedents, including ac ts of international terrorism even more extreme than thos e of September 11: the U.S. terrorist war against N icaragua, to take an uncontroversial example - uncontroversia l, because of the judgment of the highest internati onal authorities, the International Court of Justice and the Security Council. Nicaragua's efforts to pursu e lawful means failed, in a world ruled by force; but no one would impede the U.S. if it chose to follow a lawf ul course. Could the goals of apprehending and punishing the perpetrators have been attained without violence? Perhaps. We have no way of knowing whether the Taliban offer s to discuss extradition were serious, since they w ere dismissed for the reasons already mentioned. The sa me is true of the war aim added as an afterthought well after the bombing began: overthrowing the Taliban r egime.13 That would doubtless have been a high prio rity for many Afghans, just as the same is true for innu merable others throughout the world who suffer unde r brutal regimes and miserable oppression. Keeping just to q uestions of tactics and efficacy, were there prefer able ways to achieve this later goal? Evidently, the inquiry should begin with the peop le of Afghanistan: what are their attitudes and opi nions? To determine their views is a difficult task, no doubt , but not entirely impossible. There are some reaso nable ways to proceed."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" We might begin with the gathering of 1,000 Afghan leaders in Peshawar at the end of October, some of them exiles, some who trekked across the border from wit hin Afghanistan, all committed to overthrowing the Taliban regime. It was \"a rare display of unity among triba l elders, Islamic scholars, fractious politicians, and former guerrilla commanders,\" the New York Times reported. They unanimously \"urged the U.S. to stop the air r aids,\" appealed to the international media to call for an end to the \"bombing of innocent people,\" and \"deman ded an end to the U.S. bombing of Afghanistan.\" They urged that other means be adopted to overthrow the hated Taliban regime, a goal they believed could be achie ved without slaughter and destruction.14 A similar message was conveyed by Afghan oppositi on leader Abdul Haq, who was highly regarded in Washington. Just before he entered Afghanistan, app arently without U.S. support, and was then captured and killed, he condemned the bombing and criticized the U.S. for refusing to support his efforts and those of others \"to create a revolt within the Taliban.\" The bombin g was \"a big setback for these efforts,\" he said. H e reported contacts with second-level Taliban commanders and e x-Mujahiddin tribal elders, and discussed how such efforts could proceed, calling on Washington to ass ist them with funding and other support instead of undermining them with bombs. The U.S., Abdul Haq said, is trying to show its mus cle, score a victory and scare everyone in the worl d. They don't care about the suffering of the Afghans or ho w many people we will lose. And we don't like that. Because Afghans are now being made to suffer for these Arab fanatics, but we all know who brought these Arabs to Afghanistan in the 1980s, armed them and gave them a base. It was the Americans and the CIA. And the Americans who did this all got medals and good care ers, while all these years Afghans suffered from th ese Arabs and their allies. Now, when America is attack ed, instead of punishing the Americans who did this , it punishes the Afghans.15 For what it's worth, I think there is considerabl e merit in his remarks. We can also look elsewhere for enlightenment abou t Afghan opinions. There has, at last, been some be lated concern about the fate of women in Afghanistan. It even reached the First Lady. Maybe it will be follo wed some day by concern for the plight of women elsewhe re in Central and South Asia, which, unfortunately, is not all that different in many places from life under t he Taliban, including the most vibrant democracies. There are plenty of highly reliable and expert sources on the se matters, if we choose to look. And such a radica l departure from past practice would lend at least some credibi lity to the professed outrage over Taliban practice s just at the moment when it served U.S. propaganda purposes. Of course, no sane person advocates foreign military intervention by the U.S. or other states to rectify these and other terrible crimes in countries that are U.S. allies and clients. The problems are severe, but should be dealt with from within, with assistance from outsi ders if it is constructive and honest, not merely hypocritical an d self-serving. But since the harsh treatment of women in Afghani stan has at last gained some well-deserved attentio n, it would seem that attitudes of Afghan women towards p olicy options should be a primary concern. These no doubt vary considerably, and are not easy to invest igate. Nevertheless, it should not be impossible to determine whether mothers in Maslakh praise the bombing, or m ight, rather, agree with those who fled from their homes to miserable refugee camps under the threat of bomb ing and expressed the bitter hope that \"even the cr uel Americans must feel some pity for our ruined countr y\" and refrain from the threatened bombing that was already bringing death and disaster.16 And Afghan w omen are by no means voiceless everywhere. There is an organization of courageous women who have been in t he forefront of the struggle to defend women's righ ts for 25 years, RAWA (Revolutionary Association of the Wo men of Afghanistan), doing remarkable work. Their leader was assassinated by Afghan collaborators wit h the Russians in 1987, but they continued their wo rk within Afghanistan at risk of death, and in exile n earby. They have been quite outspoken. A week after the bombing began, for example, they issued a public st atement that would have been front-page news wherev er concern for Afghan women was real, not a matter of mere expediency. The RAWA statement of October 11 was entitled: \"T aliban should be overthrown by the uprising of Afgh an nation,\" and continued as follows: Again, due to the treason of fundamentalist hangmen , our people have been caught in the claws of the m onster of a vast war and destruction. America, by forming an international coalition against Osama and his Ta liban-"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"collaborators and in retaliation for the llth Septe mber terrorist attacks, has launched a vast aggress ion on our country . . . [What] we have witnessed for the past seven days leaves no doubt that this invasion will shed the blood of numerous women, men, children, young and o ld of our country. The statement went on to call for \"the eradicatio n of the plague of Taliban and Al Qieda\" by \"an ove rall uprising\" of the Afghan people themselves, which al one \"can prevent the repetition and recurrence of t he catastrophe that has befallen our country ...\" In another declaration on November 25, at a demon stration of women's organizations in Islamabad on t he International Day for the Elimination of Violence a gainst Women, RAWA condemned the U.S./Russian-backe d Northern Alliance for a \"record of human rights vio lations as bad as that of the Taliban,\" and called on the UN to \"help Afghanistan, not the Northern Alliance,\" w arnings reiterated at the national conference of th e All India Democratic Women's Association on the same days.17 Perhaps Afghans who have been struggling for fre edom and women's rights for many years don't unders tand much about their country, and should cede responsib ility for its future to foreigners who couldn't hav e placed the country on a map a few months ago, along with o thers who had helped destroy it in the past. Maybe, but it is not obvious. The situation is reminiscent of the Iraq war, whe n the Iraqi opposition was barred from media and jo urnals of opinion, apart from dissident journals at the margi ns. They forcefully opposed the U.S. bombing campai gn against Iraq and accused the U.S. of preferring a m ilitary dictatorship to overthrow of Saddam by inte rnal revolt - as was conceded publicly, when Bush (No. 1) retur ned to collaboration with his former friend and all y Saddam Hussein in carrying out major atrocities, as Saddam brutally crushed a southern Shi'ite revolt that might well have overthrown the murderous dictator, under the watchful eyes of the U.S. military that h ad total control over the region, while Washington refused e ven to allow rebelling Iraqi generals access to cap tured Iraqi arms. The Bush Administration confirmed that it would have no dealings with Iraqi opposition lea ders: \"We felt that political meetings with them . . . wo uld not be appropriate for our policy at this time, \" State Department spokesman Richard Boucher announced on M arch 14, 1991, while Saddam was massacring southern rebels.18 That had been long-standing gove rnment policy. The same is true of preference for f orce over pursuit of possibly feasible diplomatic option s, policies that continued in the decade that follo wed, until today, and are quite natural, for basically the rea sons that Abdul Haq enunciated. Another sensible way to assess the prospects for the future would be to review the actions of today' s commanders when they launched the first war on terr orism 20 years ago: there is ample evidence of what they achieved in Central America, Southern Africa, the M iddle East and Southeast Asia, all accompanied by m uch the same lofty rhetoric and passion that we hear to day. There should be no need to review that shamefu l record. Evidently, it carries important lessons about the l ikely future, as does the fact that the topic is sc rupulously ignored in the laudatory chorus for the current and future projects, although - or perhaps because - t hat record is so obviously relevant. At the end of the terrible decade of the 1980s, t he external deterrent to the use of force disappear ed. For its victims, the collapse of Soviet tyranny was a remar kable triumph and liberation, though the victory wa s soon tainted by new horrors. For others, the consequence s were more complex. The basic character of the pos t-Cold War era was revealed very quickly: more of the same , with revised pretexts and tactics. A few weeks af ter the fall of the Berlin Wall, the U.S. invaded Panama, k illing hundreds or even thousands of people, vetoin g two Security Council resolutions, and kidnapping a thug who was jailed in the U.S. for crimes that he had mostly committed while on the CIA payroll before committin g the only one that mattered: disobedience. The pat tern of events was familiar enough, but there were some dif ferences. One was pointed out by Elliott Abrams, wh o pleaded guilty to crimes committed when he was a St ate Department official during the Reagan years, an d has now been appointed Human Rights specialist at the N ational Security Council. At the time of the invasi on, he commented that for the first time in many years the U.S. could resort to force with no concern about R ussian reactions. There were also new pretexts: the interv ention was in defense against Hispanic narcotraffic kers, not the Russians who were mobilizing in Managua, two da ys march from Harlingen, Texas."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" A few months later, the Bush Administration prese nted its new Pentagon budget, an event of particula r significance because this was the first submission that could not rely on the plea that the Russians a re coming.19 The Administration requested a huge milit ary budget, as before, and in part for the same rea sons. Thus it would be necessary to bolster \"the defense industrial base\" (aka high-tech industry), and to m aintain the intervention forces that are aimed primarily at the Middle East because of \"the free world's reliance on energy supplies from this pivotal region.\" But there was a change: in that pivotal region the \"threats to our interests\" that had required direct military engagement \"could not be laid at the Kremlin's door,\" contrary to de cades of propaganda. Nor could the threats be laid at Saddam 's door: the Butcher of Baghdad was still a valued friend and ally, not yet having committed his crime of dis obedience. Rather, the threat was indigenous nation alism, as it had always been. The clouds lifted on the larger threat as well. I t is not the Russians, but rather the \"growing tech nological sophistication\" of third world powers that requires that we maintain complete military dominance world wide, even without \"the backdrop of superpower competitio n.\" The Cold War confrontation was always in the background no doubt, but served more as a pretext t han a reason, just as the Russians appealed to the U.S. threat to justify their crimes within their own dom ains. The real enemy is independent (called \"radica l\") nationalism in the South, as now tacitly acknowledg ed, the traditional pretexts having lost their util ity. The documentary and historical record provides ample ev idence to support that conclusion. Another conseque nce of the collapse of the junior partner in world control was the elimination of any space for non-alignment , and the limited measure of independence it allowed. One ind ication is the immediate sharp reduction in foreign aid, most radically in the U.S., where the category virt ually disappeared, even if we count the largest com ponent, which goes to a rich country for strategic reasons, and to Egypt because of its collaboration in the s ame enterprise. The decline of options was fully recogn ized. President Mahathir of Malaysia spoke for many when he said that: Paradoxically, the greatest catastrophe for us, who had always been anti-communist, is the defeat of communism. The end of the Cold War has deprived us of the only leverage we had - the option to defect. Now we can turn to no one.20 Not really a paradox, but the natural course of rea l-world history. Similar fears were widely expressed. The Gulf war was bitterly condemned throughout the South as a n eedless show of force, evading diplomatic options; there wa s considerable evidence for such an interpretation at the time, more since. Many perceived what Abdul Haq des cribes today: the U.S. \"is trying to show its muscl e, score a victory and scare everyone in the world,\" e stablishing \"credibility.\" The resort to overwhelmi ng military force is designed to demonstrate that \"What We Say Goes,\" in George Bush's proud words as bombs and missiles rained on Iraq. Those who did not grasp th e message then should have had no problem in doing so when he instantly returned to support for Saddam's murderous violence in order to ensure \"stability,\" a code word for subordination to U.S. power interests. The general mood in the South was captured by Cardinal Paulo Evarista Arns of Sao Paulo: In the Arab countries, he said, \"the rich sided with the U.S. government w hile the millions of poor condemned this military aggression .\" Throughout the Third World, he continued, \"there is hatred and fear: When will they decide to invade us ,\" and on what pretext?21 The general reaction to the bombing of Serbia was similar, and again, there is considerable evidence that peaceful options might have been pursued, avoiding much misery. In this case, it was officially and re peatedly proclaimed that the motives were to establish \"cred ibility\" and ensure \"stability.\" It is difficult to take seriously the claim that a subsidiary goal was to prevent the ethnic cleansing and atrocities that followed the withdrawal of monitors (over unreported Serbian objections) an d the bombing immediately afterwards - a \"predictab le\" consequence, as the commanding general informed the press as the bombing began, later reiterating that he knew of no such war aims. The rich documentary reco rd from the State Department, OSCE, the British government, and other Western sources substantially reinforces these conclusions. Perhaps that is why the illuminating record is so consistently ignored in t he extensive literature on the topic. Even in the m ost loyal client-states the bombing was condemned as a revers ion to traditional gunboat diplomacy \"cloaked in mo ralistic righteousness\" in the traditional fashion (the resp ected Israeli military analyst Amos Gilboa, by no m eans an isolated voice).22"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" Americans are carefully protected from world opin ion and critical discussion of such matters, but we do ourselves no favors by keeping to these restriction s. We also do ourselves no favors by ignoring public documents that lucidly explain the thinking of pla nners. They understand very well that the world may be tri polar in economic terms - with roughly comparable economic power in North America, Europe and Asia -b ut that it is radically unipolar in the capacity to resort to violence and to destroy. And it should be no surpri se to discover that these facts of life enter cruci ally into planning. Even before September 11, the U.S. outspent the n ext 15 countries for \"defense\"23 - which, as usual, means \"offense.\" And it is far ahead in sophisticated mil itary technology. The military budget was increased sharply after September 11, as the Administration exploited the fear and anguish of the population to ram thro ugh a wide array of measures that they knew would arouse popular opposition without the appeal to \"patriotis m\" - which the powerful are free to ignore; it is the re st who must be passive and submissive. These includ ed a variety of means to strengthen the authority of the very powerful state to which \"conservatives\" are d eeply committed, among them, sharp increases in military spending designed to enhance the enormous disparity between the U.S. and the rest of the world. Include d are the plans to extend the \"arms race\" into spac e -a \"race\" with one competitor only - undermining the Outer Sp ace Treaty of 1967 and other international obligati ons. Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) is only a small com ponent, and even that is understood to be an offens ive weapon: \"not simply a shield but an enabler of acti on,\" the RAND corporation explained, echoing not on ly the thoughts but even the words of Chinese authorities, who, realistically, regard it as a weapon directed against them. Strategic analysts realistically describe the program as a means to establish U.S. global \"hegem ony,\" which is what the world needs, they explain, echoin g many distinguished predecessors. The far broader programs of militarization of spa ce are explained in high level public documents as the natural next step in expanding state power. Armies and navi es were created to protect commercial interests and investment, Clinton's Space Command observed, and t he logical next frontier is space, in pursuit of th e same goals. But this time there will be a difference. Th e British Navy could be countered by Germany, with consequences we need not discuss. But the U.S. will be so awesomely powerful that there will be no cou n- terforce, so it is claimed. Overwhelming dominance is necessary for well-kno wn technical reasons. Even BMD requires nullificati on of the anti-satellite weapons of a potential adversary . The U.S. must therefore achieve \"full spectrum do minance,\" ensuring that even this much simpler technology wil l not be available. An iron fist is needed for othe r reasons. U.S. military planners share the assessment of the intelligence community and outside experts that wha t is misleadingly called \"globalization\" will lead to a widening divide between the \"haves\" and the \"have-n ots\" - contrary to doctrine, but in accord with reality. A nd it will be necessary to control unruly elements: by inspiring fear, or perhaps by actual use of highly destructiv e killing machines launched from space, probably nu clear- powered and on hair-trigger alert with automated co ntrol systems, thus increasing the likelihood of wh at in the trade are called \"normal accidents\": the unpredicta ble errors to which all complex systems are subject . It is recognized that these programs significantl y increase the danger of uncontrollable catastrophe , but that too is entirely rational within the framework of pr evailing institutions and ideology, which ranks heg emony well above survival. Again, there are ample precede nts throughout the history of the Cold War, and lon g before. The difference today is that the stakes are much higher. It is no exaggeration to say that the survi val of the species is at risk. These seem to me some of the realistic prospects if current tendencies persist. But there is no reas on for that to happen. The good news is that the reigning systems of authority are fragile, and they know it. There i s a major effort to exploit the current window of opportunity to institute harsh and regressive programs and to neutralize the mass popular movements that have been forming t hroughout the world in unprecedented and highly encouraging ways. There is no reason to succumb to such efforts, and every reason not to. Plenty of ch oices and options are available. What is needed, as always, i s the will and dedication to pursue them."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Part 7. U.S. /Israel-Palestine (May 2001) The latest phase of the Israel-Palestine conflict o pened on September 29, 2000, the Muslim day of pray er, when Prime Minister Ehud Barak dispatched a massive and intimidating police and military presence to the Al -Aqsa compound. Predictably, that led to clashes as thous ands of people streamed out of the mosque, leaving several Palestinians dead and 200 wounded.1 Whatever Barak may have intended, there could hardly have been a m ore effective way to set the stage for the shocking seq uel, particularly after the visit of Ariel Sharon a nd his military entourage to the compound the day before, which mig ht have passed without such serious consequences. The opening events established the pattern for wh at followed. \"During these crucial days there was n o evidence of Palestinian gunfire,\" an important UN i nquiry found.2 In the following months, as far as t he investigators could determine, \"the IDF [Israeli Ar my], operating behind fortifications with superior weaponry, endured not a single serious casualty as a result o f Palestinian demonstrations and, further, their so ldiers seemed to be in no life-threatening danger during the cour se of these events,\" as they killed hundreds of Pal estinians and imposed an even more brutal regime than before, subjecting the population to harsh collective puni shment and humiliation, the hallmark of the occupation for many years.3 The UN report found that the majority of Israeli casualties resulted from in cidents on settlements roads and at relatively isol ated checkpoints ... as a consequence of the settlements , and irritations resulting indirectly therefrom. I n this regard, account must be taken of settler violence against P alestinian civilians in areas adjoining settlements , and of IDF complicity in such violence. The current practices, along with earlier ones, h ave been reviewed in extensive detail and bitterly condemned by international Human Rights organizations. Like t he report of the UN inquiry, these studies have bee n virtually ignored in the United States. Reports of Human Rights organizations receive wi de attention when they are doctrinally useful, not otherwise; the Al-Aqsa Intifada breaks no new groun d in that regard. To cite only the most recent illu stration as I write, in April 2001 Human Rights Watch published a detailed study devoted primarily to Israeli atro cities in the Hebron district, where tens of thousands of Pal estinians have been virtually imprisoned for months while a few hundred settlers are free to abuse and humiliat e them and destroy their property under military pr otection, the pattern for many years. The study was immediate ly reported on wire services. The first (and perhap s only) mention in the U.S. was in paragraph 15 of a Washin gton Post article five days later.4 The pattern of events underscores a fact of cruci al importance. It is highly misleading to use the p hrase \"Israel- Palestine conflict,\" as I did at the outset: it sho uld be termed the \"U.S./Israel-Palestine\" conflict. For similar reasons, it is misleading - and particularly in the U.S., improper - to condemn \"Israeli atrocities,\" just as such practice would have been inappropriate in the case of Russian-backed crimes in Eastern Europe, U.S.-ba cked crimes in Central America (where it was the practic e), and innumerable other such examples. These conclusions are illustrated graphically by the events in the first days of the Al-Aqsa Intifad a. On September 30, the IDF killed twelve-year-old Muhamm ad Al-Dirra in response to rock throwing (in which he was not involved) near the small Israeli settlement at Netzarim, which is hardly more than an excuse f or a major military base and road system that cut the Gaza Str ip in two, one of several barriers separating Gaza City from the south (and Egypt). \"IDF soldiers in a heavily p rotected bunker fired repeatedly upon Palestinian R ed Crescent Society (PRCS) ambulances attempting to ev acuate\" the severely wounded boy and other casualti es, Human Rights Watch reported. \"The firing from the I DF outpost continued for at least forty-five minute s, although during this time there was no apparent ret urn fire from Palestinian demonstrators or police.\" Ambulances sought in vain to \"evacuate large number s of Palestinians wounded by heavy IDF fire from th e bunker and possibly from sniper towers in the Netza rim settlement\"; earthern berms were constructed \"t o provide people with some protection from sniper fir e from the Netzarim settlement.\" Amnesty Internatio nal found that the IDF \"apparently even targeted people helping to remove the wounded,\" reporting that a P RCS ambulance driver \"died after Israeli troops shot hi m in the chest\" as he sought to evacuate casualties .5 All of this proceeds thanks to direct U.S. suppor t, tolerance and evasion."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" The next day, October 1, \"Israeli special forces firing from and around a well-protected rooftop pos ition\" killed two Palestinians, facing no apparent threat themselves. On the same day, Israel escalated the l evel of violence when \"an IDF helicopter gunship fired reck lessly and repeatedly on areas immediately adjacent to the [PRCS] field hospital at Netzarim, disrupting opera tions there,\" at least 400 meters from any clashes; and on the Egypt-Gaza border, helicopters fired missiles that killed two Palestinians and wounded dozens. The nex t day, October 2, helicopters firing missiles at buildings and cars in the Netzarim area killed ten Palestini ans and wounded 35.6 IDF helicopters are U.S. helicopters with Israel i pilots. U.S. supply is critical because \"it is im practical to think that we can manufacture helicopters or major weapons systems of this type in Israel,\" the Minist ry of Defense reported.7 On October 3, the defense correspondent of Israe l's most prestigious newspaper reported the signing of an agreement with the Clinton Administration for \"the largest purchase of military helicopters by the Isr aeli Air Force in a decade,\" along with spare parts for Apac he attack helicopters for which an agreement had be en signed in mid-September. Also in mid-September, the Israeli press reported, U.S. Marines carried out a joint exercise with the IDF in the Negev aimed at reconqu est of the territories that had been transferred to the Palestinian Authority. The Marines provided trainin g with weapons that the IDF still lacked, and in \"A merican fighting techniques.\"8 On October 4, the world's leading military journa l reported that Washington had approved a request f or Apache helicopters along with more advanced attack equipment. The same day, the U.S. press reported th at Apaches were attacking apartment complexes with roc kets at Netzarim. In response to queries from Europ ean journalists, U.S. officials said that \"U.S. weapons sales do not carry a stipulation that the weapons can't be used against civilians. We cannot second-guess an Israel i commander who calls in helicopter gunships.\" Whit e House national security spokesman PJ. Crowley added that \"We are not in a position to pass judgement o n decisions made on either side,\" calling on both sid es to exercise restraint. A few weeks later, the lo cal Palestinian leader Hussein Abayat was killed by a m issile launched from an Apache helicopter (along wi th two women standing nearby), as the assassination campai gn against the indigenous leadership was initiated. 9 Rushing new military helicopters to Israel under these circumstances and with such authorization for use is surely newsworthy. There was no news report or edit orial comment. The sole mention in the U.S. was in an opinion piece in Raleigh, North Carolina.10 An Amne sty International condemnation of the sale of U.S. helicopters also passed in silence. That remained t rue in the months that followed, including a shipme nt in February 2001, a $.5 billion deal for Boeing Apache Longbow helicopters, the most advanced in the U.S. arsenal, noted marginally in the U.S. as business n ews. In a similar style, a major news story (May 17 ) reports the reluctance of President Bush to become more \"di rectly involved\" in the Israel-Palestine conflict, and his Administration's inability to support the Mitchell committee report by asking Israel for a settlement freeze because Prime Minister Sharon is \"philosophically o pposed to such a proposal.\" On the same day, under \"World Briefing\" a few lines report that the U.S. A rmy Corps of Engineers began construction of a $266 million Israeli military base (paid for by the U.S. ) in the Negev, a symbol \"of America's continuing commitment to Israel's security,\" Ambassador Martin Indyk declared.11 Well reported, however, are stern U.S. admonition s to Palestinians to end their terror, because \"we do not believe in rewarding violence\" (Ambassador Indyk);1 2 and regular official statements deploring violenc e and expressing tempered disapproval of Israel's assassi nation program. Washington's actual attitudes are r evealed by its actions; the coverage speaks for itself. None of this is unusual. With regard to Israel-Pa lestine specifically, the pattern has been routine for over 30 years, ever since the U.S. separated itself from th e international consensus on the conflict. Though t he most significant facts are missing from mainstream comme ntary, and often ignored or misrepresented even in scholarly work, they are not controversial. They pr ovide the indispensable background for any serious understanding of what is happening now. U.S.-Israel relations improved dramatically after Israel's military victory in 1967. In the backgrou nd, as always with regard to this region, lie its incompar able energy resources. Emerging from World War II a s the"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"overwhelmingly dominant global power, the U.S. unde rtook careful and sophisticated planning to organiz e the world system in its interests. That included effect ive control over the region's oil, previously share d with France and Britain. France was removed, and the British gr adually declined to the status of a \"junior partner ,\" in the rueful words of a British Foreign Office official. Though there was much talk about the Russians, and there is no doubt that the possibility of global war was the major element in strategic planning, the immediate problem throughout was the threat of independent nationalis m - a fact now largely conceded, even in official documents.13 In essentials, the U.S. took over the framework of control of the Middle East established by Britai n after World War I. The states of the region were to be ad ministered by what Britain called an \"Arab Facade,\" weak and pliable; Britain's \"absorption\" of the colonies would be \"veiled by constitutional fictions as a p rotectorate, a sphere of influence, a buffer State, and so on,\" a device more cost-effective than direct rule. When n eeded, British muscle would be available. The U.S. modifie d the system by incorporating a second tier of \"loc al cops on the beat,\" as the Nixon Administration called th em: local gendarmes to ensure order, preferably non -Arab, with police HQ in Washington, and U.S.-UK force in reserve. Throughout this period, Turkey has been consider ed a base for U.S. power in the region. Iran was an other, after the effort by its conservative nationalist go vernment to gain control over Iran's resources was thwarted by a UK-U.S. military coup in 1953. By 1948, the U.S. Joint Chief of Staffs were already impressed with I srael's military prowess, describing the new state as the m ajor regional military power after Turkey. Israel c ould offer the U.S. means to \"gain strategic advantage in the Middle East that would offset the effects of the de cline of British power in that area,\" the JCS concluded. In 1958, the CIA advised that \"a logical corollar y\" of opposition to Arab nationalism \"would be to s upport Israel as the only reliable pro-Western power left in the Middle East.\" The reasoning was implemented only after 1967, when Israel performed a highly valued s ervice to the U.S. by destroying Nasser, the symbol of Arab nationalism, feared and detested as a \"virus\" who m ight \"infect others,\" a \"rotten apple\" who might \"s poil the barrel,\" in the conventional terminology of planner s, commonly reshaped for public purposes as the \"do mino theory.\" By the early 1970s, a tacit tripartite alliance o f \"local cops\" had taken shape under the U.S. aegis : Iran, Saudi Arabia, Israel (Turkey is taken for granted; Pakist an was an associate for a time). With by far the la rgest petroleum reserves, Saudi Arabia is the central com ponent of the Facade; any serious departure from ob edience would doubtless bring harsh penalties. The arrangem ents were publicly explained by U.S. intelligence specialists, and also by political figures, notably Henry Jackson, the Senate's leading specialist on the Middle East and oil. He observed that thanks to the \"stren gth and Western orientation\" of Israel and Iran, th ese two \"reliable friends of the United States,\" along with Saudi Arabia, \"have served to inhibit and contain those irresponsible and radical elements in certain Arab States . . . who, were they free to do so, would po se a grave threat indeed to our principal sources of petroleum in the Persian Gulf\" (meaning primarily profit flo w and a lever of world control; the U.S. was not dependent on Middle East oil for its own use). U.S. domination of the Gulf region had already c ome under threat in 1958, when the Iraqi military o verthrew the main British client regime. Internal U.S.-UK re cords provide a revealing account of their concerns and plans, essential background for understanding the G ulf War in 1991.14 Nasser's Egypt, as noted, was considered the major threat until Israel's 1967 vic tory; U.S. aid to Israel increased rapidly, even mo re so in 1970 when Israel performed another important service, bl ocking potential Syrian support for Palestinians be ing massacred in Jordan. The fall of the Shah in 1979 w as a serious blow. President Carter at once sent a NATO general to try to instigate a military coup. When t his failed, the two remaining pillars - Saudi Arabi a and Israel - joined the U.S. in an effort to overthrow the regim e by providing military aid; that is the convention al device to overthrow a civilian government, employed with grea t success in Indonesia and Chile not long before. Exploiting its intimate relations with the Shah's r egime, Israel reestablished military contacts and s ent U.S. arms, funded by Saudi Arabia. The goals of the oper ation were explained clearly and publicly at once,1 5 but largely ignored in the U.S.; later, they were refra med in the more acceptable terms of an \"arms for ho stage\" deal, though that could not have been the initial m otivation, since there were no hostages. The U.S.-I sraeli- Saudi project was an entirely natural reaction to t he downfall of the Shah, given the basic structure of the system of control.

It is within this general context that U.S.-Israe l relations have evolved over the years, though Isr ael also became a valued contributor to Washington's operati ons in Latin America and elsewhere.16 The Cold War was always in the background, primarily because of the ever-present threat of major war. But as has been t rue rather generally, it was a secondary factor, so the histor ical and documentary record reveal. The disappearan ce of the Russian deterrent led to important tactical modific ations, but no essential change in basic policies, or the U.S.- Israel relationship. An assessment that seems to me realistic was given in April 1992 by General (ret. ) Shlomo Gazit, former head of Israeli military intelligence , later a high official of the Jewish Agency and pr esident of Ben-Gurion University, and a highly respected strat egic analyst and planner. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, he wrote, Israel's main task has not changed at all, and it r emains of crucial importance. Its location at the c enter of the Arab Muslim Middle East predestines Israel to be a devoted guardian of stability in all the countries surrounding it. Its [role] is to protect the existi ng regimes: to prevent or halt the processes of rad icalization and to block the expansion of fundamentalist religious zealotry.17 Though welcomed in Washington as a major victory, Israel's military success in 1967 posed serious th reats. Then-Defense Secretary Robert McNamara later report ed that \"we damn near had war\" when the U.S. fleet \"turned around a [Soviet] carrier in the Mediterran ean\"; he gave no details, but it may have been when Israel conquered the Golan Heights after the cease-fire, e liciting severe warnings from the USSR, including o minous hot-line communications. Recognizing that military confrontation is too dangerous, the great powers pr oposed a diplomatic settlement, formalized as UN Security Co uncil resolution 242, November 1967. The resolution called for Israeli withdrawal from the territories it had conquered and for a full peace treaty that w ould recognize every state's right to live in peace and security within recognized boundaries: in brief, fu ll peace in return for full withdrawal, with at most marginal a nd mutual adjustments, straightening a crooked bord er, perhaps.18 It is important to bear in mind that UN 242 was strictly rejectionist -using the term here in a neutral sense to refer to rejection of the national rights of one or the other of the contending national grou ps in the former Palestine, not just rejection of the rights of Jews, as in the conventional racist usage. UN 24 2 called for a settlement among existing states: Palestinians were unmentioned, apart from oblique reference to \"a ju st settlement of the refugee problem.\" UN 242 remains a cornerstone of international di plomacy on the Israel-Arab conflict, but with two m ajor changes. The first was a crucial shift in the inter national consensus, which, by the mid-1970s, had ab andoned the rejectionist principles of the resolution and c alled for a Palestinian state in the occupied terri tories; the U.S. retained its rejectionist stand, but now in interna tional isolation. The second change had to do with the U.S. interpretation of UN 242. That change dates from Fe bruary 1971, when newly-elected President Sadat of Egypt accepted Washington's official policy, in fact went beyond it by offering a full peace treaty in retur n for Israeli withdrawal only from Egyptian territory. Israel off icially welcomed this as a genuine peace offer; it was a \"famous . . . milestone\" on the path to peace, Yitz hak Rabin, then Ambassador to Washington, recounts in his memoirs. But while officially welcoming Egypt's exp ression \"of its readiness to enter into a peace agr eement with Israel,\" Israel rejected the offer, stating th at it \"will not withdraw to the pre-June 5, 1967 li nes,\" a position that it maintains to the present. The United States faced a dilemma: Should it mai ntain its official position, thus joining Egypt in a confrontation with Israel? Or should it change the interpretation of 242, opting for Kissinger's call for \"stalemate\": no negotiations, only force? Kissinger prevailed. Since then the United States has interp reted 242 to mean withdrawal only insofar as the United State s and Israel determine. The earlier interpretation continued to be reiterated officially until the Clinton Admin istration, which argued at the December 1993 UN ses sion that past UN resolutions are \"obsolete and anachronistic \" in the light of the September 1993 Israel-PLO agr eement, to which we return.19 The official endorsement of 242 was meaningless, however, because Washington continued to provide military, diplomatic, and financial support for Isr ael's gradual integration of the territories. Presi dent Carter, for"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"example, forcefully reiterated the official positio n,20 while increasing U.S. aid to Israel to about h alf of total U.S. foreign aid, as part of the Camp David settlem ent. The events of 1971 have been excised from gene ral commentary and review.21 After the 1971 rebuff, Sadat warned that if his e fforts to reach peace continued to be rejected he w ould have to go to war. He was dismissed with contempt; recall t hat this was a period of tri-umphalist and racist a rrogance in both Israel and the U.S., later bitterly denounced in Israel. The Labor government proceeded with its programs to settle northeastern Sinai, including the all-Jew ish city of Yamit established after some 10,000 far mers and Bedouins were expelled with extreme brutality by fo rces commanded by General Ariel Sharon (who was reprimanded by a military commission of inquiry). S adat warned that \"Yamit means war,\" but was ignored .22 The 1973 war turned out to be a near-disaster for I srael - and the world; there was again a threat of nuclear confrontation. Even Kissinger understood that force alone is not enough. He turned to the natural back -up strategy: since Egypt could not be ignored, the maj or Arab deterrent must be removed from the conflict . The result, achieved by Carter at Camp David, freed Isr ael \"to sustain military operations against the PLO in Lebanon as well as settlement activity on the West Bank\" (Israeli strategic analyst Avner Yaniv),23 as Israel proceeded to do at once with massive support from t he Carter Administration and its successors. Sadat became a greatly admired \"man of peace\" in 1977, though his heroic stance was far less forthco ming than in 1971; by 1977 he had joined the internation al consensus calling for Palestinian rights. The cr ucial difference is that by 1977 the U.S. had reluctantly adopted Sadat's 1971 proposal, in the wake of the 1973 war (\"Kissinger's war,\" it might be called). All of thi s too has been excised from sanitized history. U.S. isolation became still more extreme as the international consensus abandoned its rejectionism. Matters came to a head in January 1976, when the Security C ouncil debated a resolution, supported by the Arab \"confrontation states\" (Egypt, Jordan, Syria) and p ublicly backed by the PLO, calling for a two-state settlement incorporating UN 242 but now supplemented with a Pa lestinian state in the occupied territories. Israel refused to attend the session, instead bombing Lebanon, kil ling 50 civilians, with no pretext other than retal iation against the UN. The resolution was supported by Eur ope, Russia (which was in the mainstream of diploma cy throughout the period), the non-aligned countries, in fact near-unanimously. The U.S. vetoed the resol ution, again in 1980.24 At the General Assembly, the U.S. regularly voted alone (with Israel, occasionally so me other client-state) against resolutions with a similar th rust. Technically, there are no vetoes at the Gener al Assembly, but a U.S. vote against, even in isolation (as is c ommon, on a wide range of issues), is effectively a veto. In fact, a double veto, since such occasions are typically v etoed from commentary and even from history, as the events just reviewed have been. The U.S. also blocked a se ries of other diplomatic initiatives: from Europe, the Arab states and the PLO. The press commonly did not even mention them. The record is instructive. To select one example among many, on December 10, 1986, New York Times Israel correspondent Thomas Friedman wrote that the Israeli group Peace Now has \"never been more distressed\" because of \"the absence of any Arab neg otiating partner.\" A few months later, he quoted Sh imon Peres as deploring the lack of a \"peace movement am ong the Arab people [such as] we have among the Jew ish people,\" and saying that there can be no PLO partic ipation in negotiations \"as long as it is remaining a shooting organization and refuses to negotiate.\" He was spea king almost three years after Israel had rejected a nother one of Arafat's offers for negotiations leading to mutu al recognition, which the Times had refused to repo rt. Note: refused. Six days before Friedman's article on the distress of Peace Now, a headline in the mass-circu lation Israeli journal Ma'ariv read: \"Arafat indicates to Israel that he is ready to enter into direct negoti ations.\" The offer was made during Peres's tenure as prime minis ter. Peres's press advisor confirmed the report, co mmenting that \"there is a principled objection to any contac t with the PLO, which flows from the doctrine that the PLO cannot be a partner to negotiations.\" Yossi Beilin, at the dovish extreme of Peres's Labor coalition, observed that \"the proposal... was dismissed because it appe ared to be a tricky attempt to establish direct con tacts when we are not prepared for any negotiations with any P LO factor.\" Other high officials took a much harshe r stance. None of this was reported in the mainstream U.S. me dia, though Friedman was alone in using the occasio n to issue one of his periodic laments over the bitter f ate of the only peace forces in the Middle East, wh ich lack any Arab negotiating partner. Soon after, he received a Pulitzer Prize for \"balanced and informed coverage \" of the Middle East, of which this is a representative samp le, and was appointed Times chief diplomatic correspondent.25"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" There is a conventional term for Washington's suc cess in blocking diplomatic settlement, in internat ional isolation: it is \"the peace process,\" a choice of t erminology that would not have surprised Orwell. Th e peace process in this sense has been bipartisan. There is an illusion that the (first) Bush Administration t ook a harsh line towards Israel.26 The truth is closer to the o pposite. An illustration is the official Administra tion position of December 1989 (the Baker Plan), which endorsed w ithout reservations the May 1989 plan of Israel's P eres- Shamir coalition government. That plan in turn decl ared that there can be no \"additional Palestinian s tate ...\" (Jordan already being a \"Palestinian state\"), and t hat \"There will be no change in the status of Judea , Samaria and Gaza [the occupied territories] other than in a ccordance with the basic guidelines of the [Israeli ] Government.\" Israel would conduct no negotiations w ith the PLO. But Israel would permit \"free election s,\" to be conducted under Israeli military rule, with much of the Palestinian leadership in prison without ch arge or expelled. The plan was unreported in the U.S. apart from the last provision, praised as a positive and forthcoming offer. What one does read is that Baker strongly reiterated U.S. support for \"total withdr awal from territory in exchange for peaceful relations\" - whi le he was quietly lending decisive support to progr ams to ensure that nothing of the sort would happen.27 Through the first months (1988) of the first Inti fada, Washington's increasingly desperate efforts t o pretend that Arafat was not willing to consider a diplomati c settlement were beginning to elicit international ridicule. The Reagan Administration therefore agreed to accep t Arafat's long-standing offers and to enter into negotiations; the standard interpretation was that Arafat had at last capitulated to Washington's stea dfast advocacy of peace and diplomacy. Washington's actua l reaction, unreported in the U.S., was made explic it in the first session of the negotiations: U.S. Ambassa dor Robert Pelletreau informed Arafat that he must abandon any thought of an international conference - unacce ptable, because of the international consensus - an d call off the \"riots\" in the occupied territories (the Intifa da), \"which we view as terrorist acts against Israe l.\" In short, the PLO must ensure a return to the pre-Intifada status quo, so that Israel would be able to continue its expansion and repression in the territories with U.S. support . That was well understood in Israel. In February 1 989, Prime Minister Rabin assured a Peace Now delegation that the negotiations are only \"low-level discussions\" t hat avoid any serious issue and grant Israel \"at least a year\" to resolve the problem by force. \"The inhab itants of the territories are subject to harsh military and econo mic pressure,\" Rabin explained, and \"in the end, th ey will be broken,\" and will accept Israel's terms. The versio n for the U.S. public was quite different.28 The last of the regular UN General Assembly resol utions supplementing UN 242 with an affirmation of Palestinian national rights was in December 1990, 1 44-2. A few weeks later, the U.S. went to war with Iraq, and George Bush triumphantly announced the New Worl d Order in four simple words: \"What We Say Goes,\" surely in the Middle East. The world understood, an d withdrew. The U.S. was finally in a position to i mpose its own unilateral rejectionist stand, and did so, firs t at Madrid in late 1991, then in the successive Is rael-PLO agreements from 1993. With these measures, the \"pea ce-process\" has advanced towards the Bantustan-styl e arrangements that the U.S. and Israel intended, as is clear in the documentary record and, more import ant, the record on the ground. Surely it was clear on September 13,1993, when R abin and Arafat formally accepted the Declaration o f Principles (OOP) in Washington with much fanfare. T he OOP outlines what was to come with little ambiguity.29 There have been few surprises since. The OOP states that the \"permanent status,\" the ultimate settlement down the road, is to be based o n UN 242 alone. The suppressed historical record makes it ve ry clear what that means. First, the operative mean ing of UN 242 is the U.S. version: partial withdrawal, as the U.S. and Israel determine. Second, the primary iss ue of diplomacy since the mid-1970s had been whether a di plomatic settlement should be based on UN 242 alone , as the U.S. insisted, or UN 242 supplemented with the resolutions that the U.S. had blocked calling for r ecognition of Palestinian national rights, the position of the rest of the world. The DOP kept explicitly to Wash ington's unilateral rejectionism. One could choose to be del uded - many did so. But that was a choice, and an u nwise one, particularly for the victims. Arafat was compelled to \"renounce terror,\" once a gain. The sole purpose was humiliation - not of Ara fat personally, but of the Palestinian people, for whom he is a symbol of nationalism.30"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" As Secretary of State George Shultz informed Rea gan in December 1988, Arafat had said \"Unc, unc, un c\" and \"cle, cle, cle,\" but he had not yet said \"Uncle \" in properly servile tones. The importance of this further renunciation of the right to resist was unnoticed, because no such right exists in the U.S. doctrinal framework. That was made clear in the (unreported) U.S.-PLO ne gotiations of 1989, as just reviewed; and before th at, in December 1987, when the UN General Assembly debated its major resolution condemning international terrorism, opposed by the U.S. and Israel alone bec ause the resolution supports \"the right to self-det ermination, freedom and independence, as derived from the Chart er of the United Nations, of peoples forcibly depri ved of that right. . . , particularly peoples under coloni al and racist regimes [meaning South Africa] and fo reign occupation or other forms of colonial domination [m eaning the Israeli-occupied territories].\"31 Washin gton's success in effectively vetoing the resolution, from reporting and history as well, had significant eff ects for Lebanon and the occupied territories, though the U. S. did belatedly abandon its support for the Aparth eid regime. In return for Arafat's capitulation, the U.S. and Israel conceded nothing. The OOP incorporates the U.S. version of the peac e process in all essential respects. One cannot rea lly accuse Israel of violating the Oslo agreements, except in detail.32 Without violating the wording of the DOP (or the carefully constructed subsequent resolutions), Isra el continued to settle and integrate the occupied t erritories with U.S. support and assistance. Intentions were n ot concealed. They were announced openly by Rabin a nd Peres and implemented by them and their successors. 33 The exact scale of the U.S.-Israel settlement pro grams is not entirely clear because of the devices that are used to conceal them. Settler leaders allege that the se ttler population doubled to 210,000 since Oslo (not counting 180,000 in Arab East Jerusalem, effectively annexed in violation of Security Council orders, but with tacit U.S. support). They report further that 10 percent of th e settlers keep addresses within Israel, hence are not counted. Construction in the settlements for the year 2000 w as reported to be more than three times as high as in Tel Aviv, more than ten times as high as in Jerusalem, and in general far higher relative to population th an within the Green Line (Israel proper). Population growth a nd public expenditures have also been much higher: 60 percent of the construction in the territories is s tate-funded, compared to 25 percent within Israel, and all the governments have employed a variety of inducements to encourage settlement.34 The Rabin-Peres formula, adopted by their success ors and Washington, has been that settlement will b e limited to \"natural growth,\" under a policy of \"fre ezing settlements.\" But \"there is freezing and ther e is reality,\" the Israeli press reports, adding that the far righ t is \"happy to adopt the Rabin formula,\" grateful f or the \"massive increase in building authorization\" under Barak, initiated under Rabin shortly after he had a ccepted the DOP. Israel's most prominent diplomatic corresp ondent, Akiva Eldar, writes that \"According to offi cial statistics, full compliance with the [Israel-U.S.] formula would mean that Israel announces a total fr eeze - plus demolishes 500 apartments. Right now, there are 9,8 44 new (and empty) apartments either finished, or u nder construction . . . Thus the Israelis made a mockery of the American deal, and the Americans stayed sil ent\" - and forked up the cash. He adds that plans of religious extremists (mostly American) for Hebron include construction on valuable archaeological sites, over the strong protest of the Archaeological Council. Thirty- eight senior Israeli archaeologists called on Barak to cancel the construction plans (which proceed). The Council chairman condemned the plans as \"in grave v iolation of the law and custom that enables archaeo logical digging and research to be conducted in the ancient sites in our land,\" destroying \"the Hebron of our forefathers and King David, and the historical and archaeologic al infrastructure of the Land of Israel and the Peo ple of Israel's past in our land.\" And, of course, continu ing the dispossession and torture of the Palestinia ns, the vast majority.35 In late 2000, as Barak's term was drawing to a c lose, his Ministry of Construction announced that 1 0,000 units were under construction in the occupied terri tories, two-thirds in urban settlements; the Minist ry of Housing announced $25 million to subsidize construc tion and infrastructure for 2001, in addition to th e similar sum announced in April for 25 \"bypass roads\" - an e xtensive highway system designed to integrate the s ettler population within Israel, while leaving the Palesti nian population invisible and isolated. \"The Barak government is leaving Sharon's government a surpris ing legacy,\" the press reported as the transition t ook place a few months later: \"the highest number of housing starts in the territories since the time when Ariel Sharon was Minister of Construction and Settlement in 1992 before the Oslo agreements.\" Figures of the Barak"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Ministry reveal that the rate of new construction i ncreased steadily from 1993 to 2000, when it reache d five times the level of 1993, 3J/2 times 1994, to be inc reased further under the Sharon-Peres government.36 In July 2000, contracts were awarded for 522 new dwellings in Israel's Har Homa, a project on land expropriate d from an Arab enclave in southeast Jerusalem that has los t 90 percent of its land since Israel's takeover in 1967 through \"town planning\" (a euphemism for replacing Arabs by Jews, reminiscent of some uses of \"urban planning\" in the U.S.). The Har Homa project, on Jabal Abu Ghneim, comple tes Israel's encirclement of the vastly expanded \"Jerusalem\" region. The project was initiated in th e last months of Shimon Peres's Labor government, p ut on hold after strong domestic and international protes t during Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Administration, resumed energetically (and without protest) under B arak. For the Israeli far right, however, Labor's H ar Homa project was much less significant than its E-l prog ram, which received much less publicity. This invol ved new housing and road construction to extend Greater Jer usalem to the city of Ma'aleh Adumim to the east, v irtually splitting the West Bank in two. Knesset member Mich ael Kleiner, the head of the expansionist \"Land of Israel Front\" (\"Hazit Eretz Yisrael\"), greeted the announc ement of the project with much appreciation, observ ing that this plan, which \"was the initiative of the former [Peres] Housing Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer [now Minister of Defense in the Sharon-Peres government] with the authorization of Yitzhak Rabin,\" is \"the most impo rtant\" of the Front's demands, more so than Har Homa.37 In the Sharon-Peres government, the task of conce aling the ongoing programs and rejecting internatio nal protests is assigned to Foreign Minister Peres. A r eport on the government programs for more extensive settlement is headlined \"Peres rejects internationa l objections to settlements.\" Peres repeated the \"n atural growth\" formula designed to quiet protest, a tradit ional contribution of the doves.38 The basic principle was described in 1996, during the last months of Peres's Administration, by Hous ing Minister Ben-Eliezer, as he announced the plans for Har Homa and for carrying further the Rabin-Peres programs to expand Greater Jerusalem in all directi ons, to include Ma'aleh Adumim (east), Givat Ze'ev (north), Beitar (south), and beyond. Labor \"does everything quietly,\" Ben-Eliezer explained, with \"the complete protection of the Prime Minister [Peres],\" using su ch terms as \"natural growth\" instead of \"new settle ments.\" Labor dove Yossi Beilin censured the incoming Netan yahu government for its inflammatory rhetoric. The Rabin government, he wrote, \"increased settlements by 50 percent\" in \"Judea and Samaria\" (the West Ban k) after Oslo, but \"we did it quietly and with wisdom, \" whereas you foolishly \"proclaim your intentions e very morning, frighten the Palestinians and transform th e topic of Jerusalem as the unified capital of Isra el - a matter which all Israelis agree upon - into a subject of w orld-wide debate.\" Beilin's statement is only partially accurate; th e \"quiet wisdom\" extends well beyond Jerusalem.39 T he differences of style can presumably be traced to th e constituencies of the two political groupings. La bor, the party of educated professionals and westernized eli tes, is more attuned to Western norms and understan ds that the sponsors prefer \"not to see\" what they are doin g. Likud's crude methods of achieving basically the same results are an embarrassment to Western humanists, and sometimes lead to conflict and annoyance (see n ote 26). Ma'aleh Adumim is described as one of the \"neigh borhoods of Jerusalem\" in U.S. reporting. According ly, Clinton's final offer could not have been more reas onable and generous when he said that \"what is Jewi sh should be Israeli\" - \"failing to mention,\" the fore ign press observed, \"that this would entail Israel annexing settlements it built in occupied east Jerusalem,\" i n fact far beyond in all directions. But that is an irrelevance. The great virtue of Clinton's \"creative compromise ... is that at least we now know what the only real istic final deal looks like,\" Thomas Friedman explained. The Pr esident has spoken. What more can there be to say?4 0 Those who stubbornly remain unsatisfied will dis cover that Ma'aleh Adumim uses 1/16 of the 50,000 d unams allotted to it in Israeli planning, a standard perc entage, designed to permit \"natural growth.\" The st ory of Ma'aleh Adumim is recounted by B'Tselem (see note 3 8).41 The town was established under the Labor government in the mid-1970s, and grew rapidly \"with the help of a massive flow of resources from the government,\" the town website reports. The official Metropolitan Jerusalem Plan anticipates expansion by 285 percent from 1994 to 2010, to 60,000 residents. Its lands too were expropriated from several Palestini an villages, including Abu Dis, which according to the plans of the doves, is to become the Palestinian A l-Quds"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"(that is, Jerusalem) by linguistic sleight-of-hand; but deprived of its lands, in contrast to Israeli \"Jerusalem,\" which will occupy a fair chunk of the West Bank. Th e state authorities found that there had been \"wide spread illegal building\" by Jewish settlers. The \"solution \" was simple, as in other settlements: \"to provide retroactive permits rather than to demolish the structures.\" Th e solution is demolition, often brutal, when Arabs build illegally, as they must to survive because of the s tringent conditions imposed on Arab construction. The expulsion of the Jahalin Bedouin from 1993 to allow further expansion of Ma'aleh Adumim was carr ied out in a particularly cruel fashion. They sought \"t o avert their terrible fate\" - and terrible it was, very visibly so - \"by petitioning the High Court of Justice,\" which l ived up to its tradition of meekly obeying state au thorities, though it did express the hope that the IDF would e ase the expulsion \"as an act of grace.\" In November 1999, the High Court rejected another Palestinian petitio n opposing further expansion of Ma'aleh Adumim, suggesting that \"some good for the residents of nei ghboring [Palestinian villages] might spring from t he economic and cultural development\" of the all-Jewis h city. The end result, B'Tselem concludes, is that here as throughout the territories, \"the helpless local population is totally subject to regulations set by the military force of the occupation in order to promote its pol itical interests,\" increasingly so during the Oslo peace p rocess. The Ma'aleh Adumim Municipality explains that \"Th e political objective in establishing the town was settlement of the area east of Israel's capital alo ng the Jerusalem-Jericho route,\" thus separating Ra mallah and the northern Palestinian enclave from Bethlehem and the southern one. Every U.S.-Israeli peace plan in cludes some version of this condition, along with expansio n of \"Jerusalem\" to the north and south. As before, the final Clinton-Barak proposals of January 2001 include ano ther salient to the north, effectively partitioning the northern sector. The three enclaves are separated f rom the former Jerusalem, the traditional center of Palestinian life.42 They are hemmed in by extensive infrastructure construction, including \"a vast roa d system, running for some 400 km which bypasses Palestinian population centres and enables settlers and militar y forces protecting them to move speedily and safely through the West Bank.\"43 Constructed on 160,000 dunams of expropriated land, the bypass road system also prev ents expansion and development of Palestinian villa ges and impedes flow of commerce and people, though Arabs c an travel on what are officially called \"Palestinia n roads,\" many quite hazardous; the Bethlehem-Ramalla h road, for example (perhaps to be closed entirely if the Clinton-Barak formula, or something like it, is imp lemented). In addition, \"access roads\" lead to Jewi sh settlements, with their swimming pools and well-wat ered gardens (Palestinian villages and towns have l ittle water, often none during the dry season). If a sing le settler passes on an access road, all Palestinia n traffic is stopped, \"causing long delays and much resentment.\" Regular Israeli closures imprison the population f urther, \"often preventing or greatly detaining even emergen cy traffic, such as ambulances.\"44 The Israeli pres s has reported many examples of the kind of brutality and purposeful humiliation one expects of an occupying army that can act without restraint. Every step of the way, this proceeds with U.S. au thorization and subsidy, funneled through various c hannels, along with critical military and diplomatic support . The U.S. has also taken pains to ensure that the escalating state terror during the current confrontations will be free even from observation, with its inhibiting effect. On March 27, 2001, the U.S. vetoed a Security Council resolution calling for international observers. Acc ording to European sources cited in the Israeli press, the pr oposal was \"scuttled\" by Washington's \"four no's,\" which \"shocked the representatives of the four European c ountries that put together the resolution - Ireland , Britain, Norway and France.\" The U.S. rejected any mention o f the word \"siege\" or the principle of land-for-pea ce, of settlements, or of international law and the Geneva Convention. Arabs and their allies had already aba ndoned their own resolution, hoping that Europe could \"neg otiate with the Americans over the formula.\" A U.S. diplomat explained that \"the United States believes the UN should stay out of the settlement debate\" a nd that \"the Geneva Convention issue\" should be resolved be tween Israel and the Palestinians, without \"prejudg ment\" through UN involvement.45 The matter of the Geneva Conventions is particula rly significant.46 These were adopted in the afterm ath of World War II to bar the practices of the Nazis, inc luding transfer of population of the conqueror to o ccupied territory or any actions that harm the civilian pop ulation.47 Responsibility for monitoring observance of the Conventions was assigned to the International Red C ross, which has determined that Israel's settlement programs violate the Fourth Convention. The ICRC po sition has been endorsed by numerous resolutions of the"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"UN Security Council and General Assembly. Applicabi lity of the Convention to the Israeli-occupied terr itories has been affirmed by the U.S. as well: by UN Ambass ador George Bush (September 1971), and by joining i n unanimous adoption of Security Council resolution 4 65 (1980), which condemned Israeli settlements as \"flagrant violations\" of the Convention. Even Clint on was unwilling to take a public stand in blatant violation of a central part of international humanitarian law ; the U.S. therefore abstained when the Security Co uncil in October 2000 called on Israel \"to abide scrupulousl y by its responsibilities under the Fourth Geneva Convention,\" which it was again violating flagrantl y (resolution 1323, passed 14-0). Under the Conventions, it is the responsibility o f the High Contracting Parties, including the Europ ean powers and the U.S., \"to respect and to ensure respect\" fo r the Conventions \"in all circumstances.\" They \"sho uld do everything in their power to ensure that the humani tarian principles underlying the Conventions are ap plied universally,\" the ICRC has determined. It is theref ore Washington's responsibility to prevent settleme nt and expropriation, along with collective punishment and all other measures of intimidation, repression, an d violence. The ICRC has also determined (February 20 01) that Israel's closures and blockades are in vio lation of its Convention obligations, not to speak of the exc essive and unlawful use of force repeatedly condemn ed by every significant human rights organization in Isra el, the U.S., and elsewhere, and again the UN, in a n EU- sponsored resolution, passed unanimously apart from the U.S.48 It follows that the U.S. is in express violation of its obligations as a High Contracting Party. Not only is it not acting to ensure respect for the Conventions, as it is obligated to do, but it has been actively engag ed in violating them. All significant U.S.-Israel activit ies in the territory are in flat violation of inter national law. The concessions offered by Clinton and Barak, which are defined as the only \"realistic\" plan and have gain ed such acclaim for their magnanimity and generous spirit, do not exist, any more than Russia could make \"gene rous concessions\" when it withdrew from Afghanistan, or Germany when it was driven from occupied France. It is hardly necessary even to discuss the specific arran gements, repugnant as they are on elementary moral grounds. There is a good reason why Washington wants any r eference to the Geneva Conventions suppressed, and why the media cooperate so fully - even to the extent o f informing readers that the \"disputed territories\" are considered to be occupied territories by the Palest inians, which is true enough: the Palestinians and everyone else apart from Israel and its superpower patron. There are substantial forces in Israel that have long been in favor of some kind of Palestinian stat e in the occupied territories. Prominent among them are Isra eli industrialists, who were calling for a Palestin ian state even before the Oslo agreements. The president of t he Israeli Industrialists' Association, Dov Lautman , recommended the NAFTA model that was then under neg otiation - \"a transition from colonialism to neo- colonialism,\" the labor correspondent of the journa l of the Labor Party commented, \"a situation simila r to the relations between France and many of its former col onies in Africa.\" The Israeli coordinator of operat ions in the territories explained that the goal of his work is to \"integrate the economy of the territories in to the Israeli economy.\"49 A Bantustan-style statelet would allow Israeli firms to place assembly plants on the Pales tinian side of the border, providing cheap labor with no n eed for concern about environmental or other constr aints on profit making, also relieving concerns that some of those derided as \"beautiful souls\" might see the w ay workers are treated and call for minimally decent c onditions and wages. Again on the NAFTA model, a separate state would provide a useful weapon against the Israeli workin g class, offering ways to limit their wages and benef its, and to undermine unions; much as in the U.S., where manufacturers develop excess capacity abroad that c an be used to break strikes, and threaten \"transfer \" to Mexico to disrupt union organizing, a significant c onsequence of NAFTA that has probably impressed Isr aeli manufacturers.50 Poor Israeli workers in \"developme nt towns\" and the Arab sector would be particularly affected, as has already happened. During the neoli beral onslaught of the 1990s, Israeli port workers struggled against privatization of the ports and dismantling of collective-bargaining agreements endorsing right s they had won. Employer associations tried to break strikes b y diverting cargo ships to Egypt and Cyprus, but th at carries heavy transportation costs. A port in Gaza would be ideal. With the collaboration of local authorities in the standard neocolonial fashion, port operations could be transferred there, strikes broken, and Israeli ports transferred to unaccountable private hands.51"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" It is not surprising that Israel is coming to re semble the U.S., with very high inequality and leve ls of poverty, stagnating wages and deteriorating working conditio ns, and erosion of its formerly well-functioning so cial systems. As in the U.S., the economy is based heavi ly on the dynamic state sector, sometimes concealed under the rubric of military industry. It is also not sur prising that the U.S. should favor arrangements tha t make its outpost look pretty much like the sponsor itself. There are also nationalist reasons to oppose ter ritorial expansion. One growing concern is the \"dem ographic crisis\" resulting from the differential Jewish and Arab birth rates (and among the Jewish population, the difference between the secular and religious popula tions). Demographic projections indicate that befor e too long Israeli Arabs and ultra-religious Jews, many n on-Zionist, will become a major part of the populat ion. A conference of prominent figures on the problem in M arch 2001 received considerable media attention, as did a call from the respected analyst Shlomo Gazit for es tablishment of a temporary dictatorship to implemen t stern internal measures to deal with \"the demographic dan ger,\" which he regards as \"the most serious threat that Israel faces.\" For the same reason, he issued a str ong call for total withdrawal from the occupied ter ritories, unlike the Clinton-Barak or other plans.52 The essential meaning of the Oslo peace process i s well understood by prominent Israeli doves. Just before he joined the Barak government as Minister of Internal Security, historian Shlomo Ben-Ami observed in an academic study that \"in practice, the Oslo agreemen ts were founded on a neocolonialist basis, on a lif e of dependence of one on the other forever.\" With these goals, the Clinton-Rabin-Peres agreements were des igned to impose on the Palestinians \"almost total depende nce on Israel,\" creating \"an extended colonial situ ation,\" which is expected to be the \"permanent basis\" for \" a situation of dependence.\" Ben-Ami went on to beco me the chief negotiator and architect of the Barak proposa ls.53 Step by step, the U.S. and Israel have labored fo r 30 years to construct a system of permanent neoco lonial dependency. The project took new forms as the \"Oslo peace process\" was put in place, along lines proje cted in the OOP and spelled out in close detail in the inte rim agreements. The plans have been implemented in the settlement and construction programs carried out re gardless of who is in office, often most effectivel y under the Labor doves, who tend to be more immune from critic ism. Throughout, the plans and implementation have relied crucially on the military, diplomatic and fi nancial support of the U.S., and not least, the ide ological support of articulate educated opinion."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Notes PREFACE 1. \"Origins and Fundamental Causes of International Terrorism,\" UN Secretariat, reprinted in M.

For background, in October 1976 a Cubana airline r was destroyed by a bomb in flight with 73 killed including the entire Cuban Olympic gold medal fenci ng team (compare the actual events of the \"Munich massacre,\" one of the peak moments of Palestinian t errorism). The terrorist action was traced to Orlan do Bosch, probably the leading figure of international terrorism, who had been trained by the CIA along w ith his close associates in connection with the terrorist w ar against Cuba and \"had close relations with (and has been on the payroll of) the secret police of Chile and V enezuela,\" who, in turn, \"were tutored by the CIA a nd maintain close relations with it today\" (Herman, Re al Terror Network, 63).

The groundwork had already been laid in the Uni ted States and in a series of conferences for futur e terrorologists organized by Israel, which has an obvious interest in this propaganda operation . Commenting on the second Israeli-organized conferen ce on terrorism, held in Washington, Wolf Blitzer observes that the focus on Arab terrorism and the enthusiasm expresse d by many notable speakers for Israeli terrorism and agg ression (particularly, its 1982 invasion of Lebanon ), provided \"clearly a major boost for Israel's own Ha sbara campaign in the United States, as recognized by everyone involved\" (Blitzer, Jerusalem Post, June 2 9, 1984); the word \"hasbara,\" literally \"explanatio n,\" is the term for Israeli propaganda,expressing the thesis t hat since Israel's position is so plainly correct o n every issue, it is only necessary to explain; propaganda is for those with something to conceal. For more on the judgments expressed in the conference, see chapter 3, note 20. 13. Kennedy's program was limited to the second and third plank of the Reagan agenda; the first, enact ed with the support of Congressional Democrats in direct vi olation of the will of the public, reflects the dec line in relative U.S. power in the intervening years. It is no longer feasible to pursue \"great societies at h ome and grand designs abroad,\" in the words of Kennedy advi sor Walter Heller, so the former must be abandoned.

This was in Cauca, where poor people had succeeded in electi ng their own Governor, a proud and impressive indigenous leader, perhaps the first in the hemisph ere. The successes of the social bloc led to a shar p increase in paramilitary terror and guerrilla repression, an d fumigation of areas that had not even been inspec ted to see if coca or poppies are grown among the coffee bushe s and other varied crops, all destroyed. Cauca gain ed first place for human rights violations in 2001, no small achievement in this terrorist state. The very idea that the U.S. has the right to destroy crops it doesn't like in some other country is taken for granted in the terrorist superpower, but is so outlandish that comment is ba rely possible - no one, of course, has the right to destroy far more lethal substances produced in North Carolina a nd Kentucky. 7.

When Jarring died on May 29, 2002, there were obituaries in major U.S. newspapers, but the most important e vent in his political career was omitted, with one exceptio n: the Los Angeles Times, which stated falsely that both sides refused to accept Jarring's proposal (Dennis McLell an, June 1, 2002, reprinted in the Boston Globe). 14.

The behavior of certai n human rights organizations in this regard is notewo rthy. Thus to ensure that it would have no unpleasa nt information, the Interna tional League for Human Ri ghts suspended its Israeli affiliate on the sole gr ounds that the governing Labor Party had attempted to destroy it by measures so crude that they were quickly bloc ked by the Israeli Courts; see my Peace in the Middle East? (Pantheon, 1974, 196-7), FT, 142, 178, and references cited. Such behavior with regard to any other country would be elicit outrage, but it does not affect the reputati on of the International League. Similarly, the human rights i nformation journal Human Rights Internet, which simply reports without comment allegations of human rights violat ions, permits the Anti-Defamation League to respond to ch arges concerning Israel, a practice excluded for an y other state; thus the Communist Party, which has domestic credentials comparable to the ADL as a human rights organization, is not given space to respond to cha rges against the USSR, rightly of course. 63.

In France, another terrorist state, there was virtually no protest over the atrocity or the punitive acts take n by France against New Zealand in \"retaliation\" fo r the trial of the captured terrorists. Rather, a report from P aris after the settlement with New Zealand observes , \"the action called forth not self-criticism but patrioti sm. In France's view, New Zealand and its Prime Min ister, David Lange, quickly became villains for holding th e two agents, unjustly detained, in the common view here, for the crime of having served the national interes t. In France, little was made in the press of the d eath of the Greenpeace crew member, or the fact that the sovere ignty of New Zealand had been violated.\" Despite promises of the Socialist government to take \"legal action\" if \"criminal acts\" had been committed, \"th e only legal action taken was against several members of t he French Government for disclosing information to the press,\" and \"there has been no public investigation \" (New York Times, July 30, 1986).

There was no supporting evidence in the case o f the Libyan jet, but the Soviet allegation might b e correct, though it obviously provides no justification for t he atrocity; see R. W. Johnson, Shoot-Down (Viking, 1986), a study particularly interesting for its dissection o f U.S. government lies. The dismissive American rev iews are revealing. Joel Brinkley writes that the book is \"f lawed\" because of its \"strident tone\" of \"disdain b ordering on contempt\" for major figures in the Reagan Administr ation, and states falsely that it largely derives f rom the American press (New York Times Book Review, July 20 , 1986). Douglas Feaver claims that Johnson \"discre dits his thesis with disinformation of his own on points that are easily checked,\" noting that on p. 2 he q uotes the International Civil Aviation Organization's report only in part (Book World, Washington Post Weekly, J uly 7, 1986).

A recently-discov ered Israeli intelligence report of June 30, 1948 concludes that of the 391,000 Arab refugees (152,00 0 from outside the area assigned to Israel in the U N Partition recommendation), at least 70 percent fled as a result of Jewish military operations (primari ly Haganah/IDF) including direct expulsion, an apparen t underestimate, Benny Morris observes in his analy sis. The report also notes that this took place in the f ace of intense efforts of the Arab leadership to st em the flow. He also notes that the \"circumstances of the second half of the exodus,\" from July to October, \"are a different story\"; \"after June '48 there were many more plann ed expulsions\" (Middle Eastern Studies (London), Janua ry 1986; interview with Haim Bar'am, Kol Ha'ir, May 9, 1986). 106.

Perhaps the most intriguin g is that of Yitzhak Rabin, then Chief of Staff, who des cribes the attack on the ship as \"the most alarming development in the entire campaign,\" during which h e experienced \"sheer terror.\" He places it on June 7 (it was June 8), an inconceivable error, which can perh aps be understood as an effort to obscure the appar ent reason for the attack: to conceal from the U.S. the planned invasion of Syria after the cease-fire.

The U.S. government claims that from September 1 980, Nicaragua began to send arms to the guerrillas who were largely mobilized by the Carter-Duarte terrori st war against the population, a mere trickle, even if we accept the documentary evidence provided at face va lue. The evidence for arms flow from early 1981 is virtu ally nil (cf. TTT and the testimony of CIA analyst David MacMichael before the Inter national Court of Justi ce; UN A/40/907, S/17639, 19 November 1985). It is assumed without question that to provide arms to pe ople attempting to defend themselves against a terr orist attack backed by the United States is criminal, if not proof of an attempt to conquer the Hemisphere. The Court ruled in June 1986 that arms supply might have proc eeded \"up to the early months of 1981,\" though furt her alle gations \"are not solidly established,\" and rul ed that as a matter of law, such arms supply, even if it existed, would not constitute \"armed attack\" justifying a U. S. response, as Washington claimed. It found that U .S. actions \"violated the principle [of the UN Charter] prohibit ing recourse to the threat or use of forc e\" in international affairs, along with other crimes. Was hington ignored the judgment of the Court, having a lready declared that it would not be subject to Court juri s diction, reacting by escalation of the \"unlawful use of force\" for which it had just been condemned by the Court, including the first official orders to its mercenar y forces to attack undefended civilian targets. Meanwhile respe cted advocates of world order agreed that the U.S. should not submit to Court jurisdiction because America \"s till needs the freedom to protect freedom,\" as in N icaragua (Thomas Franck, New York Times, July 17, 1986). Con tra supporter Robert Leiken of the Carnegie Endowme nt for International Peace \"blamed the court, which he said suffers from the 'increasing percepti on' of having close ties to the Soviet Union\" (Jona than Karp, Washington Post, June 28, 1986) - ties that mysteri ously emerged after the same court ruled in favor o f the U.S. in the case of Iran. 4.

The wording of 242 was left deliberately imprec ise in the hope of securing at least formal agreeme nt by Israel and the Arab states. \"Withdrawal\" was genera lly understood (by the U.S. as well) to mean to the pre- June 1967 borders, with minor and mutual adjustment s.

Baker cited by Carter, Washington Post, Novembe r 26, 2000. Note Baker's use of the word \"territory ,\" not \"the territory\" or \"the territ- ories.\" In U.S. dip lomacy since 1971, omission of the definite article in the English version of UN 242 (but not the equally authoritativ e French version) has been the device for claiming that UN 242 meant only partial withdrawal, contrary to the international interpretation, including the U.S. un til 1971. There has been much legalistic debate over the matt er; pointless, because the meaning of a declaration is determined by the decisions of the most powerful ac tors, which are accepted in the doctrinal system, e ven if they are sharply contrary to the actual wording.

T hey replayed it, for example, when Arafat was confi ned to his compound in Ramallah in April 2002, surrounded by Israeli tanks, and sternly admonished to renounc e terrorism, a meaningless gesture as everyone unders tood, but useful for the purposes of humiliation of Pales tinians. In contrast, Sharon was designated a \"man of peace\" by President Bush, who was hailed for arranging the release of Arafat from his dungeon in return for U .S.-UK supervision of the accused assassins of Israeli cab inet minister Rehavam Ze'evi. Ze'evi was killed in the a nticipated reaction to Israel's escalation of the c ycle of violence by the first assassination of a political leader, Abu Ali Mustafa, in a missile attack with a U.S. helicopter; there were no charges against him. The Mustafa assas sination passed in silence (apart from some comment about the presence of American citizens in the apa rtment house attacked by the IDF assassins), but the react ion was quite different when Ze'evi was killed in r etaliation. It is inconceivable that there should be any effort to punish those responsible for killing Mustafa.

The agreements were carefully crafted by Israel i negotiators (with U.S. backing) with unclear and sometimes conflicting provisions, escape hatches, v ague reciprocity conditions, etc., in such a way as to make it possible for supporters of the occupation to argue that Israel is not violating the agreements. In con trast, the concessions by the Pales tinians are far-reaching, and given the relations of power, are in effect.

These land acquisi tion policies leave Palestinian villages \"scattered and isolated, between the [Jewish] set tlements,\" which were dispersed in order to achieve this outcome, B'Tsele m alleges. \"Palestinian communities have become settlements in an Israeli West Bank,\" a Palestinian analyst observes.

The negotations were called off by Prime Minister Barak , who also \"instructed his chief negotiator, Gilad Sher, to tell the Palestinians that the map present ed by then foreign minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, which r educed the area of the settlement bloc (including the Ma'a leh Adumim-Givat Ze'ev tract) to only 5 percent of the West Bank, had no validity.\" The status of that tract, w hich effectively bisects the West Bank, remained a major point of dispute, as at Camp David. The Palestinians prop osed an explicit map (contrary to much propaganda), with Israel retaining 3 percent of the West Bank and \"a land swap that would be equitable in size and value and in areas adjacent to the border with Palestine, and in the same vicinity as those annexed by Israel.\" Isr ael refused, offering only a much smaller disconnected area on the Sinai border.
