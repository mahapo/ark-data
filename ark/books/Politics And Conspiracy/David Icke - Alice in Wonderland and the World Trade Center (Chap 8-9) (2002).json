[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"House of cards\"Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacksof September the 11th.\"George W. BushThe official story of what happened on that horrific day in the autumn of 2001 isan obvious and transparent fantasy, and the atrocities of September 11th wereyet another version of Oklahoma and Pearl Harbor.All of these attacks (and so, so, many more) were not onlymadeto happen theywereallowedto happen and this is the combination you see in all these Illuminatistings. They arrange for their agents in government, the intelligence network, themilitary, and terrorist groups to execute the plan. At the same time they ensure thatthe plan is allowed to happened through lax security, and that those who are trulyresponsible are never named, let alone caught. Ideally you want both the executionof the plan and the \"failed security\" to involve the same organisation because thatprovides optimum efficiency and potential for cover-up. So, often, you find that theperpetrators and those protecting the perpetrators are actually thesamepeople. Theevidence is clear that the attacks of September 11th were allowed to happen.Colonel Leroy Fletcher Prouty spent a long career in the US Air Force and specialoperations in which he was heavily involved with the CIA, then led by its notoriousfirst director Allen Dulles. Prouty later wrote and lectured about some of theseclandestine operations and authored the book,JFK, The CIA, Vietnam And The Plot ToAssassinate John F. Kennedy.'The Donald Sutherland character called \"X\" in theOliver Stone movieJFKwas apparently based to an extent on Prouty. This guyoperated for decades in the shadowy world from which came the real orchestratorsof 9/11. Fletcher Prouty said:\"No one has to direct an assassination - it happens. The active role is played secretlyby permitting it to happen. This is the greatest single clue. Who has the power to calloff or reduce the usual security precautions?\"2If you look at the evidence detailed in books by myself and others, FletcherProuty's words are true in the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, his brother Bobby,210"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•House of cards\t211Martin Luther King, Princess Diana, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, SwedishPrime Minister Olaf Palme ... the list could go on for pages. The same is also true ofSeptember 11th.NORAD and Cheyenne MountainThe organisation charged with the task of protecting North American airspace inboth the United States and Canada is NORAD, the North American AreospaceDefense Command, headquartered at the Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado withits operational centre in the nearby Rocky Mountains. This was the organisationthat did nothing to prevent the attacks while all hell was happening in the skiesover America on September 11th, and it is important to look in some depth at itsbackground and capabilities. NORAD was created by an agreement signed by theUS and Canadian governments on May 12th 1958. NORAD's brief, to quote its ownwebsite, involves:\"...the monitoring of man-made objects in space, and the detection, validation, andwarning of attack against North America whether by aircraft, missiles, or spacevehicles, utilizing mutual support arrangements with other commands. Aerospacecontrol includes ensuring air sovereignty and air defense of the airspace of Canada andthe United States.\"3NORAD has an agreement with the civilian Federal Aviation Administration(FAA) to respond to civil aviation emergencies when commercial aircraft arehijacked, lose contact with air traffic controllers, or stray off-course. What happenedon 9/11, therefore, was exactly what NORAD is there to deal with. The President ofthe United States and the Prime Minister of Canada officially appoint NORAD'scommander. This means, of course, that the President of the United States appointshim. Again quoting the NORAD website: \"Cheyenne Mountain serves as a centralcollection and coordination facility for a worldwide system of sensors designed toprovide ... the leadership of Canada and the US with an accurate picture of anyaerospace threat.\"' Ah yes, Cheyenne Mountain. It was not long into my research ofthe global conspiracy in 1992 that I first came across Cheyenne Mountain inColorado. There have been many mysterious animal mutilations in that area,including some at the nearby Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, and researchers into \"UFO\"activity have long had their eyes on the Cheyenne Mountain complex. What we doknow for sure is that this is the vast super-secret headquarters for the \"defence\" ofNorth America and was the early warning and response centre during the(manufactured) \"Cold War\" with the Soviet Union. It is also the location of so muchmore that we are not told about.The complex is mounted on more than 1,300 half-ton springs that allow it tosway up to a foot horizontally in any direction should it be struck by an earthquakeor nuclear attack. The two main doors consist of 25 tons of baffled steel, three feetthick, and the complex is located 2,000 feet inside the granite mountain. In the sameregion are other major military and technology centres like Ent Air Force Base, Fort"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"212\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.Carson Army Base, Peterson Airfield, Lowry Air Force bombing range, the US AirForce Academy, the Buckley Air National Guard and Naval Air Station, and theRocky Mountain Arsenal. A Scripps Howard News Service survey reported in 1998that about 7,000 people were employed within Cheyenne Mountain and thatspending on the facility was substantially increased by the best part of $2 billionafter the \"Cold War\" was over.' This would seem to be a strange contradiction ifyou didn't know that the massive network of underground bases and the tunnelsystems that connect them across the United States are not there primarily to protectthe population at all. Their role is to control the population. Inside CheyenneMountain are some of the most brilliant technological minds in the world using anddeveloping technology that is light years ahead of anything you will see in thepublic arena. It is a big mistake to judge what is possible only on the basis oftechnology you know about. These guys aren't working with that.The following information comes from the official Cheyenne Mountain website6and represents only a fraction of what really goes on there. The excavation ofCheyenne Mountain near Colorado Springs began in May 1961 and was completedin around a year, according to the official story. The NORAD command centre waslocated here and became fully operational on April 20th 1966 when its duties weretransferred from Ent Air Force Base, also in Colorado. NORAD has since beenjoined inside Cheyenne Mountain by other \"early warning and response\"organisations with the responsibility for defending North America from air attack.One is the Air Force Space Command that is supposed to provide protection fromspace and missile attack, and this operates the Space Defense Operations Center.Personnel at the Space Defense Operations Center and \"their worldwide sensors,under the direction of Air Defense Command\", supported the first flight of thespace shuttle in April 1981.' Cheyenne Mountain has continued to support everyshuttle mission since. General Ralph E. Eberhart, the commander of NORAD at thetime of 9/11, was also commander of Space Command and he took over onFebruary 18th 2000 from General Richard B. Myers who became Deputy Chairmanof the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon, and Chairman immediately after 9/11.Eberhart and Myers also both served at the \"CIA\" Air Force Base at Langley,Virginia, from where, it is claimed, jets were scrambled (far too late) to interceptFlight 77 as it headed for Washington. Eberhart was Commander, Air CombatCommand, from June 1999 to February 2000 when he replaced Myers at NORAD.More about Myers' behaviour on September 11th in due course. I am going to detailat some length the capabilities of the Cheyenne Mountain complex for reasons thatwill become very clear. This is what its official website says about the NORADoperations today, and the information is highly revealing in the light of the events -or non-events - of September 11th:\"The Air Defense Operations Center uses its air defense network to provide surveillanceand control of air operations to North America and unknown traffic. Today the NORADCombat Operations Center has evolved into the Cheyenne Mountain Operations Centerthat collects data from a worldwide system of satellites, radars, and other sensors and"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•House of cards\t213processes that information on sophisticated computer systems to support criticalNORAD and US Space Command missions. The Cheyenne Mountain Operations Centerprovides warning of ballistic missile or air attacks against North America, assists the airsovereignty mission for the United States and Canada, and, if necessary, is the focalpoint for air defense operations to counter enemy bombers or cruise missiles.\"In support of the US Space Command mission, the Cheyenne Mountain OperationsCenter provides a day-to-day picture of precisely what is in space and where it islocated. The Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center also supports space operations,providing critical information such as collision avoidance data for space shuttle flightsand troubleshooting satellite interference problems. Since the Persian Gulf War, theCheyenne Mountain Operations Center has continued to play a vital and expanding rolein supporting our deployed forces with warning for short-range ballistic missiles such asthe Iraqi Scuds. Cheyenne Mountain operations are conducted by six centers manned24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The centers are: Command Center, Air DefenseOperations Center, Missile Warning Center, Space Control Center, CombinedIntelligence Watch Center, and the Systems Center.\"And it goes on:\"The Command Center is the heart of operations in Cheyenne Mountain. In this center,the Command Director and his crew serve as the NORAD and US Space CommandCommander in Chief's direct representatives for monitoring, processing, andinterpreting missile, space or air events which could have operational impacts on ourforces or capabilities, or could be potential threats to North America or US and alliedforces overseas. The Command Center is linked directly to the National CommandAuthorities of both the US and Canada as well as to regional command centersoverseas. When required, the Command Director must consult directly with the NORADand US Space Command Commander in Chief for time-critical assessments of missile,air, and space events; he takes action to ensure the Commander in Chief's responseand direction are properly conveyed and executed .....The Air Defense Operations Center provides command and control for the airsurveillance and air defense network for North America. In 1994, they monitored over700 'unknown' radar tracks entering North American airspace. Many of these weresubsequently identified as friendly aircraft that had erred from flight plans or usedimproper procedures. Yet nearly 100 were identified as illegal drug-carrying aircraft thatwere subsequently prosecuted by the US and Canadian Drug Enforcement Agencies.\"8The technology located within Cheyenne Mountain is the state of the state of thestate of the art. Its website explains how the Missile Warning Center employs a\"worldwide sensor and communications network to provide warning of missileattacks, either long or short range, launched against North America or our forcesoverseas\". So much so that its technology provides information \"regarding missile"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"214\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.launches anywhere on earth which are detected by the strategic missile warningsystem and which could be a potential threat to Canada or the US\". The SpaceControl Center at Cheyenne Mountain, opened in March 1994, has the highlysophisticated technology that \"supports the space control missions of spacesurveillance and protection of our assets in space\" and its primary objective is toperform \"the surveillance mission ... to detect, track, identify, and catalog all man-made objects in space\". The Center has a computerised catalogue of \"all orbitingspace objects, charts objects, charts present position, plots future orbital paths, andforecasts times and general locations for significant objects re-entering the Earth'satmosphere.\" The website tells us that the Space Control Center is currentlytracking some 8,000 \"on-orbit objects\", and this information is used to provideNASA with collision avoidance information during space flights. CheyenneMountain is also home to the Combined Intelligence Watch, which serves as NorthAmerica's \"indications and warning center for worldwide threats from space,missile, and strategic air activity, as well as geopolitical unrest that could affectNorth America and US forces/interests abroad\".9Put another way, they have asatellite surveillance network that could read your licence plate from spacewherever you may be. The Combined Intelligence Watch \"gathers intelligenceinformation to assist all the Cheyenne Mountain work centers in correlating andanalyzing events to support NORAD and US Space Command decision makers\".\"There is a Systems Center that \"ensures continuity of operations throughout theCheyenne Mountain Operations Center by providing communications andcomputer systems management for over 100 computer systems and 600communications circuits in support of NORAD and US Space Command missilewarning, space control, and air defense missions\".\"\"Most unique installation\"Cheyenne Mountain calls itself one of the most unique installations in the worldand is the likely command centre for the \"Star Wars\" satellite network so beloved ofboth the Bushes and Reagan (the Bushes). The complex has the potential formassive cooperation and coordination between apparently unconnectedorganisations because it employs staff from the Army, Navy, Marine, Air Force andCanadian Forces. Cheyenne Mountain operates military communication andnavigation satellites that direct and guide \"western\" armies during theirbombardments of Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. Major Mike Birmingham, anArmy spokesman for the Colorado base, said: \"Space support basically allowed USforces to perform that famous 'left hook' operation [employed during the Gulf War].The Iraqis assumed no one could navigate that well in the desert.\"\" But, despite allof this amazing technology and response capability, four commercial airlinershijacked in American airspace proved too much for them on September 11th. Why?If anyone is still in any doubt about the technological and coordination capabilitywe are talking about here and its instant communications network throughout theUnited States government, military and air traffic surveillance, the officialCheyenne Mountain website says:"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•House of cards\t215\"The Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center comprises the largest and most complexcommand and control network in the world. The system uses satellites, microwaveradio routes, and fiber optic links to transmit and receive vital communications. Twoblast-hardened microwave antennas and two underground coaxial cables transmit thebulk of electronic information. Most of this information is data sent from the worldwidespace surveillance and warning network directly to computers inside the Mountain.Redundant and survivable communications hotlines connect the Command Center tothe Pentagon, White House, US Strategic Command, Canadian Forces Headquarters inOttawa, other aerospace defense system command posts, and major military centersaround the world.\"13Now take a deep breath and consider the following. This was the veryorganisation that failed to respond in time to the hijacking of four commercialairliners in American airspace over densely populated areas between 8.13am,when communication was lost with Flight 11, and at least 9.38 when Flight 77crashed into the Pentagon. That's aroundan hour and a halfand not one NORADplane was able (so they tell us) to intercept any of the hijacked aircraft in the veryairspace its fantastic technology is specifically there to monitor and protect. Flight77 alone, the one that hit the Pentagon, was in the air for 80 minutes and isofficially reported to have performed a U-turn from its authorised course morethan 40 minutes before impact.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)Another point to emphasise is that the civilian (US government) Federal AviationAdministration, which has a joint response procedure with NORAD to respond tohijackings, is a monumentally corrupt organisation steeped in the culture of thecover-up. I am not referring to most of the employees, nor even those who tell themedia what the high-ups tell them to say. I am speaking of the controlling core ofthe FAA. Rodney Stich, a former navy and airline pilot and crash investigator withthe FAA, has widely documented some of the corruption that he experienceddirectly and through his own investigations. He is the author of the bookUnfriendlySkies14and he reveals the following:•\tFAA management personnel have refused to take action when faced with major airsafety and criminal violations reported by air safety inspectors.•\tFAA management warns federal air safety inspectors not to report air safetyproblems or air safety violations.•\tOfficial government air say reports of major air safety problems and air safetyviolations filed by federal air safety inspectors are destroyed.•\tFAA management harass, threaten and retaliate against federal air safety inspectorswho try to report or carry out the federal government's air safety responsibilities.•\tKey federal air safety inspectors are removed from their government air safety dutiesto stop them from reporting and taking actions on serious air safety problems or airsafety violations."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"216\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.\tFAA management encourages inspectors to ignore major air safety problems byproviding outstanding performance ratings, financial bonuses and promotions tothose inspectors who don't report these problems, while doing the opposite to thoseinspectors who do report the problems and try to address them.\tFAA management has covered up crash-causing air safety misconduct exposed byFAA inspectors who have produced official government reports of corruption withinthe FAA in relation to a series of fatal airline crashes. More than 4,000 pages ofhearing transcript exist supporting charges of corrupt and criminal activities withinthe FAA with regard to a series of fatal airline crashes.15\tAn FAA administrator covered up testimony and dozens of government documentssupporting charges of corruption within the FAA relating to fatal airline crashes,including a United Airlines DC-8 crash into New York City.Stich is also particularly scathing about the management of United Airlines. Hesays that the information about FAA corruption has repeatedly been given to the\"politically appointed\" National Transportation Safety Board, but it had beencovered up and \"fraud-related\" air disasters were allowed to continue. He accusedthe Board of \"falsifying accident reports that covered up for their own duplicity inthe crashes and deaths\".\" Stich cites the FBI, US attorneys and \"the main justiceDepartment personnel\" as other people and government agencies who have beengiven the facts about FAA corruption involving major aircraft disasters, but ignoredit and even retaliated against him and other former federal agents who tried toexpose what was happening. He names the federal judges he says have blocked hisefforts to expose FAA corruption through the courts.\" He tells the same story aboutmembers of Congress who, he says, ignored the documented evidence of \"hard-core corruption\" within the FAA:\"These are the same members of Congress, and the secretary of the Department ofTransportation, whose crocodile tears cover up for the fact that they were repeatedlyoffered evidence of the corruption that resulted in a series of fatal airline crashes, fatalhijackings, and who helped insure the success of the September 11, 2001, terroristhijackers. The cover-up of these matters by members of Congress following theSeptember 11 tragedies will insure the protection of the guilty and continuation of thetragic consequences, as documented for the past 40 years in the books described atthis site.\"18This is the same corrupt network that is telling you what happened when thoseplanes were hijacked on September 11th. It is also the organisation that, with NORADand the Pentagon, was responsible for responding to what happened that day.The case of Payne StewartAn example of the FAA-NORAD reaction procedure can be seen in the case of theprivate Learjet carrying the golfer Payne Stewart and his friends on October 25th1999. Air traffic controllers lost contact with Stewart's plane after it took off from"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•House of cards\t217Orlando in Florida heading for Dallas. When air traffic controllers realised all wasnot well, the FAA contacted NORAD and fighter jets were scrambled to check outwhat was happening. The Learjet had suffered a pressurisation failure and wasflying on autopilot while the real pilot and passengers were unconscious. AnABCNewsreport, quoting the Air Force but differing slightly from the findings of theofficial investigation, said that after contact was initially lost, two F-15s fromTyndall Air Force Base in Florida were sent to track the Learjet. The F-15s pulledback and two F-16s in the air from Florida's Eglin Air Force Base took over. Whenthe Learjet reached the Midwest, the Eglin F-16s withdrew and four F-16s and amid-air refuelling tanker from the Tulsa National Guard replaced them. Finally, twoF-16s from Fargo, North Dakota, moved in close to look into the windows to see ifthe pilot was slumped over and to help clear airspace. \"Officials hoped that the F-16s could provide assistance to anyone on board who might have helped land theplane safely\", said ABC.19When the Learjet ran out of fuel, the F-16 pilots said theysaw the plane fall to the ground. White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said theNational Security Council monitored the doomed flight, fearing the jet might crashin a populated area. President Bill Clinton could have ordered fighters to shootdown the Learjet to avoid that potential tragedy, but Lockhart said no suchrecommendation had been made. Clinton told reporters at the time: \"I am verygrateful for the work the FAA did, and for the two Air Force pilots, and the othersin the Air Force that monitored this plane and made every effort to try to makecontact with it.\";'Another important point to note. If you were \"highly trained\" Arab terroristsfrom this \"brilliantly organised\" network of Osama bin Laden, a network we aretold was capable of hijacking four commercial aircraft at the same time in Americanairspace, one of your obvious and fundamental calculations would be the possibleNORAD reaction time once it was known that the planes had been seized. So whydid they choose to hijack the planes that hit the World Trade Center in Boston witha flight time to New York well in excess of possible NORAD reaction time and whywould they have Flight 77 and 93 fly way out towards the Midwest before turningaround and going all the way back? In the case of Flight 77 it meant that they had tofly for 45 minutes from the time the plane was known to be hijacked to the momentit struck the Pentagon.By anycriteria, and the most minimal study of NORAD andFAA procedures on the Internet, they would have known that Air Force jets wouldbe scrambled. They would also have known that these procedures involved thepossible shooting down of aircraft that threaten US cities. Any idiot putting thisplan together, with the aim of crashing planes into the World Trade Center and thePentagon, would have known that under NORAD's normal, every-other-day,reaction times, they would have to complete the mission as soon as possible. Takingoff from New York and Washington, and crashing them immediately into thosebuildings would have been the ideal plan for them, surely? Instead, Flight 77, whichactually took off from Washington, was allowed to fly away from the city foraround three quarters of an hour before the hijack happened and then had to beflown all the way back! This is clearly ridiculous. But, of course, if those behind the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"218\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.attacks knew that NORAD would not be reacting that day, these details would nolonger be a problem or have to be taken into account when planning the operation.NORAD's no-showWith the fantastic technology available to NORAD and the Cheyenne Mountainoperation in general, reacting to what happened on September 11th should not havebeen a problem. In the past 20 years the technology has been introduced that allowsaircraft to be safely navigated and communicated with from almost anywhere on orabove the earth, thanks to the satellite network known as the Global PositioningSystem (GPS). This was created for use by the US military and, says one article,provides \"incredibly accurate position information to end users\" .21I'll just give youthat again: it provides \"incredibly accurate position information to end users\". Whocontrols this system? NORAD and the rest of the gang at Cheyenne Mountain. Yetthey could not track those hijacked planes and follow what was going on? Besides allthe ground-based and satellite based sensors and surveillance, NORAD also directsthe AWACS aircraft which are in the air 24 hours a day, refuelling from flyingtankers. AWACS (airborne warning and control system) are a modified Boeingairframe from a 707/320 with the 30-foot rotating radar dome on the top. They arethe premier \"air battle command and control\" aircraft in the world today. Theyprovide surveillance to NORAD from the earth's surface to the stratosphere overland and water, and one was involved in the Payne Stewart case.' The AWACS radarhas a range of more than 250 miles (375.5 kilometres) for low-flying targets andfurther for those at higher altitudes. It has a \"friend or foe\" identification system thatcan detect, identify and track friendly or \"enemy\" low-flying aircraft by eliminating\"ground clutter\" that can confuse other radar systems .23There is, to put it mildly, nocredible excuse imaginable for what happened - or rather didn't - on 9 / 11.What should have happenedThe system for what should have happened is made very clear in the officialregulations and procedures of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) .24Chapter7 of the procedures deals with the \"escort of hijacked aircraft\". It says that an FAA\"hijack coordinator\" on duty at the Washington DC headquarters will request themilitary to provide an escort aircraft for a confirmed hijacked plane to: (a) assurepositive flight following (that's staying on the authorised course to you and me); (b)report unusual observances; and (c) aid search and rescue in the event of anemergency. The escort service, say the regulations, will be requested by the FAAhijack coordinator by direct contact with the National Military Command Center(NMCC) at the Pentagon. Normally NORAD escort aircraft will take the requiredaction, it says. \"The center/control tower shall coordinate with the designatedNORAD ... military unit advising of the hijack aircraft's location, direction of flight,altitude, type of aircraft and recommended flight plan to intercept the hijackaircraft\", the document instructs. Escort aircraft are told to position themselves fivemiles directly behind the hijacked plane and to approach it from the rear to avoid thepossibility of being observed. The escort plane should take the same altitude, speed"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•House of cards\t219and heading as the hijacked aircraft. When a hijacking happens within thecontinental United States, say the procedures, the \"appropriate NORAD ... SeniorDirector\" is forwarded reports of the aircraft's call sign of position of latitude andlongitude, heading, speed and altitude. An escort mission can be terminated by FAAheadquarters, the National Military Command Center at the Pentagon or majormilitary command authority - in other words NORAD.25Air traffic controllers can,through the Federal Aviation Administration, call for military planes to escort or\"intercept\" a commercial aircraft if contact is lost with the pilot, the plane strays fromits designated course or anything inexplicable is happening. In 2000, NORADscrambled jets 125 times in such circumstances. An intercept does not require theapproval of the President or some high-up government official. It is a routineresponse to check what is going on and who is flying the plane. The intention is notto blow the plane from the sky, which would have needed presidential approval or,since 9/11, the approval of the head of NORAD and other designated military chiefs.There is an agreed procedure and code for communicating between interceptingNORAD jets and the commercial aircraft. For example:\"Rocking wings from a position slightly above and ahead of, and normally to the left of, theintercepted aircraft and, after acknowledgement, a slow level turn, normally to the left, on tothe desired heading = You have been intercepted, follow me; circling aerodrome, loweringlanding gear and over flying runway in direction of landing ... = Land at this aerodrome.\"26There is, likewise, a series of coded replies for the other aircraft. If the hijackedplane does not follow these orders, the interceptor can \"make a pass in front of theaircraft\" and eventually \"fire tracer rounds in the airplane's path\" or \"down it witha missile\", according to Marine Corps Major Mike Snyder, a NORAD spokesmanquoted in theBoston Globe.27He also confirmed that fighters' intercepting aircraftwas \"routine\". For example, after 9 / 11 when a small private Cessna flew near toPresident Bush's ranch at Crawford, Texas, the Federal Aviation Administrationactivated a response through NORAD and two jets were dispatched immediately.They tuned to the pilot's frequency and ordered him to land. Another similarincident was reported in Wood County, Texas, where Rodney Mize, the Sheriff'ssenior Dispatcher, confirmed that a private plane carrying four reporters from theHouston Chroniclewas forced down by two military pilots in A-10 Warthog jets.They flew above and below the plane and it landed at Wisener Field near Mineola.28Bush's ranch, it seems, is far more important than the Pentagon and the WorldTrade Center. Such incidents are happening week after week as the Federal AviationAdministration and NORAD activate the response system.The hijack procedureIf a problem with an aircraft is considered a possible hijack by the air trafficcontroller a much higher level of command is activated. FAA spokeswoman, AlisonDuquette, explained: \"The air traffic controller would notify the supervisor on thefloor, who would then immediately notify the FAA's regional operation center who"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"220\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.would notify NORAD, as well as others.\"29In these cases, according the regulations:\"The escort service will be requested by the FAA hijack coordinator by direct contactwith the National Military Command Center (NMCC) [based at the Pentagon].\"30The Defense Department (DOD) manual covering plane hijackings says: \"In theevent of a hijacking, the NMCC will be notified by the most expeditious means bythe FAA. The NMCC will, with the exception of immediate responses ... forwardrequests for DOD assistance to the Secretary of Defense for approval.\"31Itwasbecause of this procedure that, according to CNN \"... officers on [sic] the Joint Chiefswere monitoring the [Payne Stewart] Learjet on radar screens inside the Pentagon'sNational Military Command Center\".32Federal Aviation Administration regulationsleave air traffic controllers in no doubt that they must never take chances. They aretold that if there is an unexpected loss of radar or radio communication they mustconsider that \"an aircraft emergency exists\"...33and... \"If ... you are in doubt that asituation constitutes an emergency or potential emergency, handle it as though itwere an emergency.\"34Within Cheyenne Mountain at the NORAD headquarters isthe Air Defense Liaison Officer, a top FAA official, who is there to coordinatebetween the FAA and NORAD in these situations. All these personnel andprocedures were in place on September 11th. Yet look at what happened.The NORAD timelineI asked both NORAD and the FAA for the sequence of events and the timeline forwhat occurred that morning. Both say that only at 8.40am did the FAA notifyNORAD that American Airlines Flight 11 had been hijacked. Yet contact was lostwith the aircraft at 8.13 and at the very latest, by 8.20, it was clear that somethingserious was wrong. We should know why it took up to 27 minutes, according to theofficial story, for Air Traffic Control through the FAA to alert NORAD. TheNew YorkTimesreported that Flight 11 maintained its authorised course for only 16 minutesafter take-off and \"just past Worcester, Mass., instead of taking a southerly turn, theBoeing 767 swung to the north at 8.15. It had been taken over ...\"35Let's give thecontrollers another five minutes before they were sure the aircraft was in trouble.This still means that the FAA waited 20 minutes from the point of confirmed lostcontact to report that a commercial airliner was not responding to instructions andhad changed course with a deactivated transponder over an area of high populationand in skies criss-crossed by intensive air traffic. I asked the FAA to confirm whenexactly it was known that Flight 11 was in trouble and why it took so long to contactNORAD. The FAA spokesman would not answer.I repeat, the Federal Aviation Administration regulations instruct air trafficcontrollers that if there is an unexpected loss of radar or radio communication theymust consider that \"an aircraft emergency exists\"... and ...\"If ... you are in doubtthat a situation constitutes an emergency or potential emergency, handle it as thoughitwere an emergency.\" This could not be clearer. For goodness sake, the official storysays that at 8.24am the controller heard from the cockpit of Flight 11: \"We have someplanes. Just stay quiet and you will be OK. We are returning to the airport. Nobodymove.\" That is said to have happened 16 minutes before we are told the FAA alerted"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•House of cards\t221NORAD that the plane had been hijacked! The transponder was switched off at 8.20- 20 minutes before NORAD was informed, we are asked to believe. Let us not forgetthat through all of this the Air Force was constantly monitoring the commercial airtraffic system as it does 24 hours a day. This has to be done to prevent collisionsbetween commercial and Air Force planes. Flight attendant Betty Ong is said to haveused a seatback phone to call an American Airlines reservations agent, whocontacted the system operations control centre in Fort Worth. Betty is said to havemade that call at 8.27 - 13 minutes before NORAD says it was told of the hijack.Even five minutes before the first alleged contact with NORAD, controllers areclaimed to have heard another cockpit transmission that said: \"Nobody move please.We are going back to the airport. Don't try to make any stupid moves.\" This FAA-NORAD timeline therefore is simply ridiculous. NORAD says it scrambled fighterjets from the Otis Air National Guard Base on Cape Cod in Massachusets at 8.46, sixminutes after it says it was told of the hijack. At the very time they were taking off,according to the NORAD timeline, Flight 11 was crashing into the north tower. An F-15 departing from Otis can reach New York City in 10 to 12 minutes, according to anOtis spokeswoman, and can fly three times the speed of a 767.36If you take it to be 10minutes that means the jets would be flying at around 918 miles per hour, wellwithin their top speed. A NORAD spokesman, however, quoted the speed of thescrambled F-15s to me at only between 603 and 675 miles per hour. Why not faster?One of the pilots, named only as \"Duff\", told the BBC \"documentary\"Clear The Skieson September 1st 2002 that they did fly supersonic and this statement added to thecontradictions emerging from different spokesmen for the US military.But wait. It gets sillier. The Pentagon told CNN that NORAD was \"informed ofthe plane striking the World Trade Center at 8.47\".Informed?We are talking aboutthe most sophisticated military surveillance operation on the planet which, in itsown words, is \"the largest and most complex command and control network in theworld\", utilising a vast network of satellites and cutting-edge-air tracking andsurveillance technology. Cheyenne Mountain can tell you if a missile has beenlaunched on the other side of the world and it has to be \"informed\" that acommercial airliner it claims it has already belatedly scrambled jets to intercept hashit the World Trade Center? It's insane. We are told that at 8.52, two F-15 Eaglestook off from Otis base on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, 185 miles from New York, tointercept the second hijacked plane from Boston: Flight 175. About ten minuteslater, at 9.03, Flight 175 smashed into the south tower with the F-15s still 70 milesaway, so they tell us. One other point is that the World Trade Center is said by oneof its first tenants to be a \"No Fly Zone\". If that is so, there has to be a system of airresponse very close to New York, otherwise the No Fly Zone would beunenforceable. What would be the point of it? Ken Smith, a tenant of the WorldTrade Center back in 1979, said on Radio Free America that when he was there itwas well known by tenants that the WTC was a No Fly Zone. Smith said that anyplane off-course within 12 miles of the WTC was given a warning to changedirection and he added: \"If you came within five miles they would threaten to shootyou down. If you came within three miles, they could shoot you down.\"37"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"222\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want.

The official timelinesays that the FAA notified NORAD at 9.24am (usually reported as 9.25) that UnitedAirlines Flight 77 from Dulles Airport at Washington DC to Los Angeles may havebeen hijacked. Yet it was known before 9 o'clock that there was a problem with theplane. As I've mentioned earlier, radar reports published by USATodaysuggest thatFlight 77 took a massive detour off-course in a north to west to south loop overWest Virginia before returning to course for a short time(Figure 15).This course isvery different from the routes published by the rest of the media and could, I guess,be a mistake. If it was, however, it was a massive one.USATodaysource their routeto Flight Explorer, a company that tracks commercial aircraft in real time on theInternet using data supplied by the Federal Aviation Administration. I contactedFlight Explorer and asked for confirmation, or otherwise, of theUSATodaygraphic.Figure 15:The USA Today version of the route of\tFigure 16:The other version of Flight 77 publishedFlight 77\telsewhere in the mediaThey sent me a course that did not include such a blatant detour(Figure 16), sotakeyour pick. If the\"USAToday\"detour did happen, it would have been at around 8.36going by the Flight Explorer timeline. This was at least 16 minutes after it wasknown that Flight 11 had been hijacked, but no action was taken about Flight 77deviating wildly from its course, if that is what occurred. This continued to be thecase even after Flight 11 had smashed into the World Trade Center and it wasknown that Flight 175 had also been hijacked and crashed into the other tower. Iasked the FAA what happened when, according toUSAToday,Flight 77 looped offcourse before returning to the scheduled route because, obviously, I wanted toestablish the truth about the course taken by the plane. Did it loop or did it not? If itdid, what action had been taken at that time? What communications were madewith the cockpit to establish what was going on? The FAA would not answer me,saying I had all the information it could give. TheNew York Timespublished what itclaimed was a partial transcript of the communication tapes between Flight 77 andair traffic controllers.

The plane then did a 180-degree turn near the Ohioborder and headed back towards Washington, butstillno alert even with twohijacked planes buried in the World Trade Center and with controllers apparentlyunable to locate Flight 77 on their radar screens for ten minutes. Only at 9.24 wasNORAD told by the FAA that Flight 77 was in serious trouble, both organisationstold me. AsaNew York Timesreport said: \"By 9.25am the FAA, in consultation withthe Pentagon, had taken the radical step of banning all take-offs around the country,but fighters still had not been dispatched.\"39This was some 40 minutes after Flight77 dramatically changed course and Flight 11 crashed into the World Trade Center;itwas at least 35 minutes after air traffic controllers knew that Flight 77 had beenhijacked; 24 minutes after the transponder signal was lost; 22 minutes after Flight175 hit the World Trade Center; and 18 minutes after air traffic control facilitiesthroughout the country knew that Flight 77 had likely been hijacked. Yet look at theFAA regulations again for air traffic controllers: \"Consider that an aircraftemergency exists ... when: ... There is unexpected loss of radar contact and radiocommunications with any ... aircraft\"4°and \"If ... you are in doubt that a situationconstitutes an emergency or potential emergency, handle it as though it were anemergency.\"41MSNBC reported the day after 9/11 on how seriously air trafficcontrollers and their bosses at the FAA are supposed to take aircraft that deviatefrom their agreed route:\"If a plane deviates by 15 degrees, or two miles from that course, the flight controllerswill hit the panic button. They'll call the plane, saying 'American 11, you're deviatingfrom course.' It's considered a real emergency, like a police car screeching down ahighway at 100 miles an hour. When golfer Payne Stewart's incapacitated Learjetmissed a turn at a fix, heading north instead of west to Texas, F-16 interceptors werequickly dispatched.\"42Itwas at 8.50am that contact was lost with the cockpit of Flight 77. At thatmoment the flight would have been under the control of the Indianapolis Air RouteTraffic Control Center, one of 20 regional centres that track flights betweenairports.\" At 9.02, still 40 minutes before impact with the Pentagon, a controller isreported to have told American Airlines the latest news on Flight 77: \"We lost trackcontrol of the guy, he's in coast track but we haven't - we don't really know wherehis target is and we can't get a hold of him.\"44Yet it was only at 9.24 that NORADwas told that Flight77 \"may\"have been hijacked? Oh do come on, this is the landof clouds and cuckoos. AsaNewsdayreport pointed out: \"The record suggests thatteenagers on instant-message networks communicate faster than some federalofficials did during the crisis.\"45Or as theNew York Timesput it:. .despite elaborate plans that link civilian and military efforts to control the nation'sairspace in defense of the country, and despite two other jetliners' having already hit the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•House of cards\t227World Trade Center in New York, the fighter planes that scrambled into protective orbitsaround Washington did not arrive until 15 minutes after Flight 77 hit the Pentagon.\"\"But even beyond all this, there is a more fundamental question that needs to beanswered. Why, when two hijacked airliners had been crashed into the World TradeCenter weren't fighter jets deployed immediately to guard the skies overWashington? Surely the first thing you would do after what happened in New Yorkis to instigate air defence for your other most likely targets - Washington being themost obvious.Air traffic controllers mystifiedTheMiami Heraldtalked to air traffic controllers who said they could notunderstand why there was no reaction to what was happening in the skies thatmorning.\" Why no reaction from the FAA and the military? \"That's a questionthat more and more people are going to ask,\" one controller in Miami told theHerald.\"What the hell went on here? Was anyone doing anything about it? Just asa national defense thing, how are they able to fly around and no one go afterthem?\"\" TheHeraldquoted controllers who said that even with the transpondersilent, the plane would have been visible on radar both to controllers who handlecross-continent air traffic and to a Federal Aviation Administration commandcentre outside of Washington. The FAA would not discuss with theMiami Heraldthe track of Flight 77 or what happened in air-control centres while it was inflight, and nor would American Airlines. Air traffic controllers told theHeraldthatthe trouble should have been instantly noticeable. Flight 77, like all such planes,would have first showed up on radar screens as a short solid line, theHeraldreported, with a readout that identifies the plane and gives its altitude and speed.When the transponder shuts down, the short line vanishes. The speed numbergoes away too. \"It's just something that catches your eye\", one controller said.\"The first move when a transponder goes down would be to contact the pilot andtell him the transponder wasn't working. But even if the plane remained silent,controllers could still find it - by switching their screen display to the old-fashioned radar that bounces a signal off the plane's metal skin, theHeraldsaid.The report went on:\"Military jets are routinely scrambled in the case of hijackings and \"runners,\" planesthat do not answer or do not heed air traffic controllers. But FAA officials would not saywhen controllers detected the errant Flight 77 or whether any fighter jets were able toget into the air to confront it. Fighter jets are based nearby, in Virginia, and could havereached the White House within minutes, aviation sources say ...\"... The FAA has a detailed hijacking manual: Supervisors are notified. The FAAcommand center near Washington and the FBI are put on alert. Military jets arescrambled to follow the plane.

He said: \"The secret service has an arrangement with the FAA.They had open lines after the World Trade Center was ...\" He didn't finish thesentence, no doubt because he realised he had said too much, and it is worthpondering the wider implications of that statement. The FAA had open lines withthe secret service after the World Trade Center was hit? That happened at 8.46,about the time that Flight 77 was known to be in trouble, and yet the FAA saidthey did not tell NORAD and the Pentagon Command Center about Flight 77until 9.24 when they had already established open lines to the secret service. Arewe being told that the Pentagon and NORAD did not have open lines also withthe FAA and were able to follow in real time the communications and non-communications from the cockpits long before a single fighter jet was deployed?Indeed the FAA and NORAD have both confirmed to me that they had open linesto discuss Flights 77 and 93, the one that crashed in Pennsylvania. I asked theFAA when exactly these open lines were established, but its spokesman wouldnot say. Surely in any sane system these would have been established, as Cheneyindicated, at least from the moment the first plane struck the World Trade Center.So, again, why the delay in responding?We are told that after contact was lost with Flight 77 and its transponder wasdeactivated, an \"unidentified\" aircraft was eventually picked up on radar headingforWashington at some 500 miles an hour and this turned out to be Flight 77.Unidentified? Have you seen the tracking technology available to NORAD andCheyenne Mountain? Even when a transponder is turned off the plane can still betracked by conventional radar, let alone by the technology those guys have. Ataround 9.27, NORAD says it ordered jets scrambled from Langley Air Force Basein Virginia (the base of the CIA's own fleet of military aircraft) to intercept Flight77. Before becoming head of NORAD, General Ralph Eberhart was Commander,Air Combat Command, at Langley. At 9.35, it is said, three F-16 Fighting Falconstook off from Langley for Washington. Note the approximately eight minutes'response time before they were in the air in this official story when the Air Forceapparently claims response times of scramble to 29,000 feet in two and a halfminutes.52An F-16 has a top speed of some 1,800 miles an hour, twice the speed ofsound. At 9.37, Flight 77 was \"lost from radar screens\", the story goes, and aminute later hit the Pentagon, precisely 60 years to the day since construction ofthat building began on September 11th 1941, the year of Pearl Harbor. TheNORAD jets arrived at 9.49, so we are told. Shucks, just missed again. Whatterrible bad luck. These jets flew at speeds of about \".9 mach\" or just below thespeed of sound, according to information given to me by NORAD spokesmanBarry Venable, who, I must say, was extremely thorough and efficient in hisdealings with me.53He said that .9 mach is between 603 and 675 miles per hour"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•House of cards\t229depending on the altitude the planes were flying. The higher they fly the fasterthey go. Of course, their top speed of 1,800 miles an hour is not possible over landat lower altitudes, but less than the speed of sound for aircraft capable of twicethe speed of sound might legitimately be questioned here when they werepursuing a hijacked airliner heading for the US capital after two others had beencrashed into the World Trade Center. Barry Venable quoted similar speeds for theplanes NORAD says were scrambled from Otis Air Force Base, but an Otisspokesman quoted by the localCape Cod Timessaid the 153 miles from there toNew York can be made by an F-15 in as little as ten minutes - that's around 918miles per hour. At that speed the 130 miles from Langley to Washington would becompleted in around eight minutes. This speed would have put jets from Langleyover the Pentagon at about 9.38/39 - just as Flight 77 was turning in to crash andnot \"12 minutes [or] 105 miles\" away as the NORAD timelines says they were atthe time of impact.A commercial airliner can fly from Washington to Ohio, turn back and fly all theway from the Midwest to cross a No Fly Zone and crash into the headquarters ofthe most powerful military force on earth without a military response worth thename? Vice President Dick Cheney even told the NBCMeet the Pressprogrammes'that: \"It doesn't do any good to put up a combat air patrol if you don't give theminstructions to act, if, in fact, they feel it's appropriate.\" He says this to divertattention from the fact that this is precisely what is happening every week in theskies of North America. You can check out and intercept (\"stop, deflect, or interruptthe progress or intended course of\")\" an aircraft without shooting it down, forgoodness sake. Again this was Cheney's attempt to mislead people from the centralquestions that will unleash the genie.Why not Andrews?Langley is around 130 miles from Washington so why did NORAD say it scrambledjets from that far away when Andrews Air Force Base, the one designated to defendWashington DC, is only a little over ten miles from the capital and pilots from therecould have had breakfast and still intercepted Flight 77 with time to spare? This iseven allowing for the fact that NORAD only activated interception proceduressome 34 minutes after contact with the plane was lost. Andrews Air Force Base is aminute or so by fighter jet from Washington DC and that's why it is the capital'sfirst line of air defence (see map,Figure 17 overleaf ).In the name of sanity, theairspace above the Pentagon and the White House is a No Fly Zone and of coursethere are going to be squadrons on standby at the nearest Air Force base to defendthat.Andrews is one of the most famous bases in America because it is the home ofAir Force One, the President's plane, and foreign heads of state often pass throughthere. Again, are you going to locate the presidential plane at a base that does nothave fighters that are ready to move at a moment's notice? Andrews, in fact, hastwo major squadrons on what are officially termed the highest possible state ofreadiness.

The fact that these planes were not scrambled from Andrews at any timebefore impact with the Pentagon is stunning. The Andrews AFB website wentdown immediately after September 11th and did not reappear until around mid -November.56When it came back online it no longer had a link to the Air Force webpages describing the capabilities and mission of 113th Fighter Wing of the AirNational Guard at Andrews - the capability of reacting immediately to any threatby air to Washington.57A website calleddcmiltary.comis authorised to supply information to thoseemployed by US forces. It reported before 9/11 (although I haven't been able to findthe web page since) that Andrews is the base for the 121st Fighter Squadron, 113thFighter Wing, and it confirmed its role: \"... as part of its dual mission, the 113thprovides capable and ready response forces for the District of Columbia in the eventof a natural disaster or civil emergency.

The F16 is the ninth different type of fighter in the wing's 44-year history.\"And look at how it completes this piece of self-congratulation:\"Throughout its existence, the men and women of the DC Air National Guard have beenand will continue to be a vital part of the community and the total force. They standready to respond to the needs of the District of Columbia - and the nation - should theneed arise.\" [Except on September 11th]60The DC Air National Guard even calls itself the \"Capital Guardians\"! Before9/11, although not it seems afterwards, they made their mission crystal clear whenthey claimed to ...\"provide combat units in the highest possible state of readiness\".So where on earth were they on September 11th when a commercial airliner flewback towards Washington, for 45 minutes after Air Traffic Control lost contact, tocrash a minute's flying time from Andrews AFB? It was not the fault of the pilotswho, I'm sure, are utterly bewildered at what happened. It is the highest level of themilitary and government that we have to focus on - those with the power to decidenot to deploy from Andrews.

Defense officials won't saywhether that has changed.\"62Not even NORAD claims there were no fighters atAndrews, and what kind of journalism is it that prints this story when the truth isonly a \"Netfind\" away? The sameUSA Todayedition also said in directcontradiction: \"The District of Columbia National Guard maintained fighter planesat Andrews Air Force Base, only about 15 miles [sic] from the Pentagon, but thoseplanes were not on alert and not deployed.\"63TheSan Diego Union-Tribune,however, told the truth about Andrews when it reported:\"Air defense around Washington is provided mainly by fighter planes from Andrews AirForce Base in Maryland near the District of Columbia border. The DC Air National Guardis also based there and equipped with F-16 fighter planes, a National Guard spokesmansaid. But the fighters took to the skies over Washington only after the devastatingattack on the Pentagon...\"64Other media sources also reported that fighters from Andrews AFB weredeployed over Washington. NBCNightly Newssaid: \"It was after the attack on thePentagon that the Air Force then decided to scramble F-16s out of the DC NationalGuard Andrews Air Force Base to fly a protective cover over Washington, DC.\"65The UKDaily Telegraphsaid: \"Within minutes of the attack [on the Pentagon]American forces around the world were put on one of their highest states of alert -Defcon 3, just two notches short of all-out war - and F-16s from Andrews Air ForceBase were in the air over Washington DC.\"66A \"former Pentagon Air TrafficController\" quoted, but not named, is said to have commented:\"All those years ago when I was in the Pentagon, this wouldn't have happened. AirTraffic Control Radar images were (and are) available in the understructures of thePentagon, and any commercial flight within 300 miles of DC that made an abruptcourse change toward Washington, turned off their transponder, and refused tocommunicate with ATC, would have been intercepted at supersonic speeds within a maxof 9 minutes by a fighter out of Andrews. Period. Why these planes weren't, baffles me.If we could get fighters off the ground in two minutes then, we could now.\"67And yet a Pentagon spokesman, Rear Admiral Craig Quigley, made thisastonishing statement: \"Planes come up and down the Potomac all the time. Youcan hear them in the building. There was no warning.\"' John A. Koskinen, theWashington DC City Administrator, said the District was \"largely helpless\" to stopsuch attacks.' Utter garbage."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Alice in wonderland and the world Trade Centre Disaster•House of cards\t233What happened to flight 93?United Airlines Flight 93 from Newark, New Jersey, to San Francisco was, we aretold, reported to NORAD as a possible hijack at 9.16am. This was about around 16minutes after the aircraft is thought to have been taken over. At 9.35am Flight 93filed a new flight plan and headed for Washington. I asked the FAA who in thecockpit filed that plan and what exchange took place between air traffic control, butthe spokesman said he could give me no information on this. At 9.40, it is claimed,the transponder signal stopped and \"radar contact was lost\". This is nonsense. Weare talking NORAD and Cheyenne Mountain here and, like the FAA system, theycan still track a plane after the transponder has been switched off. At approximately10.03 according to the NORAD timeline (anything up to 10.37 according to others),Flight 93 \"crashed\" near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and the NORAD timeline saysthat no fighter jet was within 100 miles of the plane when it went down. By 10.03, ifwe take the NORAD version, it was an hour and 11 minutes since fighters are saidto have been scrambled from Otis AFB to New York and 50 minutes since Flight 93was reported to NORAD as a possible hijack. My own feeling is that at least one jetdid get to Flight 93 on this occasion and may well have shot down the aircraft. I willelaborate on the background later.What a shamblesThe FAA-NORAD-Pentagon response procedure in these circumstances could notbe clearer in the official regulations. Equally clear is that on September 11th, on thatday of all days, that response was a disgrace. I do not believe for a second that thisis unconnected to the fact that the Illuminati, working through US governmentagencies, wanted the attacks of September 11th to happen as they did. Somewherein that normal line of response from the FAA's air traffic control through to thePentagon and the scrambling of NORAD jets a spanner was thrown in the works toslow down the reaction times. If you accept that the FAA and NORAD timelines arecorrect, the FAA is an organisation that has some serious questions to answer, butwon't. I asked the FAA media spokesman Fraser Jones the following questions:1.Ihave been going through the timeline you sent to me and I have somequestions. I asked when there was first known to be a problem with the fourflights and in answer to that you gave me the times that the FAA informedNORAD. These are not the same times as when a problem was firstidentified. Could I have the times when problems were first identified?2.Flight 11 failed to respond to the air traffic controller at 8.13 and yet both theFAA and NORAD say that the FAA did not inform NORAD of a problemuntil 8.40.Why a delay of 27 minutes?3.Flight 77 failed to respond to air traffic control at 8.50am and six minutes laterthe transponder was turned off ... yet both NORAD and the FAA say that the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"234\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.FAA did not inform NORAD of a problem until 9.24. Why the delay of 34minutes, especially when, by 9.03am, two planes had crashed into the WorldTrade Center?4.Before Flight 77 turned around it made a detour off course in a north-west-south loop over West Virginia [according to USAToday]before returningbriefly to its agreed route. Why was this ignored?5.At what time exactly did the FAA and NORAD establish open lines to discussFlight 77 and Flight 93?6.NORAD has told me that the FAA is responsible for policing No Fly Zoneslike the one over Washington and New York. What is the procedure the FAAhas for doing this, what aircraft does it use and where are they based, and.what happened on September 11th when there was no response? If the FAAdoesn't have planes, then who does? What is the point of a No Fly Zone ifthere is nothing to defend it?Mr Jones replied that he had already provided \"all the info\" he had for questionsone to five (none of which gave me an answer to any of them). For question six hesaid: \"The FAA monitors prohibited airspace and would be aware if a pilotblundered into such an area. Our mission is not civil defense. We would helpcoordinate the appropriate response given the circumstances\".\" What on earth doesthat mean? NORAD told me that it is not responsible for policing the No Fly Zoneover Washington and it was a matter for the civilian FAA. The FAA tells me it\"monitors prohibited airspace\" and would be aware if a pilot blundered into suchan area and would then help to coordinate the appropriate response in thecircumstances. Oh really well take your time, no rush. How long does it take for aplane to enter restricted airspace over Washington before it parks itself in the WhiteHouse, Capitol Hill, or the Pentagon? Seconds. So where would the immediate airor ground-to-air response come from? Langley AFB 130 miles away? What the helluse would that be? Now the FAA and NORAD are either not telling me the truth orthere is no system for protecting No Fly Zones. One or the other must be the casegiven what they have both said. I asked Fraser Jones whom the FAA would contactwhen the No Fly Zone threatened to be breached and they \"coordinate theappropriate response in the circumstances\", but I received no reply. Couldn't beAndrews AFB and the DC Air National Guard could it?Military special operations commander was head of FAA \"security\"The head of security for the FAA on September 11th was Michael Canavan, whoresigned after only 10 months in the job shortly after the attacks. Canavan is aretired US Army lieutenant general, who had been Chief of Staff of the USEuropean Command in Stuttgart, Germany. Canavan has a considerablebackground in US Special Operations, which, according to the Department of"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•House of cards\t235Defense's Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, are defined as: \"Operationsconducted by specially organized, trained, and equipped military and paramilitaryforces to achieve military, political, economic or psychological objectives byunconventional means in hostile, denied or politically sensitive areas.\" In short:operations that are above the law and off the record. Canavan was CommandingGeneral, Special Operations Command, Europe, and Commanding General, JointSpecial Operations Command, at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. In July 2002, themilitary announced that four soldiers with Special Forces based at Fort Bragg hadmurdered their wives and three of the men had recently returned from Afghanistan.Two had also killed themselves and the other two had been charged with murder.The military said the murders were \"not stress related\". This is the same Fort Braggthat provided several officers from its US Army 4th Psychological Operations(PSYOPS) Group to work in the news division at CNN's headquarters in Atlanta inthe final days of the Kosovo War, according to media reports, and also staffed theNational Security Council's Office of Public Diplomacy (OPD), a shadowygovernment propaganda agency that planted stories in the US media supportingthe Reagan-Bush Administration's policies in Central America. TheMiami HeraldofJuly 19th 1987 quoted a \"senior US official\" as describing the OPD as a \"vastpsychological warfare operation of the kind the military conducts to influence apopulation in enemy territory.\" These are the sorts of operations that MichaelCanavan, the head of FAA security on September 11th, would have been involvedwith in his high positions in Special Operations Command.What is absolutely clear is that the FAA's response to the hijackings that morningwas bizarre, and this happened in what must be the best-defended airspace in theworld. Let us consider again the capabilities detailed in the official websites of theFAA's partners in policing US airspace, NORAD and Cheyenne Mountain:\tThe NORAD Command Center at Cheyenne Mountain is responsible for\"monitoring, processing, and interpreting missile, space or air events whichcould have operational impacts on our forces or capabilities, or could bepotential threats to North America or US and allied forces overseas.\"So why noton September 11th?\tCheyenne Mountain serves as a central collection and coordination facility for aworldwide system of sensors designed to provide ... the leadership of Canadaand the US with an accurate picture of any aerospace threat.\"So why not onSeptember 11th?The Command Centre is linked directly to the National Command Authorities ofboth the US and Canada as well as to regional command centres overseas.

The active role is played secretly bypermitting it to happen. This is the greatest single clue. Who has the power to calloff or reduce the usual security precautions?\" He could not have put it better inrelation to 9/11. The FAA and NORAD are not the only ones who have someserious questions to answer.

Myers officially tookover as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Before his appointment to thePentagon as Deputy Chairman in 2000, he was the Commander of NORAD. Myers,therefore, knew precisely what the procedures were for reacting to unexplainedhappenings with planes in North American airspace.As we have seen, Federal Aviation Administration regulations say: \"The escortservice will be requested by the FAA hijack coordinator by direct contact with theNational Military Command Center (NMCC)\". The NMCC is based at thePentagon, headquarters of the Joint Chiefs, and the Department of Defense's ownmanual says that: \"In the event of a hijacking, the National Military CommandCenter will be notified by the most expeditious means by the Federal AviationAdministration. The NMCC will, with the exception of immediate responses ...forward requests for DOD [Department of Defense] assistance to the Secretary ofDefense for approval.\" This is the same National Military Command Center thatclaims it had no warning that an airliner was about to crash into its own buildingsome 45 minutes after it deviated off course! Where was General Myers while allthis was going on and what were the top brass in the Pentagon doing all thistime? What was Defense Secretary Rumsfeld doing? Where was President Bush?Myers knew the response procedures. He knew that Andrews AFB around tenmiles down the road had all that was necessary to respond to Flight 77 as itheaded for Washington. Yet nothing was done. TheNew York Timestried toexplain what was happening at the Pentagon that morning:\"During the hour or so that American Airlines Flight 77 was under the control ofhijackers, up to the moment it struck the west side of the Pentagon, military officials ina command center on the east side of the building were urgently talking to lawenforcement and air traffic control officials about what to do.\"(No, you didn't misread that.)240"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Where were you on 9/11 ?\t241\"But despite elaborate plans that link civilian and military efforts to control the nation'sairspace in defense of the country, and despite two other jetliners' having already hitthe World Trade Center in New York, the fighter planes that scrambled into protectiveorbits around Washington did not arrive until 15 minutes after Flight 77 hit thePentagon.\"1What? Military chiefs in the Pentagon command centre were \"urgently talkingabout what to do?\" Uh? These are the guys who are supposed to protect the UnitedStates from nuclear attack! \"Er, now there's a missile heading for us gentlemen thatwill end life in America as we know it. This is due to land on this building in twominutes, now what do you think we should do?\" If they were talking to air trafficofficials (FAA) during the hour in question why no response from NORAD? Whyare we told that NORAD, which is under Pentagon command, was not alertedabout Flight 77 until 9.24 when the Pentagon command centre was \"urgentlytalking to law enforcement and air traffic control officials about what to do\" for \"thehour or so that American Airlines Flight 77 was under the control of the hijackers\"?Given what had happened in New York why weren't planes scrambled to patrol theskies over Washington as a matter of course anyway? General Myers told his Senateconfirmation hearing when he became Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that hepledged \"...to keep our armed forces at that razor's edge\"! A Pentagon spokesman,Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Vic Warzinski, even had the audacity to tellNewsdaythat: \"The Pentagon was simply not aware that this aircraft was coming our way...\"2The Cheyenne Mountain official website says of the NORAD CommandCenter: \"Redundant and survivable communications hot lines connect theCommand Center to the Pentagon, White House, US Strategic Command, CanadianForces Headquarters in Ottawa, other aerospace defense system command posts,and major military centers around the world.\"' And the Pentagon didn't know thata hijacked plane heading for its own city for more than 45 minutes was coming itsway?? CNN reported that while Payne Stewart's plane was flying on auto pilot \"...officers on [sic] the joint Chiefs were monitoring the Learjet on radar screens insidethe Pentagon's National Military Command Center\".' Of course they were, that'swhat they are supposed to do. Why are we told they did not do this on September11th when four planes were hijacked, and that they didn't know one was heading intheir direction? It is an insult to the intelligence. CNN also quoted officials at thePentagon as saying they were never made aware of the threat from hijacked UnitedAirlines Flight 93 until after it crashed in Pennsylvania.' Reports say that theFederal Aviation Administration informed NORAD at 9.16am that Flight 93 mayhave been hijacked and the transponder was turned off at 9.40, although NORADand the FAA both told me that open lines between them were established to discussFlight 93. There is no way that the Pentagon's National Military Command Centerwith open lines to the FAA and NORAD was not told of the hijack of Flight 93 untilit crashed after 10am. The Pentagon's entire story is nonsense, of course it is, and itis designed to hide the simple truth - at the highest levels of power within the USgovernment and military these attacks were being allowed to happen."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"242\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon on the west side of what is the biggest officecomplex in the world. This is the opposite side of the building to where the mainoffices of Donald Rumsfeld and the military top brass and the National MilitaryCommand Center are located. The targeted section had been the first of five toundergo renovations and strengthening to protect the Pentagon from terroristattacks. Yet this is the very section these \"highly trained, highly professional\"terrorists aimed for?? Such is the size and strength of the Pentagon that Rumsfeldsaid that he only felt a \"jarring thing\" when the plane hit.6If you were really acrazed Islamic fanatic dedicated to attacking the \"Great Satan America\", whywould you aim the plane at the very opposite side of a 29-acre, six million-square-foot building to where your real targets are? The same reason why TimothyMcVeigh parked the Ryder truck as far away as possible from his alleged target, theoffices of the ATF, I guess.Where was Myers?General Myers was Acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on September 11thin the absence abroad of the outgoing General Hugh Shelton. Myers would beconfirmed as Shelton's successor at a Senate hearing only two days later. Chairmanof the Joint Chiefs is the highest-ranking uniformed military post and third incommand of US forces with only the president and the defense secretary above himin the line of command. Surely this is a man who would have been at the centre ofevents with America \"under attack\" from terrorists. Where was Myers while all hellwas breaking loose in those two horrific hours? It turns out, and I'm not kidding,that he was having a meeting with Senator Max Cleland of Georgia on Capitol Hill.I think its best if you sit down while you read the following, and breathing deeplymight help too. This is Myers' account of his movements that morning described inan interview with the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service:\"I remember it was like watching a bad movie. I was on Capitol Hill. I was about readyto meet with Senator Cleland. I was meeting with him in preparation for my hearing, myconfirmation hearing to be the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. And I rememberbefore we walked in there was a TV that was playing and somebody has said, 'Anairplane has hit one of the World Trade Center towers'. They thought it was an airplane,and they thought it was a small airplane or something like that. So we walked in and wedid the office call with Senator Cleland.\"The highest-ranking uniformed officer in the US military on American soil thatday hears that a plane has hit the World Trade Center and instead of checking it outhe goes into a routine meeting with a senator about confirmation hearings? Comeagain? And it gets worse:\"Sometime during that office call the second tower was hit. Nobody informed us of that.But when we came out, that was obvious. Then right at that time somebody said thePentagon has been hit.\"'"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Where were you on 9/11 ?\t243Hold on, let me sit down here and strap in. No one informs the Acting Chairmanof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the top military man on American soil that day, that asecond airliner has hit the World Trade Center when, down in Florida, the WhiteHouse Chief of Staff, Andrew Card, is telling President Bush that \"America is underattack\", according to the official story? General Myers' account makes no rationalsense whatsoever. Do they really think we are all so stupid that we would believethat the Acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is not contactable at all timesand that he would not have been told of the second plane - indeed the first also - asa matter of course by the Pentagon? If he wasn't, why the hell not? Myers then saysthat \"right at the time\" when he and Cleland came out of their meeting \"somebodysaid the Pentagon has been hit\". We can therefore add a timeline to his story. Myers'account puts him in the meeting with Cleland at no later than around gam beforethe second plane crashed and he did not come out until the Pentagon was struck,that's no earlier than 9.38 - 9.40. How amazing that this meeting took place acrossprecisely the time that the attacks were happening. TheNew York Timestells us that\"during the hour or so that American Airlines Flight 77 was under the control ofhijackers, up to the moment it struck the west side of the Pentagon, military officialsin a command center on the east side of the building were urgently talking to lawenforcement and air traffic control officials about what to do.\"8All this washappening and they didn't inform their ultimate boss that day who was in ameeting down the street on Capitol Hill? Smell a rat? I smell a whole species.General Myers says that when he emerged from the meeting to be told what most ofthe world already knew, he launched into action:\"Immediately, somebody handed me a cell phone, and it was General Eberhart out atNORAD in Colorado Springs talking about what was happening and the actions he wasgoing to take. We immediately, after talking to him, jumped in the car, ran back to thePentagon.\" [How do you do both?]9Ihave detailed the fantastic technology and communications network at thedisposal of NORAD and the Pentagon, and yet NORAD contacts the acting militaryhead of US forces onlyafterthree planes have crashed over nearly an hour andwhen somebody handed him a cell phone? The NORAD commander GeneralEberhart - the man who replaced Myers at Cheyenne Mountain - is telling him \"theactions he isgoingto take\" after three airliners are embedded in three of America'sbiggest buildings and 3,000 people are dead? What in God's name had Eberhart andhis NORAD operation been doing all this time? If you feel you can stand any more,General Myers also told Armed Forces Radio and Television:\"The Chairman [General Shelton] had left that morning to go to Europe, so he wassomewhere over the Atlantic. As I got to the Pentagon I noticed a lot of people werecoming out of the Pentagon. Of course they'd been told to evacuate. My concern waswhere can you best discharge your duties? ...

The Deputy Secretary actually went to another location at thatpoint.We did what had to be done in terms of the command and control of the day ...\"The interviewer asked Myers if he could believe that it was actually a terroristattack:\"Ididn't know what to believe at the time. That was the problem. We had these events,and then subsequently the airplane went down in Pennsylvania. We were trying to tiethis together, what does this mean? General Eberhart was working with the FederalAviation Agency trying to figure out the logical steps at this point. We had some fightersairborne at that time in case we had some hijacked airplanes that were possibly athreat to other institutions or structures, but it was initially pretty confusing. You hate toadmit it, but we hadn't thought about this.\"Given what is claimed to have happened, the voices said to have been heardfrom the cockpit radios, and reports by passengers and attendants on cellphonesand airphones that morning, to say they didn't know this was a \"terrorist attack\" isan unbelievable misrepresentation of events. Only with three planes down,thousands dead, and a fourth soon to crash in Pennsylvania, did the top militaryofficer on duty that day walk into the command centre at the Pentagon which, aswe have seen, has clear and set procedures for reacting to hijackings or aircraftanomalies and would have had open lines to the Federal Aviation Administrationand NORAD throughout. Only then did the Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeldappear and he was in the building from about the time that Flight 11, the firsthijacked plane, was leaving its gate at Boston Logan. More about Rumsfeld shortly,but let us stay with General Myers because this guy really is something else. Youmay have seen him: a grey-haired chap in uniform giving news conferences at thePentagon while his forces bombed innocent civilians in Afghanistan and elsewhere.Two days after 9/11 Myers appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committeehearing that confirmed his appointment as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.Committee Chairman Senator Carl Levin questioned him about what hadhappened while the attacks were taking place:Levin:Was the Defense Department contacted by the FAA or the FBI or any otheragency after the first two hijacked aircraft crashed into the World Trade Center, prior tothe time that the Pentagon was hit?Myers:Sir, I don't know the answer to that question. I can get that for you, for the record.Levin:Thank you. Did the Defense Department take - or was the Defense Departmentasked to take action against any specific aircraft?Myers:Sir,we were ..."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Where were you on 9/11 ?\t245Levin: ...And did you take action against - for instance, there have been statementsthat the aircraft that crashed in Pennsylvania was shot down. Those stories continue toexist.Myers:Mr Chairman, the armed forces did not shoot down any aircraft. When it becameclear what the threat was, we did scramble fighter aircraft, AWACS, radar aircraft andtanker aircraft to begin to establish orbits in case other aircraft showed up in the FAAsystem that were hijacked. But we never actually had to use force.Levin:Was that order that you just described given before or after the Pentagon wasstruck? Do you know?Myers:That order, to the best of my knowledge, was after the Pentagon was struck.10Well, well, well. The highest-ranking military man in America, third only inmilitary authority to the President and the Defense Secretary, and himself aformer Commander of NORAD, does not know two days after 9/11 if his ownDefense Department was contacted by the FAA or the FBI or any other agencyafter the first two hijacked aircraft crashed into the World Trade Center and beforethe Pentagon was hit? You mean he didn't ask at any time after he claims to haverushed to his \"battle station\", the National Military Command Center in thePentagon, where they would have known everything that had happened? Whatutter tripe. He knew exactly the procedure and lines of communications as boththe Acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a former head of NORAD. Heknew that the Defense Department, NORAD, and the FAA work closely in hijacksituations and that the Pentagon would have been notified before the first planecrashed, never mind after the first two had done so. He knew that fighters aredeployed as a matter of course to seek out rogue aircraft. General Myers you are aliar and the question that follows is why are you lying? Myers says that \"to hisknowledge\" no order was given to scramble jets in response to the attacks untilafter the Pentagon was hit. \"To his knowledge\"? You mean he didn't ask thatquestion either when he \"ran\" to the Pentagon or for two days afterwards? In thattime no one told him? This question of whether jets were indeed scrambled beforethe Pentagon was struck is interesting because not only did Myers say that to hisknowledge this was the case, this appeared to be NORAD's position for severaldays also, although NORAD spokesman Barry Venable says this is not the caseand sent me an Associated Press report of September 11th in which NORADspokesman Colonel Mike Perini is quoted as saying \"NORAD controllers didtrack one of the hijacked planes, but it crashed into the World Trade Center evenas fighters were scrambling.\" However, other NORAD spokesmen said the veryopposite, as did General Myers. Two Cape Cod pilots, named only as Duff andNasty, spoke to the BBC programmeClear The Skies,which slavishly andunquestioningly repeated the official story from start to finish. The pilots said theydid scramble to New York, but could not get there in time."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"246\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.Cue DanThe \"we did scramble planes\" story only began to circulate after a report by DanRather, the Council on Foreign Relations member and CBS News \"anchor\". Ratheris the man who told talk show host David Letterman: \"George Bush is thePresident. He makes the decisions. Wherever he wants me to line up, just tell mewhere.\"11Itwas Rather who announced to the nation on September 14th that jetshad been scrambled while quoting no sources. From this \"Rather exclusive\" the\"we scrambled jets, but they were just too late\" story became the official history. Infact on September 12th, Rather himself had asked the CBS Military Consultant,Colonel Mitch Mitchell, why the Pentagon didn't have a system in which fighterswere used to defend against attacks like 9/11.12Rather's revelations that jets weredeployed on September 11th before the Pentagon was hit came the day after thedisastrous testimony of General Myers to the Senate Armed Forces Committee inwhich he had made the shocking statement that no fighters had been ordered tointercept the first three hijacked airliners over a period of nearly an hour and a half.Myers made no mention of planes scrambling from Otis or Langley, the CIA AirForce base where he was stationed for three years in the late 1980s. Then, heypresto, the following day the scrambled fighter jets story suddenly appeared onCBS. Dan Rather said that night:\"CBS News has learned the FAA alerted US Air Defense units of a possible hijacking at8.38 Tuesday morning, and six minutes later, at 8.44, two F -15s received a scrambleorder at Otis Air Force Base on Cape Cod. But two minutes later, at 8.46, AmericanAirlines Flight 11, the first hijacked jet, slammed into the World Trade Center. Sixminutes later, at 8.52, the F -15s were airborne and began racing towards New York City,but the fighters were still 70 miles away when the second hijacked jet, United AirlinesFlight 175, hit the second Trade Center tower. Shortly after that blast, the F -15sreached Manhattan and began flying air cover missions over the city.\"But to the south, a new danger and a new response. At 9.30, three F -16s werelaunched out of Langley Air Force base in Virginia, 150 miles [130] south ofWashington. But just seven minutes later, at 9.37, American Airlines Flight 77 hit thePentagon. The F-16s arrived in Washington just before 10am and began flying coverover the nation's capital.\"13The contradictions can be clearly observed in two reports in theBoston Globejustfour days apart. On Saturday, September 15th, reporter Glen Johnson highlightedthe opposing accounts of CBS and NORAD.14After repeating Rather's CBS\"exclusive\" the night before, he writes that NORAD at this stage still deniedscrambling any jets before the Pentagon was attacked, even though a NORADspokesman, Marine Corps Major Mike Snyder, said they \"routinely\" interceptaircraft. Go figure. TheGlobequoted Snyder as saying: \"We scramble aircraft torespond to any aircraft that we consider a potential threat. The hijacked aircraft"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Where were you on 9/11 ?\t247were normal, scheduled commercial aircraft on approved flight plans and we onlyhad 10 minutes prior notice to the first attack, which unfortunately was not enoughnotice.\"15But he also confirmed that none were scrambled for the next hour either!TheGlobestory says:\" ...Snyder, the NORAD spokesman ... said the command did not immediatelyscramble any fighters even though it was alerted to a hijacking 10 minutes before thefirst plane, American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston to Los Angeles, slammed into thefirstWorld Trade Center tower at 8.45am Tuesday.\"Never before had a hijacked airliner been steered into a skyscraper, Snyder noted, intrying to explain the lack of immediate response.\"The spokesman said the fighters remained on the ground until after the Pentagon washit by American Airlines Flight 77 at 9.40am, during which time the second trade centertower was struck by United Airlines Flight 175, which also originated in Boston and wasdestined for Los Angeles.\"By that time, military authorities realized the scope of the attack, Snyder said, andfinally ordered the jets aloft.\"16Vice President Cheney was still telling this same story on September 16th on theNBC showMeet the Presswhen he said it was Bush who personally made thedecision to send up interceptors and he suggested this was only done after thePentagon was hit.17How does that square with having fighters in the air heading forhijacked airliners before that time?18But then suddenly the story changed, new songsheets all round at Cheyenne Mountain and the Pentagon. By September 19th, eightdays after 9/11, Glen Johnson and theBoston Globewere now reporting a verydifferent version of events from NORAD. Johnson wrote that:\"Two fighter jets dispatched from Otis Air National Guard Base on Cape Cod had closedto within 71 miles of New York last week when the second of two hijacked airlinersslammed into the World Trade Center towers, the military confirmed Tuesday.\"Similarly, two F16 fighters that had scrambled from Langley Air Force Base in Virginiastreaked toward Washington as a third airliner bore in on the Pentagon, but both werestillabout 12 minutes away when the commandeered plane struck the nation's militaryheadquarters.\"19This timeline, provided by NORAD, had miraculously changed. As Johnsonrightly pointed out: \"The account contradicted earlier statements from a defensecommand spokesman and the incoming chairman of the joint Chiefs of Staff [GeneralMyers]. Both said the military did not launch its planes until after the Pentagon hadbeen hit.\" Now a \"different defense command spokesman\", Army Major Barry"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"248\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.Venable, said the previous statements were based on \"inaccurate information\".20ImetGlen Johnson in Boston and he told me he had called the public affairs office at OtisAir Force Base to ask them to confirm that they did scramble planes that morning, butthey refused to comment for reasons of \"operational security\" even though theirbosses at NORAD had now issued a press release saying that they had. Johnson toldme that eventually they would not return his calls. What goes on? I asked NORAD if Icould speak with the pilots of the planes that were said to have been scrambled fromOtis, but I was told they had \"elected not to speak with the media\".21They had noproblem, however, speaking with the BBC programmeClear The Skiesthatunquestioningly repeated the official line and enjoyed great cooperation and access toCheyenne Mountain and other military establishments as a result. I am not sayingthat the Otis and Langley jets were not scrambled, albeit way too late, but the blatantcontradictions in the official story are constant and obvious.Anyway, even according to this new timeline of NORAD and the Pentagon, nofighter jet got within 100 miles of even the fourth aircraft, Flight 93, before itcrashed in Pennsylvania. Johnson highlights the obvious point that these\"scrambled\" jets flew to their targets at well below their potential speed. Why? Wehad the same contradictions with Flight 93 almost two hours after the problem wasfirst identified with Flight 11. Major General Paul Weaver, director of the AirNational Guard, said that \"No Air National Guard or other military planes werescrambled to chase the fourth hijacked airliner, United Airlines Flight 93.\"22This is astaggering statement in itself. But Rumsfeld's Deputy Defense Secretary PaulWolfowitz was quoted in theBoston Heraldtelling a very different story. He said that\"... the Air Force was tracking the hijacked plane that crashed in Pennsylvania onTuesday after other airliners slammed into the Pentagon and World Trade Centerand had been in a position to bring it down if necessary\".23The whole official storyis a mess. During his \"evidence\" to the Senate Committee on September 13th,General Myers was questioned by Senator Bill Nelson, who clearly exposed howridiculous the earlier explanations had been:Nelson:The second World Trade tower was hit shortly after 9am. And the Pentagon washit approximately 40 minutes later. That's approximately. You would know specificallywhat the timeline was. The crash that occurred in Pennsylvania after the Newarkwestbound flight was turned around 180 degrees and started heading back toWashington was approximately an hour after the World Trade Center second explosion.You said earlier in your testimony that we had not scrambled any military aircraft untilafter the Pentagon was hit. And so, my question would be: why?Myers:Ithink I had that right, that it was not until then. I'd have to go back and reviewthe exact timelines.[Hethinksthat's right?]Nelson:Perhaps we want to do this in our session, in executive [secret] session. Butmy question is an obvious one for not only this committee, but for the executive branchand the military establishment. If we knew that there was a general threat on terrorist"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Where were you on 9/11 ?\t249activity,which we did, and we suddenly have two trade towers in New York beingobviously hit by terrorist activity, of commercial airliners taken off course from Boston toLos Angeles, then what happened to the response of the defense establishment oncewe saw the diversion of the aircraft headed west from Dulles turning around 180degrees and, likewise, in the aircraft taking off from Newark and, in flight, turning 180degrees? That's the question. I leave it to you as to how you would like to answer it. Butwe would like an answer.Myers:You bet. I spoke, after the second tower was hit, I spoke to the commander ofNORAD, General Eberhart. And at that point, I think [think?] the decision was at thatpoint to start launching aircraft.[Pardon? In his interview with Armed Forces Radio and Television he said that when hecameout of his meeting on Capitol Hill with Senator Max Cleland he was told of thesecond plane crashing into the WTC and that the Pentagon had just been hit. Only then,he said, did he talk to Eberhart. Myers is changing his accounts in response toNelson's questions as they expose the inexplicable non-reaction of NORAD and thePentagon. What Myers is therefore saying here again is that no planes were scrambleduntil after the Pentagon was hit.]Myers:One of the things you have to understand, senator, is that in our posture rightnow, that we have many fewer aircraft on alert than we did during the height of the ColdWar. And so, we've got just a few bases around the perimeter of the United States.[What about the fighters a minute's flying time from Washington at Andrews AFB, whichwere deployed after the Pentagon was hit?]Myers:So it's not just a question of launching aircraft, it's launching to do what? Youhave to have a specific threat. We're pretty good if the threat's coming from outside.We're not so good if the threat's coming from inside.[Two planes have hit the WTC and another hijacked aircraft is heading for Washingtonand he says you have to have a \"specific threat\" before scrambling fighters? And\"launching to do what?\" Launchingtodo what they do every week of the year and as aformer commander of NORAD he well knows that. Whywereplanes not deployed overWashingtonassoon as the World Trade Center was attacked? If it was felt right to dothat after the Pentagon was hit why not before?]Myers:In this case, if my memory serves me - and I'll have to get back to you for therecord - my memory says that we had launched on the one that eventually crashed inPennsylvania. I mean, we had gotten somebody close to it, as I recall. I'll have to checkthat out.[Remember this is the top-ranking uniformed military officer in Americaspeaking.] Ido not recall if that was the case for the one that had taken off from Dulles.But part of it is just where we are positioned around this country to do that kind of workbecause that was never - it goes back to Senator Collins' issue. Is this one of thethings that we'll worry about. You know, what's next? But our posture today is not oneof the many sites and the many tens of aircraft on alert. We just have a handful today."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"250\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.Let us not forget that General Myers said that he headed straight for thecommand centre in the Pentagon after he came out of his meeting on Capitol Hill.The idea that he did not know that morning, never mind two days later, whatfighter jets had been, or not been, scrambled is simply laughable. Of course heknew and what he said until he was faced with uncomfortable questions is thatthey did not scramble jets until the Pentagon was hit. When you have someonepresenting such a travesty of the truth and dithering around unable to answer themost basic of questions - answers he would clearly have known - the alarm bellsbegin to explode. Later, Senator Nelson emphasises his point again to thecommittee:\"Mr Chairman, may I, just for the record? Commenting from CNN on the timeline, 9.03is the correct time that the United Airlines flight crashed into the south tower of theWorld Trade Center; 9.43 is the time that American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into thePentagon. And 10.10am is the time that United Airlines Flight 93 crashed in SomersetCounty, Pennsylvania. So that was 40 minutes between the second tower being hit andthe Pentagon crash. And it is an hour and seven minutes until the crash occurred inPennsylvania.\"24NORAD or snorad?General Ralph Eberhart, Commander in Chief of NORAD and Space Command atCheyenne Mountain, appeared on October 25th 2001 before the Senate ArmedServices Committee Holds Hearing on the Role of Defense Department inHomeland Security. By now the new song sheets had been circulated all round.Eberhart said that the Federal Aviation Administration did not notify NORAD orthe Department of Defense that Flight 77 was \"probably hijacked\" until 9.24am,even though it had changed course and turned back at about 8.55 - after the firstplane had already crashed into the World Trade Center. So the plane was \"probablyhijacked\"? Can it get any sillier? Eberhart said: \"I show it as 9.24 that we werenotified, and that's the first notification that we received. I do not know, sir, why ittook that amount of time for FAA. I hate to say it, but you'll have to ask FAA.\" Hewas asked if they had now improved the communication system:\"Sir, I assure you that we have, and we practice this daily now, and now it takes aboutone minute from the time that FAA sees some sort of discrepancy on their radar scopeor detects a discrepancy in terms of their communication before they notify NORAD. Sothat certainly has been fixed.1 think at that time, the FAA was still thinking that if they saw a problem it was aproblem that was a result of a mechanical failure or some sort of crew deviation. Theyweren't thinking hijacking. Today, the first thing they think is hijacking, and we respondaccordingly.\"25"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Where were you on 9/11 ?\t251You can see from the evidence presented in the last chapter about the normalreaction procedures of the FAA and NORAD before September 11th that we arebeing seriously misled here. If you look at what happened to those planes it wasclear to air traffic controllers that the aircraft were not suffering a \"mechanicalfailure or some sort of crew deviation\" and so why is Eberhart talking suchnonsense? Senator Warner asked Eberhart if the FAA and NORAD had notrehearsed the possibilities of an aircraft being seized by terrorists. Eberhart replied:..although we practice this, day in and day out, the FAA sees on their scopes scoresof problems that are a result of mechanical problems, switch errors, pilot errors, etcetera, and that's what they think when they see this\".Oh do come on. Contact was lost with the cockpits, transponders were turnedoff, there were massive changes of course, and planes were crashing into buildings.Then we are told there were calls from passengers on the planes and \"terrorists\"heard in the cockpits. Nothing to worry about, Ralph, must be a mechanical fault.Note also that he says they \"practice this, day in and day out ... \" using the pre-September 11th tense if you read the sentence. Eberhart continued:\"Although we have exercised this, we have practiced it, in most cases it's a hijackingl ike most of the hijackings, all of the hijackings I'm aware of, where we have plenty oftime to react, we get on the wing, and we follow this airplane to where it lands and thenthe negotiations start. We were not thinking a missile - an airborne missile that wasgoing to be used as a target - a manned missile if you will.\"And in most cases when we practice this, regrettably we practiced it - the origin of thisflight was from overseas and we did not have the time-distance problems that we hadon that morning. We had plenty of time to react. We were notified that for sure therewas a hijacking and we were notified that they were holding a gun to the pilot's headand telling him to fly toward New York City or Washington, DC. So that's how we hadpracticed this, sir.\"Icertainly wish we had practiced it differently, but I really think that, for sure in the firsttwo instances, and probably in the third, the time and distance would not have allowedus to get an airplane to the right place at the right time.\"26What is this man saying? His operation has access to the most sophisticatedtracking and surveillance technology on earth - and in space - known to man. Twoplanes hit the World Trade Center and he claims they don't have the time tointercept a plane that turned back 45 minutes before it struck the Pentagon? He saysthat they \"were not thinking a missile - an airborne missile that was going to beused as a target - a manned missile if you will\", but two such \"missiles\" hadalready crashed into the World Trade Center before the non-reaction to Flight 77 inWashington by the FAA-NORAD system.

It'sjust achoice rightnow betweenfear and love.Senator Wayne Allard asked him if they had aircraft \"at least up in the air with thesecond plane to hit the twin towers\". Eberhart replied, \"Yes sir.\" The followingexchange then took place:Allard:And so what I'm interested in knowing is, what was the process there and then,how was that followed-up with the other aircraft that you identified that were coming orheading toward Washington, and how you responded? And how was the FAA interactingwith NORAD in that whole situation, starting with that first plane that you deployedheading toward New York City?Eberhart:Yes, sir. The first flight I think was American Flight 11.[Hethinks?]TheFAA,once they notified us and we issued a scramble order almost simultaneously to the firstcrash, tragically. That flight of two out of Otis Air Force Base, out of Cape Cod ...Allard:Let me understand - so right at the time the first aircraft was hitting the twintowers, you were being notified by FAA that you had another plane headed toward thetowers, you just routinely brought another aircraft ...Eberhart:No, they notified us of the first hijacking just about the time that that airplanewas hitting the tower.Allard:OK.Eberhart:And at that time, we issued a scramble order for the two F-15s out of Otis AirForce Base[even though NORAD was denying this for a week].We continued to sendthose airplanes toward New York City because initially, as we worked with the FAA, weweren't sure if that was the hijacked airplane[a ludicrous statement]. Imean, I hate toadmit this, but I'm sitting there hoping that someone has made a mistake; there hasbeen an accident; that this isn't the hijacked airplane, because there is confusion. Wewere told it was a light commuter airplane. It didn't look like that was caused by a lightcommuter airplane. [With NORAD's technology they would have known exactly what itwas, so why is he saying this?] Sowe were still trying to sort this out, so we're movingthe two F-15s and we continue to move them. They're flying toward New York City. Infact, they are eight minutes away from New York City when the second crash occurs. Wedidn't turn around. We didn't send them back.Allard:They hadn't made a sighting of that ...Eberhart:Again, it's time and distance. It took them only six minutes to get airborne.[The US Air Force claims a potential response time of 2.5 minutes from scramble to29,000 feet.]Once we told them to get airborne, it took them six minutes to getairborne.

And then you had the other two planes heading out.Then FAA continued to notify NORAD that you had two other potential hijackings, theseheaded for Washington; is that correct?Eberhart:Yes, sir. The initial hijacking of the one, I think[think?]it's 77 that crashedinto the Pentagon, we were working that with the FAA and we launched the airplanes outof Langley Air Force Base as soon as they notified us about hijacking. At that time ittook those airplanes, two F-16s, again, six minutes to get airborne. They wereapproximately 13 minutes away from Washington, DC, when that tragic crash occurred.Six minutes to get airborne, but still 13 minutes to it.Idon't want to worry you, but this guy is the head of the operation that issupposed to protect the United States from attacks from air and space. Better getthat shelter dug smartish. Eberhart also revealed that NORAD helped to providethe radars used by the FAA to track aircraft in US airspace and that NORAD has\"moved manpower on the order of about 200 people over the years to the FAA tooperate these radars\". I wonder if any NORAD staff were on FAA duty that day?We can't know because no one is saying and if they did, would you believe them?Eberhart also said that he could not discuss in an open session who had theauthority to order a commercial plane to be shot down, even though the WhiteHouse had confirmed it was the President before 9 / 11 and that the head of NORADand a list of other named military men could now issue such an order. Oh, by theway, at the end of Senator Allard's questioning in which Eberhart's answers werepathetic to anyone who has looked at what should have happened on 9/11, theSenator said: \"Well, I just want to thank you and your people for, I know, I think atremendous effort in light of some totally unexpected circumstances. And at least, I,for one, appreciate, you know, the readiness that was displayed.\" I know, incredibleisn't it? But these are the people running our world.Where was Rumsfeld?OK, we have established where General Myers was that morning - nowhere to beseen. But what about the Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, the number two inthe United States military command structure? It turns out he was working on theeast side of the Pentagon from before the time that Flight 11 took off from Boston.He told the CNN talk showLarry King Liveon December 5th that he was in hisoffice and was given no warning whatsoever that Flight 77 was heading forWashington before it crashed into the Pentagon.27Can the official story get any more"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"254\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.insane? Unfortunately it can. This is the headquarters of the US military with openlines to NORAD at Cheyenne Mountain with all its satellites, AWACS and ground-based surveillance, and with open lines by now with the FAA. Two planes hadalready crashed into the World Trade Center and the US Defence Secretary wasgiven no warning that an aircraft was about to crash into the building he was in,albeit a long, long, way from impact? This is an extraordinary statement and moretransparent tosh. Larry King failed to ask a single question about the DefenseSecretary's ridiculous story, but that, of course, will surprise no one. Rumsfeldrelated to King that earlier that morning he had told a congressional delegation inhis office at the Pentagon: \"Sometime in the next two, four, six, eight, ten, twelvemonths, there would be an event that would occur in the world that would besufficiently shocking that it would remind people, again, how important it is tohave a strong, healthy Defense Department that contributes - that underpins peaceand stability in our world. And that is what underpins peace and stability.\"28Howprophetic. Then came another outrageous statement that Rumsfeld made to King.He said that during this meeting in his office ...\"...someone walked in and handed me a note that said that a plane had just hit theWorld Trade Center. And we adjourned the meeting. And I went in to get my CIA briefingright next door here, and the whole building shook within 15 minutes. And it was ajarring thing.\"29Now hold on here. The first plane hit the World Trade Center at about 8.46. ThePentagon wasn't hit until around 9.38. Yet Rumsfeld tells King he was handed anote saying a plane had \"just\" hit the WTC and within 15 minutes Flight 77 crashedinto the Pentagon? Are we being asked to believe that the Defense Secretary wasn'ttold about the first plane hitting the WTC until some 40 minutes after it happenedwhen he is sitting in his own office at the Pentagon all this time? This is the onlyway that the \"within 15 minutes\" can be explained. Most of America and hundredsof millions across the world were watching events unfold live on television beforegam and yet the Defense Secretary, number two only to the President in the USmilitary command, didn't know until about 9.20? Where does that leave the \"just\"hit the World Trade Center in the Rumsfeld story and why was he not told aboutthe second hit on the WTC at the same time? Rumsfeld's own Department ofDefense manual says: \"In the event of a hijacking, the [National Military CommandCenter at the Pentagon] will be notified by the most expeditious means by the FAA.The NMCC will, with the exception of immediate responses ... forward requests forDOD assistance to the Secretary of Defense for approval.\"\" Given this procedurealone the Secretary of Defense would surely have been told immediately the firstplane hit the north tower - 50 to 55 minutes before the Pentagon was hit, not 15. Infact, he would have had to be told under the Pentagon's own proceduresimmediately it was known that the first plane had been hijacked. That would havebeen around 8.20 - an hour and 20 minutes before the Pentagon was hit. The lies arejust so blatant."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Where were you on 9/11 ?\t255TheWashington Postreported that after Rumsfeld was informed of the WorldTrade Center attack by his Chief of Staff he \"stayed in his office on the east side ofthe Pentagon for a scheduled CIA briefing\" - note \"scheduled\" - while \"several ofhis senior aides rushed to the Pentagon's command center deep within the five-sided complex, where a crisis action center [no-action center] was being set up.\"31Ifyou only believe the ludicrous official version that Pentagon officials were given 12minutes' warning of the plane heading their way, why would no one tell theDefense Secretary before he felt his \"jarring thing\"? And, according to the officialstory from Rumsfeld's own military, jets were dispatched from Langley at 9.30 tointercept the plane and yet Rumsfeld and others in the Pentagon had no warningthat the building was likely to be hit? Nowhere, but nowhere, do their pieces fit andthere is a very good reason for that. It's a pack of lies. I contacted the Pentagon withthe following list of questions, but officials chose not to answer them.1.With the capability of United States air defence, how can a hijacked airliner,Flight 77, be allowed to fly for 45 minutes towards Washington, withcommunication lost with air traffic control and the transponder turned off,approach a No Fly Zone and hit your headquarters without any challengewhatsoever?2.Why was the Defense Secretary Mr Rumsfeld unaware that the plane wasapproaching until the Pentagon was actually struck?3.Why was Secretary Rumsfeld not told of the first plane striking the WTC untilaround 15 minutes before Flight 77 struck the Pentagon (thus about 9.20am to9.25am)? Why was he not told at this time that a second plane had struck theWorld Trade Center?4.Why was Richard Myers, the acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, notinformed that two planes had struck the WTC and that another was headingfor Washington while he was in a scheduled meeting on Capitol Hill andavailable throughout? Why did he only learn of what was happening whenhe emerged from the meeting to be told that the Pentagon had been hit? Isthere not a constant communication link between the Chairman and thePentagon?5.Why were the ground to air defences at the Pentagon and the White Housenot activated when Flight 77 approached?6.Why is there no survelliance camera footage of Flight 77 from much closer tothe point of impact? The pictures released by the Pentagon seem to be a longway away for a building that must be guarded by a very large number ofcameras, many of them looking outwards."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"256\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want.

Mind you, if I werethe Pentagon I wouldn't want to be faced with answering these questions eitherbecause to do so credibly is simply not possible.Where was Bush?So to George W. Bush. Where was he when his country needed a decisive President?He was not in Washington that morning, which doesn't surprise me at all. Instead,as I have already mentioned, he was back in brother Jeb's state of Florida for a pre-publicised photo opportunity at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School inSarasota. What he did that morning, and when and how he heard of Flight 11striking the World Trade Center, depends very much on which official account youwant to hear. There are several from people like Bush, Cheney and Ari Fleischer, thePresident's press secretary. Sonya Ross, an Associated Press reporter, said she knewof the first crash even before Bush had reached the school that morning:\"My cell phone rang as President Bush's motorcade coursed toward Emma E. BookerElementary School in Sarasota, Florida. A colleague reported that a plane had crashedinto the World Trade Center in New York. No further information.\"Icalled the AP desk in Washington, seeking details. Same scant information. But Iknew it had to be grim. I searched for a White House official to question, but none wason hand until 9.05am.\"33If her office knew and enough time had passed for them to call her on acellphone, Bush must have known well before he arrived at the school that theaircraft had crashed into the WTC, and he must have known even earlier that therewas a hijack in progress on Flight 11. Contact was lost with the aircraft at 8.13am andthe President travels with a staff that is in instant contact with the National MilitaryCommand Center (NMCC) at the Pentagon, which coordinates with NORAD, theFAA and the government intelligence network. John Cochran, an ABC journalist,was reporting Bush's visit to Florida that day. He told Peter Jennings on ABC:\"Peter, as you know, the President's down in Florida talking about education. He got out ofhis hotel suite this morning, was about to leave, reporters saw the White House Chief ofStaff, Andy Card, whisper into his ear. The reporter said to the President, `Do you knowwhat's going on in New York?' He said he did, and he said he will have something about itlater. His first event is about half an hour at an elementary school in Sarasota, Florida.\"34How do you explain the report that when Card whispered in the President's earoutside his hotel that Bush \"did not respond\"? Would he not have been utterlyshocked and insisted on cancelling the school visit to handle the situation? After all,"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Where were you on 9/11 ?\t257at that time he was the only one who could give permission for a civilian airliner tobe shot down. How could he be ready to react to events sitting in a classroomlistening to children reading? One reason why someone would not be stunned tohear such information, of course, is if they already knew what was going to happen.At the very least from about 8.46am when Flight 11 crashed, the secret service thatlooks after the safety of the President had \"open lines\" with the Federal AviationAdministration. This was confirmed by Vice President Dick Cheney on NBC'sMeetthe Press.35In truth, the open lines would surely have been activated earlier than thatwhen Flight 11 began to act very strangely and dramatically change course. TheBush team in Florida knew precisely what the FAA knew by that time - indeedsuspected from about 8.20 - that Flight 11 had been hijacked. It would have beenthe most basic security response to keep the President away from a pre-arranged,publicised, event at a school, especially as it is only five miles from the Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport. Especially after Flight 11 struck the World TradeCenter the thought that the President could be a target of a similar attack must haveoccurred to them, yet there appears to have been no discussion about thePresident's security given these circumstances and off he went to the school asplanned. Did they know something we didn't?\"There's one terrible pilot\"Despite the eye-witness reports of when Bush must have known that Flight 11 wasin trouble, he completely contradicted this - and the earlier accounts of his ownofficials - in an extraordinary performance on December 4th at a \"town meeting\" atthe Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, Florida, where he wasanswering non-challenging questions from a sycophantic audience. I actuallywatched this happen live on CNN in a hotel bar. As I sipped my beer and despairedat the hero worship being enjoyed by a village idiot, Bush made a startlingstatement about September 11th. For the next two days I scanned the newspapers,the Internet \"news\" sites, including CNN, but there was no mention of the amazingstatement he had made. Weeks later a Belgian visitor to my website sent me thewords that Bush had said. They were posted on the White House website, hiddenaway in the full and long transcript of the meeting.\" Bush was talking about whathappened on September 11th and how he heard of the atrocities in New York, inanswer to a question from a young boy called Jordan:\"Well, Jordan, you're not going to believe what state I was in when I heard about theterrorist attack[wellitdidn't show]. Iwas in Florida. And my Chief of Staff, Andy Card -actually, I was in a classroom talking about a reading program that works. I was sittingoutside the classroom waiting to go in, and I saw an airplane hit the tower - the TV wasobviously on. And I used to fly, myself, and I said, well, there's one terrible pilot. I said itmust have been a horrible accident. But I was whisked off there; I didn't have muchtime to think about it. And I was sitting in the classroom, and Andy Card, my Chief ofStaff, who is sitting over here, walked in and said, 'A second plane has hit the tower,America is under attack.\"'"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"A few facts. There was no live televisioncoverage of the first plane hitting thetower - how could there be? Therecorded footage of the first crash didnot air until long after Bush went intothe classroom where he was told of thesecond crash by Card(Figure 18).Thel ive pictures were of the second planewhen the television networks werealready broadcasting shots of theburning north tower. How could he,Figure 18:\"Mr President, America is under attack.\"therefore, claim to have seen the first\"OK Andy, as soon as I've heard what happens to thisgoat, 0/ be right out.\"\tplane strike? This is simply notpossible, so what on earth is he talkingabout? What about his reaction of \"there's one terrible pilot\"? Uh? A passenger jetcrashes into a 110-storey building full of people and all the President of the UnitedStates can say is \"there's one terrible pilot\"! We have already seen that Bush musthave known about the first crash before he even arrived at the school and he wants usto believe that the President of the United States, the Commander-in-Chief of USforces and \"homeland\" defence, would not be told before that time how contact withFlight 11 had been lost, its transponder had been turned off, and that it had veeredsharply off-course? Contact was lost at 8.13 and the plane did not hit the north toweruntil about 8.46. The Federal Aviation Administration, NORAD and the NationalMilitary Command Center at the Pentagon were tracking the plane from soon aftercontact ceased. Bush, remember, said before leaving his hotel for the school that hewould \"have something\" later about what was happening in New York and theAssociated Press reporter said she knew of the first crash before Bush had evenarrived at the school. Yet he says that he saw the plane crash on a television at theschool (not possible) and his reaction was: \"I used to fly myself, and I said, well,there's one terrible pilot. I said it must have been a horrible accident.\" Lies, lies, liesagain. Bush's story is also in direct contradiction to the earlier official version that hewas told about Flight 11 in a call from his National Security Adviser CondoleezzaRice before he went into the classroom.\" This, in turn, contradicts the accounts ofreporters who make it clear that Bush must have known what was happening beforehe arrived at the school.Then, knowing what had happened and knowing the plane had been hijacked,how does the President of the United States react to these monumental events? Hewalks into a classroom to read to children from the second grade and hear themread him a story about a pet goat! As the children read to him he said: \"Really goodreaders - whew!\" Bush interrupted at one point, saying, \"This must be SixthGrade.\" God help us. There has just been a catastrophe in New York, Mr President,involving thousands of people and you know the cause is a hijacked airliner. Hello?When Andrew Card came into the classroom and whispered in his ear that a secondplane had hit the World Trade Center and that \"America is under attack\", what"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Where were you on 9/11 ?\t259does the President do then? He continues to sit there listening to a story about a petgoat. If you were writing this as fiction they'd say it was a ridiculous story.Associated Press reported on September 12th:\"In Sarasota, Florida, Bush was reading to children in a classroom at 9.05am when hischief of staff Andrew Card whispered into his ear. The president briefly turned somberbefore he resumed reading. He addressed the tragedy about a half-hour later.\"38He \"briefly\" remained somber, or sombre, as we spell it in Britain? He's just beentold that a second commercial airliner has struck the World Trade Center. Death anddestruction on a massive scale was already obvious and the President knew the firstplane had been hijacked before he went into the classroom. Yet he turned \"brieflysomber\" before continuing to focus on the adventures of a pet goat. Jenna Heath ofCox Newspapers' Washington Bureau reported that Bush \"did not appearpreoccupied\" as he introduced Education Secretary Rod Paige inside the classroomand shook hands with teacher Sandra Kay Daniels. \"There was no sign that[Condoleezza] Rice had just told Bush about the first attack on New York's WorldTrade Center during a telephone call,\" Heath wrote.39Look at his reaction whenCard \"whispered in his ear\" before he left his hotel? \"He did not respond,\" saidwitnesses. Is this really a natural response from a man who has just been told ofsuch events in the country he is supposed to be leading? Or is it the response ofsomeone who knew full well what was going on and why? Bush told the Floridatown meeting on December 4th:\"But I knew I needed to act. I knew that if the nation's under attack, the role of theCommander-in-Chief is to respond forcefully to prevent other attacks from happening.And so, I've talked to the Secretary of Defense; one of the first acts I did was to put ourmilitary on alert.\"40Bush says he knew he needed to act, but the indisputable truth is that he didn't.What's all this about calling Defense Secretary Rumsfeld? When did he do that?Rumsfeld told Larry King that even though he was in his office in the Pentagon hedidn't know anything was happening until he was handed a note while meeting acongressional delegation in his office little more than 15 minutes before thePentagon was struck at about 9.38. We are being told here that although thePresident knew well before gam, the Defense Secretary was not told until at leasthalf an hour later even though he was in the Pentagon. Wherever you look there isa deluge of lies and contradictions. Bush says that he put the military on alert, buthe could not have done this until he was finished with the goat story and left theclassroom shortly before 9.30 - more than 40 minutes after the first plane hit. As Imentioned, the official tale (official version 99933/S11/666/update/triplicate) isthat Bush was taken to a private room before he went into the classroom and spokeon the phone with his National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, who told himabout Flight 11. We are told that at this point the crash of Flight 11 could have been"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"260\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.considered just a \"terrible accident\" - an obvious lie. If Bush talked to his NationalSecurity Adviser before gam, how come Defense Secretary Rumsfeld says he didn'tknow anything for another 25 minutes? Why was Rice not in immediate contactwith Rumsfeld? Why wasn't the President? Why wasn't anyone? It was 9.30 - 26minutes after hearing of the second crash - before Bush went into the schoollibrary to announce:\"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America. Two airplanes havecrashed into the World Trade Center, in an apparent terrorist attack on our country. I amgoing to conduct a full-scale investigation and hunt down and find those folks whocommitted this act. Terrorism against our nation will not stand.\"No, Mr Bush, you were about to name the patsy and the target that suited theagenda of those who control you. The \"folks\" are much closer to home, as you wellknow.The lie about scare force oneBush was taken to Air Force One, the presidential plane, and even the official storysays that he did not call Vice President Cheney and put the US military on highalert status until at least 10am, by which time the Pentagon had been hit. Bushheaded for Barksdale Air Force base, Louisiana, and the US Strategic Command atOffutt Air Force base in Nebraska, and did not arrive at the White House, via theAndrews Air Force Base, until shortly before 7pm. This was more than ten hoursafter the first strike on the World Trade Center. When understandable questionswere being asked about why Bush did not head straight for Washington to lead hiscountry at such a terrible time, the White House said that they had received a phonecall giving a secret code to say that Air Force One was the next target. No theydidn't, that was yet another lie. John Ashcroft, the Attorney General and the manwho delivers \"justice\" to others, also said the \"government has credible evidencethat the White House and Air Force One were targets\".41Lie again. Reports werecirculated through the news agencies on September 12th that quoted a White Housespokesman as saying: \"There was real and credible information that the WhiteHouse and Air Force One were targets of terrorist attacks and that the plane that hitthe Pentagon was headed for the White House.\" Ari Fleischer, the White HousePress Secretary, confirmed this the same afternoon. The Secret Service had \"specificand credible information\" that the White House and Air Force One were potentialtargets, he said. Bush's chief political strategist, the Enron shareholder Karl Rove,was quoted the following day as confirming that the threat came in language thatproved the terrorists had knowledge of the President's \"procedures andwhereabouts\".42So why did they allow him to attend a publicised appearance at aschool in the circumstances of that morning and why, if there was a specific threatto Air Force One, was Bush taken straight to the airport to take off in that planeafter he had finished with the pet goat story? Maureen Dowd wrote in theNew YorkTimesthat Karl Rove had \"called around town, trying to sell reporters the story.\"43"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Where were you on 9/11?\t261But two weeks later the White House was forced to back down on the wholefantasy and on September 25th the CBSEvening Newsreported that the call \"simplynever happened\".44Most newspapers did not even report this fantastic exposure ofthe lies spewed out daily by the Bush administration, and theWashington Postonlyran the story on an inside page.Itwas this same White House press spokesman, Ari Fleischer, who repeated thelies about Air Force One, which told us how Flight 77 was heading for the WhiteHouse before it \"veered off\" and aimed at the Pentagon. Vice President Cheney saidthe same on NBC'sMeet the Press.He confirmed that the plane was being tracked(so why no response?) and \"when it entered the danger zone and looked like it washeaded for the White House was when they grabbed me and evacuated me to thebasement...\"45They waited, he claims, until the aircraft was \"in the danger zone\"before evacuating the Vice President when they had been tracking a hijackedplane's progress towards Washington for some 40 minutes after two planes hadalready crashed into the World Trade Center. TheCBSNewsTransportationCorrespondent Bob Orr reported that the recorded flight path of Flight 77 does notsupport what Cheney and Fleischer claim:\"Eight minutes before the crash, at 9.30am EDT, radar tracked the plane as it closed towithin 30 miles of Washington. Sources say the hijacked jet continued east at a highspeed toward the city, but flew several miles south of the restricted airspace around theWhite House.\"Once again I sent a list of questions to the White House media office relating tothese events. They were faxed in May 2002, but they chose not to answer.1.When did the President know that Flight 11 was in trouble or there could be aproblem? When did the FAA, NORAD, and the Pentagon communicate thisinformation to the President's support team in Florida that morning?Would not respond.2.Why, when he was told of the first plane striking the WTC, did the Presidentcontinue with his engagement and go into a reading class at the EmmaBooker School?Would not respond.3.Why when told by Andrew Card in the classroom that a second plane hadstruck the WTC and that \"America is under attack\", did he continue to stay inthe classroom for some time?Would not respond.4.When did the President put the United States military on high alert?Would not respond."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"262\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.5.Why did the President not go back to Washington immediately when we nowknow that the story of the telephone warning that Air Force One was the nexttarget never happened?Would not respond.6.Why did the President tell a public meeting that he saw the first plane strikethe WTC and said \"There's one a terrible pilot\", when he could not possiblyhave seen that happen before he entered the classroom? That footage was notaired until much later.Would not respond.7.Whywas the President not considered to be in danger when the attacksbegan, and thus removed from the school and a pre-announced visit whenthe school was only a short distance from an airport?Would not respond.Why no evacuation?Another piece of criminal negligence - in truth more than that - was the failure toevacuate the Pentagon, the White House and other major Washington symbolsuntil the Pentagon was struck. This was despite a warning apparently issued to thePentagon by the Federal Aviation Administration. CNN, quoting \"DefenseDepartment officials\", said that no action was taken for at least 12 minutes despitewarnings that an airliner \"appeared\" to be heading towards Washington.\" (In factthe aircraft must have been tracked heading in that direction for more than 40minutes.) American Forces Press Service reported that personnel at the Pentagonrealised they could be a target long before they were hit: \"We were watching theWorld Trade Center on the television,\" said a Navy officer. \"When the secondplane deliberately dove into the tower, someone said, 'The World Trade Center isone of the most recognizable symbols of America. We're sitting in a closesecond.\"'47The top people in the Pentagon, apparently, could not see whateveryone else could. Or maybe, I would suggest, some of them could see veryclearly, but did nothing. Retired General Wesley Clark, a former NATO SupremeCommander, said, \"We've known for some time that some group has beenplanning this, obviously, we didn't do enough to prepare for such an attack.\"48Officials at the Pentagon, quoted by CNN, said, \"no mechanism existed within theUS government to notify various departments and agencies under suchcircumstances\". No mechanism to evacuate the Pentagon with a flying bombheading in its direction?? In contradiction of this, Pentagon spokesman GlennFlood said \"to call for a general evacuation, at that point, it would have been justguessing ... We evacuate when we know something is a real threat to us.\"49Clearlysomething is only considered a \"real threat\" when it smashes into the building. Oh,itwas a real threat then; better evacuate, I guess.Newsdayreported that many ofthe building's 20,000 workers were still sitting at their desks when the planestruck, and some said they heard the crash but didn't know the plane had hit the"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Where were you on 9/11?\t263Pentagon until they saw it on TV!50\"The first thought everyone had was that it hadbeen a bomb,\" said Victoria Clarke, a spokeswoman for Defense SecretaryRumsfeld.51Only with a hole in the side of the building and 125 employees andworkers dead was the building evacuated followed by the White House, CapitolHill and elsewhere. None of the Pentagon top brass were killed or injured becausethey did not work in the part of the building that was struck. General RichardMyers, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had the unbelievable nerve to sayat a memorial ceremony for the victims that they were \"serving their country\" inthe course of doing their jobs at the Pentagon, \"and on September 11 were called tomake the ultimate sacrifice\".52Sacrifice, I think, was the only appropriate word.They were allowed to die, as the recorded facts make so plain. All this was coldlycalculated by those running the 9/11 operation because the more death anddestruction they could cause, the bigger would be the problem, the bigger thereaction and therefore the bigger the solution that could be offered - a war withoutend and the dismantling of basic freedoms. The families of those who died in thePentagon have an open and shut case for a lawsuit against the US government forthe gross negligence that cost the lives of their loved ones. It is, however, as Icontinue to stress, far more than \"negligence\" that is behind all this.And where was \"Big Dick\"?Representatives of government, \"security\" agencies and the military at the highestlevels constantly lied over and over about what did and did not happen. Whichbrings me to Dick Cheney. Where was the Vice President all this time? He told themedia on September 12th that a clerical secretary watching television in hisWashington office alerted him to the attacks.53Oh really, Dick. The CheyenneMountain official website says of the NORAD Command Center: \"Redundant andsurvivable communications hotlines connect the Command Center to the Pentagon,White House, US Strategic Command, Canadian Forces Headquarters in Ottawa,other aerospace defense system command posts, and major military centers aroundthe world.\"54Yet Cheney, sitting in the White House, says he learned of the attackswhen a clerical secretary comes in and says, \"Hey, you'll never guess what I've justseen on the telly.\" The whole story is a joke. But look at the common denominatorhere between Bush, Rumsfeld and Myers, the 1, 2, 3, in the military commandstructure, and Cheney. Their stories and actions all ensured that they were not in aposition to react immediately to events until after the Pentagon was hit. Or ratherthey had an excuse not to do so. Bush was occupied with the goat story until shortlybefore the Pentagon was hit and then went straight into another room to make astatement to the media. Rumsfeld gave Larry King a tale that he knew nothingabout the World Trade Center until 15 minutes before the Pentagon was hit, andclaims no one told him that plane was coming. \"So how could I order a response?\"is the obvious implication. Myers says that he was in a pre-arranged meeting with asenator throughout the period between the first strike on the World Trade Centerand the crash, almost an hour later, into the Pentagon. Isn't that all so terriblyconvenient? Another key question is where was Father George Bush, the"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"264This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.orchestrator, with Cheney, of the Boy George \"Presidency\"? He admits himself thathe was at the White House the night before, but says he flew to St Paul,Minneapolis, the next morning. What time the next morning? The first plane to behijacked was Flight 11 at about 8.15. Two planes had crashed into the World TradeCenter by 9.03 and, if Flight 93 had not been delayed well over half an hour beforetake-off, it is highly probable that all four aircraft would have hit their targets byaround 9.40. What were Father Bush and Cheney doing while all this was going on?Where were the ground-to-air defences?There is one other massive red flag also, which provides yet more confirmation, asif it were needed, that the attacks of September 11th were allowed to happen by thevery authorities that are, in retaliation, waging a global war on terrorism. While Iwas on a speaking tour in Australia a few weeks after 9/11, I was told by a manwho is involved with the computer systems of the Australian military that hiscountry's forces were on full alert status immediately the World Trade Center washit. That makes it more than an hour before America, the target of the attacks, wasput on the same status by George Bush once he had finished with the pet goat andarrived at Air Force One. But the Australian contact told me something else. Hesaid that the Australian Parliament building in Canberra is protected from airattack by hidden ground-to-air missiles. He said that the procedure is as follows:when an aircraft enters the protected airspace around the parliament building thepilot is contacted immediately by a computer system that demands he or shepunch in a code authorising the plane to fly into that airspace. If this is not done inseconds, the contact told me, the computer launches a missile to blow the planefrom the sky. Even at the G-8 Summit in Genoa, Italy, in July 2001 airspace wasclosed over the city and defended with ground-to-air missiles. My Australiancontact said he knew for a fact that the Pentagon and Washington DC in generalare defended by an even more sophisticated missile system than Canberra, butworks in basically the same way. It is obvious that this would be the case and it hasbeen openly accepted that a ground-to-air system is in place to defend the WhiteHouse. TheGlobe and Mailnewspaper in Canada provided one of the rare mentionsof the Pentagon system. It reported: \"Meanwhile, there was no explanation of howfour airliners could be hijacked and flown - in at least two cases hundreds ofkilometres and for nearly an hour - without being successfully intercepted. Thatone ploughed into the Pentagon, supposedly protected by surface-to-air missiles,dramatically demonstrated US vulnerability.\"55Why weren't those missileslaunched to stop the Pentagon crash? The same reason that the FAA, NORAD andthe Defense Department did not scramble fighter jets, or at least not in time. Theyweren't meant to.An insider speaksAfter I had originally completed this chapter I came across an investigative websitethat claims to have conducted a phone interview on December 9th 2001 with amember of the US Air Force based in New York.

But he said that after thesealerts and requests for action were received from Air Traffic Control and the FAA,orders from the \"highest level of the executive branch of the federal governmentwere received, demanding that the Air Force stand down and not follow throughwith established scramble-intercept procedures that morning until further notice\".56This Air Force contact was unnamed, but then, to be fair, how could he have been?People will just have to decide for themselves if what he is claimed to have saidrings true. But it is a scenario that does fit what happened that morning and makessense of the apparently nonsensical lack of response.No planes were scrambled to intercept the hijacked planes (either at all or intime) and no ground-to-air defences were activated to save the lives of those whodied inside the Pentagon and the World Trade Center. Some would call thisincompetence. But staggering as that alone would be, what happened on September11th is far more than that. It was calculated mass murder. The first position taken bythe authorities is that there was nothing they could have done. That is what theyreally want you to believe. The second, when that doesn't work, is to let you thinkthey were incompetent. Both positions are designed to hide the truth - the truth thatwhat we are looking at here amid the explosion of lies and diversions is notincompetence at all. This was orchestrated incompetence in which forces at, andbehind, the highest levels of the United States government and military wereintervening to stop the system working as it normally would. To stop thousands ofpeople going home to their families that September day because it suited the sickagenda for those people to die and for the world to watch it all live on television.But these same forces did not only allow the atrocities to happen. They madethem happen, too.SOURCES1New York Times,September 15th 20012Newsday,September 23rd 20013https://www.cheyennemountain.af.mil4CNN.com,Pentagon Never Considered Downing Stewart's Learjet, President Would Have toMake Decision, October26th 1999"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"266\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want.
