In different ways, at different times, the peoples inhabiting Eurasia— though mostly those from its Western European periphery—pe netrated and dominated the world's other regions as individual Eurasian states attained the special sta tus and enjoyed the privileges of being the world's premier powers. The last decade of the twentieth century has wi tnessed a tectonic shift in world affairs. For the first time ever, a non-Eurasian power has emerged not only as the ke y arbiter of Eurasian power relations but also as t he world's paramount power. The defeat and collapse of the Soviet Union was the final step in the rapid ascendance of a Western Hemisphere power, the Unite d States, as the sole and, indeed, the first truly global power. Eurasia, however, retains its geopolitical impo rtance. Not only is its western periphery—Europe—st ill the location of much of the world's political and econo mic power, but its eastern region— Asia—has lately become a vital center of economic growth and rising politi cal influence. Hence, the issue of how a globally e ngaged America copes with the complex Eurasian power relat ionships— and particularly whether it prevents the emergence of a dominant and antagonistic Eurasian p ower—remains central to America's capacity to exerc ise global primacy. It follows that—in addition to cultivating the various novel dimensions of power (technology, communications, information, as well as trade and f inance)—American foreign policy must remain concern ed with the geopolitical dimension and must employ its influence in Eurasia in a manner that creates a st able continental equilibrium, with the United States as the political arbiter. Eurasia is thus the chessboard on which the stru ggle for global primacy continues to be played, and that struggle involves geostrategy—the strategic managem ent of geopolitical interests. It is noteworthy tha t as recently as 1940 two aspirants to global power, Ado lf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, agreed explicitly (in the secret negotiations of November of that year) that America should be excluded from Eurasia. Each realized tha t the injection of American power into Eurasia would prec lude his ambitions regarding global domination. Eac h shared the assumption that Eurasia is the center of the world and that he who controls Eurasia control s the world. A half century later, the issue has been red efined: will America's primacy in Eurasia endure, a nd to what ends might it be applied? The ultimate objective of American policy should be benign and visionary: to shape a truly cooperat ive global community, in keeping with long-range trends and wi th the fundamental interests of humankind. But in t he meantime, it is imperative that no Eurasian challen ger emerges, capable of dominating Eurasia and thus also of challenging America. The formulation of a comprehen sive and integrated Eurasian geostrategy is therefo re the purpose of this book. Zbigniew Brzezinski Washington, D.C. April 1997"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Chapter 1. Hegemony of a New Type HEGEMONY is AS OLD AS MANKIND. But America's curren t global supremacy is distinctive in the rapidity of its emergence, in its global scope, and in the manner of its exercise. In the course of a single century, America has transformed itself—and has also been tr ansformed by international dynamics—from a country relatively isolated in the Western Hemisphere into a power of unprecedented worldwide reach and grasp. THE SHORT ROAD TO GLOBAL SUPREMACY The Spanish-American War in 1898 was America's firs t overseas war of conquest. It thrust American powe r far into the Pacific, beyond Hawaii to the Philippines. By the turn of the century, American strategists w ere already busy developing doctrines for a two-ocean naval sup remacy, and the American navy had begun to challeng e the notion that Britain \"rules the waves.\" American cla ims of a special status as the sole guardian of the Western Hemisphere's security—proclaimed earlier in the cen tury by the Monroe Doctrine and subsequently justif ied by America's alleged \"manifest destiny\"—were even furt her enhanced by the construction of the Panama Cana l, which facilitated naval domination over both the At lantic and Pacific Oceans. The basis for America's expanding geopolitical a mbitions was provided by the rapid industrializatio n of the country's economy. By the outbreak of World War I, America's growing economic might already accounted for about 33 percent of global GNP, which displaced Gre at Britain as the world's leading industrial power. This remarkable economic dynamism was fostered by a cult ure that favored experimentation and innovation. America's political institutions and free market ec onomy created unprecedented opportunities for ambit ious and iconoclastic inventors, who were not inhibited from pursuing their personal dreams by archaic privileg es or rigid social hierarchies. In brief, national cultur e was uniquely congenial to economic growth, and by attracting and quickly assimilating the most talented individu als from abroad, the culture also facilitated the e xpansion of national power. World War I provided the first occasion for the massive projection of American military force into Europe. A heretofore relatively isolated power promptly trans ported several hundred thousand of its troops acros s the Atlantic—a transoceanic military expedition unprece dented in its size and scope, which signaled the em ergence of a new major player in the international arena. J ust as important, the war also prompted the first m ajor American diplomatic effort to apply American princi ples in seeking a solution to Europe's internationa l problems. Woodrow Wilson's famous Fourteen Points r epresented the injection into European geopolitics of American idealism, reinforced by American might. (A decade and a half earlier, the United States had p layed a leading role in settling a Far Eastern conflict bet ween Russia and Japan, thereby also asserting its g rowing international stature.) The fusion of American idea lism and American power thus made itself fully felt on the world scene. Strictly speaking, however, World War I was sti ll predominantly a European war, not a global one. But its self-destructive character marked the beginning of the end of Europe's political, economic, and cultur al preponderance over the rest of the world. In the co urse of the war, no single European power was able to prevail decisively — and the war's outcome was heav ily influenced by the entrance into the conflict of the rising non-European power, America. Thereafter, Eur ope would become increasingly the object, rather th an the subject, of global power politics. However, this brief burst of American global le adership did not produce a continuing American enga gement in world affairs. Instead, America quickly retreate d into a self-gratifying combination of isolationis m and idealism. Although by the mid-twenties and early th irties totalitarianism was gathering strength on th e European continent, American power—by then includin g a powerful two-ocean fleet that clearly outmatche d the British navy—remained disengaged. Americans pre ferred to be bystanders to global politics. Consistent with that predisposition was the Ame rican concept of security, based on a view of Ameri ca as a continental island. American strategy focused on sh eltering its shores and was thus narrowly national in scope, with little thought given to international or globa l considerations. The critical international player s were still the European powers and, increasingly, Japan."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" The European era in world politics came to a fi nal end in the course of World War II, the first tr uly global war. Fought on three continents simultaneously, wit h the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans also heavily contested, its global dimension was symbolically de monstrated when British and Japanese soldiers— representing, respectively, a remote Western Europe an island and a similarly remote East Asian island— collided thousands of miles from their homes on the Indian-Burmese frontier. Europe and Asia had becom e a single battlefield. Had the war's outcome been a clear-cut victory for Nazi Germany, a single European power might the n have emerged as globally preponderant. (Japan's victory in the Pacific would have gained for that nation th e dominant Far Eastern role, but in all probability, Japan would still have remained only a regional heg e-mon.) Instead, Germany's defeat was sealed largely by the two extra-European victors, the United States and the Soviet Union, which became the successors to Europe 's unfulfilled quest for global supremacy. The next fifty years were dominated by the bipol ar American-Soviet contest for global supremacy. In some respects, the contest Between the United States and the Soviet Union represented the fulfillment of th e geopoliticians' fondest theories: it pitted the wor ld's leading maritime power, dominant over both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans, against the world's leading land power, paramount on the Eurasian heartland (w ith the Sino-Soviet bloc encompassing a space remarkably re miniscent of the scope of the Mongol Empire). The geopolitical dimension could not have been clearer: North America versus Eurasia, with the world at st ake. The winner would truly dominate the globe. There was no one else to stand in the way, once victory was fin ally grasped. Each rival projected worldwide an ideological ap peal that was infused with historical optimism, tha t justified for each the necessary exertions while reinforcing its conviction in inevitable victory. Each rival wa s clearly dominant within its own space—unlike the imperial E uropean aspirants to global hegemony, none of which ever quite succeeded in asserting decisive preponde rance within Europe itself. And each used its ideol ogy to reinforce its hold over its respective vassals and tributaries, in a manner somewhat reminiscent of th e age of religious warfare. The combination of global geopolitical scope and the proclaimed universality of the competing dogma s gave the contest unprecedented intensity. But an additio nal factor—also imbued with global implications—mad e the contest truly unique. The advent of nuclear weapons meant that a head-on war, of a classical type, bet ween the two principal contestants would not only spell thei r mutual destruction but could unleash lethal conse quences for a significant portion of humanity. The intensit y of the conflict was thus simultaneously subjected to extraordinary self-restraint on the part of both ri vals. In the geopolitical realm, the conflict was wage d largely on the peripheries of Eurasia itself. The Sino-Soviet bloc dominated most of Eurasia but did not control its peripheries. North America succeeded in entrenc hing itself on both the extreme western and extreme east ern shores of the great Eurasian continent. The def ense of these continental bridgeheads (epitomized on the western \"front\" by the Berlin blockade and on the eastern by the Korean War) was thus the first strategic test of what came to be known as the Cold War. In the Cold War's final phase, a third defensive \"front\"—the southern—appeared on Eurasia's map (see map above). The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan precipitated a two-pronged American response: direct U.S. assistance to the native resistance in Afghanistan in order to bog down the Soviet army; and a large-scale buildup of the U.S. military presence in the Persian"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Gulf as a deterrent to any further southward projec tion of Soviet political or military power. The Uni ted States committed itself to the defense of the Persian Gulf region, on a par with its western and eastern Eura sian security interests. The successful containment by North America of t he Eurasian bloc's efforts to gain effective sway o ver all of Eurasia—with both sides deterred until the very end from a direct military collision for fear of a nuc lear war— meant that the outcome of the contest was eventuall y decided by nonmilitary means. Political vitality, ideological flexibility, economic dynamism, and cul tural appeal became the decisive dimensions. The American-led coalition retained its unity, w hereas the Sino-Soviet bloc split within less than two decades. In part, this was due to the democratic coalition's greater flexibility, in contrast to the hierarchic al and dogmatic—but also brittle—character of the Communis t camp. The former involved shared values, but with out a formal doctrinal format. The latter emphasized do gmatic orthodoxy, with only one valid interpretativ e center. America's principal vassals were also significantly weaker than America, whereas the Soviet Union coul d not indefinitely treat China as a subordinate. The outc ome was also due to the fact that the American side proved to be economically and technologically much more dynam ic, whereas the Soviet Union gradually stagnated an d could not effectively compete either in economic gr owth or in military technology. Economic decay in t urn fostered ideological demoralization. In fact, Soviet military power—and the fear it i nspired among westerners—for a long time obscured t he essential asymmetry between the two contestants. Am erica was simply much richer, technologically much more advanced, militarily more resilient and innovative, socially more creative and appealing. Ideological constraints also sapped the creative potential of the Soviet Un ion, making its system increasingly rigid and its e conomy increasingly wasteful and technologically less comp etitive. As long as a mutually destructive war did not break out, in a protracted competition the scales had to tip eventually in America's favor. The final outcome was also significantly influen ced by cultural considerations. The American-led co alition, by and large, accepted as positive many attributes of America's political and social culture. America' s two most important allies on the western and eastern periphe ries of the Eurasian continent, Germany and Japan, both recovered their economic health in the context of a lmost unbridled admiration for all things American. America was widely perceived as representing the future, as a society worthy of admiration and deserving of em ulation. In contrast, Russia was held in cultural contemp t by most of its Central European vassals and even more so by its principal and increasingly assertive eastern al ly, China. For the Central Europeans, Russian domin ation meant isolation from what the Central Europeans con sidered their philosophical and cultural home: West ern Europe and its Christian religious traditions. Wors e than that, it meant domination by a people whom t he Central Europeans, often unjustly, considered their cultural inferior. The Chinese, for whom the word \"Russia\" means \" the hungry land,\" were even more openly contemptuou s. Although initially the Chinese had only quietly con tested Moscow's claims of universality for the Sovi et model, within a decade following the Chinese Communist rev olution they mounted an assertive challenge to Mosc ow's ideological primacy and even began to express openl y their traditional contempt for the neighboring no rthern barbarians. Finally, within the Soviet Union itself, the 50 percent of the population that was non-Russian eve ntually also rejected Moscow's domination. The gradual political awakening of the non-Russians meant that the Ukrai nians, Georgians, Armenians, and Azeris began to view Sovi et power as a form of alien imperial domination by a people to whom they did not feel culturally inferio r. In Central Asia, national aspirations may have b een weaker, but here these peoples were fueled in addit ion by a gradually rising sense of Islamic identity , intensified by the knowledge of the ongoing decolon ization elsewhere. Like so many empires before it, the Soviet Unio n eventually imploded and fragmented, falling victi m not so much to a direct military defeat as to disintegrati on accelerated by economic and social strains. Its fate confirmed a scholar's apt observation that empires are inherently politically unstable because subordi nate units almost always prefer greater autonomy, and counter- elites in such units almost always act, upon opport unity, to"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"obtain greater autonomy. In this sense, empires do not fall; rather, they fall apart, usually very slo wly, though sometimes remarkably quickly.1 1.

THE FIRST GLOBAL POWER The collapse of its rival left the United States in a unique position. It became simultaneously the fi rst and the only truly global power. And yet America's global s upremacy is reminiscent in some ways of earlier emp ires, notwithstanding their more confined regional scope. These empires based their power on a hierarchy of vassals, tributaries, protectorates, and colonies, with thos e on the outside generally viewed as barbarians. To some degree, that anachronistic terminology is not altog ether inappropriate for some of the states currentl y within the American orbit. As in the past, the exercise of Ame rican \"imperial\" power is derived in large measure from superior organization, from the ability to mobilize vast economic and technological resources promptly for military purposes, from the vague but significant c ultural appeal of the American way of life, and fro m the sheer dynamism and inherent competitiveness of the American social and political elites. Earlier empires, too, partook of these attribute s. Rome comes first to mind. Its empire was establi shed over roughly two and a half centuries through sustained territorial expansion northward and then both westw ard and southeastward, as well as through the assertion of effective maritime control over the entire shorelin e of the Mediterranean Sea. In geographic scope, it reached its high point around the year A.D. 211 (see map on page 11). Rome's was a centralized polity and a single s elf-sufficient economy. Its imperial power was exer cised deliberately and purposefully through a complex sys tem of political and economic organization. A strat egically designed system of roads and naval routes, originat ing from the capital city, permitted the rapid rede ployment and concentration—in the event of a major security threat—of the Roman legions stationed in the variou s vassal states and tributary provinces. At the empire's apex, the Roman legions deployed abroad numbered no less than three hundred thousan d men—a remarkable force, made all the more lethal by the Roman superiority in tactics and armaments as well as by the center's ability to direct relatively rap id redeployment. (It is striking to note that in 19 96, the vastly more populous supreme power, America, was protectin g the outer reaches of its dominion by stationing 296,000 professional soldiers overseas.) Rome's imperial power, however, was also derived from an important psychological reality. Civis Romanus sum—\"I am a Roman citizen\"—was the highest possible self-definition, a source of pride, and an aspiration for many. Eventually granted even to those not of Roman birth, the exalted status of the Roman citizen was an expression of cultural superiority that justified the imperial power's sense of mission. It not only legitimated Rome's rule, but it also inclined those subject to it to desire assimilation and inclusion in the imperial structure. Cultural superiority, taken for granted by the rulers and conceded by the subjugated, thus reinforced imperial power."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" That supreme, and largely uncontested, imperial power lasted about three hundred years. With the e xception of the challenge posed at one stage by nearby Carth age and on the eastern fringes by the Parthian Empi re, the outside world was largely barbaric, not well organi zed, capable for most of the time only of sporadic attacks, and culturally patently inferior. As long as the em pire was able to maintain internal vitality and uni ty, the outside world was noncompetitive. Three major causes led to the eventual collapse of the Roman Empire. First, the empire became too l arge to be governed from a single center, but splitting it into western and eastern halves automatically destr oyed the monopolistic character of its power. Second, at the same time, the prolonged period of imperial hubris generated a cultural hedonism that gradually sapped the political elite's will to greatness. Third, su stained inflation also undermined the capacity of the syste m to sustain itself without social sacrifice, which the citizens were no longer prepared to make. Cultural decay, po litical division, and financial inflation conspired to make Rome vulnerable even to the barbarians in its near abroad. By contemporary standards, Rome was not truly a global power but a regional one. However, given the sense of isolation prevailing at the time between the var ious continents of the globe, its regional power wa s self- contained and isolated, with no immediate or even d istant rival. The Roman Empire was thus a world unt o itself,'with its superior political organization an d cultural superiority making it a precursor of lat er imperial systems of even greater geographic scope. Even so, the Roman Empire was not unique. The Ro man and the Chinese empires emerged almost contemporaneously, though neither was aware of the other. By the year 221 B.C. (the time of the Punic Wars between Rome and Carthage), the unification by Chin ' of the existing seven states into the first Chine se empire had prompted the construction of the Great Wall in northern China, to seal off the inner kingdom from the barbarian world beyond. The subsequent Han Empire, which had started to emerge by 140 B.C., was even m ore impressive in scope and organization. By the onset of the Christian era, no fewer than 57 million peop le were subject to its authority. That huge number, itself unprecedented, testified to extraordinarily effecti ve central control, exercised through a centralized and puniti ve bureaucracy. Imperial sway extended to today's K orea, parts of Mongolia, and most of today's coastal Chin a. However, rather like Rome, the Han Empire also b ecame afflicted by internal ills, and its eventual collap se was accelerated by its division in A.D. 220 into three independent realms. China's further history involved cycles of reun ification and expansion, followed by decay and frag mentation. More than once, China succeeded in establishing imp erial systems that were self-contained, isolated, a nd unchallenged externally by any organized rivals. Th e tripartite division of the Han realm was reversed in A.D. 589, with something akin to an imperial system reemerging. But the period of China's greatest imperial self-assertion came under the Manchus, specifically during the early Ch'ing dynasty. By the eighteenth century, China was once again a full-fledged empire, with the imperial center surrounded by vassal and tributary states, including today's Korea, Indochina, Thailand, Burma, and Nepal. China's sway thus extended from today's Russian Far East all the way across southern Siberia to Lake Baikal and into contemporary Kazakstan, then southward toward the Indian Ocean, and then back east across Laos and northern Vietnam (see map on page 14). As in the Roman case, the empire was a complex financial, economic, educational,"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"and security organization. Control over the large t erritory and the more than 300 million people livin g within it was exercised through all these means, with a stron g emphasis on centralized political authority, supp orted by a remarkably effective courier service. The entire em pire was demarcated into four zones, radiating from Peking and delimiting areas that could be reached by couri er within one week, two weeks, three weeks, and fou r weeks, respectively. A centralized bureaucracy, pro fessionally trained and competitively selected, pro vided the sinews of unity. That unity was reinforced, legitimated, and sus tained—again, as in the case of Rome—by a strongly felt and deeply ingrained sense of cultural superiority that was augmented by Confucianism, an imperially exped ient philosophy, with its stress on harmony, hierarchy, and discipline. China—the Celestial Empire—was seen as the center of the universe, with only barbarians on its peripheries and beyond. To be Chinese meant to be cultured, and for that reason, the rest of the worl d owed China its due deference. That special sense of superiority permeated the response given by the Chi nese emperor—even in the phase of China's growing decline, in the late eighteenth century—to King Geo rge III of Great Britain, whose emissaries had atte mpted to inveigle China into a trading relationship by offer ing some British industrial products as goodwill gi fts: We, by the Grace of Heaven, Emperor, instruct the K ing of England to take note of our charge: The Celestial Empire, ruling all within the fou r seas . . . does not value rare and precious thing s ... nor do we have the slightest need of your country's man ufactures.... Hence we ... have commanded your tribute envoys to re-tiirn safely home. You, O King, should simply act in conformity with our wishes by strengt hening your loyalty and swearing perpetual obedience. The decline and fall of the several Chinese empi res was also primarily due to internal factors. Mon gol and later occidental \"barbarians\" prevailed because int ernal fatigue, decay, hedonism, and loss of economi c as well as military creativity sapped and then accelerated the collapse of Chinese will. Outside powers exploi ted China's internal malaise—Britain in the Opium War o f 1839-1842, Japan a century later—which, in turn, generated the profound sense of cultural humiliatio n that has motivated the Chinese throughout the twe ntieth century, a humiliation all the more intense because of the collision between their ingrained sense of cultural superiority and the demeaning political realities o f postimperial China. Much as in the case of Rome, imperial China wou ld be classified today as a regional power. But in its heyday, China had no global peer, in the sense that no other power was capable of challenging its impe rial status or even of resisting its further expansion i f that had been the Chinese inclination. The Chines e system was self-contained and self-sustaining, based prima rily on a shared ethnic identity, with relatively l imited projection of central power over ethnically alien a nd geographically peripheral tributaries. The large and dominant ethnic core made it poss ible for China to achieve periodic imperial restora tion. In that respect, China was quite unlike other empires, in which numerically small but hege-monically moti vated peoples were able for a time to impose and maintain domination over much larger ethnically alien popul ations. However, once the domination of such small-core emp ires was undermined, imperial restoration was out o f the question. To find a somewhat closer analogy to today's de finition of a global power, we must turn to the rem arkable phenomenon of the Mongol Empire. Its emergence was achieved through an intense struggle with major and well-organized opponents. Among those defeated were the kingdoms of Poland and Hungary, the forces of the Holy Roman Empire, several Russian and Rus' princip alities, the Caliphate of Baghdad, and later, even the Sung dynasty of China. Genghis Khan and his successors, by defeating t heir regional rivals, established centralized contr ol over the territory that latter-day scholars oi geopolitics h ave identified as the global heartland, or the pivo t for world power. Their Eurasian continental empire ranged fro m the shores of the China Sea to Anatolia in Asia M inor and to Central Europe (see map). It was not until t he heyday of the Stalinist Sino-Soviet bloc that th e Mongol"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Empire on the Eurasian continent was finally matche d, insofar as the scope of centralized control over contiguous territory is concerned. The Roman, Chinese, and Mongol empires were regional precursors of subsequent aspirants to global power. In the case of Rome and China, as already noted, their imperial structures were highly developed, both politically and economically, while the widespread acceptance of the cultural superiority of the center exercised an important cementing role. In contrast, the Mongol Ê ťťť -plre sustained political control by relying more directly on military conquest followed by adaptation (and even assimilation) to local conditions. Mongol imperial power was largely based on military domination. Achieved through the brilliant and ruthless application of superior military tactics that combined a remarkable capacity for rapid movement o f forces with their timely concentration, Mongol ru le entailed no organized economic or financial system, nor was Mongol authority derived from any assertiv e sense of cultural superiority. The Mongol rulers were too thin numerically to represent a self-regenerating ruling class, and in any case, the absence of a defined an d self-conscious sense of cultural or even ethnic s uperiority deprived the imperial elite of the needed subjectiv e confidence. In fact, the Mongol rulers proved quite suscept ible to gradual assimilation by the often culturall y more advanced peoples they had conquered. Thus, one of t he grandsons of Genghis Khan, who had become the emperor of the Chinese part of the great Khan's rea lm, became a fervent propagator of Confucianism; an other became a devout Muslim in his capacity as the sulta n of Persia; and a third became the culturally Pers ian ruler of Central Asia. It was that factor—assimilation of the rulers b y the ruled because of the absence of a dominant po litical culture—as well as unresolved problems of successio n to the great Khan who had founded the empire, tha t caused the empire's eventual demise. The Mongol rea lm had become too big to be governed from a single center, but the solution attempted—dividing the emp ire into several self-contained parts—prompted stil l more rapid local assimilation and accelerated the imperi al disintegration. After lasting two centuries, fro m 1206 to 1405, the world's largest land-based empire disappe ared without a trace. Thereafter, Europe became both the locus of glob al power and the focus of the main struggles for gl obal power. Indeed, in the course of approximately three centuries, the small northwestern periphery of the Eurasian continent attained—through the projection of mariti me power and for the first time ever—genuine global domination as European power reached, and asserted itself on, every continent of the globe. It is note worthy that the Western European imperial hegemons were de mographically not very numerous, especially when compared to the numbers effectively subjugated. Yet by the beginning of the twentieth century, outside of the Western Hemisphere (which two centuries earlier had also been subject to Western European control and which was inhab-ed predominantly by European emigrants an d their descendants), only China, Russia, the Ottom an Empire, and Ethiopia were free of Western Europe's domination (see map on page 18)."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" However, Western European domination was not tant amount to the attainment of global power by Western Europe. The essential reality was that of Europe's civilizational global supremacy and of fragmented E uropean continental power. Unlike the land conquest of the Eurasian heartland by the Mongols or by the subsequ ent ussian Empire, European overseas imperialism was at tained through ceaseless transoceanic exploration a nd the expansion of maritime trade. This process, however, also involved a continuous struggle among the lead ing European states not only for the overseas dominions but for hegemony within Europe itself. The geopo-l itically consequential fact was that Europe's global hegemon y did not derive from hegemony in Europe by any sin gle European power. Broadly speaking, until the middle of the sevent eenth century, Spain was the paramount European pow er. By the late fifteenth century, it had also emerged as a major overseas imperial power entertaining global ambitions. Religion served as a unifying doctrine and as a sou rce of imperial missionary zeal. Indeed, it took pa pal arbitration between Spain and its maritime rival, P ortugal to codify a formal division of the world in to Spanish and Portuguese colonial spheres in the Treaties of Tordesilla (1494) and Saragossa 1529). Nonetheless, faced by English, French, and Dutch challenges, Spain was never able to assert genuine supremacy either in W estern Europe itself or across the oceans. Spain's preeminence gradually gave way to that of France. Until 1815, France was the dominant Euro pean power, though continuously checked by its European rivals, both on the continent and overseas. Under Napoleon, France came close to establishing true he gemony over Europe. Had it succeeded, it might have also gained the status of the dominant global power. How ever, its defeat by a European coalition reestablis hed the continental balance of power."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" For the next century, until World War I, Great B ritain exercised global maritime domination as Lond on became the world's principal financial and trading center and the British navy \"ruled the waves.\" Grea t Britain was clearly paramount overseas, but like the earlie r European aspirants to global hegemony, the Britis h Empire could not single-handedly dominate Europe. Instead, Britain relied on an intricate balance-of-power di plomacy and eventually on an Anglo-French entente to preven t continental domination by either Russia or German y. The overseas British Empire was initially acqu ired through a combination of exploration, trade, a nd conquest. But much like its Roman and Chinese prede cessors or its French and Spanish rivals, it also d erived a great deal of its staying power from the perception of British cultural superiority. That superiority was not only a matter of subjective arrogance on the part of the imperial ruling class but was a perspective shared by many of the non-British subjects. In the words of South Afr ica's first black president, Nelson Mandela: \"I was brought up in a British school, and at the time Britain was the home of everything that was best in the world. I have not discarded the influence which Britain and British h istory and culture exercised on us.\" Cultural super iority, successfully asserted and quietly conceded, had the effect of reducing the need to rely on large milit ary forces to maintain the power of the imperial center. By 19 14, only a few thousand British military personnel and civil servants controlled about 11 million square miles a nd almost 400 million non-British peoples (see map on page 20). In brief, Rome exercised its sway largely throu gh superior military organization and cultural appe al. China relied heavily on an efficient bureaucracy to rule an empire based on shared ethnic identity, reinforc ing its control through a highly developed sense of cultura l superiority. The Mongol Empire combined advanced military tactics for conquest with an inclination t oward assimilation as the basis for rule. The Briti sh (as well as the Spanish, Dutch, and French) gained preeminence as their flag followed their trade, their control l ikewise reinforced by superior military organization and cu ltural assertiveness. But none of these empires wer e truly global. Even Great Britain was not a truly global p ower. It did not control Europe but only balanced i t. A stable Europe was crucial to British international preemin ence, and Europe's self-destruction inevitably mark ed the end of British primacy."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" In contrast, the scope and pervasiveness of Am erican global power today are unique. Not only does the United States control all of the world's oceans and seas, but it has developed an assertive military c apability for amphibious shore control that enables it to project its power inland in politically significant ways. Its military legions are firmly perched on the western and easte rn extremities of Eurasia, and they also control th e Persian Gulf. American vassals and tributaries, some yearni ng to be embraced by even more formal ties to Washi ngton, dot the entire Eurasian continent, as the map on pa ge 22 shows. America's economic dynamism provides the necess ary precondition for the exercise of global primacy . Initially, immediately after World War II, America' s economy stood apart from all others, accounting a lone for more than 50 percent of the world's GNP. The econom ic recovery of Western Europe and Japan, followed b y the wider phenomenon of Asia's economic dynamism, m eant that the American share of global GNP eventual ly had to shrink from the disproportionately high leve ls of the immediate postwar era. Nonetheless, by th e time the subsequent Cold War had ended, America's share of g lobal GNP, and more specifically its share of the w orld's manufacturing output, had stabilized at about 30 pe rcent, a level that had been the norm for most of t his century, apart from those exceptional years immedia tely after World War II. More important, America has maintained and has even widened its lead in exploiting the latest scie ntific breakthroughs for military purposes, thereby creati ng a technologically peerless military establishmen t, the only one with effective global reach. All the while, it has maintained its strong competitive advantage in the economically decisive information technologies. Ame rican mastery in the cutting-edge sectors of tomorr ow's economy suggests that American technological domina tion is not likely to be undone soon, especially gi ven that in the economically decisive fields, Americans are maintaining or even widening their advantage i n productivity over their Western European and Japane se rivals. To be sure, Russia and China are powers that re sent this American hegemony. In early 1996, they jo intly stated as much in the course of a visit to Beijing by Russia's President Boris Yeltsin. Moreover, they possess nuclear arsenals that could threaten vital U.S. int erests. But the brutal fact is that for the time be ing, and for some time to come, although they can initiate a sui cidal nuclear war, neither one of them can win it. Lacking the ability to project forces over long distances i n order to impose their political will and being te chnologically much more backward than America, they do not have t he means to exercise—nor soon attain—sustained political clout worldwide."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" In brief, America stands supreme in the four de cisive domains of global power, militarily, it has an unmatched global reach; economically, it remains th e main locomotive of global growth, even if challen ged in some aspects by Japan and Germany (neither of which enjoys the other attributes of global might); technologically, it retains the overall lead in the cutting-edge areas of innovation; and culturally, despite some crassness, it enjoys an appeal that is unrivaled, e specially among the world's youth—all of which give s the United States a political clout that no other state comes close to matching. It is the combination of all four that makes America the only comprehensive global superpo wer. THE AMERICAN GLOBAL SYSTEM Although America's international preeminence unavoi dably evokes similarities to earlier imperial syste ms, the differences are more essential. They go beyond the question of territorial scope. American global powe r is exercised through a global system of distinctively American design that mirrors the domestic American experience. Central to that domestic experience is the pluralistic character of both the American soci ety and its political system. The earlier empires were built by aristocratic p olitical elites and were in most cases ruled by ess entially authoritarian or absolutist regimes. The bulk of th e populations of the imperial states were either po litically indifferent or, in more recent times, infected by i mperialist emotions and symbols. The quest for nati onal glory, \"the white man's burden,\" \"la mission civilisatrice ,\" not to speak of the opportunities for personal p rofit—all served to mobilize support for imperial adventures and to sustain essentially hierarchical imperial po wer pyramids. The attitude of the American public toward the e xternal projection of American power has been much more ambivalent. The public supported America's engageme nt in World War II largely because of the shock eff ect of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The engagement of the United States in the Cold War was initially endorsed more reluctantly, until the Berlin blockad e and the subsequent Korean War. After the Cold War had ended, the emergence of the United States as the si ngle global power did not evoke much public gloatin g but rather elicited an inclination toward a more limite d definition of American responsibilities abroad. P ublic opinion polls conducted in 1995 and 1996 indicated a general public preference for \"sharing\" global po wer with others, rather than for its monopolistic exercise. Because of these domestic factors, the American global system emphasizes the technique of co-optat ion (as in the case of defeated rivals—Germany, Japan, and lately even Russia) to a much greater extent than t he earlier imperial systems did. It likewise relies heavily on the indirect exercise of influence on dependent fo reign elites, while drawing much benefit from the appeal of its d emocratic principles and institutions. All of the f oregoing are reinforced by the massive but intangible impact of the American domination of global communication s, popular entertainment, and mass culture and by the potentially very tangible clout of America's techno logical edge and global military reach. Cultural domination has been an underappreciate d facet of American global power. Whatever one may think of its aesthetic values, America's mass culture exe rcises a magnetic appeal, especially on the world's youth. Its attraction may be derived from the hedonistic quali ty of the lifestyle it projects, but its global app eal is undeniable. American television programs and films account for about three-fourths of the global marke t. American popular music is equally dominant, while A merican fads, eating habits, and even clothing are increasingly imitated worldwide. The language of th e Internet is English, and an overwhelming proporti on of the global computer chatter also originates from Am erica, influencing the content of global conversati on. Lastly, America has become a Mecca for those seekin g advanced education, with approximately half a mil lion foreign students flocking to the United States, wit h many of the ablest never returning home. Graduate s from American universities are to be found in almost eve ry Cabinet on every continent. The style of many foreign democratic politician s also increasingly emulates the American. Not only did John F. Kennedy find eager imitators abroad, but even mo re recent (and less glorified) American political l eaders have become the object of careful study and politic al imitation. Politicians from cultures as disparat e as the Japanese and the British (for example, the Japanese prime minister of the mid-1990s, Ryutaro Hashimoto , and the British prime minister, Tony Blair—and note the \"Tony,\" imitative of \"Jimmy\" Carter, \"Bill\" Clinto n, or"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"\"Bob\" Dole) find it perfectly appropriate to copy B ill Clinton's homey mannerisms, populist common tou ch, and public relations techniques. Democratic ideals, associated with the American political tradition, further reinforce what some p erceive as America's \"cultural imperialism.\" In the age of the most massive spread of the democratic form of gove rnment, the American political experience tends to serve as a standard for emulation. The spreading emphasis worldwide on the centrality of a written constituti on and on the supremacy of law over political exped iency, no matter how short-changed in practice, has drawn upo n the strength of American constitutionalism. In re cent times, the adoption by the former Communist countri es of civilian supremacy over the military (especia lly as a precondition for NATO membership) has also been ver y heavily influenced by the U.S. system of civil-mi litary relations. The appeal and impact of the democratic American political system has also been accompanied by the growing attraction of the American entrepreneurial economic model, which stresses global free trade an d uninhibited cohnpetition. As the Western welfare st ate, including its German emphasis on \"codeterminat ion\" between entrepreneurs and trade unions, begins to l ose its economic momentum, more Europeans are voici ng the opinion that the more competitive and even ruth less American economic culture has to be emulated i f Europe is not to fall further behind. Even in Japan , greater individualism in economic behavior is bec oming recognized as a necessary concomitant of economic s uccess. The American emphasis on political democracy and economic development thus combines to convey a simple ideological message that appeals to many: th e quest for individual success en-hnnees freedom wh ile generating wealth. The resulliiiK blend of idealism and egoism is a potent combination. Individual sel f- fulfillment is said to be a God-given right that at the same time can benefit others by setting an exa mple and by generating wealth. It is a doctrine that attracts t he energetic, the ambitious, and the highly competi tive. As the imitation of American ways gradually per vades the world, it creates a more congenial settin g for the exercise of the indirect and seemingly consensual A merican hegemony. And as in the case of the domesti c American system, that hegemony involves a complex s tructure of interlocking institutions and procedure s, designed to generate consensus and obscure asymmetr ies in power and influence. American global suprema cy is thus buttressed by an elaborate system of allian ces and coalitions that literally span the globe. The Atlantic alliance, epitomized institutional ly by NATO, links the most productive and influenti al states of Europe to America, making the United States a key p articipant even in intra-European affairs. The bila teral political and military ties with Japan bind the mos t powerful Asian economy to the United States, with Japan remaining (at least for the time being) essentially an American protectorate. America also participate s in such nascent trans-Pacific multilateral organizations as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC) , making itself a key participant in that region's af fairs. The Western Hemisphere is generally shielded from outside influences, enabling America to play the ce ntral role in existing hemispheric multilateral org anizations. Special security arrangements in the Persian Gulf, especially after the brief punitive mission in 1991 against Iraq, have made that economically vital region into an American military preserve. Even the former Sov iet space is permeated by various American-sponsored ar rangements for closer cooperation with NATO, such a s the Partnership for Peace. In addition, one must consider as part of the A merican system the global web of specialized organi zations, especially the \"international\" financial institutio ns. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the W orld Bank can be said to represent \"global\" interests, a nd their constituency may be construed as the world . In reality, however, they are heavily American dominat ed and their origins are traceable to American init iative, particularly the Bret-Ion Woods Conference of 1944. Unlike earlier empires, this vast and complex g lobal system is not a hierarchical pyramid. Rather, America stands at the center of an interlocking universe, o ne in which power is exercised through continuous b argaining, dialogue, diffusion, and quest for formal consensus , even though that power originates ultimately from a single source, namely, Washington, D.C. And that is where the power game has to be played, and played accordi ng to America's domestic rules. Perhaps the highest compl iment that the world pays to the centrality of the democratic process in American global hegemony is t he degree to which foreign countries are themselves"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"drawn into the domestic American political bargaini ng. To the extent that they can, foreign government s strive to mobilize those Americans with whom they share a special ethnic or religious identity. Most foreign governments also employ American lobbyists to advan ce their case, especially in Congress, in addition to approximately one thousand special foreign interest groups registered as active in America's capital. American ethnic communities also strive to influence U.S. fo reign policy, with the Jewish, Greek, and Armenian lobbies standing out as the most effectively organized. American supremacy has thus produced a new inter national order that not only replicates but institu tionalizes abroad many of the features of the American system itself. Its basic features include • a collective security system, including integrate d command and forces (NATO, the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, and so forth); • regional economic cooperation (APEC, NAFTA [North Amer ican Free Trade Agreement]) and specialized global cooper ative institutions (the W orld Bank, IMF, WTO [World Trade Organization]); • procedures that emphasize consensual decision mak ing, even if dominated by the United States; • a preference for democratic membership within key alliances; • a rudimentary global constitutional and judicial structure (ranging from the World Court to a specia l tribunal to try Bosnian war crimes). Most of that system emerged during the Cold War , as part of America's effort to contain its global rival, the Soviet Union. It was thus ready-made for global app lication, once that rival faltered and America emer ged as the first and only global power. Its essence has be en well encapsulated by the political scientist G. John Ikenberry: It was hegemonic in the sense that it was centered around the United States and reflected American- styled political mechanisms and organizing principl es. It was a liberal order in that it was legitimat e and marked by reciprocal interactions. Europeans [one m ay also add, the Japanese] were able to reconstruct and integrate their societies and economies in ways that were congenial with American hegemony but also with room to experiment with their own autonom ous and semi-independent political systems . . . The evolution of this complex system served to \"dom esticate\" relations among the major Western states. There have been tense conflicts between these state s from time to time, but the important point is tha t conflict has been contained within a deeply embedde d, stable, and increasingly articulated political order. ... The threat of war is off the table.2 Currently, this unprecedented American global h egemony has no rival. But will it remain unchalleng ed in the years to come? 2.

The Eurasian Chessboard FOR AMERICA, THE CHIEF geopolitical prize is Eurasi a. For half a millennium, world affairs were dominated by Eurasian powers and peoples who fought with one another for regional domination and reach ed out for global power. Now a non-Eurasian power is p reeminent in Eurasia—and America's global primacy i s directly dependent on how long and how effectively its preponderance on the Eurasian continent is sust ained. Obviously, that condition is temporary. But its duration, and what follows it, is of critical impo rtance not only to America's well-being but more generally to international peace. The sudden emergence of the fi rst and only global power has created a situation in which an equally quick end to its supremacy—either becaus e of America's withdrawal from the world or because of t he sudden emergence of a successful rival—would produce massive international instability. In effec t, it would prompt global anarchy. The Harvard poli tical scientist Samuel P. Huntington is right in boldly a sserting: A world without U.S. primacy will be a world with m ore violence and disorder and less democracy and economic growth than a world where the United State s continues to have more influence than any other country in shaping global affairs. The sustained in ternational primacy of the United States is central to the welfare and security of Americans and to the fu ture of freedom, democracy, open economies, and international order in the world.1 1. Samuel P. Huntington. \"Why International Primacy Matters,\" International Security (Spring 1993):83. In that context, how America \"manages\" Eurasia is critical. Eurasia is the globe's largest contine nt and is geopolitically axial. A power that dominates Eurasi a would control two of the world's three most advan ced and economically productive regions. A mere glance at t he map also suggests that control over Eurasia woul d almost automatically entail Africa's subordination, rendering the Western Hemisphere and Oceania geopolitically peripheral to the world's central co ntinent (see map on page 32). About 75 percent of t he world's people live in Eurasia, and most of the world's phy sical wealth is there as well, both in its enterpri ses and underneath its soil. Eurasia accounts for about 60 percent of the world's GNP and about three-fourths of the world's known energy resources (see tables on page 33)."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" Eurasia is also the location of most of the wor ld's politically assertive and dynamic states.

Cumulatively, Eurasia's power vastly overshadows America's. Fortu nately for America, Eurasia is too big to be politi cally one. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" Eurasia is thus the chessboard on which the struggle for global primacy continues to be played. Although geostrategy—the strategic management of geopolitical interests—may be compared to chess, the somewhat oval-shaped Eurasian chessboard engages not just two but several players, each possessing differing amounts of power. The key players are located on the chessboard's west, east, center, and south. Both the western and the eastern extremities of the chessboard contain densely populated regions, organized on relatively congested space into several powerful states. In the case of Eurasia's small western periphery, American power is deployed directly on it. The far eastern mainland is the seat of an increasi ngly powerful and independent player, controlling a n enormous population, while the territory of its ene rgetic rival—confined on several nearby islands—and half of a small far-eastern peninsula provide a perch for A merican power. Stretching between the western and eastern extre mities is a sparsely populated and currently politi cally fluid and organizationally fragmented vast middle space t hat was formerly occupied by a powerful rival to U. S. preeminence—a rival that was once committed to the goal of pushing America out of Eurasia. To the sout h of that large central Eurasian plateau lies a politica lly anarchic but energy-rich region of potentially great importance to both the western and the eastern Eura sian states, including in the southernmost area a h ighly populated aspirant to regional hegemony. This huge, oddly shaped Eurasian chessboard—ext ending from Lisbon to Vladivostok—provides the sett ing for \"the game.\" If the middle space can be drawn in creasingly into the expanding orbit of the West (wh ere America preponderates), if the southern region is n ot subjected to domination by a single player, and if the East is not unified in a manner that prompts the expulsi on of America from its offshore bases, America can then be said to prevail. But if the middle space rebuffs th e West, becomes an assertive single entity, and eit her gains control over the South or forms an alliance with th e major Eastern actor, then America's primacy in Eu rasia shrinks dramatically. The same would be the case if the two major Eastern players were somehow to unit e. Finally, any ejection of America by its Western par tners from its perch on the western periphery would automatically spell the end of America's participat ion in the game on the Eurasian chessboard, even th ough that would probably also mean the eventual subordination of the western extremity to a revived player occup ying the middle space. The scope of America's global hegemony is admit tedly great, but its depth is shallow, limited by b oth domestic and external restraints. American hegemony involves the exercise of decisive influence but, u nlike the empires of the past, not of direct control. The ver y scale and diversity of Eurasia, as well as the po wer of some of its states, limits the depth of American influen ce and the scope of control over the course of even ts. That megacontinent is just too large, too populous, cult urally too varied, and composed of too many histori cally ambitious and politically energetic states to be co mpliant toward even the most economically successfu l and politically preeminent global power. This condition places a premium on geostrategic skill, on the car eful, selective, and very deliberate deployment of Americ a's resources on the huge Eurasian chessboard. It is also a fact that America is too democratic at home to be autocratic abroad. This limits the u se of America's power, especially its capacity for milita ry intimidation. Never before has a populist democr acy attained international supremacy, lint the pursuit of power is not a goal that commands popular passio n, except in conditions of a sudden threat or challenge to th e public's sense of domestic well-being. The econom ic self- denial (that is, defense spending) and the human sa crifice (casualties even among professional soldier s) required in the effort are uncongenial to democrati c instincts. Democracy is inimical to imperial mobi lization."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" Moreover, most Americans by and large do not de rive any special gratification from their country's new status as the sole global superpower. Political \"tr iumphalism\" connected with America's victory in the Cold War has generally tended to receive a cold receptio n and has been the object of some derision on the p art of the more liberal-minded commentators. If anything, two rather varying views of the implications for Americ a of its historic success in the competition with the former Soviet Union have been politically more appealing: on the one hand, there is the view that the end of the Col d War justifies a significant reduction in America' s global engagement, irrespective of the consequences for Am erica's global standing; and on the other hand, the re is the perspective that the time has come for genuine inte rnational multilateralism, to which America should even yield some of its sovereignty. Both schools of thou ght have commanded the loyalty of committed constituencies. Compounding the dilemmas facing the American lea dership are the changes in the character of the glo bal situation itself: the direct use of power now tends to be more constrained than was the case in the pa st. Nuclear weapons have dramatically reduced the utility of wa r as a tool of policy or even as a threat. The grow ing economic interdependence among nations is making th e political exploitation of economic blackmail less compelling. Thus maneuver, diplomacy, coalition bui lding, co-optation, and the very deliberate deploym ent of one's political assets have become the key ingredie nts of the successful exercise of geostrategic powe r on the Eurasian chessboard. GEOPOLITICS AND GEOSTRATEGY The exercise of American global primacy must be sen sitive to the fact that political geography remains a critical consideration in international affairs. Na poleon reportedly once said that to know a nation's geography was to know its foreign policy. Our understanding o f the importance of political geography, however, m ust adapt to the new realities of power. For most of the history of international affair s, territorial control was the focus of political c onflict. Either national self-gratification over the acquisition of larger territory or the sense of national deprivat ion over the loss of \"sacred\" land has been the cause of most of the bloody wars fought since the rise of nationali sm. It is no exaggeration to say that the territorial imperative has been the main impulse driving the aggressive b ehavior of nation-states. Empires were also built through the careful seizure and retention of vital geographic a ssets, such as Gibraltar or the Suez Canal or Singapore, which served as key choke points or linchpins in a system of imperial control. The most extreme manifestation of the linkage b etween nationalism and territorial possession was p rovided by Nazi Germany and imperial Japan. The effort to b uild the \"one-thousand-year Reich\" went far beyond the goal of reuniting all German-speaking peoples under one political roof and focused also on the desire to control \"the granaries\" of Ukraine as well as other Slavic lands, whose populations were to provide cheap slav e labor for the imperial domain. The Japanese were similarl y fixated on the notion that direct territorial pos session of Manchuria, and later of the important oil-producing Dutch East Indies, was essential to the fulfillmen t of the Japanese quest for national power and global status . In a similar vein, for centuries the definition o f Russian national greatness was equated with the acquisition of territory, and even at the end of the twentieth century, the Russian insistence on retaining control over such n on-Russian people as the Chechens, who live around a vital oil pipeline, has been justified by the claim that such control is essential to Russia's status as a g reat power. Nation-states continue to be the basic units of the world system. Although the decline in big-powe r nationalism and the fading of ideology has reduced the emotional content of global politics—while nucl ear weapons have introduced major restraints on the use of force—competition based on territory still domi nates world affairs, even if its forms currently tend to be more civil. In that competition, geographic loca tion is still the point of departure for the definition of a nati on-state's external priorities, and the size of nat ional territory also remains one of the major criteria of status an d power. However, for most nation-states, the issue of te rritorial possession has lately been waning in sali ence. To the extent that territorial disputes are still importan t in shaping the foreign policy of some states, the y are more a matter of resentment over the denial of self-determ ination to ethnic brethren said to be deprived of t he right to"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"join the \"motherland\" or a grievance over alleged m istreatment by a neighbor of ethnic minorities than they are a quest for enhanced national status through territ orial enlargement. Increasingly, the ruling national elites have co me to recognize that factors other than territory a re more crucial in determining the international status of a state or the degree of its international influence. Econo mic prowess, and its translation into technological innovation, can also be a key criterion of power. Japan provide s the supreme example. Nonetheless, geographic location s till tends to determine the immediate priorities of a state— and the greater its military, economic, and politic al power, the greater the radius, beyond its immedi ate neighbors, of that state's vital geopolitical inter ests, influence, and involvement. Until recently, the leading analysts of geopolit ics have debated whether land power was more signif icant than sea power and what specific region of Eurasia is vi tal to gain control over the entire continent. One of the most prominent, Harold Mackinder, pioneered the discussi on early in this century with his successive concep ts of the Eurasian \"pivot area\" (which was said to include al l of Siberia and much of Central Asia) and, later, of the Central-East European \"heartland\" as the vital spri ngboards for the attainment of continental dominati on. He popularized his heartland concept by the famous dic tum: Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland; Who rules the Heartland commands the World-Island; Who rules the World-Island commands the world. Geopolitics was also invoked by some leading German political geographers to justify their country's \" Drang nach Osten,\" notably with Karl Haushofer adapting M ackinder's concept to Germany's strategic needs. It s much-vulgarized echo could also be heard in Adolf H itler's emphasis on the German people's need for \"L ebens- raum.\" Other European thinkers of the first half of this century anticipated an eastward shift in the geopolitical center of gravity, with the Pacific region—and spec ifically America and Japan—becoming the likely inhe ritors of Europe's fading domination. To forestall such a shift, the French political geographer Paul Demange on, as well as other French geopoliticians, advocated grea ter unity among the European states even before Wor ld War II. Today, the geopolitical issue is no longer what geographic part of Eurasia is the point of departu re for continental domination, nor whether land power is m ore significant than sea power. Geopolitics has mov ed from the regional to the global dimension, with pre ponderance over the entire Eurasian continent servi ng as the central basis for global primacy. The United States , a non-Eurasian power, now enjoys international pr imacy, with its power directly deployed on three peripheri es of the Eurasian continent, from which it exercis es a powerful influence on the states occupying the Eura sian hinterland. But it is on the globe's most impo rtant playing field—Eurasia—that a potential rival to Ame rica might at some point arise. Thus, focusing on t he key players and properly assessing the terrain has to b e the point of departure for the formulation of Ame rican geostrategy for the long-term management of America 's Eurasian geopolitical interests. Two basic steps are thus required: • first, to identify the geostrategically dynamic E urasian states that have the power to cause a poten tially important shift in the international distribution o f power and to decipher the central external goals of their respective political elites and the likely co nsequences of their seeking to attain them; and to pinpoint the geopolitically critical Eurasian state s whose location and/or existence have catalytic ef fects either on the more active geostrategic players or o n regional conditions; • second, to formulate specific U.S. policies to of fset, co-opt, and/or control the above, so as to pr eserve and promote vital U.S. interests, and to conceptual ize a more comprehensive geostrategy that establish es on a global scale the interconnection between the m ore specific U.S. policies. "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" In brief, for the United States, Eurasian geostr ategy involves the purposeful management of geostra tegically dynamic states and the careful handling of geopolit ically catalytic states, in keeping with the twin i nterests of America in the short-term preservation of its uniqu e global power and in the long-run transformation o f it into increasingly institutionalized global cooperation. To put it in a terminology that hearkens back to th e more brutal age of ancient empires, the three grand impe ratives of imperial geostrategy are to prevent coll usion and maintain security dependence among the vassals, to keep tributaries pliant and protected, and to keep the barbarians from coming together. GEOSTRATEGIC PLAYERS AND GEOPOLITICAL PIVOTS Active geostrategic players are the states that hav e the capacity and the national will to exercise po wer or influence beyond their borders in order to alter—to a degree that affects America's interests—the exis ting geopolitical state of affairs. They have the potent ial and/or the predisposition to be geopolitically volatile. For whatever reason—the quest for national grandeur, id eological fulfillment, religious messianism, or eco nomic aggrandizement—some states do seek to attain region al domination or global standing. They are driven b y deeply rooted and complex motivations, best explain ed by Robert Browning's phrase: \"... a man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for?\" They thu s take careful stock of America's power, determine the extent to which their interests overlap or collide with America, and shape their own more limited Eura sian objectives, sometimes in collusion but sometimes in conflict with America's policies. To the Eurasian states so driven, the United States must pay special attentio n. Geopolitical pivots are the states whose import ance is derived not from their power and motivation but rather from their sensitive location and from the conseque nces of their potentially vulnerable condition for the behavior of geostrategic players. Most often, geopo litical pivots are determined by their geography, w hich in some cases gives them a special role either in defi ning access to important areas or in denying resour ces to a significant player. In some cases, a geopolitical p ivot may act as a defensive shield for a vital stat e or even a region. Sometimes, the very existence of a geopolit ical pivot can be said to have very significant pol itical and cultural consequences for a more active neighboring geostrategic player. The identification of the pos t-Cold War key Eurasian geopolitical pivots, and protectin g them, is thus also a crucial aspect of America's global geostrategy. It should also be noted at the outset that alth ough all geostrategic players tend to be important and powerful countries, not all important and powerful countries are automatically geostrategic players. Thus, whil e the identification of the geostrategic players is thus relatively easy, the omission from the list that fo llows of some obviously important countries may require more just ification. In the current global circumstances, at least f ive key geostrategic players and five geopolitical pivots (with two of the latter perhaps also partially qualifying as players) can be identified on Eurasia's new pol itical map. France, Germany, Russia, China, and India are major and active players, whereas Great Britain, Japan, and Indonesia, while admittedly very important countrie s, do not so qualify. Ukraine, Azerbaijan, South Ko rea, Turkey, and Iran play the role of critically import ant geopolitical pivots, though both Turkey and Ira n are to some extent—within their more limited capabilities— also geostrategically active. More will be said abo ut each in subsequent chapters. At this stage, suffice it to say that in the wes tern extremity of Eurasia the key and dynamic geost rategic players are France and Germany. Both of them are mo tivated by a vision of a united Europe, though they differ on how much and in what fashion such a Europe shoul d remain linked to America. But both want to shape something ambitiously new in Europe, thus altering the status quo. France in particular has its own ge ostrategic concept of Europe, one that differs in some signifi cant respects from that of the United States, and i s inclined to engage in tactical maneuvers designed to play off R ussia against America and Great Britain against Ger many, even while relying on the Franco-German alliance to offset its own relative weakness. Moreover, both France and Germany are powerful enough and assertive enough to exercise influence w ithin a wider regional radius. France not only seeks a ce ntral political role in a unifying Europe but also sees itself as the nucleus of a Mediterranean-North African cluste r of states that share common concerns. Germany is increasingly conscious of its special status as Eur ope's most important state—as the area's economic l ocomotive"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"and the emerging leader of the European Union (EU). Germany feels it has a special responsibility for the newly emancipated Central Europe, in a manner vague ly reminiscent of earlier notions of a German-led Mitteleuropa. Moreover, both France and Germany con sider themselves entitled to represent European int erests in dealings with Russia, and Germany even retains, because of its geographic location, at least theore tically, the grand option of a special bilateral accommodation w ith Russia. In contrast, Great Britain is not a geostrategic player. It has fewer major options, it entertains no ambitious vision of Europe's future, and its relative decline has also reduced its capacity to play the traditio nal role of the European balancer. Its ambivalence regarding Europe an unification .and its attachment to a waning spec ial relationship with America have made Great Britain i ncreasingly irrelevant insofar as the major choices confronting Europe's future are concerned. London h as largely dealt itself out of the European game. Sir Roy Denman, a former British senior official in the European Commission, recalls in his memoirs that as early as the 1955 conference in Messina, which prev iewed the formation of a European Union, the offici al spokesman for Britain flatly asserted to the assemb led would-be architects of Europe: The future treaty which you are discussing has no c hance of being agreed; if it was agreed, it would have no chance of being applied. And if it was appl ied, it would be totally unacceptable to Britain.. .. au revoir et bonne chance.2 More than forty years later, the above dictum r emains essentially the definition of the basic Brit ish attitude toward the construction of a genuinely united Europ e. Britain's reluctance to participate in the Econo mic and Monetary Union, targeted for January 1999, reflects the country's unwillingness to identify British de stiny with that of Europe. The substance of that attitude was well summarized in the early 1990s as follows: • Britain rejects the goal of political unification . • Britain favors a model of economic integration ba sed on free trade. • Britain prefers foreign policy, security, and def ense coordi nation outside the EC [European Community] framework. • Britain has rarely maximized its influence with t he EC.3 Great Britain, to be sure, still remains import ant to America. It continues to wield some degree o f global influence through the Commonwealth, but it is neith er a restless major power nor is it motivated by an ambitious vision. It is America's key supporter, a very loyal ally, a vital military base, and a close partner in critically important intelligence activities. Its f riendship needs to be nourished, but its policies d o not call for sustained attention. It is a retired geostrategic p layer, resting on its splendid laurels, largely dis engaged from the great European adventure in which France and German y are the principal actors. 2. Roy Denman, Missed Chances (London: Cassell, 199 6). 3. In Robert Skidelsky's contribution on \"Great Bri tain and the New Europe,\" in From the Atlantic to t he Urals, ed. David P. Calleo and Philip H. Gordon (Arlington , Va.: 1992), p. 145. The other medium-sized European states, with most b eing members of NATO and/or the European Union, either follow America's lead or quietly line up beh ind Germany or France. Their policies do not have a wider regional impact, and they are not in a position to alter their basic alignments. At this stage, they a re neither geostrategic players nor geopolitical pivots. The s ame is true of the most important potential Central European member of NATO and the EU, namely, Poland. Poland i s too weak to be a geostrategic player, and it has only one option: to become integrated into the West. Mor eover, the disappearance of the old Russian Empire and Poland's deepening ties with both the Atlantic alli ance and the emerging Europe increasingly give Pola nd historically unprecedented security, while confinin g its strategic choices. Russia, it hardly needs sa ying, remains a major geostrategic player, in spite of it s weakened state and probably prolonged malaise. It s very presence impacts massively on the newly independent states within the vast Eurasian space of the forme r Soviet"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Union. It entertains ambitious geopolitical objecti ves, which it increasingly proclaims openly. Once i t has recovered its strength, it will also impact signifi cantly on its western and eastern neighbors. Moreov er, Russia has still to make its fundamental geostrategic choi ce regarding its relationship with America: is it a friend or foe? It may well feel that it has major options on the Eurasian continent in that regard. Much depends on how its internal politics evolve and especially on whet her Russia becomes a European democracy or a Eurasi an empire again. In any case, it clearly remains a pla yer, even though it has lost some of its \"pieces,\" as well as some key spaces on the Eurasian chessboard. Similarly, it hardly needs arguing that China is a major player. China is already a significant reg ional power and is likely to entertain wider aspirations, given its history as a major power and its view of the C hinese state as the global center. The choices China makes are a lready beginning to affect the geopolitical distrib ution of power in Asia, while its economic momentum is bound to give it both greater physical power and increas ing ambitions. The rise of a \"Greater China\" will not l eave the Taiwan issue dormant, and that will inevit ably impact on the American position in the Far East. Th e dismantling of the Soviet Union has also created on the western edge of China a series of states, regarding which the Chinese leaders cannot be indifferent. T hus, Russia will also be much affected by China's more a ctive emergence on the world scene. The eastern periphery of Eurasia poses a parado x. Japan is clearly a major power in world affairs, and the American-Japanese alliance has often—and correctly— been defined as America's most important bilateral relationship. As one of the very top economic power s in the world, Japan clearly possesses the potenti al for the exercise of first-class political power. Yet it doe s not act on this, eschewing any aspirations for re gional domination and preferring instead to operate under American protection. Like Great Britain in the case of Europe, Japan prefers not to become engaged in the politics of the Asian mainland, though at least a p artial reason for this is the continued hostility of many fellow Asians to any Japanese quest for a regionall y preeminent political role. This self-restrained Japanese political profile in turn permits the United States to play a centra l security role in the Far East. Japan is thus not a geostrategic p layer, though its obvious potential for quickly bec oming one— especially if either China or America were suddenly to alter its current policies—imposes on the Unite d States a special obligation to carefully nurture the America n-Japanese relationship. It is not Japanese foreign policy that America must watch, but it is Japan's self-restrain t that America must very subtly cultivate. Any sign ificant reduction in American-Japanese political ties would impact directly on the region's stability. The case for not listing Indonesia as a dynamic geostrategic player is easier to make. In Southeas t Asia, Indonesia is the most important country, but even i n the region itself, its capacity for projecting si gnificant influence is limited by the relatively underdevelop ed state of the Indonesian economy, its continued i nternal political uncertainties, its dispersed archipelago, and its susceptibility to ethnic conflicts that ar e exacerbated by the central role exercised in its internal financia l affairs by the Chinese minority. At some point, I ndonesia could become an important obstacle to Chinese south ward aspirations. That eventuality has already been recognized by Australia, which once feared Indonesi an expansionism but lately has begun to favor close r Australian-Indonesian security cooperation. But a p eriod of political consolidation and continued econ omic: success is needed before Indonesia can be viewed as the regionally dominant actor. In contrast, India is in the process of establis hing itself as a regional power and views itself as potentially a major global player as well. It also sees itself as a rival to China. That may be a matter of overesti mating its own long-term capabilities, but India is unquestion ably the most powerful South Asian state, a regiona l hege- mon of sorts. It is also a semisecret nuclear power , and it became one not only in order to intimidate Pakistan but especially to balance China's possession of a n uclear arsenal. India has a geostrate-gic vision of its regional role, both vis-a-vis its neighbors and in the India n Ocean. However, its ambitions at this stage only peripherally intrude on America's Eurasian interests, and thus, as a geostrategic player, India is not—at least, no t to the same degree as either Russia or China—a source of geopol itical concern. Ukraine, a new and important space on the Eurasi an chessboard, is a geopolitical pivot because its very existence as an independent country helps to transf orm Russia. Without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be a Eurasian empire. Russia without Ukraine can still strive for imperial status, but it would then become a predom inantly Asian imperial state, more likely to be drawn into debilitating conflicts with aroused Central Asians, who would"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"then be resentful of the loss of their recent indep endence and would be supported by their fellow Isla mic states to the south. China would also be likely to oppose any restoration of Russian domination over Central Asia, given its increasing interest in the newly independ ent states there. However, if Moscow regains contro l over Ukraine, with its 52 million people and major resou rces as well as its access to the Black Sea, Russia automatically again regains the wherewithal to beco me a powerful imperial state, spanning Europe and A sia. Ukraine's loss of independence would have immediate consequences for Central Europe, transforming Pola nd into the geopolitical pivot on the eastern frontier of a united Europe. Despite its limited size and small population, A zerbaijan, with its vast energy resources, is also geopolitically critical. It is the cork in the bottle containing t he riches of the Caspian Sea basin and Central Asia . The independence of the Central Asian states can be ren dered nearly meaningless if Azerbaijan becomes full y subordinated to Moscow's control. Azerbaijan's own and very significant oil resources can also be subj ected to Russian control, once Azerbaijan's independence has been nullified. An independent Azerbaijan, linked to Western markets by pipelines that do not pass throu gh Russian-controlled territory, also becomes a maj or avenue of access from the advanced and energy-consu ming economies to the energy rich Central Asian republics. Almost as much as in the case of Ukraine , the future of Azerbaijan and Central Asia is also crucial in defining what Russia might or might not become. Turkey and Iran are engaged in establishing som e degree of influence in the Caspian Sea-Central As ia region, exploiting the retraction of Russian power. For that reason, they might be considered as geost rategic players. However, both states confront serious dome stic problems, and their capacity for effecting maj or regional shifts in the distribution of power is lim ited. They are also rivals and thus tend to negate each other's influence. For example, in Azerbaijan, where Turkey has gained an influential role, the Iranian postur e (arising out of concern over possible Azeri national stirrin gs within Iran itself) has been more helpful to the Russians. Both Turkey and Iran, however, are primarily im portant geopolitical pivots. Turkey stabilizes the Black Sea region, controls access from it to the Mediterranea n Sea, balances Russia in the Caucasus, still offer s an antidote to Muslim fundamentalism, and serves as th e southern anchor for NATO. A destabilized Turkey w ould be likely to unleash more violence in the southern Balkans, while facilitating the reimposition of Rus sian control over the newly independent states of the Ca ucasus. Iran, despite the ambiguity of its attitude toward Azerbaijan, similarly provides stabilizing support for the new political diversity of Central Asia. It dominates the eastern shoreline of the Persian Gulf, while it s independence, irrespective of current Iranian hos tility toward the United States, acts as a barrier to any long-te rm Russian threat to American interests in the Pers ian Gulf region. Finally, South Korea is a Far Eastern geopoliti cal pivot. Its close links to the United States ena ble America to shield Japan and thereby to keep Japan from becomin g an independent and major military power, without an overbearing American presence within Japan itself. Any significant change- in South Korea's status, ci ther through unification and/or through a shift into an expanding Chinese sphere of influence, would necess arily alter dramatically America's role in the Far East, thus altering Japan's as well. In addition, South K orea's growing economic power also makes it a more importa nt \"space\" in its own right, control over which bec omes increasingly valuable. The above list of geostrategic players and geopo litical pivots is neither permanent nor fixed. At t imes, some states might have to be added or subtracted. Certai nly, in some respects, the case could be made that Taiwan, or Thailand, or Pakistan, or perhaps Kazakstan or Uzbe kistan should also be included in the latter catego ry. However, at this stage, the case for none of the ab ove seems compelling. Changes in the status of any of them would represent major events and involve some shift s in the distribution of power, but it is doubtful that the catalytic consequences would be far-reaching. The o nly exception might involve the issue of Taiwan, if one chooses to view it apart from China. Even then, tha t issue would only arise if China were to use major force to conquer the island, in successful defiance of the U nited States, thereby threatening more generally Am erica's political credibility in the Far East. The probabil ity of such a course of events seems low, but that consideration still has to be kept in mind when framing U.S. poli cy toward China. "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"CRITICAL CHOICES AND POTENTIAL CHALLENGES The identification of the central players and key p ivots helps to define America's grand policy dilemm as and to anticipate the potential major challenges on the Eu rasian supercontinent. These can be summarized, bef ore more comprehensive discussion in subsequent chapter s, as involving five broad issues: • What kind of Europe should America prefer and hen ce promote? • What kind of Russia is in America's interest, and what and how much ran America do nhoul it? • What are the prospects for the emergence in Centr al Eurasia of a new Balkans,\" and what should America do to minimize the resulting risks? • What role should China be encouraged to assume in the Far East, and what are the implications of the foregoing not only for the United States but also f or Japan? • What new Eurasian coalitions are possible, which might be most dangerous to U.S. interests, and what needs to be done to preclude them? The United States has always professed its fide lity to the cause of a united Europe. Ever since th e days of the Kennedy administration, the standard invocation has been that of \"equal partnership.\" Official Washing ton has consistently proclaimed its desire to see Europe em erge as a single entity, powerful enough to share w ith America both the responsibilities and the burdens o f global leadership. That has been the established rhetoric on the s ubject. But in practice, the United States has been less clear and less consistent. Does Washington truly desire a Europe that is a genuinely equal partner in world affairs, or does it prefer an unequal alliance? For example, is the United States prepared to share leadership wit h Europe in the Middle East, a region not only much closer g eographically to Europe than to America but also on e in which several European states have long-standing in terests? The issue of Israel instantly comes to min d. U.S.- European differences over Iran and Iraq have also b een treated by the United States not as an issue be tween equals but as a matter of insubordination. Ambiguity regarding the degree of American supp ort for European unity also extends to the issue of how European unity is to be defined, especially concern ing which country, if any, should lead a united Eur ope. Washington has not discouraged London's divisive po sture regarding Europe's integration, though Washin gton has also shown a clear preference for German—rather than French— leadership in Europe. That is understandable, given the traditional thrust of Fre nch policy, but the preference has also had the eff ect of encouraging the occasional appearance of a lactical Franco-British entente in order to thwart Germany, as well as periodic French flirtation with Moscow in order to offset the American-German coalition. The emergence of a truly united Europe—especial ly if that should occur with constructive American support—will require significant changes in the str ucture and processes of the NATO alliance, the prin cipal link between America and Europe. NATO provides not only the main mechanism for the exercise of U.S. influen ce regarding European matters but the basis for the po litically critical American military presence in We stern Europe. However, European unity will require that s tructure to adjust to the new reality of an allianc e based on two more or less equal partners, instead of an alli ance that, to use traditional terminology, involves essentially a hegemon and its vassals. That issue has so far been largely skirted, despite the modest steps taken in 1996 to enhance within NATO the role of the Western Europea n Union (WEU), the military coalition of the Wester n European states. A real choice in favor of a united Europe will thus compel a far-reaching reordering of NATO, inevitably reducing the American primacy within the alliance. In brief, a long-range American geostrategy for Europe will have to address explicitly the issues of European unity and real partnership with Europe. An America that truly desires a united and hence also a more independent Europe will have to throw its weight be hind those European forces that are genuinely commi tted to Europe's political and economic integration. Such a strategy will also mean junking the last vestiges of the once-hallowed U.S.-U.K. special relationship."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" A policy for a united Europe will also have to a ddress—though jointly with the Europeans—the highly sensitive issue of Europe's geographic scope. How f ar eastward,should the European Union extend? And s hould the eastern limits of the EU be synonymous with the eastern front line of NATO? The former is more a m atter for a European decision, but a European decision on that issue will have direct implications for a NAT O decision. The latter, however, engages the United S tates, and the U.S. voice in NATO is still decisive . Given the growing consensus regarding the desirability of ad-milling the nations of Central Europe into both the EU and NATO, the practical meaning of this question fo cuses attention on the future status of the Baltic republics and perhaps also that of Ukraine. There is thus an important overlap between the European dilemma discussed above and the second one pertaining to Russia. It is easy to respond to the question regarding Russia's future by professing a preference for a democratic Russia, closely linked to Europe. Presumably, a democratic Russia would be more sympa thetic to the values shared by America and Europe and henc e also more likely to become a junior partner in sh aping a more stable and cooperative Eurasia. But Russia's a mbitions may go beyond the attainment of recognitio n and respect as a democracy. Within the Russian foreign policy establishment (composed largely of former So viet officials), there still thrives a deeply ingrained desire for a special Eurasian role, one that would consequently entail the subordination to Moscow of the newly ind ependent post-Soviet states. In that context, even friendly western policy i s seen by some influential members of the Russian p olicy- making community as designed to deny Russia its rig htful claim to a global status. As two Russian geopoliticians put it: [T]he United States and the NATO countries—while sp aring Russia's self-esteem to the extent possible, but nevertheless firmly and consistently—are destro ying the geopolitical foundations which could, at least in theory, allow Russia to hope to acquire th e status as the number two power in world politics that belonged to the Soviet Union. Moreover, America is seen as pursuing a policy in w hich the new organization of the European space that is being engineered by the West is, in essence, built on the idea of supporting, in this part of the world, new, relatively small and weak national states thro ugh their more or less close rapprochement with NATO, t he EC, and so forth.4 4. A. Bogaturov and V. Kremenyuk (both senior schol ars in the Institute of the United States and Canad a), in \"Current Relations and Prospects for Inter-.•iclior i Between Russia and the United States,\" Nezavisima ya Gazeta, June 28, 1966. The above quotations define, well—even though wi lli some animus—the dilemma that the United Slates laces. To what extent should Russia be helped econo mically—which inevitably strengthens Russia politic ally and militarily—and to what extent should the newly independent states be simultaneously assisted in th e defense and consolidation of their independence? Ca n Russia be both powerful and a democracy at the sa me time? If it becomes powerful again, will it not see k to regain its lost imperial domain, and can it th en be both an empire and a democracy? U.S. policy toward the vital geopolitical pivot s of Ukraine and Azerbaijan cannot skirt that issue , and America thus faces a difficult dilemma regarding ta ctical balance and strategic purpose. Internal Russ ian recovery is essential to Russia's democratization a nd eventual Europeanization. But any recovery of it s imperial potential would be inimical to both of these object ives. Moreover, it is over this issue that differen ces could develop between America and some European states, e specially as the EU and NATO expand. Should Russia be considered a candidate for eventual membership i n either structure? And what then about Ukraine? Th e costs of the exclusion of Russia could be high—creating a self-fulfilling prophecy in the Russian mindset—bu t the results of dilution of either the EU or NATO could also be quite destabilizing. Another major uncertainty looms in the large an d geopoliti-cally fluid space of Central Eurasia, m aximized by the potential vulnerability of the Turkish-Irani an pivots. In the area demarcated on the following map from Crimea in the Black Sea directly eastward along the new southern frontiers of Russia, all the way to t he Chinese"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"province of Xinjiang, then down to the Indian Ocean and thence westward to the Red Sea, then northward to the eastern Mediterranean Sea and back to Crimea, l ive about 400 million people, located in some twent y-five states, almost all of them ethnically as well as re ligiously heterogeneous and practically none of the m politically stable. Some of these states may be in the process of acquiring nuclear weapons. This huge region, torn by volatile hatreds and s urrounded by competing powerful neighbors, is likel y to be a major battlefield, both for wars among nation-state s and, more likely, for protracted ethnic and relig ious violence. Whether India acts as a restraint or whet her it takes advantage of some opportunity to impos e its will on Pakistan will greatly affect the regional scope of the likely conflicts. The internal strains withi n Turkey and Iran are likely not only to get worse but to greatl y reduce the stabilizing role these states are capa ble of playing within this volcanic region. Such developments will in turn make it more difficult to assimilate the n ew Central Asian states into the international community, whil e also adversely affecting the American-dominated s ecurity of the Persian Gulf region. In any case, both Ameri ca and the international community may be faced her e with a challenge that will dwarf the recent crisis in th e former Yugoslavia. A possible challenge to American primacy from Islamic fundamentalism could be part of the problem in this unstable region. By exploiting religious hostility to the American way of life and taking advantage of the Arab-Israeli conflict, Islamic fundamentalism could undermine several pro-Western Middle Eastern governments and eventually jeopardize American regional interests, especially in the Persian Gulf. However, without political cohesion and in the absence of a single genuinely powerful Islamic state, a challenge from Islamic fundamentalism would lack a geopolitical core and would thus be more likely to express itself through diffuse violence. A geostrategic issue of crucial importance is posed by China's emergence as a major power. The most appealing outcome would be to co-o pt a democratizing and free-marketing China into a large r Asian regional framework of cooperation. But supp ose China does not democratize but continues to grow in economic and military power? A \"Greater China\" may be emerging, whatever the desires and calculations of its neighbors, and any effort to prevent that from happening could entail an intensifying conflict with China. S uch a conflict could strain American-Japanese relat ions—for it is far from certain that Japan would want to fol low America's lead in containing China—and could th erefore have potentially revolutionary consequences for Tok yo's definition of Japan's regional role, perhaps e ven resulting in the termination of the American presen ce in the Far East. However, accommodation with China will also exac t its own price. To accept China as a regional powe r is not a matter of simply endorsing a mere slogan. The re will have to be substance to any such regional preeminence. To put it very directly, how large a C hinese sphere of influence, and where, should Ameri ca be prepared to accept as part of a policy of successfu lly co-opting China into world affairs? What areas now outside of China's political radius might have to b e conceded to the realm of the reemerging Celestial Empire? In that context, the retention of the American p resence in South Korea becomes especially important . Without it, it is difficult to envisage the American-Japane se defense arrangement continuing in its present fo rm, for Japan would have to become militarily more self-suf ficient. But any movement toward Korean reunificati on is likely to disturb the basis for the continued U.S. military presence in South Korea. A reunified Korea may choose not to perpetuate American military protecti on; that, indeed, could be the price exacted by Chi na for"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"throwing its decisive weight behind the reunificati on of the peninsula. In brief, U.S. management of i ts relationship with China will inevitably have direct consequences for the stability of the American-Jap anese- Korean triangular security relationship. Finally, some possible contingencies involving future political alignments should also be briefly noted, subject to fuller discussion in pertinent chapters. In the past, international affairs were largely do minated by contests among individual states for regional domin ation. Henceforth, the United States may have to de termine how to cope with regional coalitions that seek to p ush America out of Eurasia, thereby threatening Ame rica's status as a global power. However, whether any such coalitions do or do not arise to challenge America n primacy will in fact depend to a very large degree on how effectively the United States responds to th e major dilemmas identified here. Potentially, the most dangerous scenario would be a grand coalition of China, Russia, and perhaps Iran, an \"antihegemonic\" coalition united not by ideology bu t by complementary grievances. It would be reminisc ent in scale and scope of the challenge once posed by the Sino-Soviet bloc, though this time China would like ly be the leader and Russia the follower. Averting this conti ngency, however remote it may be, will require a di splay of U.S. geostrategic skill on the western, eastern, an d southern perimeters of Eurasia simultaneously. A geographically more limited but potentially ev en more consequential challenge could involve a Sin o- Japanese axis, in the wake of a collapse of the Ame rican position in the Far East and a revolutionary change in Japan's world outlook. It would combine the power o f two extraordinarily productive peoples, and it co uld exploit some form of \"Asianism\" as a unifying anti- American doctrine. However, it does not appear like ly that in the foreseeable future China and Japan will form an alliance, given their recent historical experie nce; and a farsighted American policy in the Far East should c ertainly be able to prevent this eventuality from o ccurring. Also quite remote, but not to be entirely exclud ed, is the possibility of a grand European realignm ent, involving either a German-Russian collusion or a Fr anco-Russian entente. There are obvious historical precedents for both, and either could emerge if Eur opean unification were to grind to a halt and if re lations between Europe and America were to deteriorate grav ely. Indeed, in the latter eventuality, one could i magine a European-Uussian accommodation to exclude America f rom the continent. At this stage, all of these vari ants seem improbable. They would require not only a mass ive mishandling by America of its European policy b ut also a dramatic reorientation on the part of the ke y European states. Whatever the future, it is reasonable to conclud e that American primacy on the Eurasian continent w ill be buffeted by turbulence and perhaps at least by spor adic violence. America's primacy is potentially vul nerable to new challenges, either from regional contenders or novel constellations. The currently dominant Americ an global system, within which \"the threat of war is o ff the table,\" is likely to be stable only in those parts of the world in which American primacy, guided by a long-t erm geostrategy, rests on compatible and congenial sociopolitical systems, linked together by American -dominated multilateral frameworks."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Chapter 3. The Democratic Bridgehead EUROPE is AMERICA'S NATURAL ALLY. It shares the sam e values; partakes, in the main, of the same religious heritage; practices the same democratic p olitics; and is the original homeland of a large ma jority of Americans. By pioneering in the integration of nati on-states into a shared supranational economic and eventually political union, Europe is also pointing the way toward larger forms of postnational organi zation, beyond the narrow visions and the destructive passi ons of the age of nationalism. It is already the mo st multilaterally organized region of the world (see c hart on page 58). Success in its political unificat ion would create a single entity of about 400 million people, living under a democratic roof and enjoying a stan dard of living comparable to that of the United States. Suc h a Europe would inevitably be a global power. Europe also serves as the springboard for the pr ogressive expansion of democracy deeper into Eurasi a. Europe's expansion eastward would consolidate the d emocratic victory of the 1990s. It would match on t he political and economic plane the essential civiliza tional scope of Europe—what has been called the Pet rine Europe—as defined by Europe's ancient and common re ligious heritage, derived from Western-rite Christianity. Such a Europe once existed, long befo re the age of nationalism and even longer before th e recent division of Europe into its American- and Soviet-do minated halves. Such a larger Europe would be able to exercise a magnetic attraction on the states locate d even farther east building a network of ties with Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia drawing them into increasingly binding cooperation while proselytizing common democratic principles. Eventually, such a Europe co uld become one of the vital pillars of an American- sponsored larger Eurasian structure of security and cooperation. But first of all, Europe is America's essenti al geopolitical bridgehead on the Eurasian continen t. America's geostrategic stake in Europe is enormous. Unlike Am erica's links with Japan the Atlantic alliance entr enches American political influence and military power dir ectly on the Eurasian mainland. At this stage of Am erican- European relations, with the allied European nation s still highly dependent on U.S. security protectio n, any expansion in the scope of Europe becomes automatica lly an expansion in the scope of direct U.S. influe nce as well. Conversely, without close transatlantic ties, America's primacy in Eurasia promptly fades away U S control over the Atlantic Ocean and the ability to project influence and power deeper into Eurasia wou ld be severely circumscribed."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" The problem, however, is that a truly European \"Europe\" as such does not exist. It is a vision, a concept, and a goal but it is not yet reality. Western Europe is already a common market, but it is still far from being a single political entity. A political Europe has yet to eme rge. The crisis in Bosnia offered painful proof of Europe's continued absence, if proof were still needed. The brutal fact is that Western Europe, and increasingl y also Central Europe remains largely an American protecto rate, with its allied states reminiscent of ancient vassals and tributaries. This is not a healthy condition, e ither for America or for the European nations Matters are made worse by a more pervasive decl ine in Europe's internal vitality. Both the legitim acy of the existing socio-economic system and even the surfaci ng sense of European identity appear to be vulnerab le. In a number of European states one can detect a crisis o f confidence and a loss of creative momentum, as we ll as.an inward perspective that is both isolationist and es capist from the larger dilemmas of the world. It is not clear whether most Europeans even want Europe to be a maj or power and whether they are prepared to do what i s needed for it to become one. Even residual European anti-Americanism, currently quite weak, is curious ly cynical: the Europeans deplore American \"hegemony\" but take comfort in being sheltered by it. The political momentum for Europe's unification was once driven by three main impulses: the memorie s of the destructive two world wars, the desire for econ omic recovery, and the insecurity generated by the Soviet threat. By the mid-nineties, however, these impulse s had faded. Economic recovery by and large has bee n achieved; if anything, the problem Europe increasin gly faces is that of an excessively burdensome welf are system that is sapping its economic vitality, while the passionate resistance to any reform by special interests is diverting European political attention inward. The Soviet threat has disappeared, while the desire of some Europeans to gain independence from American tutela ge has not translated into a compelling impulse for continental unification. The European cause has been increasingly sustain ed by the bureaucratic momentum generated by the la rge institutional machinery created by the European Com munity and its successor, the European Union. The i dea of unity still enjoys significant popular support, but it tends to be lukewarm, lacking in passion and a sense of mission. In general, the Western Europe of today co nveys the impression of a troubled, unfocused, comf ortable yet socially uneasy set of societies, not partaking of any larger vision. European unification is incr easingly a process and not a cause. Still, the political elites of two leading Europ ean nations— France and Germany—remain largely comm itted to the goal of shaping and defining a Europe that w ould truly be Europe. They are thus Europe's princi pal architects. Working together, they could construct a Europe worthy of its past and of its potential. B ut each is committed to a somewhat different vision and design , and neither is strong enough to prevail by itself . This condition creates for the United States a s pecial opportunity for decisive intervention. It ne cessitates American engagement on behalf of Europe's unity, fo r otherwise unification could grind to a halt and t hen gradually even be undone. But any effective America n involvement in Europe's construction has to be gu ided by clarify in American thinking regarding what kind of Europe America prefers and is ready to promote— an equal partner or a junior ally—and regarding the ev entual scope of both the European Union and NATO. I t also requires careful management of Europe's two princip al architects. GRANDEUR AND REDEMPTION France seeks reincarnation as Europe; Germany hopes for redemption through Europe. These varying motivations go a long way toward explaining and def ining the substance of the alternative French and G erman designs for Europe. For France, Europe is the means for regaining F rance's past greatness. Even before World War II, s erious French thinkers on international affairs already wo rried about the progressive decline of Europe's cen trality in world affairs. During the several decades of the Co ld War, that worry turned into resentment over the \"Anglo- Saxon\" domination of the West, not to speak of cont empt for the related \"Americanization\" of Western c ulture. The creation of a genuine Europe—in Charles De Gaul le's words, \"from the Atlantic to the Urals\"—was to remedy that deplorable state of affairs. And such a Europe, since it would be led by Paris, would simultaneously regain for France the grandeur that the French still feel remains their nation's specia l destiny."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" For Germany, a commitment to Europe is the basi s for national redemption, while an intimate connec tion to America is central to its security. Accordingly, a Europe more assertively independent of America is n ot a viable option. For Germany, redemption + security = Europe + America. That formula defines Germany's posture and policy, making Germany simultaneously E urope's truly good citizen and America's strongest European supporter. Germany sees in its fervent commitment to Europ e a historical cleansing, a restoration of its mora l and political credentials. By redeeming itself through Europe, Germany is restoring its own greatness whil e gaining a mission that would not automatically mobilize Eur opean resentments and fears against Germany. If Ger mans seek the German national interest, that runs the ri sk of alienating other Europeans; if Germans promot e Europe's common interest, that garners European sup port and respect. On the central issues of the Cold War, France wa s a loyal, dedicated, and determined ally. It stood shoulder lo shoulder with America when the chips were down. Whe ther during the two Berlin blockades or during the Cuban missile crisis, there was no doubt about Fren ch steadfastness. But France's support for NATO was tempered by a simultaneous French desire to assert a separate French political identity and to preserv e for France its essential freedom of action, especially on matters that pertained to France's global status or to the future of Europe. There is an element of delusional obsession in t he French political elite's preoccupation with the notion that France is still a global power. When Prime Minister Alain Juppe, echoing his predecessors, declared to the National Assembly in May 1995 that \"France can and must assert its vocation as a world power,\" the gat hering broke out into spontaneous applause. The French ins istence on the development of its own nuclear deter rent was motivated largely by the view that France would thereby enhance its own freedom of action and at t he same time gain the capacity to influence American l ife-and-death decisions regarding the security of t he Western alliance as a whole. It was not vis-a-vis t he Soviet Union that France sought to upgrade its s tatus, for the French nuclear deterrent had, at the very best, only a marginal impact on Soviet war-making capabi lities. Paris felt instead that its own nuclear weapons wou ld give France a role in the Cold War's top-level a nd most dangerous decision-making processes. In French thinking, the possession of nuclear we apons fortified France's claim to being a global po wer, of having a voice that had to be respected worldwide. It tangibly reinforced France's position as one of the five veto-wielding- UN Security Council members, all fiv e also nuclear powers. In the French perspective, t he British nuclear deterrent was simply an extension o f the American, especially given the British commit ment to the special relationship and the British abstention from the effort to construct an independent Europe . (That the French nuclear program significantly benefited from covert U.S. assistance was, to the French, of no consequence for France's strategic calculus.) The F rench nuclear deterrent also consolidated, in the F rench mindset, France's commanding position as the leadin g continental power, the only truly European slale so endowed. France's global ambitions were also expressed t hrough its determined efforts to sustain a special security role in most of the Francophone African countries. Despi te the loss, after prolonged combat, of Vietnam and Algeria and the abandonment of a wider empire, that securit y mission, as well as continued French control over scattered Pacific islands (which have provided the venue for controversial French atomic tests), has r einforced the conviction of the French elite that France, ind eed, still has a global role to play, despite the r eality of being essentially a middle-rank postim-perial European po wer. All of the foregoing has sustained as well as m otivated France's claim to the mantle of European l eadership. With Britain self-marginalized and essentially an a ppendage to U.S. power and with Germany divided for much of the Cold War and still handicapped by its twenti eth-century history, France could seize the idea of Europe, identify itself with it, and usurp it as identical with France's conception of itself. The country tha t first invented the idea of the sovereign nation-state and made nat ionalism into a civic religion thus found it quite natural to see itself—with the same emotional commitment that was once invested in \"la patrie\"—as the embodiment of an independent but united Europe. The grandeur of a French-led Europe would then be France's as well."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" This special vocation, generated by a deeply fe lt sense of historical destiny and fortified by a u nique cultural pride, has major policy implications. The key geopo litical space that France had to keep within its or bit of influence—or, at least, prevent from being dominate d by a more powerful state than itself—can be drawn on the map in the form of a semicircle. It includes th e Iberian Peninsula, the northern shore of the west ern Mediterranean, and Germany up to East-Central Europ e (see map on page 64). That is not only the minima l radius of French security; it is also the essential zone of French political interest. Only with the s upport of the southern states assured, and with Germany's backing guaranteed, can the goal of constructing a unified and independent Europe, led by France, be effectively p ursued. And obviously, within that geopolitical orb it, the increasingly powerful Germany is bound to be the mo st difficult to manage. In the French vision, the central goal of a united and independent Europe can be achieved by combining the unification of Europe under French leadership with the simultaneous but gradual diminution of the American primacy on the continent. But if France is to shape Europe's future, it must both engage and shackle Germany, while also seeking step-by-step to strip Washington of its political leadership in European affairs. The resulting key policy dilemmas for France are essentially twofold: how to preserve the American security commitment to Europe—which France recognizes is still essential—while steadily reducing the American presence; and how to sustain Franco-German partnership as the combined political- economic engine of European unification while precluding German leadership in Europe. If France were truly a global power, the resolut ion of these dilemmas in the pursuit of France's ce ntral goal might not be difficult. None of the other European states, save Germany, are endowed with the same amb ition or driven by the same sense of mission. Even German y could perhaps be seduced into acceptance of Frenc h leadership in a united but independent (of America) Europe, but only if it felt that France was in fac t a global power and could thus provide Europe with the securi ty that Germany cannot but America does. Germany, however, knows the real limits of Fren ch power. France is much weaker than Germany economically, while its military establishment (as the Gulf War of 1991 showed) is not very competent. It is good enough td squash internal coups in satellite A frican states, but it can neither protect Europe no r project significant power far from Europe. France is no mor e and no less than a middle-rank European power. Accordingly, in order to construct Europe, Germany has been willing to propitiate French pride, but in order to keep Europe truly secure, it has not been willing t o follow French leadership blindly. It has continue d to insist on a central role in European security for America. That reality, painful for French self-esteem, e merged more clearly after Germany's reunification. Until then, the Franco-German reconciliation did have the appea rance of French political leadership riding comfort ably on German economic dynamism. That perception actually suited both parties. It mitigated the traditional E uropean fears of Germany, and it had the effect of fortifyi ng and gratifying French illusions by generating th e impression that the construction of Europe was led by France, backed by an economically dynamic West Germany."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" Franco-German reconciliation, even with its mis conceptions, was nonetheless a positive development for Europe, and its importance cannot be overstated. It has provided the crucial foundation for all of the progress so far achieved in Europe's difficult process of unifi cation. Thus, it was also fully compatible with Ame rican interests and in keeping with the long-standing Ame rican commitment to the promotion of transnational cooperation in Europe. A breakdown of Franco-German cooperation would be a fatal setback for Europe an d a disaster for America's position in Europe. Tacit American support made it possible for Fra nce and Germany to push the process of Europe's uni fication forward. Germany's reunification, moreover, increas ed the incentive for the French to lock Germany int o a binding European framework. Thus on December 6, 199 0, the French president and the German chancellor committed themselves to the goal of a federal Europ e, and ten days later, the Rome intergovernmental conference on political union issued—British reserv ations notwithstanding—a clear mandate to the twelv e foreign ministers of the European Community to prep are a Draft Treaty on Political Union. However, Germany's reunification also dramatical ly changed the real parameters of European politics . It was simultaneously a geopolitical defeat for Russia and for France. United Germany not only ceased to be a political junior partner of France, but it automati cally became the undisputed prime power in Western Europe and even a partial global power, especially through its major financial contributions to the support o f the key international institutions.1 The new reality bred s ome mutual disenchantment in the Franco-German relationship, for Germany was now able and willing to articulate and openly promote its own vision of a future Europe, still as France's partner but no longer as its protege. For France, the resulting diminished political l everage dictated several policy consequences. Franc e somehow had to regain greater influence within NATO—from wh ich it had largely abstained as a protest against U .S. domination—while also compensating for its relative weakness through greater diplomatic maneuver. Returning to NATO might enable France to influence America more; occasional flirtation with Moscow or London might generate pressure from the outside on America as well as on Germany. 1. For example, as a percentage of overall budget, Germany accounts for EU: 28.5 percent; NATO: 22.8 percent; UN 8.93 percent, in addition to being the largest shareholder in the World Bank and the EBRD) (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development). Consequently, as part of its policy of maneuver rather than contestation, France returned to NATO's command structure. By 1994, France was again a de f acto active participant in NATO's political and mil itary decision making; by late 1995, the French foreign a nd defense ministers were again regular attendees a t alliance sessions. But at a price: once fully inside, they r eaffirmed their determination to reform the allianc e's structure in order to make for greater balance between its Am erican leadership and its European participation. T hey wanted a higher profile and a bigger role for a col lective European component. As the French foreign m inister, Herve de Charette, stated in a speech on April 8, 1 996, \"For France, the basic goal [of the rapprochem ent] is to assert a European identity within the alliance that is operationally credible and politically visible. \" At the same time, Paris was quite prepared to e xploit tactically its traditional links with Russia to constrain America's European policy and to resuscitate whenev er expedient the old Franco-British entente to offs et Germany's growing European primacy. The French fore ign minister came close to saying so explicitly in August 1996, when he declared that \"if France wants to play an international role, it stands to benefi t from the existence of a strong Russia, from helping it to re affirm itself as a major power,\" prompting the Russ ian foreign minister to reciprocate by stating that \"of all the world leaders, the French are the closest to havin g constructive attitudes in their relations with Russia.\"2 2. As quoted by Le Nouvel Obsvrvtiteur, August 12, 1996. France's initially lukewarm support for NATO's eastward expansion—indeed, a barely suppressed skep ticism regarding its desirability—was thus partially a tac tic designed to gain leverage in dealing with the U nited States. Precisely because America and Germany were the chief proponents of NATO expansion, it suited France to play cool, to go along reticently, to voi ce concern regarding the potential impact of that i nitiative on Russia, and to act as Europe's most sensitive inter locutor with Moscow. To some Central Europeans, it"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"appeared that the French even conveyed the impressi on that they were not averse to a Russian sphere of influence in Eastern Europe. The Russian card thus not only balanced America and conveyed a none-too-s ubtle message to Germany, but it also increased the press ure on the United States to consider favorably Fren ch proposals for NATO reform. Ultimately, NATO expansion will require unanimi ty among the alliance's sixteen members. Paris knew that its acquiescence was not only vital for that unanim ity but that France's actual support was needed to avoid obstruction from other alliance members. Thus, it m ade no secret of the French intention to make suppo rt for NATO expansion a hostage to America's eventually sa tisfying the French determination to alter both the balance of power within the alliance and its fundam ental organization. France was at first similarly tepid in its support for the eastward expansion of the European Union. I k-re the lead was taken largely by Germany, with American su pport but without the same degree of U.S. engagemen t as in the case of NATO expansion. Even though in NATO France tended to argue that the EU's expansion woul d provide a more suitable umbrella for the former Com munist states, as soon as Germany started pressing for the more rapid enlargement of the EU to include Central Europe, France began to raise technical concerns a nd also to demand that the EU pay equal attention to Europe 's exposed Mediterranean southern flank. (These differences emerged as early as the November 1994 F ranco-German summit.) French emphasis on the latter issue also had the effect of gaining for France the support of NATO's southern members, thereby maximi zing France's overall bargaining power. But the cost was a widening gap in the respective geopolitical visi ons of Europe held by France and Germany, a gap only parti ally narrowed by France's belated endorsement in th e second half of 1996 of Poland's accession to both N ATO and the EU. That gap was inevitable, given the changing hist orical context. Ever since the end of World War II, democratic Germany had recognized that Franco-Germa n reconciliation was required to build a European community within the western half of divided Europe . That reconciliation was also central to Germany's historical rehabilitation. Hence, the acceptance of French leadership was a fair price to pay. At the same time, the continued Soviet threat to a vulnerable West Ge rmany made loyalty to America the essential precond ition for survival—and even the French recognized that. B ut after the Soviet collapse, to build a larger and more united Europe, subordination to France was neither necessary nor propitious. An equal Franco-German partnership, with the reunified Germany in fact now being the stronger partner, was more than a fair d eal for Paris; hence, the French would simply have to accep t Germany's preference for a primary security link with its transatlantic ally and protector. With the end of the Cold War, that link assumed new importance for Germany. In the past, it had she ltered Germany from an external but very proximate threat and was the necessary precondition for the eventual reunification of the country. With the Soviet Union gone and Germany reunified, the link to America no w provided the umbrella under which Germany could mor e openly assuime a leadership role in Central Europ e without simultaneously threatening its neighbors. T he American connection provided more than the certi ficate of good behavior: it reassured Germany's neighbors that a close relationship with Germany also meant a closer relationship with America. All of that made it easi er for Germany to define more openly its own geopol itical priorities. Germany—safely anchored in Europe and rendered harmless but secure by the visible American militar y presence—could now promote the assimilation of the newly freed Central Europe into the European struct ures. It would not be the old Mitteleuropa of German impe rialism but a more benign community of economic renewal stimulated by German investments and trade, with Germany also acting as the sponsor of the eventually formal inclusion of the new Mitteleuropa in both the European Union and NATO. With the Fran co- German alliance providing the vital platform for th e assertion of a more decisive regional role, Germa ny no longer needed to be shy in asserting itself within an orbit of its special interest. On the map of Europe, the zone of German specia l interest could be sketched in the shape of an obl ong, in the West including of course France and in the East spanning the newly emancipated post-Communist stat es of Central Europe, including the Baltic republics, emb racing Ukraine and Belarus, and reaching even into Russia (see map on page 64). In many respects, that zone c orresponds to the historical radius of constructive German cultural influence, carved out in the prenationalis t era by German urban and agricultural colonists in East-"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Central Europe and in the Baltic republics, all of whom were wiped out in the course of World War II. More important, the areas of special concern to the Fren ch (discussed earlier) and the Germans, when viewed together as in the map below, in effect define the western a nd eastern limits of Europe, while the overlap betw een them underlines the decisive geopolitical importance of the Franco-German connection as the vital core of E urope. The critical breakthrough for the more openly a ssertive German role in Central Europe was provided by the German-Polish reconciliation that occurred during t he mid-nineties. Despite some initial reluctance, t he reunited Germany (with American prodding) did forma lly recognize as permanent the Oder-Neisse border w ith Poland, and that step in turn removed the single mo st important Polish reservation regarding a closer relationship with Germany. Following some further m utual gestures of goodwill and forgiveness, the relationship underwent a dramatic change. Not only did German-Polish trade literally explode (in 1995 Poland superseded Russia as Germany's largest trading part ner in the East), but Germany became Poland's princ ipal sponsor for membership in the EU and (together with the United States) in NATO. It is no exaggeration to say that by the middle of the decade, Polish-German rec onciliation was assuming a geopolitical importance in Central Europe matching the earlier impact on Weste rn Europe of the Franco-German reconciliation. Through Poland, German influence could radiate northward— into the Baltic states—and eastward—into Ukraine and Belarus. Moreover, the scope of the Ger man-Polish reconciliation was somewhat widened by Poland's occasional inclusion in important Franco-G erman discussions regarding Europe's future. The so -called Weimar Triangle (named after the German city in whi ch the first high-level trilateral Franco-German-Po lish consultations, which subsequently became periodic, had taken place) created a potentially significant geopolitical axis on the European continent, embrac ing some 180 million people from three nations with a highly defined sense of national identity. On the o ne hand, this further enhanced Germany's dominant r ole in Central Europe, but on the other hand, that role wa s somewhat balanced by the Franco-Polish participat ion in the three-way dialogue. Central European acceptance of German leadershi p—and such was even more the case with the smaller Central European states—was eased by the very evide nt German commitment to the eastward expansion of Europe's key institutions. In so committing itself, Germany undertook a historical mission much at var iance with some rather deeply rooted Western European out looks. In that latter perspective, events occurring east of Germany and Austria were perceived as somehow beyon d the limits of concern to the real Europe. That attitude—articulated in the early eighteenth centur y by Lord Bolingbroke,3 who argued that political v iolence in the East was of no consequence to the Western Eu ropeans—resurfaced during the Munich crisis of 1938 ; and it made a tragic reappearance in the British and Fr ench attitudes during the conflict of the mid-1990s in Bosnia. It still lurks beneath the surface in the ongoing d ebates regarding the future of Europe. 3. Cf. his History of Europe, from the Pyreneart Pe ace to the Death of Louis XIV. In contrast, the only real debate in Germany wa s whether NATO or the EU should be expanded first—t he defense minister favored the former, the foreign mi nister advocated the latter—with the net result tha t Germany became the undisputed apostle of a larger and more united Europe. The German chancellor spoke of the y ear 2000 as the goal for the EU's first eastward enlarg ement, and the German defense minister was among th e first to suggest that the fiftieth anniversary of NATO's founding was an appropriately symbolic date for the alliance's eastern expansion. Germany's conception of Europe's future thus differed from its pri ncipal European allies: the British proclaimed their prefe rence for a larger Europe because they saw in enlar gement the means for diluting Europe's unity; the French f eared that enlargement would enhance Germany's role and hence favored more narrowly based integration. Germ any stood for both and thus gained a standing in Ce ntral Europe all its own. AMERICA'S CENTRAL OBJECTIVE The central issue for America is how to construct a Europe that is based on the Franco-German connecti on, a Europe that is viable, that remains linked to the U nited States, and that widens the scope of the coop erative democratic international system on which the effect ive exercise of American global primacy so much dep ends. Hence, it is not a matter of making a choice betwee n France and Germany. Without either France or Germ any, there will be no Europe."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" Three broad conclusions emerge from the foregoin g discussion: 1. American engagement in the cause of European unification is needed to compensate for the interna l crisis of morale and purpose that has been sapping Europea n vitality, to overcome the widespread European sus picion that ultimately America does not favor genuine Euro pean unity, and to infuse into the European underta king the needed dose of democratic fervor. That requires a c lear-cut American commitment to the eventual accept ance of Europe as America's global partner. 2. In the short run, tactical opposition to Fren ch policy and sup port for German leadership is jus tified; in the longer run, European unity will have to involve a m ore distinctive European political and military ide ntity if a genuine Europe is actually to become reality. That requires some progressive accommodation to the Fren ch view regarding the distribution of power within tra nsatlantic institutions. 3. Neither France nor Germany is sufficiently st rong to con struct Europe on its own or to resolve with Russia the ambiguities inherent in the definition of Europ e's geographic scope. That re quires energetic, foc used, and determined American involvement, particularly with the Germans, in defining Europe's scope and hence a lso in coping with such sensitive—especially to Russia—iss ues as the eventual status within the European syst em of the Baltic republics and Ukraine. Just one glance at the map of the vast Eurasian landmass underlines the geopolitical significance t o America of the European bridgehead—as well as its geographi c modesty. The preservation of that bridgehead and its expansion as the springboard for democracy are dire ctly relevant to America's security. The existing g ap between America's global concern for stability and for the related dissemination of democracy and Euro pe's seeming indifference to these issues (despite Franc e's self-proclaimed status as a global power) needs to be closed, and it can only be narrowed if Europe incre asingly assumes a more confederated character. Euro pe cannot become a single nation-state, because of the tenacity of its diverse national traditions, but i t can become an entity that through common political institution s cumulatively reflects shared democratic values, i dentifies its own interests with their universal-ization, and exercises a magnetic attraction on its co-inhabita nts of the Eurasian space. Left to themselves, thc Europeans run the risk of b ecoming absorbed by their internal social concerns. Europe's economic recovery has obscured the longer-run costs of its seeming success. These costs are damaging economically as well as politically. The crisis of political legitimacy and economic vitality that Wes tern Europe increasingly confronts—but is unable to overcome—is deeply rooted in the pervasive expansion of the st ate- sponsored social structure that favors paternalism, protectionism, and parochialism. The result is a c ultural condition that combines escapist hedonism with spir itual emptiness—a condition that can be exploited b y nationalist extremists or dogmatic ideologues. This condition, if it becomes rampant, could pr ove deadly to democracy and the idea of Europe. The two, in fact, are linked, for the new problems of Europe—be they immigration or economic-technological competitiveness with America or Asia, not to speak of the need for a politically stable reform of exis ting socioeco-nomic structures—can only be dealt with ef fectively in an increasingly continental context. A Europe that is larger than the sum of its parts—that is, a Europe that sees a global role for itself in the p romotion of democracy and in the wider proselytization of basic human values—is more likely to be a Europe that is firmly uncongenial to political extremism, narrow national ism, or social hedonism. One need neither evoke the old fears of a separ ate German-Russian accommodation nor exaggerate the consequences of French tactical flirtation with Mos cow to entertain concern for the geopolitical stabi lity of Europe—and for America's place in it—resulting from a failure of Europe's still ongoing efforts to uni te. Any such failure would in fact probably entail some ren ewed and rather traditional European maneuvers. It would certainly generate opportunities for either Russian or German geopolitical self-assertion, though if E urope's modern history contains any lesson, neither would b e likely to gain an enduring success in that regard . However, at the very least, Germany would probably become more assertive and explicit in the definitio n of its national interests."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" Currently, Germany's interests are congruent wi th, and even sublimated within, those of the EU and of NATO. Even the spokesmen for the leftist Alliance 9 0/Greens have advocated the expansion of both NATO and the EU. But if the unification and enlargement of Europe should stall, there is some reason to ass ume that a more nationalist definition of Germany's concept of the European \"order\" would then surface, to the po tential detriment of European stability. Wolfgang Schauble, the leader of the Christian Democrats in the Bunde stag and a possible successor to Chancellor Kohl, expres sed that mindset when he stated that Germany is no longer \"the western bulwark against the East; we have beco me the center of Europe,\" pointedly adding that in \"the long periods during the Middle Ages... Germany was involved in creating order in Europe. \"4 In this vi sion, Mitteleuropa—instead of being a European region in which Germany economically preponderates—would become an area of overt German political primacy as well as the basis for a more unilateral German pol icy vis- a-vis the East and the West. 4. Politiken Sondag, August 2, 1996, Italics added. Europe would then cease to be the Eurasian brid gehead for American power and the potential springb oard for the democratic global system's expansion into Euras ia. This is why unambiguous and tangible American support for Europe's unification must be sustained. Although both during Europe's economic recovery an d within the transatlantic security alliance America has frequently proclaimed its support for European unification and supported transnational cooperation in Europe, it has also acted as if it preferred to deal on tro ubling economic and political issues with individual Europ ean states and not with the European Union as such. Occasional American insistence on a voice within th e European decision-making process has tended to reinforce European suspicions that America favors c ooperation among the Europeans when they follow the American lead but not when they formulate Europe's policies. This is the wrong message to convey. American commitment to Europe's unity—reiterated forcefully in the joint American-European Madrid Declaration of December 1995—will continue to ring hollow until America is ready not only to declare unambiguously that it is prepared to accept the con sequences of Europe becoming truly Europe but to ac t accordingly. For Europe, the ultimate consequence w ould entail a true partnership with America rather than the status of a favored but still junior ally. And a tr ue partnership does mean sharing in decisions as we ll as responsibilities. American support for that cause w ould help to invigorate the transatlantic dialogue and would stimulate among the Europeans a more serious concen tration on the role that a truly significant Europe might play in the world. It is conceivable that at some point a truly un ited and powerful European Union could become a glo bal political rival to the United States. It could cert ainly become a difficult economic-technological com petitor, while its geopolitical interests in the Middle East and elsewhere could significantly diverge from tho se of America. But, in fact, such a powerful and politica lly single-minded Europe is not likely in the fores eeable future. Unlike the conditions prevailing in America at the time of the formation of the United States, there are deep historical roots to the resiliency of the Euro pean nation-states and the passion for a transnatio nal Europe has clearly waned. The real alternatives for the next decade or tw o are either an expanding and unifying Europe, purs uing— though hesitantly and spasmodically—the goal of con tinental unity; a stalemated Europe, not moving muc h beyond its current state of integration and geograp hic scope, with Central Europe remaining a geopolit ical no- man's-land; or, as a likely sequel to the stalemate , a progressively fragmenting Europe, resuming its old power rivalries. In a stalemated Europe, it is almost ine vitable that Germany's self-identification with Eur ope will wane, prompting a more nationalist definition of th e German state interest. For America, the first opt ion is clearly the best, but it is an option that requires energizing American support if it is to come to pa ss. At this stage of Europe's hesitant construction , America need not get directly involved in intrica te debates regarding such issues as whether the EU should make its foreign policy decisions by majority vote (a p osition favored especially by the Germans); whether the Eur opean Parliament should assume decisive legislative powers and the European Commission in Brussels shou ld become in effect the European executive; whether the timetable for implementing the agreement on Europea n economic and monetary union should be relaxed; or , finally, whether Europe should be a broad confedera tion or a multilayered entity, with a federated inn er core and a somewhat looser outer rim. These are matters for the Europeans to thrash out among themselves—an d it"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"is more than likely that progress on all of these i ssues will be uneven, punctuated by pauses, and eve ntually pushed forward only by complex compromises. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to assume that the Economic and Monetary Union will come into being b y the year 2000, perhaps initially among six to ten of th e EU's current fifteen members. This will accelerat e Europe's economic integration beyond the monetary dimension, further encouraging its political integration. Thu s, by fits and starts and with an inner more integrated core a s well as a looser outer layer, a single Europe wil l increasingly become an important political player o n the Eurasian chessboard. In any case, America should not convey the impre ssion that it prefers a vaguer, even if broader, Eu ropean association, but it should reiterate, through words and deeds, its willingness to deal eventually with the EU as America's global political and security partner and not just as a regional common market made up of st ates allied with the United States through NATO. To make that commitment more credible and thus go beyond t he rhetoric of partnership, joint planning with the EU regarding new bilateral transatlantic decision-mak ing mechanisms could be proposed and initiated. The same principle applies to NATO as such. Its preservation is vital to the transatlantic connect ion. On this issue, there is overwhelming American-European cons ensus. Without NATO, Europe not only would become vulnerable but almost immediately would become poli tically fragmented as well. NATO ensures European security and provides a stable framework for the pu rsuit of European unity. That is what makes NATO historically so vital to Europe. However, as Europe gradually and hesitantly unif ies, the internal structure and processes of NATO w ill have to adjust. On this issue, the*French have a point. One cannot someday have a truly united Europe and y et have an alliance that remains integrated on the basis of one superpower plus fifteen dependent powers. Once Europe begins to assume a genuine political identity of it s own, with the EU increasingly taking on some of t he functions of a supranational government, NATO will have to be altered on the basis of a 1 + 1 (US + EU ) formula. This will not happen overnight and all at once. Progress in that direction, to repeat, will be hesi tant. But such progress will have to be reflected In the existing alliance arrangements, lest the absence of such adj ustment itself should become an obstacle to further progres s. A significant step in that direction was the 199 6 decision of the alliance to make room for the Combined Joint Task Forces, thereby envisaging the possibility of some purely European military initiatives based on the a lliance's logistics as well as on command, control, communications, and intelligence. Greater U.S. will ingness to accommodate French demands for an increa sed role for the Western European Union within NATO, es pecially in regard to command and decision making, would also betoken more genuine American support fo r European unity and should help to narrow somewhat the gap between America and France regarding Europe 's eventual self-definition. In the longer run, it is possible that the WEU will embrace some EU member states that, for varyin g geopolitical or historical reasons, may choose not to seek NATO membership. That could involve Finland or Sweden, or perhaps even Austria, all of which have already acquired observer status with the WEU.5 Oth er states may also seek a WEU connection as a prelimin ary to eventual NATO membership. The WEU might also choose at some point to emulate NATO's Partnership for Peace program with regard to would-be members o f the EU. AH of that would help to spin a wider web o f security cooperation in Europe, beyond the formal scope of the transatlantic alliance. 5. It is noteworthy that influential voices both in Finland and in Sweden have began to discuss the po ssibility of association with NATO. In May 1996, the commander o f the Finnish Defense Forces was reported by the Swedish media to have raised the possibility of som e NATO deployments on Nordic soil, and in August 19 96, the Swedish Parliament's Defense Committee, in an a ction symptomatic of a gradual drift toward closer security cooperation with NATO, recommended that Sw eden join the Western European Armaments Group (WEAG) to which only NATO members belong.

Thus, regarding France, the central policy dilemma for Am erica will continue to be how to inveigle France into clo ser Atlantic political and military integration wit hout compromising the American-German connection, and re garding Germany, how to exploit U.S. reliance on German leadership in an Allanlicist Europe without prompting concern in France and Britain as well as in other European countries. More demonstrable American flexibility on the f uture shape of the alliance would be helpful in eve ntually mobilizing greater French support for the alliance' s eastward expansion. In the long run, a NATO zone of integrated military security on both sides of Germa ny would more firmly anchor Germany within a multil ateral framework, and that should be a matter of consequen ce for France. Moreover, the expansion of the allia nce would increase the probability that the Weimar Tria ngle (of Germany, France, and Poland) could become a subtle means for somewhat balancing German leadersh ip in Europe. Although Poland relies on German supp ort for gaining entrance into the alliance (and resents current French hesitations regarding such expansio n), once it is inside the alliance a shared Franco-Polish geopo litical perspective is more likely to emerge. In any case, Washington should not lose sight of the fact that France is only a short-term adversar y on matters pertaining to the identity of Europe or to the inne r workings of NATO. More important, it should bear in mind the fact that France is an essential partner in the important task of permanently locking a democratic Germany into Europe. That is the historic role of the Franc o-German relationship, and the expansion of both th e EU and NATO eastward should enhance the importance of that relationship as Europe's inner core. Finally, Fran ce is not strong enough either to obstruct America on the geostrategic fundamentals of America's European po licy or to become by itself a leader of Europe as such. Hen ce, its peculiarities and even its tantrums can be tolerated. It is also germane to note that France does play a constructive role in North Africa and in the Fra ncophone African countries. It is the essential partner for Morocco and Tunisia, while also exercising a stabil izing role in Algeria. There is a good domestic reason for such F rench involvement: some 5 million Muslims now resid e in France. France thus has a vital stake in the stabil ity and orderly development of North Africa. But th at interest is of wider benefit to Europe's security. Without t he French sense of mission, Europe's southern flank would be much more unstable and threatening. All of southern Kiirope is becoming increasingly concerned with th e social-political threat posed by instability along the Mediterranean's southern littoral. France's int ense concern for what transpires across the Mediterranean is thu s quite pertinent to NATO's security concerns, and that consideration should be taken into account when Ame rica occasionally has to cope with France's exagger ated claims of special leadership status. Germany is another matter. Germany's dominant r ole cannot be denied, but caution must be exercised regarding any public endorsements of the German lea dership role in Europe. That leadership may be expe dient to some European states—like those in Central Europ e that appreciate the German initiative on behalf o f Europe's eastward expansion—and it may be tolerable to the Western Europeans as long as it is subsumed under America's primacy, but in the long run, Europ e's construction cannot be based on it. Too many me mories still linger; too many fears are likely to surface. A Europe constructed and led by Berlin is simply n ot feasible. That is why Germany needs France, why Europe needs the Franco-German connection, and why America cannot choose between Germany and France. The essential point regarding NATO expansion is that it is a process integrally connected with Eur ope's own expansion. If the European Union is to become a geo graphically larger community—with a more-integrated Franco-German leading core and less-integrated oute r layers—and if such a Europe is to base its securi ty on a continued alliance with America, then it follows th at its geopolitically most exposed sector, Central Europe, cannot be demonstratively excluded from partaking i n the sense of security that the rest of Europe enj oys through the transatlantic alliance. On this, Americ a and Germany agree. For them, the impulse for enla rgement is political, historical, and constructive. It is n ot driven by animosity toward Russia, nor by fear o f Russia, nor by the desire to isolate Russia. Hence, America must work particularly closely w ith Germany in promoting the eastward expansion of Europe. American-German cooperation and joint leade rship regarding this issue are essential. Expansion will"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"happen if the United States and Germany jointly enc ourage the other NATO allies to endorse the step an d either negotiate effectively some accommodation with Russi a, if it is willing to compromise (see chapter 4), or act assertively, in the correct conviction that the tas k of constructing Europe cannot be subordinated to Moscow's objections. Combined American-German pressure will be especially needed to obtain the required unanimo us agreement of all NATO members, but no NATO member w ill be able to deny it if America and Germany jointly press for it. Ultimately at stake in this effort is America's long-range role in Europe. A new Europe is still ta king shape, and if that new Europe is to remain geopolitically a part of the \"Euro-Atlantic\" space, the expansion of NATO is essential. Indeed, a comprehensive U.S. policy f or Eurasia as a whole will not be possible if the e ffort to widen NATO, having been launched by the United Stat es, stalls and falters. That failure would discredi t American leadership; it would shatter the concept o f an expanding Europe; it would demoralize the Cent ral Europeans; and it could reignite currently dormant or dying Russian geopolitical aspirations in Centra l Europe. For the West, it would be a self-inflicted wound th at would mortally damage the prospects for a truly European pillar in any eventual Eurasian security architectu re; and for America, it would thus be not only a re gional defeat but a global defeat as well. The bottom line guiding the progressive expansio n of Europe has to be the proposition that no power outside of the existing transatlantic system has the right to veto the participation of any qualified European state in the European system—and hence also in its transatlantic security system—and that no qualified European sta te should be excluded a priori from eventual membershi p in either the EU or NATO. Especially the highly vulnerable and increasingly qualified Baltic states are entitled to know that eventually they also can become full-fledged members in both organizations— and tha t in the meantime, their sovereignty cannot be thre atened without engaging the interests of an expanding Euro pe and its U.S. partner. In essence, the West—especially America and its Western European allies—must provide an answer to t he question eloquently posed by Vaclav Havel in Aachen on May 15, 1996: I know that neither the European Union nor the Nort h Atlantic Alliance can open its doors overnight to all those who aspire to join them. What both most a ssuredly can do—and what they should do In-fore il is loo late—is to ö³?å the whole of Europe, seen as a sphere of common values, the clear assurance tha t they are not closed clubs. They should formulate a clear and detailed policy of gradual enlargement th at not only contains a timetable but also explains the logic of that timetable, [italics added] EUROPE'S HISTORIC TIMETABLE Although at this stage the ultimate eastern limits of Europe can neither be defined firmly nor finally fixed, in the broadest sense Europe is a common civilization, derived from the shared Christian tradition. Europ e's narrower Western definition has been associated wit h Rome and its historical legacy. But Europe's Chri stian tradition has involved also Byzantium and its Russi an Orthodox emanation. Thus, culturally, Europe is more than the Petrine Europe, and the Petrine Europe in turn is much more than Western Europe—even though i n recent years the latter has usurped the identity of \"Europe.\" Even a mere glance at the map on page 82 confirms that the existing Europe is simply not a complete E urope. Worse than that, it is a Europe in which a z one of insecurity between Europe and Russia can have a suc tion effect on both, inevitably causing tensions an d rivalry. A Charlemagne Europe (limited to Western Europe ) by necessity made sense during the Cold War, but such a Europe is now an anomaly. This is so because in a ddition to being a civilization, the emerging unite d Europe is also a way of life, a standard of living, and a polity of shared democratic procedures, not burdene d by ethnic and territorial conflicts. That Europe in its forma lly organized scope is currently much less than its actual potential. Several of the more advanced and politic ally stable Central European states, all part of th e Western Petrine tradition, notably the Czech Republic, Pola nd, Hungary, and perhaps also Slovenia, are clearly qualified and eager for membership in \"Europe\" and its transa tlantic security connection. "},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" In the current circumstances, the expansion of NATO to include Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary — probably by 1999—appears to be likely. After this i nitial but significant step, it is likely that any subsequent expansion of the alliance will either be coincident al with or will follow the expansion of the EU. The latter involves a much more complicated process, both in t he number of qualifying stages and in the meeting o f membership requirements (see chart on page 83). Thu s, even the first admissions into the EU from Centr al Europe are not likely before the year 2002 or perha ps somewhat later. Nonetheless, after, the first th ree new NATO members have also joined the EU, both the EU a nd NATO will have to address the question of extending membership to the Baltic republics, Slove nia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Slovakia, and perhaps a lso, eventually, to Ukraine."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" It is noteworthy that the prospect of eventual m embership is already exercising a constructive infl uence on the affairs and conduct of would-be members. Knowledge that neither the EU nor NATO wishes to be burdened by additional conflicts pertaining either to minority rights or to territorial claims among their members (Turkey versus Greece is more than enough) has already give n Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania the needed incenti ve to reach accommodations that meet the standards set by the Council of Europe. Much the same is true for t he more general principle that only democracies can qualify for membership. The desire not to be left out is h aving an important reinforcing impact on the new democracies . In any case, it ought to be axiomatic that Euro pe's political unity and security are indivisible. As a practical matter, in fact it is difficult to conceive of a tr uly united Europe without a common security arrange ment with America. It follows, therefore, that states that ar e in a position to begin and are invited to underta ke accession talks with the EU should automatically also be view ed henceforth as subject in effect to NATO's presum ptive protection."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" Accordingly, the process of widening Europe and enlarging the transatlantic security system is like ly to move forward by deliberate stages. Assuming sustained Am erican and Western European commitment, a speculati ve but cautiously realistic timetable for these stages might be the following: 1. By 1999, the first new Central European members will have been admitted into NATO, though their ent ry into the EU will probably not happen before 2002 or 2003. 2. In the meantime, the EU will initiate accession talks with the Baltic republics, and NATO will like wise begin to move for ward on the issue of their membership a s well as Roma nia's, with their accession likely t o be completed by 2005. At some point in this stage, the other Balkan states may likewise become eligible. 3. Accession by the Baltic states might prompt Swed en and Finland also to consider NATO membership. 4. Somewhere between 2005 and 2010, Ukraine, especi ally if in the meantime the country has made signif icant progress in its domestic reforms and has succeeded in becoming more evidently identified as a Central European country, should become ready for serious n egotiations with both the EU and NATO. In the meantime, it is likely that Franco- German-Polish collaboration within the EU and NATO will have deepened considerably, especially in the area of defense. That collaboration could become the Western core of any wider European security arrangements that might eventually embrace both Russia and Ukraine. Given the special geopolitical interest of Germany and Poland in Ukraine's independence, it is also quite possible that Ukraine will gradually be drawn into the special Franco-German- Polish relationship. By the year 2010, Franco-German-Polish-Ukrainian political collaboration, engaging some 230 million people, could evolve into a partnership enhancing Europe's geostrategic depth (see map above). Whether the above scenario emerges in a benign fashion or in the context of intensifying tensions with Russia is of great importance. Russia should be con tinuously reassured that the doors to Europe are op en, as are the doors to its eventual participation in ;ui expa nded transatlantic system of security and, perhaps at some future point, in a new trans-Eurasian system of sec urity. To give credence to these assurances, variou s cooperative links between Russia and Europe—in all fields—should be very deliberately promoted. (Russi a's relationship to Europe, and the role of Ukraine in that regard, are discussed more fully in the next c hapter.) If Europe succeeds both in unifying and in expa nding and if Russia in the meantime undertakes succ essful democratic consolidation and social modernization, at some point Russia can also become eligible for a more organic relationship with Europe. That, in turn, wo uld make possible the eventual merger of the transa tlantic security system with a transcontinental Eurasian on e. However, as a practical reality, the question of Russia's formal membership will not arise for quite some tim e to come—and that, if anything, is yet another rea son for not pointlessly shutting the doors to it. To conclude: with the Europe of Yalta gone, it is essential that there be no reversion to the Euro pe of Versailles. The end of the division of Europe shoul d not precipitate a step back to a Europe of quarre lsome nation-states but should be the point of departure for shaping a larger and increasingly integrated Eu rope,"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"reinforced by a widened NATO and rendered even more secure by a constructive security relationship wit h Russia. Hence, America's central geostrategic goal in Europe can be summed up quite simply: it is to consolidate through a more genuine transatlantic pa rtnership the U.S. bridgehead on the Eurasian conti nent so that an enlarging Europe can become a more viable s pringboard for projecting into Eurasia the internat ional democratic and cooperative order."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Chapter 4. The Ulack Hole THE DISINTEGRATION LATE IN 1991 of the world's terr itorially largest state created a \"black hole\" in t he very center of Eurasia. It was as if the geopolitic ians' \"heartland\" had been suddenly yanked from the global map. For America, this new and perplexing geopolitic al situation poses a crucial challenge. Understanda bly, the immediate task has to be to reduce the probability of political anarchy or a reversion to a hostile di ctatorship in a crumbling state still possessing a powerful nucle ar arsenal. But the long-range task remains: how to encourage Russia's democratic transformation and ec onomic recovery while avoiding the reemergence of a Eurasian empire that could obstruct the American ge ostrategic goal of shaping a larger Euro-Atlantic s ystem to which Russia can then be stably and safely related. RUSSIA'S NEW GEOPOLITICAL SETTING The collapse of the Soviet Union was the final stag e in the progressive fragmentation of the vast Sino -Soviet Communist bloc that for a brief period of time matc hed, and in some areas even surpassed, the scope of Genghis Khan's realm. Hut the more modern transcont inental Eurasian bloc lasted very briefly, with the defection by Tito's Yugoslavia and the insubordinat ion of Mao's China signaling early on the Communist camp's vulnerability to nationalist aspirations tha t proved to be stronger than ideological bonds. The Sino- Soviet bloc lasted roughly ten years; the Soviet Un ion about seventy. However, even more geopolitically significant w as the undoing of the centuries-old Moscow-ruled Gr eat Russian Empire. The disintegration of that empire w as precipitated by the general socio-economic and p olitical failure of the Soviet system—though much of its mal aise was obscured almost until the very end by its systemic secrecy and self-isolation. Hence, the world was st unned by the seeming rapidity of the Soviet Union's self- destruction. In the course of two short weeks in De cember 1991, the Soviet Union was first defiantly d eclared as dissolved by the heads of its Russian, Ukrainian , and Belorussian republics, then formally replaced by a vaguer entity—called the Commonwealth of Independen t States (CIS)—embracing all of the Soviet republic s but the Baltic ones; then the Soviet president relu ctantly resigned and the Soviet flag was lowered fo r the last time from the tower of the Kremlin; and, finally, t he Russian Federation—now a predominantly Russian national state of 150 million people—emerged as the de facto successor to the former Soviet Union, whi le the other republics— accounting for another 150 million people—asserted in varying degrees their independe nt sovereignty. The collapse of the Soviet Union produced monum ental geopolitical confusion. In the course of a me re fortnight, the Russian people—who, generally speaki ng, were .even less forewarned than the outside wor ld of the Soviet Union's approaching disintegration— sudd enly discovered that they were no longer the master s of a transcontinental empire but that the frontiers of R ussia had been rolled back to where they had been i n the Caucasus in the early 1800s, in Central Asia in the mid-1800s, and—much more dramatically and painfull y—in the West in approximately 1600, soon after the reig n of Ivan the Terrible. The loss of the Caucasus re vived strategic fears of resurgent Turkish influence; the loss of Central Asia generated a sense of deprivat ion regarding the enormous energy and mineral resources of the region as well as anxiety over a potential Islamic challenge; and Ukraine's independence challenged th e very essence of Russia's claim to being the divin ely endowed standard-bearer of a common pan-Slavic iden tity. The space occupied for centuries by the Tsarist Empire and for three-quarters of a century by the Russian- dominated Soviet Union was now to be filled by a do zen states, with most (except for Russia) hardly pr epared for genuine sovereignty and ranging in size from th e relatively large Ukraine with its 52 million peop le to Armenia with its 3.5 million. Their viability seeme d uncertain, while Moscow's willingness to accommod ate permanently to the new reality was similarly unpred ictable. The historic shock suffered by the Russian s was magnified by the fact that some 20 million Russian- speaking people were now inhabitants of foreign sta tes dominated politically by increasingly nationalistic elites determined to assert their own identities a fter decades of more or less coercive Russification."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" The collapse of the Russian Empire created a po wer void in the very heart of Eurasia. Not only was there weakness and confusion in the newly independent sta tes, but in Russia itself, the upheaval produced a massive systemic crisis, especially as the political upheav al was accompanied by the simultaneous attempt to u ndo the old Soviet socioeconomic model. The national trauma was made worse by Russia's military involvement in Tajikistan, driven by fears of a Muslim takeover of that newly independent state, and was especially h eightened by the tragic, brutal, and both economically and po litically very costly intervention in Chechnya. Mos t painful of all, Russia's international status was significa ntly degraded, with one of the world's two superpow ers now viewed by many as little more than a Third World re gional power, though still possessing a significant but increasingly antiquated nuclear arsenal. The geopolitical void was magnified by the scale of Russia's social crisis. Three-quarters of a cen tury of Communist rule had inflicted unprecedented biologic al damage on the Russian people. A very high propor tion of its most gifted and enterprising individuals wer e killed or perished in the Gulag, in numbers to be counted in the millions. In addition, during this century the country also suffered the ravages of World War 1, t he killings of a protracted civil war, and the atrocities and d eprivations of World War II. The ruling Communist r egime imposed a stifling doctrinal orthodoxy, while isola ting the country from the rest of the world. Its ec onomic policies were totally indifferent to ecological con cerns, with the result that both the environment an d the health of the people suffered greatly. According to offici al Russian statistics, by the mid-1990s only about 40 percent of newborns came into the world healthy, while roug hly one-fifth of Russian first graders suffered fro m some form of mental retardation. Male longevity had decl ined to 57.3 years, and more Russians were dying th an were being born. Russia's social condition was, in fact, typical of a middle-rank Third World country. One cannot overstate the horrors and tribulation s that have befallen the Russian people in the cour se of this century. Hardly a single Russian family has had the opportunity to lead a normal civilized existence. Consider the social implications of the following sequence o f events: • the Russo-Japanese War of 1905, ending in Russia' s humili ating defeat; • the first \"proletarian\" revolution of 1905, ignit ing large-scale urban violence; • World War I of 1914-1917, with its millions of ca sualties and massive economic dislocation; • the civil war of 1918-1921, again .consuming seve ral million lives and devastating the land; • the Russo-Polish War of 1919-1920, ending in a Ru ssian defeat; • the launching of the Gulag in the early 1920s , including the decimation of the prerevolutionary elite and its large-scale exodus from Russia; • the industrialization and collectivization drives of the early and mid-1930s, which generated massiv e famines and mil lions of deaths in Ukraine and Kaza kstan; • the Great Purges and Terror of the mid- and late 1930s, with millions incarcerated in labor camps an d upward of 1 mil lion shot and several million dying from maltreatment; • World War II of 1941-1945, with its multiple mill ions of mili tary and civilian casualties and vast economic devastation; • the reimposition of Stalinist terror in the late 1940s, again involving large-scale arrests and freq uent executions; • the forty-year-long arms race with the United Sta tes, lasting from the late 1940s to the late 1980s, with its socially impov erishing effects; • the economically exhausting efforts to project So viet power into the Caribbean, Middle East, and Africa during the 1970s and 1980s;"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"• the debilitating war in Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989; • the sudden breakup of the Soviet Union, followed by civil disorders, a painful economic crisis, and the bloody and hu miliating war against Chechnya. Not only was the crisis in Russia's internal co ndition and the loss of international status distre ssingly unsettling, especially for the Russian political el ite, but Russia's geopolitical situation was also a dversely affected. In the West, as a consequence of the Sovi et Union's disintegration, Russia's frontiers had b een altered most painfully, and its sphere of geopolitical infl uence had dramatically shrunk (see map on page 94). The Baltic states had been Russian-controlled since the 1700s, and the loss of the ports of Riga and Talli nn made Russia's access to the Baltic Sea more limited and subject to winter freezes. Although Moscow managed to retain a politically dominant position in the forma lly newly independent but highly Kussifiod Belarus, it was far from certain that the nationalist contagion would n ot eventually also gain the upper hand there as wel l. And beyond the frontiers of the former Soviet Union, th e collapse of the Warsaw Pact meant that the former satellite states of Central Europe, foremost among them Polan d, were rapidly gravitating toward NATO and the European Union. Most troubling of all was the loss of Ukraine. T he appearance of an independent Ukrainian state not only challenged all Russians to rethink the nature of th eir own political and ethnic identity, but it repre sented a vital geopolitical setback for the Russian state. The rep udiation of more than three hundred years of Russia n imperial history meant the loss of a potentially rich indust rial and agricultural economy and of 52 million peo ple ethnically and religiously sufficiently close to th e Russians to make Russia into a truly large and co nfident imperial state. Ukraine's independence also deprive d Russia of its dominant position on the Black Sea, where Odessa had served as Russia's vital gateway to trad e with the Mediterranean and the world beyond. The loss of Ukraine was geopolitically pivotal, for it drastically limited Russia's geostrategic op tions. Even without the Baltic states and Poland, a Russia that retained control over Ukraine could still seek to be the leader of an assertive Eurasian empire, in which Moscow co uld dominate the non-Slavs in the South and Southea st of the former Soviet Union. But without Ukraine and it s 52 million fellow Slavs, any attempt by Moscow to rebuild the Eurasian empire was likely to leave Rus sia entangled alone in protracted conflicts with th e nationally and religiously aroused non-Slavs, the w ar with Chechnya perhaps simply being the first exa mple. Moreover, given Russia's declining birthrate and th e explosive birthrate among the Central Asians, any new Eurasian entity based purely on Russian power, with out Ukraine, would inevitably become less European and more Asiatic with each passing year. The loss of Ukraine was not only geopolitically pivotal but also geopolitically catalytic. It was U krainian actions—the Ukrainian declaration of independence i n December 1991, its insistence in the critical neg otiations in Bela Vezha that the Soviet Union should be repla ced by a looser Commonwealth of Independent States, and especially the1 suddm coup-like imposition of Ukrai nian command over the Soviet army units stationed o n Ukrainian soil—that prevented the CIS from becoming merely a new name for a more con-federal USSR. Ukraine's political self-determination stunned Mosc ow and set an example that the other Soviet republi cs, though initially more timidly, then followed. Russia's loss of its dominant position on the B altic Sea was replicated on the Black Sea not only because of Ukraine's independence but also because the newly i ndependent Caucasian states— Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan—enhanced the opportunities for Turkey to reestablish its once-lost influence in the region. Prior to 1991, the Black Sea was the point of departure for the projection of Russian naval power into the Mediterranean. By the mid-1990s, Russia was left wi th a small coastal strip on the Black Sea and with an unresolved debate with Ukraine over basing rights i n Crimea for the remnants of the Soviet Black Sea F leet, while observing, with evident irritation, joint NAT O-Ukrainian naval and shore-landing maneuvers and a growing Turkish role in the Black Sea region. Russi a also suspected Turkey of having provided effectiv e aid to the Chechen resistance. Farther to the southeast, the geopolitical uphe aval produced a similarly significant change in the status of the Caspian Sea basin and of Central Asia more generall y. Before the Soviet Union's collapse, the Caspian Sea was in effect a Russian lake, with a small southern sec tor falling within Iran's perimeter. With the emerg ence of the"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"independent and strongly nationalist Azerbaijan—rei nforced by the influx of eager Western oil investor s—and the similarly independent Kazakstan and Turkmenista n, Russia became only one of five claimants to the riches of the Caspian Sea basin. It could no longer confid ently assume that it could dispose of these resourc es on its own. The emergence of the independent Central Asian states meant that in some places Russia's southeast ern frontier had been pushed back northward more than o ne thousand miles. The new states now controlled va st mineral and energy deposits that were bound to attr act foreign interests. It was almost inevitable tha t not only the elites but, before too long, also the peoples o f these states would become more nationalistic and perhaps increasingly Islamic in outlook. In Kazakstan, a va st country endowed with enormous natural resources but with its nearly 20 million people split almost even ly between Kazaks and Slavs, linguistic and nationa l frictions are likely to intensify. Uzbekistan—with its much m ore ethnically homogeneous population of approximat ely 25 million and its leaders emphasizing the country' s historic glories—has become increasingly assertiv e in affirming the region's new postcolonial status. Tur kmenistan, geographically shielded by Kazakstan fro m any direct contact with Russia, has actively developed new links with Iran in order to diminish its prior dependence on the Russian communications system for access to the global markets. Supported from the outside by Turkey, Iran, Pak istan, and Saudi Arabia, the Central Asian states h ave not been inclined to trade their new political sovereig nty even for the sake of beneficial economic integr ation with Russia, as many Russians continued to hope they wou ld. At the very least, some tension and hostility i n their relationship with Russia is unavoidable, while the painful precedents of Chechnya and Tajikistan sugge st that something worse cannot be altogether excluded. For the Russians, the specter of a potential conflict w ith the Islamic states along Russia's entire southern flank (which, adding in Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan, acco unt for more than 300 million people) has to be a source of serious concern. Finally, at the time its empire dissolved, Russ ia was also facing an ominous new geopolitical situ ation in the Far East, even though no territorial or political c hanges had taken place. For several centuries, Chin a had been weaker and more backward than Russia, at least in t he political-military domains. No Russian concerned with the country's future and perplexed by the dramatic changes of this decade can ignore the fact that Chi na is on its way to being a more advanced, more dynamic, and mor e successful state than Russia. China's economic po wer, wedded to the dynamic energy of its 1.2 billion peo ple, is fundamentally reversing the historical equa tion between the two countries, with the empty spaces of Siberia almost beckoning for Chinese colonization."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" This staggering new reality was bound to affect the Russian sense of security in its Far Eastern r egion as well as Russian interests in Central Asia. Before long, this development might even overshadow the geopolit ical importance of Russia's loss of Ukraine. Its strateg ic implications were well expressed by Vladimir Luk in, Russia's first post-Communist ambassador to the Uni ted States and later the chairman of the Duma's For eign Affairs Committee: In the past, Russia saw itself as being ahead of As ia, though lagging behind Europe. But since then, A sia has developed much faster. ... we find ourselves to be not so much between \"modern Europe\" and \"backward Asia\" but rather occupying some strange m iddle space between two \"Europes.\"1 1. In \"Our Security Predicament,\" Foreign Policy 88 (Fall 1992):60. In brief, Russia, until recently the forger of a great territorial empire and the leader of an ide ological bloc of satellite states extending into the very heart of E urope and at one point to the South China Sea, had become a troubled national state, without easy geographic ac cess to the outside world and potentially vulnerabl e to debilitating conflicts with its neighbors on its we stern, southern, and eastern flanks. Only the uninh abitable and inaccessible northern spaces, almost permanently fr ozen, seemed geopo-litically secure. GEOSTRATEGIC PHANTASMAGORIA A period of historic and strategic confusion in pos timperial Russia was hence unavoidable. The shockin g collapse of the Soviet Union and especially the stu nning and generally unexpected disintegration of th e Great Russian Empire have given rise in Russia to enormou s soul-searching, to a wide-ranging debate over wha t ought to be Russia's current historical self-defini tion, to intense public and private arguments over questions that in most major nations are not even raised: Wha t is Russia? Where is Russia? What does it mean to be a Russian? These questions are not merely theoretical: any reply contains significant geopolitical content. I s Russia a national state, based on purely Russian ethnicity, or is Russia by definition something more (as Brita in is more than England) and hence destined to be an imperial state? What are—historically, strategically, and et hnically — the proper frontiers of Russia? Should the indepe ndent Ukraine be viewed as a temporary aberration w hen assessed in such historic, strategic, and ethnic te rms? (Many Russians are inclined to feel that way.) To be a Russian, does one have to be ethnically a Russian ( \"Russkyi\"), or can one be a Russian politically but not ethnically (that is, be a \"Rossyanin\"—the equivalen t to \"British\" but not to \"English\")? For example, Yeltsin and some Russians have argued (with tragic conseque nces) that the Chechens could—indeed, should—be considered Russians. A year before the Soviet Union's demise, a Russi an nationalist, one of the few who saw the end appr oaching, cried out in a desperate affirmation: If the terrible disaster, which is unthinkable to t he Russian people, does occur and the state is torn apart, and the people, robbed and deceived by their 1,000- year history, suddenly end up alone, and their rece nt \"brothers\" have taken their belongings and disappea red into their \"national lifeboats\" and sail away f rom the listing ship—well, we have nowhere to go.... Russian statehood, which embodies the \"Russian idea\" politically, economically, and spiritually, w ill be built anew. It will gather up all the best from its long 1,000-year kingdom and the 70 years of Sov iet history that have flown by in a moment.2 2.

Now, suddenly, that mission was repudiated a s the state shrank territorially to a largely ethnic dimension. Moreover, the post-Soviet crisis of the Russian state (of its \"essence,\" so to speak) was compounde d by the fact that Russia was not only faced with the challe nge of having been suddenly deprived of its imperia l missionary vocation but, in order to close the yawn ing gap between Russia's social backwardness and th e more advanced parts of Eurasia, was now being pressed by domestic modernizers (and their Western consultant s) to withdraw from its traditional economic role as the mentor, owner, and disposer of social wealth. This called for nothing short of a politically revolutionary limita tion of the international and domestic role of the Russian state. This was profoundly disruptive to the most establis hed patterns of Russian domestic life and contribut ed to a divisive sense of geopolitical disorientation withi n the Russian political elite. In that perplexing setting, as one might have e xpected, \"Whither Russia and what is Russia?\" promp ted a variety of responses. Russia's extensive Eurasian l ocation has long predisposed that elite to think in geopolitical terms. The first foreign minister of the postimperi al and post-Communist Russia, Andrei Kozyrev, reaff irmed that mode of thought in one of his early attempts t o define how the new Russia should conduct itself o n the international scene. Barely a month after the disso lution of the Soviet Union, he noted: \"In abandonin g messianism we set course for pragmatism. ... we rap idly came to understand that geopolitics ... is rep lacing ideology.\"3 3. Interview in Rossiyskaya Gazela, January 12, 199 2. Generally speaking, three broad and partially o verlapping geostrategic options, each ultimately re lated to Russia's preoccupation with its status vis-a-vis Am erica and each also containing some internal varian ts, can be said to have emerged in reaction to the Soviet Unio n's collapse. These several schools of thought can be classified as follows: 1. priority for \"the mature strategic partnership\" with America, which for some of its adherents was actually a code term for a global condominium; 2. emphasis on the \"near abroad\" as Russia's centra l concern, with some advocating a form of Moscow- dominated economic integration but with others also expecting an eventual restoration of some measure of imperial control, thereby creating a power more capable of balancing America and Europe; and 3. a counteralliance, involving some sort of a Eura sian anti-U.S. coalition designed to reduce the American preponderance in Eurasia. Although the first of the foregoing was initiall y dominant among President Yeltsin's new ruling tea m, the second option surfaced into political prominence sh ortly thereafter, in part as a critique of Yeltsin' s geopolitical priorities; the third made itself heard somewhat la ter, around the mid-1990s, in reaction to the sprea ding sense that Russia's post-Soviet geostrategy was both uncl ear and failing. As it happens, all three proved to be historically maladroit and derived from rather phan tasmagoric views of Russia's current power, interna tional potential, and foreign interests. In the immediate wake of the Soviet Union's coll apse, Yeltsin's initial posture represented the cre sting of the old but never entirely successful \"westernizer\" con ception in Russian political thought: that Russia b elonged in the West, should be part of the West, and should as much as possible imitate the West in its own domes tic development. That view was espoused by Yeltsin hims elf and by his foreign minister, with Yeltsin being quite explicit in denouncing the Russian imperial legacy. Speaking in Kiev on November 19, 1990, in words th at the Ukrainians or Chechens could subsequently turn agai nst him, Yeltsin eloquently declared: Russia does not aspire to become the center of some sort of new empire . .. Russia understands better than others the per-niciousness of that role, inasm uch as it was Russia that performed that role for a long time. What did it gain from this? Did Russians beco me freer as a result? Wealthier? Happier? .. . hist ory has taught us that a people that rules over others cannot be fortunate."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" The deliberately friendly posture adopted by th e West, especially by the United States, toward the new Russian leadership was a source ol CIKoiiiaijciucii l In Ihc pnsl-Snviol \"westenizers\" in the Russian f oreign policy establishment. It both reinforced its pro-Am erican inclinations and seduced its membership pers onally. The new leaders were flattered to be on a first-nam e basis with the top policy makers of the world's o nly superpower, and they found it easy to deceive thems elves into thinking that they, too, were the leader s of a superpower. When the Americans launched the slogan of \"the mature strategic partnership\" between Washington and Moscow, to the Russians it seemed as if a new democratic American-Russian condominium— replacing the former contest—had thus been sanctifi ed. That condominium would be global in scope. Russ ia thereby would not only be the legal successor to the former Soviet Union but the de facto partner in a g lobal accommodation, based on genuine equality. As the new Russian leaders never tired of asserting, that mean t not only that the rest of the world should recogn ize Russia as America's equal but that no global problem could be tackled or resolved without Russia's participat ion and/or permission. Although it was not openly stated, impl icit in this illusion was also the notion that Cent ral Europe would somehow remain, or might even choose to remai n, a region of special political proximity to Russi a. The dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and Comecon would no t be followed by the gravitation of their former me mbers either toward NATO or even only toward the EU. Western aid, in the meantime, would enable the R ussian government to undertake domestic reforms, withdrawing the state from economic life and permit ting the consolidation of democratic institutions. Russia's economic recovery, its special status as America's coequal partner, and its sheer attractiveness would then encourage the recently independent states of the ne w CIS—grateful that the new Russia was not threaten ing them and increasingly aware of the benefits of some form of union with Russia—to engage in ever-closer economic and then political integration with Russia , thereby also enhancing Russia's scope and power. The problem with this approach was that it was devoid of either international or domestic realism. While the concept of \"mature strategic partnership\" was flatt ering, it was also deceptive. America was neither i nclined to share global power with Russia nor could it, even i f it had wanted to do so. The new Russia was simply too weak, too devastated by three-quarters of a century of Communist rule, and too socially backward to be a real global partner. In Washington's view, Germany, Japa n, and China were at least as important and influen tial. Moreover, on some of the central geostrategic issue s of national interest to America—in Europe, the Mi ddle East, and the Far East—it was far from the case tha t American and Russian aspirations were the same. O nce differences inevitably started to surface, the disp roportion in political power, financial clout, tech nological innovation, and cultural appeal made the \"mature st rategic partnership\" seem hollow—and it struck an increasing number of Russians as deliberately desig ned to deceive Russia. Perhaps that disappointment might have been aver ted if earlier on—during the American-Russian honeymoon—America had embraced the concept of NATO expansion and had at the same time offered Russia \"a deal it could not refuse,\" namely, a special coo perative relationship between Russia and NATO. Had America clearly and decisively embraced the idea of widening the alliance, with the stipulation that R ussia should somehow be included in the process, perhaps Moscow's subsequent sense of disappointment with \"t he mature partnership\" as well as the progressive weak ening of the political position of the westernizers in the Kremlin might have been averted. The moment to have done so was during the second half of 1993, right after Yeltsin's public endorse ment in August of Poland's interest in joining the transatl antic alliance as being consistent with \"the intere sts of Russia.\" Instead, the Clinton administration, then still pur suing its \"Russia first\" policy, agonized for two m ore years, while the Kremlin changed its tune and became incre asingly hostile to the emerging but indecisive sign als of the American intention to widen NATO. By the time W ashington decided, in 1996, to make NATO enlargement a central goal in America's policy of s haping a larger and more secure Euro-Atlantic commu nity, the Russians had locked themselves into rigid oppos ition. Hence, the year 1993 might be viewed as the year of a missed historic opportunity. Admittedly, not all of the Russian concerns rega rding NATO expansion lacked legitimacy or were moti vated by malevolent motives. Some opponents, to be sure, especially among the Russian military, partook of a Cold War mentality, viewing NATO expansion not as an int egral part of Europe's own growth but rather as the"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"advance toward Russia of an American-led and still hostile alliance. Some of the Russian foreign polic y elite— most of whom were actually former Soviet officials— persisted in the long-standing geostrategic view th at America had no place in Eurasia and that NATO expan sion was largely driven by the American desire to increase its sphere of influence. Some of their opp osition also derived^ from the hope that an unattac hed Central Europe would some day again revert to Mosco w's sphere of geopolitical influence, once Russia h ad regained its health. But many Russian democrats also feared that the expansion of NATO would mean that Russia would be left outside of Europe, ostracized politically, and cons idered unworthy of membership in the institutional framework of European civilization. Cultural insecu rity compounded the political fears, making NATO expansion seem like the culmination of the long-sta nding Western policy designed to isolate Russia, le aving it alone in the world and vulnerable to its various en emies. Moreover, the Russian democrats simply could not grasp the depth either of the Central Europeans' re sentment over half a century of Moscow's domination or of their desire to be part of a larger Euro-Atlantic s ystem. On balance, it is probable that neither the dis appointment nor the weakening of the Russian wester nizers could have been avoided. For one thing, the new Rus sian elite, quite divided within itself and with ne ither its president nor its foreign minister capable of provi ding consistent geostrategic leadership, was not ab le to define clearly what the new Russia wanted in Europe, nor c ould it realistically assess the actual limitations of Russia's weakened condition. Moscow's politically embattled democrats could not bring themselves to state boldl y that a democratic Russia does not oppose the enlargement o f the transatlantic democratic community and that i t wishes to be associated with it. The delusion of a shared global status with America made it difficult for the Moscow political elite to abandon the idea of a pri vileged geopolitical position for Russia, not only in the area of the former Soviet Union itself but even in regar d to the former Central European satellite states. These developments played into the hands of the nationalists, who by 1994 were beginning to recove r their voices, and the militarists, who by then had become Yeltsin's critically important clomestic supporter s. Their increasingly shrill and occasionally threatening re actions to the aspirations of the Central Europeans merely intensified the determination of the former satelli te states—mindful of their only recently achieved l iberation from Russian rule—to gain the safe haven of NATO. The gulf between Washington and Moscow was wide ned further by the Kremlin's unwillingness to disav ow all of Stalin's conquests. Western public opinion, especially in Scandinavia but also in the United St ates, was especially troubled by the ambiguity of the Russian attitude toward the Baltic republics. While recogn izing their independence and not pressing for their membership in the CIS, even the democratic Russian leaders periodically resorted to threats in order to obtain preferential treatment for the large communities o f Russian colonists who had deliberately been settled in thes e countries during the Stalinist years. The atmosph ere was further clouded by the pointed unwillingness of the Kremlin to denounce the secret Nazi-Soviet agreeme nt of 1939 that had paved the way for the forcible incorp oration of these republics into the Soviet Union. E ven five years after the Soviet Union's collapse, spokesmen for the Kremlin insisted (in the official statement of September 10, 1996) that in 1940 the Baltic states had voluntarily \"joined\" the Soviet Union. The post-Soviet Russian elite had apparently als o expected that the West would aid in, or at least not impede, the restoration of a central Russian role in the po st-Soviet space. They thus resented the West's will ingness to help the newly independent post-Soviet states conso lidate their separate political existence. Even whi le warning that a \"confrontation with the United States ... is an option that should be avoided,\" senior Russian analysts of American foreign policy argued (not altogether inco rrectly) that the United States was seeking \"the reorganization of interstate relations in the whole of Eurasia ... whereby there was not one sole lead ing power on the continent but many medium, relatively stable , and moderately strong ones ... but necessarily in ferior to the United States in their individual or even colle ctive capabilities.\"4 4.

In this regard, Ukraine was critical. The growi ng American inclination, especially by 1994, to ass ign a high priority to American-Ukrainian relations and to hel p Ukraine sustain its new national freedom was view ed by"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"many in Moscow—even by its \"westerniz-ers\"—as a pol icy directed at the vital Russian interest in event ually bringing Ukraine back into the common fold. That Uk raine will eventually somehow be-, \"reintegrated\" remains an article of faith among many members of t he Russian political elite.5 As a result, Russia's geopolitical and historical questioning of Ukraine' s separate status collided head-on with the America n view that an imperial Russia could not be a democratic R ussia. Additionally, there were purely domestic reason s that a \"mature strategic partnership\" between two \"democracies\" proved to be illusory. Russia was jus t too backward and too devastated by Communist rule to be a viable democratic partner of the United States. T hat central reality could not be obscured by high-s ounding rhetoric about partnership. Post-Soviet Russia, mor eover, had made only a partial break with the past. Almost all of its \"democratic\" leaders—even if genuinely d isillusioned with the Soviet past— were not only th e products of the Soviet system but former senior mem bers of its ruling elite. They were not former diss idents, as in Poland or the Czech Republic. The key institutio ns of Soviet power—though weakened, demoralized, an d corrupted—were still there. Symbolic of that realit y and of the lingering hold of the Communist past w as the historic centerpiece of Moscow: the continued prese nce of the Lenin mausoleum. It was as if post-Nazi Germany were governed by former middle-level Nazi \" Gauleiters\" spouting democratic slogans, with a Hit ler mausoleum still standing in the center of Berlin. 5. For example, even Yeltsin's top adviser, Dmitryi Ryurikov, was quoted by Interfax (November 20, 199 6) as considering Ukraine to be \"a temporary phenomenon,\" while Moscow's Obshchaya Gazeta (December 10, 1996) reported that \"in the foreseeable future even ts in eastern Ukraine may confront Russia with a ve ry difficult problem. Mass manifestations of disconten t... will be accompanied by appeals to Russia, or e ven demands, to take over the region. Quite a few peopl e in Moscow would be ready to support such plans.\" Western concerns regarding Russian intentions were certainly not eased by Russian demands for Crimea a nd Sevastopol, nor by such provocative acts as the del iberate inclusion in late 199(i of Sevastopol in Ru ssian public television's nitfhUy wcalhcr ton-casts for K ussi.in rilirs. The political weakness of the new democratic eli te was compounded by the very scale of the Russian economic crisis. The need for massive reforms—for t he withdrawal of the Russian state from the economy — generated excessive expectations of Western, especi ally American, aid. Although that aid, especially f rom Germany and America, gradually did assume large pro portions, even under the best of circumstances it s till could not prompt a quick economic recovery. The res ulting social dissatisfaction provided additional underpinning for a mounting chorus of disappointed critics who alleged that the partnership with the U nited States was a sham, beneficial to America but damagi ng to Russia. In brief, neither the objective nor the subject ive preconditions for an effective global partnersh ip existed in the immediate years following the Soviet Union's co llapse. The democratic \"westerniz-ers\" simply wante d too much and could deliver too little. They desired an equal partnership—or, rather, a condominium—with America, a relatively free hand within the CIS, and a geopolitical no-man's-land in Central Europe. Ye t their ambivalence about Soviet history, their lack of rea lism regarding global power, the depth of the econo mic crisis, and the absence of widespread social suppor t meant that they could not deliver the stable and truly democratic Russia that the concept of equal partner ship implied. Russia first had to go through a prol onged process of political reform, an equally long proces s of democratic stabilization, and an even longer p rocess of socioeconomic modernization and then manage a deepe r shift from an imperial to a national mindset rega rding the new geopolitical realities not only in Central Europe but especially within the former Russian Emp ire before a real partnership with America could become a viab le geopolitical option. Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that the \"near abroad\" priority became both the maj or critique of the pro-West option as well as an early foreign policy alternative. It was based on the argument th at the \"partnership\" concept slighted what ought to be mos t important to Russia: namely, its relations with t he former Soviet republics. The \"near abroad\" came to be the shorthand formulation for advocacy of a policy that would place primary emphasis on the need to reconstruct s ome sort of a viable framework, with Moscow as the decision-making center, in the geopolitical space o nce occupied by the Soviet Union. On this premise, there was widespread agreement that a policy of concentra tion on the West, especially on America, was yieldi ng little and costing too much. It simply made it easier for the West to exploit the opportunities created by th e Soviet Union's collapse."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" However, the \"near abroad\" school of thought wa s a broad umbrella under which several varying geop olitical conceptions could cluster. It embraced not only the economic functionalists and de-terminists (includi ng some \"westernizers\") who believed that the CIS could evo lve into a Moscow-led version of the EU but also ot hers who saw in economic integration merely one of sever al tools of imperial restoration that could operate either under the CIS umbrella or through special arrangeme nts (formulated in 1996) between Russia and Belarus or among Russia, Belarus, Kazakstan, and Kyrgyzstan; i t also included Slavophile romantics who advocated a Slavic Union of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, and, finally, proponents of the somewhat mystical notion of Eurasianism as the substantive definition of Russia 's enduring historical mission. In its narrowest form, the \"near abroad\" priori ty involved the perfectly reasonable proposition th at Russia must first concentrate on relations with the newly independent states, especially as all of them remai ned tied to Russia by the realities of the deliberately fostere d Soviet policy of promoting economic interdependen ce among them. That made both economic and geopolitical sens e. The \"common economic space,\" of which the new Russian leaders spoke often, was a reality that cou ld not be ignored by the leaders of the newly indep endent states. Cooperation, and even some integration, was an economic necessity. Thus, it was not only norma l but desirable to promote joint CIS institutions in orde r to reverse the economic disruptions and fragmenta tion produced by the political breakup of the Soviet Uni on. For some Russians, the promotion of economic in tegration was thus a functionally effective and pol itically responsible reaction to what had transpired. The an alogy with the EU was often cited as pertinent to t he post- Soviet situation. A restoration of the empire was e xplicitly rejected by the more moderate advocates o f economic integration. For example, an influential r eport entitled \"A Strategy for Russia,\" which was i ssued as early as August 1992 by the Council for Foreign and Defense Policy, a group of prominent personalities and government officials, very pointedly advocated \"pos t-imperial enlightened integration\" as the proper p rogram for the post-Soviet \"common economic space.\" However, emphasis on the \"near abroad\" was not merely a politically benign doctrine of regional ec onomic cooperation. Its geopolitical content had imperial overtones. Even the relatively moderate 1992 report spoke of a recovered Russia that would eventually establish a strategic partnership with the West, in which Rus sia would have the role of \"regulating the situation in Easte rn Europe, Central Asia and the Far East.\" Other ad vocates of this priority were more unabashed, speaking explici tly of Russia's \"exclusive role\" in the post-Soviet space and accusing the West of engaging in an anti-Russian po licy by providing aid to Ukraine and the other newl y independent states. A typical but by no means extreme example was th e argument made by Y. Ambartsumov, the chairman in 1993 of the parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee and a former advocate of the \"partnership\" priorit y, who openly asserted that the former Soviet space was an exclusive Russian sphere of geopolitical influence . In January 1994, he was echoed by the heretofore energ etic advocate of the pro-Western priority, Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, who stated that Russia \"must preser ve its military presence in regions that have been in its sphere of interest for centuries.\" In fact, Izvesti ia reported on April 8, 1994, that Russia had succe eded in retaining no fewer than twenty-eight military bases on the soil of the newly independent states—and a line drawn on a map linking the Russian military deploym ents in Kaliningrad, Moldova, Crimea, Armenia, Tajikistan, and the Kuril Islands would roughly app roximate the outer limits of the former Soviet Unio n, as in the map on page 108. In September 1995, President Yeltsin issued an o fficial document on Russian policy toward the CIS t hat codified Russian goals as follows: The main objective of Russia's policy toward the CI S is to create an economically and politically integrated association of states capable of claimin g its proper place in the world community ... to consolidate Russia as the leading force in the form ation of a new system of interstate political and economic relations on the1 territory of the post-Un ion space. "},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" One should note the emphasis placed on the political dimension of the effort, on the reference to a single entity claiming \"its\" place in the world system, and on Russia's dominant role within that new entity. In keeping with this emphasis, Moscow insisted that political and military ties between Russia and the newly constituted CIS also be reinforced: that a common military command be created; that the armed forces of the CIS states be linked by a formal treaty; that the \"external\" borders of the CIS be subject to centralized (meaning Moscow's) control; that Russian forces play the decisive role in any peacekeeping actions within the CIS; and that a common foreign policy be shaped within the CIS, whose main institutions have come to be located in Moscow (and not in Minsk, as originally agreed in 1991), with the Russian president presiding at the CIS summit meetings. And that was not all. The September 1995 documen t also declared that Russian television and radio broadcasting in the ne ar abroad should be guaranteed, the dissemination o f Russian press in the region should be supported, an d Russia should train national cadres for CIS state s. Special attention should be given to restoring Russia's position as the main educational center on the territory of the post-Soviet space, bearing in mind the need to educate the young generation in CIS st ates in a spirit of friendly relations with Russia. Reflecting this mood, in early 1996 the Russian Duma went so far as to declare the dissolution of the Soviet Union to be invalid. Moreover, during spring of the same year, Russia signed two agreements providing for closer economic and political integration between R ussia and the more accommodating members of the CIS . One agreement, signed with great pomp and circumsta nce, in effect provided for a union between Russia and Belarus within a new \"Community of Sovereign Republ ics\" (the Russian abbreviation \"SSR\" was pointedly reminiscent of the Soviet Union's \"SSSR\"), and the other—signed by Russia, Kazakstan, Belarus, and Kyr gyzs- tan—postulated the creation in the long term of a \" Community of Integrated States.\" Both initiatives i ndicated impatience over the slow progress of integration wi thin the CIS and Russia's determination to persist in promoting it. The \"near abroad\" emphasis on enhancing the cen tral mechanisms of the CIS thus combined some eleme nts of reliance on objective economic determinism with a strong dose of subjective imperial determination. But neither provided a more philosophical and also a ge opolitical answer to the still gnawing question \"Wh at is Russia, what is its true mission and rightful scope ?\" It was this void that the increasingly appealin g doctrine of Eurasianism—with its focus also on th e \"near abroad\"—attempted to fill. The point of departure f or this orientation—defined in rather cultural and even mystical terminology—was the premise that geopoliti cally and culturally, Russia is neither quite Europ ean nor quite Asian and that, therefore, it has a distincti ve Eurasian identity of its own. That identity is t he legacy of Russia's unique spatial control over the enormous l andmass between Central Europe and the shores of th e Pacific Ocean, the legacy of the imperial statehood thai Moscow forged through four centuries of eastw ard expansion. That expansion assimilated into Russia a large non-Russian and non-European population, cre ating thereby also a singular Eurasian political and cult ural personality."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" Eurasianism as a doctrine was not a post-Soviet emanation. It first surfaced in the nineteenth cen tury but became more pervasive in the twentieth, as an artic ulate alternative to Soviet communism and as a reac tion to the alleged decadence of the West. Russian emigres were especially active in propagating the doctrine as an alternative to Sovietism, realizing that the nation al awakening of the non-Russians within the Soviet Union required an overarching supranational doctrine, les t the eventual fall of communism lead also to the disintegration of the old Great Russian Empire. As early as the mid-1920s, this case was articul ated persuasively by Prince N. S. Trubetzkoy, a lea ding exponent of Eurasian-ism, who wrote that Communism was in fact a disguised version of Europeanism in destroying the spiritual foundations and national u niqueness of Russian life, in propagating there the materialist frame of reference that actually governs both Europ e and America ... Our task is to create a completely new culture, our own culture, which will not resemble European civilization . .. when Russia ceases to be a distor ted reflection of European civilization ... when sh e becomes once again herself: Russia-Eurasia, the con scious heir to and bearer of the great legacy of Genghis Khan.6 6. «N. S. Trubetzkoy. \"The Legacy of Genghis Khan,\" Cross Currents 9 (1990):68. That view found an eager audience in the confuse d post-Soviet setting. On the one hand, communism w as condemned as a betrayal of Russian orthodoxy and of the special, mystical \"Russian idea\"; and on the o ther, westernism was repudiated because the West, especia lly America, was seen as corrupt, anti-Russian cult urally, and inclined to deny to Russia its historically and geographically rooted claim to exclusive control o ver the Eurasian landmass. Eurasianism was given an academic gloss in the much-quoted writings of Lev Gumilev, a historian, geographer, and ethnographer, whose books Medieval Russia and the Great Steppe, The Rhythms of Eurasia , and The Geography ofEthnos in Historical Time make a powerful case for the proposition that Eurasia is the natural geographic setting for the Russian people's distinctive \"eth-nos,\" the consequence of a histor ic symbiosis between them and the non-Russian inhabita nts of the open steppes, creating thereby a unique Eurasian cultural and spiritual identity. Gumilev w arned that adaptation to the West would mean nothin g less for the Russian people than the loss of their own \" ethnos and soul.\" These views were echoed, though more primitively , by a variety of Russian nationalist politicians. Yeltsin's former vice president, Aleksandr Rutskoi, for examp le, asserted that \"it is apparent from looking at o ur country's geopolitical situation that Russia repres ents the only bridge between Asia and Europe. Whoev er becomes the master of this space will become the ma ster of the world.\"7 Yeltsin's 1996 Communist chall enger, Gennadii Zyuganov, despite his Marxist-Leninist voc ation, embraced Eurasianism's mystical emphasis on the special spiritual and missionary role of the Russia n people in the vast spaces of Eurasia, arguing tha t Russia was thereby endowed both with a unique cultural voc ation and with a specially advantageous geographic basis for the exercise of global leadership. 7. Interview with L'Espresso (Rome), July 15, 1994. A more sober and pragmatic version of Eurasianis m was also advanced by the leader of Kazakstan, Nur sultan Nazarbayev. Faced at home with an almost even demog raphic split between native Kazaks and Russian sett lers and seeking a formula that would somewhat dilute Mo scow's pressures for political integration, Nazarba yev propagated the concept of the \"Eurasian Union\" as a n alternative to the faceless and ineffective CIS. Although his version lacked the mystical content of the more traditional Eurasianist thinking and certainly did not posit a special missionary role for the Russians as leaders of Eurasia, it was derived from the notion that Eu rasia— defined geographically in terms analogous to that o f the Soviet Union—constituted an organic whole, wh ich must also have a political dimension. To a degree, the attempt to assign to the \"near abroad\" the highest priority in Russian geopolitica l thinking was justified in the sense that some measure of ord er and accommodation between postimperial Russia an d the newly independent states was an absolute necessity, in terms of security and economics. However, what gave"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"much of the discussion a surrealistic touch was the lingering notion that in some fashion, whether it came about either voluntarily (because of economics) or as a c onsequence of Russia's eventual recovery of its los t power— not to speak of Russia's special Eurasian or Slavic mission—the political \"integration\" of the former empire was both desirable and feasible. In this regard, the frequently invoked comparis on with the EU neglects a crucial distinction: the EU, even allowing for Germany's special influence, is not do minated by a single power that alone overshadows al l the other members combined, in relative GNP, population , or territory. Nor is the EU the successor to a na tional empire, with the liberated members deeply suspiciou s that \"integration\" is a code word for renewed subordination. Even so, one can easily imagine what the reaction of the European states would have bee n if Germany had declared formally that its goal was to consolidate and expand its leading role in the EU a long the lines of Russia's pronouncement of September 1995 c ited earlier. The analogy with the EU suffers from yet anothe r deficiency. The open and relatively developed Wes tern European economies were ready for democratic integr ation, and the majority of Western Europeans percei ved tangible economic and political benefits in such in tegration. The poorer West European countries were also able to benefit from substantial subsidies. In contrast, the newly independent states viewed Russia as poli tically unstable, as still entertaining domineering ambitio ns, and, economically, as an obstacle to their part icipation in the global economy and to their access to much-need ed foreign investment. Opposition to Moscow's notions of \"integration\" was particularly strong in Ukraine. Its leaders qu ickly recognized that such \"integration,\" especially in l ight of Russian reservations regarding the legitima cy of Ukrainian independence, would eventually lead to th e loss of national sovereignty. Moreover, the heavy -handed Russian treatment of the new Ukrainian state—its un willingness to grant recognition of Ukraine's borde rs, its questioning of Ukraine's right to Crimea, its insis tence on exclusive extraterritorial control over th e port of Sevastopol—gave the aroused Ukrainian nationalism a distinctively anti-Russian edge. The self-definiti on of Ukrainian nationhood, during the critical formative stage in the history of the new state, was thus di verted from its traditional anti-Polish or anti-Romanian orient ation and became focused instead on opposition to a ny Russian proposals for a more integrated CIS, for a special Slavic community (with Russia and Belarus), or for a Eurasian Union, deciphering them as Russian imperia l tactics. Ukraine's determination to preserve its independ ence was encouraged by external support. Although i nitially the West, especially the United States, had been ta rdy in recognizing the geopolitical importance of a separate Ukrainian state, by the mid-1990s both America and Germany had become strong backers of Kiev's separat e identity. In July 1996, the U.S. secretary of defen se declared, \"I cannot overestimate the importance of Ukraine as an independent country to the security and stabi lity of all of Europe,\" while in September, the Ger man chancellor—notwithstanding his strong support for P resident Yeltsin—went even further in declaring tha t \"Ukraine's firm place in Europe can no longer be ch allenged by anyone ... No one will be able any more to dispute Ukraine's independence and territorial inte grity.\" American policy makers also came to describ e the American-Ukrainian relationship as \"a strategic par tnership,\" deliberately invoking the same phrase us ed to describe the American-Russian relationship. Without Ukraine, as already noted, an imperial r estoration based either on the CIS or on Eurasianis m was not a viable option. An empire without Ukraine would ev entually mean a Russia that would become more \"Asianized\" and more remote from Europe. Moreover, Eurasianism was also not especially appealing to th e newly independent Central Asians, few of whom were eager for a new union with Moscow. Uzbekistan becam e particularly assertive in supporting Ukraine's obje ctions to any elevation of the CIS into a supranati onal entity and in opposing the Russian initiatives designed to enhance the CIS. Other CIS states, also wary of Moscow's intentio ns, tended to cluster around Ukraine and Uzbekistan in opposing or evading Moscow's pressures for closer p olitical and military integration. Moreover, a sens e of national consciousness was deepening in almost all of the new states, a consciousness increasingly foc used on icpiidi.ilini! past submission to Moscow as colonia lism and on eradicating its various legacies. Thus, even the ethnically vulnerable Kazakstan joined the other Ce ntral Asian states in abandoning the Cyrillic alpha bet and replacing it with the Latin script as adapted earli er by Turkey. In effect, by the mid-1990s a bloc, q uietly led by"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Ukraine and comprising Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Az erbaijan, and sometimes also Kazakstan, Georgia, an d Moldova, had informally emerged to obstruct Russian efforts to use the CIS as the tool for political i ntegration. Ukrainian insistence on only limited and largel y economic integration had the further effect of de priving the notion of a \"Slavic Union\" of any practical meaning . Propagated by some Slavophiles and given prominen ce by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's support, this idea automat ically became geopolitically meaningless once it wa s repudiated by Ukraine. It left Belarus alone with R ussia; and it also implied a possible partition of Kazakstan, with its Russian-populated northern regions potenti ally part of such a union. Such an option was under standably not reassuring to the new rulers of Kazakstan and m erely intensified the anti-Russian thrust of their nationalism. In Belarus, a Slavic Union without Ukraine meant no thing less than incorporation into Russia, thereby also igniting more volatile feelings of nationalist rese ntment. These external obstacles to a \"near abroad\" pol icy were powerfully reinforced by an important inte rnal restraint: the mood of the Russian people. Despite the rhetoric and the political agitation among the political elite regarding Russia's special mission in the spa ce of the former empire, the Russian people—partial ly out of sheer fatigue but also out of pure common sense—sho wed little enthusiasm for any ambitious program of imperial restoration. They favored open borders, op en trade, freedom of movement, and special status f or the Russian language, but political integration, especi ally if it was to involve economic costs or require bloodshed, evoked little enthusiasm. The disintegration of the \"union\" was regretted, its restoration favored; bu t public reaction to the war in Chechnya indicated that any policy that went beyond the application of economic leverage and/or political pressure would lack popul ar support. In brief, the ultimate geopolitical inadequacy of the \"near abroad\" priority was that Russia was n ot strong enough politically to impose its will and not attra ctive enough economically to be able to seduce the new states. Russian pressure merely made them seek more externa l ties, first and foremost with the West but in som e cases also with China and the key Islamic countries to th e south. When Russia threatened to form its own mil itary bloc in response to NATO's expansion, it begged the question \"With whom?\" And it begged the even more painful answer: at the most, maybe with Belarus and Tajikistan. The new states, if anything, were increasingly inclined to distrust even perfectly legitimate and needed forms of economic integration with Russia, fearing their potential political consequences. At the same time, the notions of Russia's alleged Eurasian mission and of the Slavic mystique served only to isolate Russia further from Europe and, more generally, from the West, the reby perpetuating the post-Soviet crisis and delayi ng the needed modernization and westernization of Russian society along the lines of what Kemal Ataturk did i n Turkey in the wake of the Ottoman Empire's collapse . The \"near abroad\" option thus offered Russia not a geopolitical solution but a geopolitical illusion. If not a condominium with America and if not the \"n ear abroad,\" then what other geostrategic option wa s open to Russia? The failure of the Western orientation t o produce the desired global co-equality with Ameri ca for a \"democratic Russia,\" which was more a slogan than r eality, caused a letdown among the democrats, where as the reluctant recognition that \"reintegration\" of t he old empire was at best a remote possibility temp ted some Russian geopoliticians to toy with the idea of some sort of counteralliance aimed at America's hegemon ic position in Eurasia. In early 1996, President Yeltsin replaced his W estern-oriented foreign minister, Kozyrev, with the more experienced but also orthodox former Communist inte rnational specialist Evgenniy Primakov, whose long- standing interest has been Iran and China. Some Rus sian commentators speculated that Primakov's orient ation might precipitate an effort to forge a new \"antiheg emonic\" coalition, formed around the three powers w ith the greatest geopolitical stake in reducing America's p rimacy in Eurasia. Some of Primakov's initial trave l and comments reinforced that impression. Moreover, the existing Sino-Iranian connection in weapons li.ulc as well as the Russian inclination to cooperate in Iran's e fforts to increase its access to nuclear energy see med to provide a perfect fit for closer political dialogue and eventual alliance. The result could, at least theoretically, bring together the world's leading Slavic power, th e world's most militant Islamic power, and the worl d's most populated and powerful Asian power, thereby creatin g a potent coalition."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" The necessary point of departure for any such c ounteralliance option involved a renewal of the bil ateral Sino- Russian connection, capitalizing on the resentment among the political elites of both states over the emergence of America as the only global superpower. In early 1996, Yeltsin traveled to Beijing and signed a decl aration that explicitly denounced global \"hegemonic\" tenden cies, thereby implying that the two states would al ign themselves against the United States. In December, the Chinese prime minister, Li Peng, returned the v isit, and both sides not only reiterated their opposition to an international system \"dominated by one power\" bu t also endorsed the reinforcement of existing alliances. R ussian commentators welcomed this development, view ing it as a positive shift in the global correlation of po wer and as an appropriate response to America's spo nsorship of NATO's expansion. Some even sounded gleeful that th e Sino-Russian alliance would give America its dese rved comeuppance. However, a coalition allying Russia with both C hina and Iran can develop only if the United States is shortsighted enough to antagonize China and Iran si multaneously. To be sure, that eventuality cannot b e excluded, and American conduct in 1995-1996 almost seemed consistent with the notion that the United S tates was seeking an antagonistic relationship with both Teheran and Beijing. However, neither Iran nor Chin a was prepared to cast its lot strategically with a Russi a that was both unstable and weak. Both realized th at any such coalition, once it went beyond some occasional tact ical orchestration, would risk their respective acc ess to the more advanced world, with its exclusive capacity fo r investment and with its needed cutting-edge techn ology. Russia had too little to offer to make it a truly w orthy partner in an anti-hegemonic coalition. In fact, lacking any shared ideology and united merely by an \"antihegemonic\" emotion, any such coa lition would be essentially an alliance of a part of the T hird World against the most advanced portions of th e First World. None of its members would gain much, and Chi na especially would risk losing its enormous invest ment inflows. For Russia, too, \"the phantom of a Russia- China alliance ... would sharply increase the chanc es that Russia would once again become restricted from West ern technology and capital,\" as a critical Russian geopolitician noted.8 The alignment would eventuall y condemn all of its participants, whether two or t hree in number, to prolonged isolation and shared backwardn ess. 8. \"Aleksei Bogaturov. \"Current Relations and Pros pects for Interaction Between Russia and the United States,\" Nezavisimaya Gazeta, June 28, 1996. Moreover, China would be the senior partner in any serious Russian effort to jell such an \"antiheg emonic\" coalition. Being more populous, more industrious, m ore innovative, more dynamic, and harboring some potential territorial designs on Russia, China woul d inevitably consign Russia to the status of a juni or partner, while at the same time lacking the means (and proba bly any real desire) to help Russia overcome its backwardness. Russia would thus become a buffer bet ween an expanding Europe and an expansionist China. Finally, some Russian foreign affairs experts c ontinued to entertain the hope that a stalemate in European integration, including perhaps internal Western dis agreements over the future shape of NATO, might eve ntually create at least tactical opportunities for a Russo- German or a Russo-French flirtation, in either case to the detriment of Europe's transatlantic connection with America. This perspective was hardly new, for thro ughout the Cold War, Moscow periodically tried to play eit her the German or the French card. Nonetheless, it was not unreasonable for some of Moscow's geopoliticians to calculate that a stalemate in European affairs cou ld create tactical openings that might be exploited to Americ a's disadvantage. But that is about all that could thereby be att ained: purely tactical options. Neither France nor Germany is likely to forsake the American connection. An occas ional flirtation, especially with the French, focus ed on some narrow issue, cannot be excluded—but a geopoli tical reversal of alliances would have to be preced ed by a massive upheaval in European affairs, a breakdown i n European unification and in transatlantic ties. A nd even then, it is unlikely that the European states would be inclined lo pursue a truly comprehensive geopol itical alignment with a disoriented Russia. Thus, none of the counteralliance options, in t he final analysis, offer a viable alternative. The solution to Russia's new geopolitical dilemmas will not be foun d in counteralliance, nor will it come about throug h the illusion of a coequal strategic partnership with Am erica or in the effort to create some new political ly and"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"economically \"integrated\" structure in the space of the former Soviet Union. All evade the only choice that is in fact open to Russia. THE DILEMMA OF THE ONE ALTERNATIVE Russia's only real geostrategic option—the option t hat could give Russia a realistic international rol e and also maximize the opportunity of transforming and social ly modernizing itself—is Europe. And not just any E urope, but the transatlantic Europe of the enlarging EU an d NATO. Such a Europe is taking shape, as we have s een in chapter 3, and it is also likely to remain linked c losely to America. That is the Europe to which Russ ia will have to relate, if it is to avoid dangerous geopolitical isolation. For America, Russia is much too weak to be a pa rtner but still too strong to be simply its patient . It is more likely to become a problem, unless America fosters a setting that helps to convince the Russians that the best choice for their country is an increasingly organic connection with a transatlantic Europe. Although a long-term Russo-Chinese and Russo-Iranian strategic alliance is not likely, it is obviously important for Americ a to avoid policies that could distract Russia from making the needed geopolitical choice. To the extent possible , American relations with China and Iran should, ther efore, be formulated with their impact on Russian geopolitical calculations also kept in mind. Perpet uating illusions regarding grand geostrategic optio ns can only delay the historic choice that Russia must make in order to bring to an end its deep malaise. Only a Russia that is willing to accept the new realities of Europe, both economic and geopolitica l, will be able to benefit internally from the enlarging scope of transcontinental European cooperation in commer ce, communications, investment, and education. Russia's participation in the Council of Europe is thus a s tep very much in the right direction. It is a foretaste of f urther institutional links between the new Russia a nd the growing Europe. It also implies that if Russia purs ues this path, it will have no choice other than ev entually to emulate the course chosen by post-Ottoman Turkey, w hen it decided to shed its imperial ambitions and embarked very deliberately on the road of moderniza tion, Europeanization, and democratization. No other option can offer Russia the benefits t hat a modern, rich, and democratic Europe linked to America can. Europe and America are not a threat to a Russi a that is a nonexpansive national and democratic st ate. They have no territorial designs on Russia, which China someday might have, nor do they share an insecure a nd potentially violent frontier, which is certainly th e case with Russia's ethnically and territorially u nclear border with the Muslim nations to the south. On the contra ry, for Europe as well as for America, a national a nd democratic Russia is a geopolitically desirable ent ity, a source of stability in the volatile Eurasian complex. Russia consequently faces the dilemma that the choice in favor of Europe and America, in order for it to yield tangible benefits, requires, first of all, a clear-cut abjuration of the imperial past and, seco nd, no tergiversation regarding the enlarging Europe's pol itical and security links with America. The first r equirement means accommodation to the geopolitical pluralism t hat has come to prevail in the space of the former Soviet Union. Such accommodation does not exclude economic cooperation, rather on the model of the old Europe an Free Trade Area, but it cannot include limits on th e political sovereignty of the new states—for the s imple reason that they do not wish it. Most important in that respect is the need for clear and unambiguous acceptance by Russia of Ukraine's separate existence, of its b orders, and of its distinctive national identity. The second requirement may be even more difficu lt to swallow. A truly cooperative relationship wit h the transatlantic community cannot be based on the noti on that those democratic states of Europe that wish to be part of it can be excluded because of a Russian say -so. The expansion of that community need not be ru shed, and it certainly should not be promoted on an anti- Russian theme. But neither can it, nor should it, b e halted by a political fiat that it-srll relied s an antiquate d notion of European security relations. An expandi ng and democratic Europe has to be an open-ended historica l process, not subject to politically arbitrary geo graphic limits. For many Russians, the dilemma of the one alter native may at first, and for some time to come, be too difficult to resolve. It will require an enormous a ct of political will and perhaps also an outstandin g leader, capable of making the choice and articulating the v ision of a democratic, national, truly modern and E uropean Russia. That may not happen for some time.

No Russian Ataturk is now in sight. Non etheless, Russians will eventually have to come to recognize that Russia's national redefinition is not an act o f capitulation but one of liberation.9 They will have to accept that what Yeltsin said in Kiev in 1990 a bout a nonimperial future for Russia was absolutely on the mark. And a genuinely nonimperial Russia will stil l be a great power, spanning Eurasia, the world's largest territorial unit by far. In any case, a redefinition of \"What is Russia and where is Russia\" will probably occur only by st ages, and it will require a wise and firm Western posture. Ameri ca and Europe will have to help. They should offer Russia not only a special treaty or charter with NATO, but they should also begin the process of exploring wi th Russia the shaping of an eventual transcontinental system of security and cooperation that goes considerably beyond the loose structure of the Organization for Securit y and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). And if Russia consolidates its internal democratic institutions a nd makes tangible progress in free-market-based eco nomic development, its ever-closer association with NATO and the EU should not be ruled out. 9. In early 1996, General Aleksandr Lebed published a remarkable article (\"The Fading of Empire or the Rebirth of Russia,\" Segodnya, April 26, 1996) that went a long way toward making that case. At the same time, it is equally important for t he West, especially for America, to pursue policies that perpetuate the dilemma of the one alternative for R ussia. The political and economic stabilization of the new post-Soviet states is a major factor in necessitati ng Russia's historical self-redefinition. Hence, su pport for the new post-Soviet states—for geopolitical pluralism i n the space of the former Soviet empire—has to be a n integral part of a policy designed to induce Russia to exercise unambiguously its European option. Amo ng these states, three are geopolitically especially i mportant: Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, and Ukraine. An independent Azerbaijan can serve as a corrido r for Western access to the energy-rich Caspian Sea basin and Central Asia. Conversely, a subdued Azerbaijan would mean that Central Asia can be sealed off from the outside world and thus rendered politically vulnera ble to Russian pressures for reintegration. Uzbekis tan, nationally the most vital and the most populous of the Central Asian states, represents a major obstac le to any renewed Russian control over the region. Its indepe ndence is critical to the survival of the other Cen tral Asian states, and it is the least vulnerable to Russian p ressures. Most important, however, is Ukraine. As the EU a nd NATO expand, Ukraine will eventually be in the position to choose whether it wishes to be part of either organization. It is likely that, in order to reinforce its separate status, Ukraine will wish to join both, on ce they border upon it and once its own internal transformation begins to qualify it for membership. Although that will take time, it is not too early for the West—while further enhancing its economic and secur ity ties with Kiev—to begin pointing to the decade 2005- 2015 as a reasonable time frame for the initiation of Ukraine's progressive inclusion, thereby reducin g the risk that the Ukrainians may fear that Europe's expansio n will halt on the Polish-Ukrainian border. Russia, despite its protestations, is likely to acquiesce in the expansion of NATO in 1999 to inclu de several Central European countries, because the cultural an d social gap between Russia and Central Europe has widened so much since the fall of communism. By con trast, Russia will find it incomparably harder to acquiesce in Ukraine's accession to NATO, for to do so would be to acknowledge that Ukraine's destiny is no longer organically linked to Russia's. Yet if Ukrai ne is to survive as an independent state, it will h ave to become part of Central Europe rather than Eurasia, and if it is to be part of Central Europe, then it will ha ve to partake fully of Central Europe's links to NATO and the Eur opean Union. Russia's acceptance of these links wou ld then define Russia's own decision to be also truly a par t of Europe. Russia's refusal would be tantamount t o the rejection of Europe in favor of a solitary \"Eurasia n\" identity and existence. The key point to bear in mind is that Russia ca nnot be in Europe without Ukraine also being in Eur ope, whereas Ukraine can be in Europe without Russia bei ng in Europe. Assuming that Russia decides to cast its lot with Europe, it follows that ultimately it is in Ru ssia's own interest that Ukraine be included in the expanding European structures. Indeed, Ukraine's relationship to Europe could be the turning point for Russia it self. But that also means that the defining moment for Russia 's relationship to Europe is still some time off—\"d efining\" in the sense that Ukraine's choice in favor of Euro pe will bring to a head Russia's decision regarding the next"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"phase of its history: either to be a part of Europe as well or to become a Eurasian outcast, neither t ruly of Europe nor Asia and mired in its \"near abroad\" conf licts.

In that man ner, in the course of the first two decades of the next century , Russia could increasingly become an integral part of a Europe that embraces not only Ukraine but reaches t o the Urals and even beyond.

The Eurasian Balkans IN EUROPE, THE WORD \"BALKANS\" conjures up images of ethnic conflicts and great-power regional rivalries. Eurasia, too, has its \"Balkans,\" but the Eurasian Balkans are much larger, more populated, even more religiously and ethnically heterogeneous. They are located within that large geographic oblong that de marcates the central zone of global instability identified i n chapter 2 and that embraces portions of southeast ern Europe, Central Asia and parts of South Asia, the Persian G ulf area, and the Middle East. The Eurasian Balkans form the inner core of that large oblong (see map on page 124), and they differ from its outer zone in one particularly significant way: they are a power vacuum. Although most of the states located in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East are also unstable, American power is that region's ultimate arbiter. The unstable region in the outer zone is thus an area of single power hegemony and is tempered by that hegemony. In contrast, the Eurasian Balkans are truly reminiscent of the older, more familiar Balkans of southeastern Europe: not only are its political entities unstable but they tempt and invite the intrusion of more powerful neighbors, each of whom is determined to oppose the region's domination by another. It is this familiar combination of a power vacuum and power suction that justifies the appellation \"Eurasian Balkans.\" The traditional Balkans represented a potential geopolitical prize in the struggle for European su premacy. The Eurasian Balkans, astride the inevitably emergi ng transportation network meant to link more direct ly Eurasia's richest and most industrious western and eastern extremities, are also geopolitically signif icant. Moreover, they are of importance from the standpoin t of security and historical ambitions to at least three of their most immediate and more powerful neighbors, n amely, Russia, Turkey, and Iran, with China also signaling an increasing political interest in the r egion. But the Eurasian Balkans are infinitely more important as a potential economic prize: an enormous concentrati on of natural gas and oil reserves is located in th e region, in addition to important minerals, including gold. The world's energy consumption is bound to vastl y increase over the next two or three decades. Esti mates by the U.S. Department of Energy anticipate that world demand will rise by more than 50 percent between 1 993 and 2015, with the most significant increase in con sumption occurring in the Far East. The momentum of Asia's economic development is already generating massive pressures for the exploration and exploitation of n ew sources of energy, and the Central Asian region and the Caspian Sea basin are known to contain reserve s of natural gas and oil that dwarf those of Kuwait, the Gulf of Mexico, or the North Sea. Access to that resource and sharing in its poten tial wealth represent objectives that stir national ambitions, motivate corporate interests, rekindle historical c laims, revive imperial aspirations, and fuel intern ational rivalries. The situation is made all the more volat ile by the fact that the region is not only a power vacuum but is also internally unstable. Every one of its count ries suffers from serious internal difficulties, al l of them have frontiers that are either the object of claims by n eighbors or are zones of ethnic resentment, few are nationally homogeneous, and some are already embroiled in terr itorial, ethnic, or religious violence. "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"THE ETHNIC CAULDRON The Eurasian Balkans include nine countries that on e way or another fit the foregoing description, wit h two others as potential candidates. The nine are Kazaks tan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenist an, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia—all of them former ly part of the defunct Soviet Union—as well as Afghanistan. The potential additions to the list ar e Turkey and Iran, both of them much more political ly and economically viable, both active contestants for re gional influence within the Eurasian Balkans, and t hus both significant geostrategic players in the region. At the same time, both are potentially vulnerable to i nternal ethnic conflicts. If either or both of them were to be des tabilized, the internal problems of the region woul d become unmanageable, while efforts to restrain regional do mination by Russia could even become futile. The three slates of the Caucasus—Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan—can be said to be based on truly his toric nations. As a result, their nationalisms tend to be both pervasive and intense, and external conflicts have tended to be the key challenge to their well-being.

In either type of state, thes e vulnerabilities have tempted exploitation by thei r more powerful and imperially minded neighbors. The Eurasian Balkans are an ethnic mosaic (see preceding table and map). The frontiers of its stat es were drawn arbitrarily by Soviet cartographers in the 19 20s and 1930s, when the respective Soviet republics were formally established. (Afghanistan, never having be en part of the Soviet Union, is the exception.) The ir borders were carved out largely on the ethnic principle, bu t they also reflected the Kremlin's interest in kee ping the southern region of the Russian Empire internally di vided and thus more subservient. "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" Accordingly, Moscow rejected proposals by Centr al Asian nationalists to meld the various Central A sian peoples (most of whom were not yet nationalisticall y motivated) into a single political unit—to be cal led \"Turkestan\"—preferring instead to create five separ ate \"republics,\" each with a distinctive new name a nd jigsaw borders. Presumably out of a similar calcula tion, the Kremlin abandoned plans for a single Cauc asian federation. Therefore, it is not surprising that, u pon the collapse of the Soviet Union, neither the t hree states of the Caucasus nor the five states of Central Asia we re fully prepared for their newly independent statu s nor for the needed regional cooperation. In the Caucasus, Armenia's less than 4 million people and Azerbaijan's more than 8 million promptl y became embroiled in open warfare over the status of Nagorn o-Karabakh, a largely Armenian-populated enclave wi thin Azerbaijan. The conflict generated large-scale ethn ic cleansings, with hundreds of thousands of refuge es and expellees fleeing in both directions. Given the fac t that Armenia is Christian and Azerbaijan Muslim, the war has some overtones of a religious conflict. The eco nomically devastating war made it much more difficu lt for either country to establish itself as stably indepe ndent. Armenia was driven to rely more on Russia, w hich had provided significant military help, while Azerhaija n's new independence and internal stability were compromised by the loss of Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan's vulnerability has wider regional im plications because the country's location makes it a geopolitical pivot. It can be described as the vita lly important \"cork\" controlling access to the \"bot tle\" that contains the riches of the Caspian Sea basin and Ce ntral Asia. An independent, Turkic-speaking Azerbai jan, with pipelines running from it to the ethnically re lated and politically supportive Turkey, would prev ent Russia from exercising a monopoly on access to the region and would thus also deprive Russia of decisive poli tical leverage over the policies of the new Central Asian states. Yet Azerbaijan is very vulnerable to press ures from powerful Russia to the north and from Iran to the s outh. There are twice as many Azeris—some estimate as many as 20 million—living in northwestern Iran as i n Azerbaijan proper. That reality makes Iran fearfu l of potential separatism among its Azeris and hence qui te ambivalent regarding Azerbaijan's sovereign stat us, despite the two nations' shared Muslim faith. As a result, Azerbaijan has become the object of combine d Russian and Iranian pressures to restrict its deali ngs with the West. Unlike either Armenia or Azerbaijan, both of wh ich are ethnically quite homogeneous, about 30 perc ent of Georgia's 6 million people are minorities. Moreover , these small communities, rather tribal in organiz ation and identity, have intensely resented Georgian dominati on.

In Central Asia, internal factors have been more significant in promoting instability. Culturally a nd linguistically, four of the five newly independent Central Asian states are part of the Turkic world. Tajikistan is linguistically and culturally Persian, while Afghan istan (outside of the former Soviet Union) is a Pat han, Tajik, Pashttm, and Persian ethnic mosaic. All six countri es are Muslim. Most of llicin, over the years, were under the passing influence of the Persian, Turkish, and Russ ian empires, but that experience has not served to foster a spirit of a shared regional interest among them. On the contrary, their diverse ethnic composition mak es them vulnerable to internal and external conflicts, whic h cumulatively tempt intrusion by more powerful nei ghbors. Of the five newly independent Central Asian sta tes, Kazakstan and Uzbekistan are the most importan t. Regionally, Kazakstan is the shield and Uzbekistan is the soul for the region's diverse national awake nings. Kazakstan's geographic size and location shelter th e others from direct Russian physical pressure, sin ce Kazakstan alone borders on Russia. However, its pop ulation of about 18 million is approximately 35 per cent Russian (the Russian population throughout the area is steadily declining), with another 20 percent al so non- Kazak, a fact that has made it much more difficult for the new Kazak rulers—themselves increasingly nationalistic but representing only about one-half of the country's total population—to pursue the goa l of nation building on the basis of ethnicity and language. The Russians residing in the new state are natu rally resentful of the new Kazak leadership, and be ing the formerly ruling colonial class and thus also better educated and situated, they are fearful of the los s of privilege. Furthermore, they tend to view the new Kazak nation alism with barely concealed cultural disdain. With both the northwestern and northeastern regions of Kazaks tan heavily dominated by Russian colonists, Kazakst an would face the danger of territorial secession if K azak-Russian relations were to deteriorate seriousl y. At the same time, several hundred thousand Kazaks reside o n the Russian side of the state borders and in nort heastern Uzbekistan, the state that the Kazaks view as their principal rival for Central Asian leadership. Uzbekistan is, in fact, the prime candidate for regional leadership in Central Asia. Although smal ler in size and less endowed with natural resources than Kazaks tan, it has a larger population (nearly 25 million) and, much more important, a considerably more homogeneou s population than Kazakstan's. Given higher indigenous birthrates and the gradual exodus of the formerly dominant Russians, soon about 75 percent of its people will be Uzbek, with only an insignificant Ru ssian minority remaining largely in Tashkent, the c apital. Moreover, the country's political elite delibera tely identifies the new state as the direct descend ant of the vast medieval empire of Tamerlane (1336-1404), whose cap ital, Samarkand, became the region's renowned cente r for the study of religion, astronomy, and the arts. This lineage imbues modern Uzbekistan with a deepe r sense of historical continuity and regional mission than its neighbors. Indeed, some Uzbek leaders see Uzbek istan as the national core of a single Central Asian entity, presumably with Tashkent as its capital. More than in any of the other Central Asian states, Uzbekistan's politi cal elite and increasingly also its people, already partake of the subjective makings of a modern nation-state and are determined—domestic difficulties notwithstanding—n ever to revert to colonial status. That condition makes Uzbekistan both the leader in fostering a sense of post-ethnic modern national ism and an object of some uneasiness among its neighbors. E ven as the Uzbek leaders set the pace in nation bui lding and in the advocacy of greater regional self-suffic iency, the country's relatively greater national ho mogeneity and more intense national consciousness inspire fea r among the rulers of Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Taj ikistan, and even Kazakstan that Uzbek regional leadership c ould evolve into Uzbek regional domination. That co ncern inhibits regional cooperation among the newly sover eign states—which is not encouraged by the Russians in any case—and perpetuates regional vulnerability. However, like the others, Uzbekistan is not ent irely free of ethnic tensions. Parts of southern Uz bekistan, particularly around the historically and culturally important centers of Samarkand and Bukhara, have s ignificant Tajik populations, which remain resentful of the fr ontiers drawn by Moscow.

Although rich in minerals and endowed with a natural beauty that has led some to describe the co untry as the Switzerland of Central Asia (and thus potentially as a new tourist frontier), Kyrgyzstan's geopolitic al location, squeezed between China and Kazakstan, makes it highly dependent on the degree to which Kazakstan i tself succeeds in maintaining its independence. Tajikistan is only somewhat more ethnically hom ogeneous. Of its 6.5 million people, fewer than two -thirds are Tajik and more than 25 percent are Uzbek (who a re viewed with some hostility by the Tajiks), while the remaining Russians account for only about 3 percent . However, as elsewhere, even the dominant ethnic community is sharply—even violently—divided along t ribal lines, with modern nationalism confined large ly to the urban political elite. As a result, independenc e has produced not only civil strife but a convenie nt excuse for Russia to continue deploying its army in the countr y. The ethnic situation is even further complicated by the large presence of Tajiks across the border, in nort heastern Afghanistan. In fact, almost as many ethni c Tajiks live in Afghanistan as in Tajikistan, another facto r that serves to undermine regional stability. Afghanistan's current state of disarray is like wise a Soviet legacy, even though the country is no t a former Soviet republic. Fragmented by the Soviet occupatio n and the prolonged guerrilla warfare conducted aga inst it, Afghanistan is a nation-state in name only. Its 22 million people have become sharply divided along et hnic lines, with growing divisions among the country's P ashtuns, Tajiks, and Hazaras. At the same time, the jihad against the Russian occupiers has made religion the dominant dimension of the country's political lift -, infusing dogmatic fervor into already sharp political differ ences. Afghanistan thus has to be seen not only as a part of the Central Asian ethnic conundrum but also as politica lly very much part of the Eurasian Balkans. Although all of the formerly Soviet Central Asia n states, as well as Azerbaijan, are populated pred ominantly by Muslims, their political elites—still largely th e products of the Soviet era—are almost uniformly nonreligious in outlook and the states are formally secular. However, as their populations shift from a primarily traditional clannish or tribal identity to a more m odern national awareness, they are likely to become imbued with an intensifying Islamic consciousness. In fact , an Islamic revival—already abetted from the outsi de not only by Iran but also by Saudi Arabia—is likely to become the mobilizing impulse for the increasingly pervasive new nationalisms, determined to oppose an y reintegration under Russian—and hence infidel— control. Indeed, the process of Islamization is likely to prove contagious also to the Muslims who have rema ined within Russia proper. They number about 20 million— more than twice the number of disaffected Russians (circa 9.5 million) who continue to live under fore ign rule in the independent Central Asian states. T he Russian Muslims thus account for about 13 percent of Russia 's population, and it is almost inevitable that the y will become more assertive in claiming their rights to a distinctive religious and political identity. Even if that claim does not take the form of a quest for outright inde pendence, as it has in Chechnya, it will overlap wi th the dilemmas that Russia, given its recent imperial inv olvement and the Russian minorities in the new stat es, will continue to face in Central Asia. Gravely increasing the instability of the Euras ian Balkans and making the situation potentially mu ch more explosive is the fact that two of the adjoining maj or nation-states, each with a historically imperial , cultural, religious, and economic interest in the region—name ly, Turkey and Iran—are themselves volatile in thei r"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"geopolitical orientation and are internally potenti ally vulnerable. Were these two states to become de stabilized, it is quite likely that the entire region would be plunged into massive disorder, with the ongoing eth nic and territorial conflicts spinning out of control and t he region's already delicate balance of power sever ely disrupted. Accordingly, Turkey and Iran are not onl y important geostrategic players but are also geopo litical pivots, whose own internal condition is of critical importance to the fate of the region. Both are mid dle-sized powers, with strong regional aspirations and a sens e of their historical significance. Yet the future geopolitical orientation and even the national cohesion of both states remains uncertain. Turkey, a postimperial state still in the proce ss of redefining its identity, is pulled in three d irections: the modernists would like to see it become a European s tate and thus look to the west; the Islamists lean in the direction of the Middle East and a Muslim community and thus look to the south; and the historically m inded nationalists see in the Turkic peoples of the Caspi an Sea basin and Central Asia a new mission for a r egionally dominant Turkey and thus look eastward. Each of the se perspectives posits a different strategic axis, and the clash between them introduces for the first time si nce the Kemalist revolution a measure of uncertaint y regarding Turkey's regional role. Moreover, Turkey itself could become at least a partial victim of the region's ethnic conflicts. A lthough its population of about 65 million is predominantly Tur kish, with about 80 percent Turkic stock (though in cluding a variety of Circassians, Albanians, Bosnians, Bulg arians, and Arabs), as much as 20 percent or perhap s even more are Kurdish. Concentrated in the country's eas tern regions, the Turkish Kurds have increasingly b een drawn into the struggle for national independence w aged by the Iraqi and Iranian Kurds. Any internal t ensions within Turkey regarding the country's overall direc tion would doubtless encourage the Kurds to press e ven more violently for a separate national status. Iran's future orientation is even more problema tic. The fundamentalist Shiite revolution that triu mphed in the late 1970s may be entering its \"Thermidorian\" phase , and that heightens the uncertainty regarding Iran 's geostrategic role. On the one hand, the collapse of the atheistic Soviet Union opened up Iran's newly independent northern neighbors to religious prosely tizing but, on the other, Iran's hostility to the U nited States has inclined Teheran to adopt at least a tactically pro-Moscow orientation, reinforced by Iran's conce rns regarding the impact on its own cohesion of Azerbai jan's new independence. That concern is derived from Iran's vulnerabilit y to ethnic tensions. Of the country's 65 million p eople (almost identical in number to Turkey's), only somewhat mor e than one-half are Persians. Roughly one-fourth ar e Azeri, and the remainder include Kurds, Baluchis, T urkmens, Arabs, and other tribes. Outside of the Ku rds and the Azeris, the others at present do not have the c apacity to threaten Iran's national integrity, espe cially given the high degree of national, even imperial, conscio usness among the Persians. But that could change qu ite quickly, particularly in the event of a new politic al crisis in Iranian politics. Furthermore, the very fact that several newly i ndependent \"stans\" now exist in the area and that e ven the 1 million Chechens have been able to assert their pol itical aspirations is bound to have an infectious e ffect on the Kurds as well as on all the other ethnic minorities in Iran. If Azerbaijan succeeds in stable politica l and economic development, the Iranian Azeris will proba bly become increasingly committed to the idea of a greater Azerbaijan. Thus, political instability and divisio ns in Teheran could expand into a challenge to the cohesion of the Iranian state, thereby dramatically extending t he scope and increasing the stakes of what is invol ved in the Eurasian Balkans. THE MULTIPLE CONTEST The traditional Balkans of Europe involved head-on competition among three imperial rivals: the Ottoma n Empire, the Austro-Hun-garian Empire, and the Russi an Empire. There were also three indirect participa nts who were concerned that their European interests wo uld be adversely affected by the victory of a parti cular protagonist: Germany feared Russian power, France o pposed Austria-Hungary, and Great Britain preferred to see a weakening Ottoman Empire in control of the Da rdanelles than the emergence of any one of the othe r major contestants in control of the Balkans. In the course of the nineteenth century, these powers man aged to contain Balkan conflicts without prejudice to anyon e's vital interests, but they failed to do so in 19 14, with disastrous consequences for all."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" Today's competition within the Eurasian Balkans also directly involves three neighboring powers: Ru ssia, Turkey, and Iran, though China may eventually becom e a major protagonist as well. Also Involved In Ili e competition, bul more remotely, are Ukraine, Pakist an, India, and the distant America. Each of the thr ee principal and most directly engaged contestants is driven not only by the prospect of future geopoliti cal and economic benefits but also by strong historical imp ulses. Each was at one time or another either the p olitically or the culturally dominant power in the region. Eac h views the others with suspicion. Although head-on warfare among them is unlikely, the cumulative impact of th eir external rivalry could contribute to regional c haos. In the case of the Russians, the attitude of ho stility to the Turks verges on the obsessive. The R ussian media portrays the Turks as bent on control over the regi on, as instigators of local resistance to Russia (w ith some justification in the case of Chechnya), and as thre atening Russia's overall security to a degree that is altogether out of proportion to Turkey's actual capabilities. The Turks reciprocate in kind and view their role a s that of liberators of their brethren from prolonged Russian oppression. The Turks and the Iranians (Persians) have also been historical rivals in the region, and that riva lry has in recent years been revived, with Turkey p rojecting the image of a modern and secular alternative to the Ir anian concept of an Islamic society. Although each of the three can be said to seek at least a sphere of influence, in the case of Russ ia, Moscow's ambitions have a much broader sweep because of the relatively fresh memories of imperial control, the presence in the area of several million Russians, a nd the Kremlin's desire to reinstate Russia as a ma jor global power. Moscow's foreign policy statements have made it plain that it views the entire space of the for mer Soviet Union as a zone of the Kremlin's special geo strategic interest, from which outside political—an d even economic—influence should be excluded. In contrast, although Turkish aspirations for r egional influence retain some vestiges of an imperi al, albeit more dated, past (the Ottoman Empire reached its ap ogee in 1590 with the conquest of the Caucasus and Azerbaijan, though it did not include Central Asia) , they tend to be more rooted in an ethnic-linguist ic sense of identity with the Turkic peoples of the area (see m ap on page 137). Given Turkey's much more limited p olitical and military power, a sphere of exclusive political influence is simply unattainable. Rather, Turkey s ees itself as potential leader of a loose Turkic-speaking communi ty, taking advantage to that end of its appealing r elative modernity, its linguistic affinity, and its economi c means to establish itself as the most influential force in the nation-building processes underway in the area. Iran's aspirations are vaguer still, but in the long run no less threatening to Russia's ambitions. The Persian Empire is a much more distant memory. At its peak, circa 500 B.C., it embraced the current territory of the three Caucasian states—Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan—and Afghanistan, as well as Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel. Although Iran's current geopolitical aspirations are narrower than Turkey's, pointing mainly at Azerbaijan and Afghanistan, the entire Muslim population in the area—even within Russia itself—is the object of Iranian religious interest. Indeed, the revival of Islam in Central Asia has become an organic part of the aspirations of Iran's current rulers. The competitive interests of Russia, Turkey, and Iran are represented on the map on page 1 138: in the case of the geopolitical thrust of Ru ssia, by two arrows pointing directly south at Azerbaijan an d Kazakstan; in Turkey's case, by a single arrow po inting eastward through Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea at Central Asia; and in Iran's case, by two arrows aim ing"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"northward at Azerbaijan and northeast at Turkmenist an, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan. These arrows not o nly crisscross; they can collide. At this stage, China's role is more limited and its goals less evident. It stands to reason that China prefers to face a collection of relatively independent states in the West rather than a Russian Empire. At a minimum, the new states serve as a buffer, but China is also anxious that its own Turkic minorities in Xinjiang Province might see in the newly independent Central Asian states an attractive example for themselves, and for that reason, China has sought assurances from Kazakstan that cross-border minority activism will be suppressed. In the long run, the energy resources of the region are bound to be of special interest lo Beijing, and direct access to them, not subject to Moscow's control, has to be China's central goal. Thus, the overall geopolitical interest of China tends to clash with Russia's quest for a dominant role and is complementary to Turkish and Iranian aspirations. For Ukraine, the central issues are the future char acter of the CIS and freer access to energy sources , which would lessen Ukraine's dependence on Russia. In tha t regard, closer relations with Azerbaijan, Turkmen istan, and Uzbekistan have become important to Kiev, with Ukrainian support for the more independent-minded states being an extension of Ukraine's efforts to e nhance its own independence from Moscow. Accordingl y, Ukraine has supported Georgia's efforts to become t he westward route for Azeri oil exports. Ukraine ha s also collaborated with Turkey in order to weaken Russian influence in the Black Sea and has supported Turki sh efforts to direct oil flows from Central Asia to Tu rkish terminals. The involvement of Pakistan and In dia is more remote still, but neither is indifferent to wh at may be transpiring in these new Eurasian Balkans . For Pakistan, the primary interest is to gain geostrate gic depth through political influence in Afghanista n—and to deny to Iran the exercise of such influence in Afgh anistan and Tajikistan—and to benefit eventually fr om any pipeline construction linking Central Asia with the Arabian Sea. India, in reaction to Pakistan and po ssibly concerned about China's long-range influence in the region, views Iranian influence in Afghanistan and a greater Russian presence in the former Soviet space more favorably. Although distant, the United States, with its st ake in the maintenance of geopolitical pluralism in post-Soviet Eurasia, looms in the background as an increasingly important if indirect player, clearly interested n ot only in developing the region's resources but also in preve nting Russia from exclusively dominating the region 's geopolitical space. In so doing, America is not onl y pursuing its larger Eurasian geostrategic goals b ut is also representing its own growing economic interest, as well as that of Europe and the Far East, in gaining unlimited access to this hitherto closed area. Thus, at stake in this conundrum are geopolitic al power, access to potentially great wealth, the f ulfillment of national and/or religious missions, and security. T he particular focus of the contest, however, is on access. Until the collapse of the Soviet Union, access to the reg ion was nionopoli/ed by Moscow. All rail transport, gas and oil pipelines, and even air travel were channeled t hrough the center. Russian geopoliticians would pre fer it to remain so, since they know that whoever either cont rols or dominates access to the region is the one m ost likely to win the geopolitical and economic prize."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" It is this consideration that has made the pipe line issue so central to the future of the Caspian Sea basin and Central Asia. If the main pipelines to the region c ontinue to pass through Russian territory to the Ru ssian outlet on the Black Sea at Novorossiysk, the political con sequences of this condition will make themselves fe lt, even without any overt Russian power plays. The region w ill remain a political dependency, with Moscow in a strong position to determine how the region's new w ealth is to be shared. Conversely, if another pipel ine crosses the Caspian Sea to Azerbaijan and thence to the Mediterranean through Turkey and if one more g oes to the Arabian Sea through Afghanistan, no single powe r will have monopoly over access. The troubling fact is that some elements in the Russian political elite act as if they prefer that the area's resources not be developed at all if Russia cannot have complete control over access. Let the wealth r emain unexploited if the alternative is that foreign inve stment will lead to more direct presence by foreign economic, and thus also political, interests. That proprietar y attitude is rooted in history, and it will take t ime and outside pressures before it changes. The Tsarist expansion into the Caucasus and Cen tral Asia occurred over a period of about three hun dred years, but its recent end was shockingly abrupt. As the Ottoman Empire declined in vitality, the Russi an Empire pushed southward, along the shores of the Caspian S ea toward Persia. It seized the Astrakhan khanate i n 1556 and reached Persia by 1607. It conquered Crimea dur ing 1774-1784, then took over the kingdom of Georgi a in 1801 and overwhelmed the tribes astride the Caucasi an mountain range (with the Chechens resisting with unique tenacity) during the second half of the 1800 s, completing the takeover of Armenia by 1878. The conquest of Central Asia was less a matter of overcoming a rival empire than of subjugating es sentially isolated and quasi-tribal feudal khanates and emira tes, capable of offering only sporadic and isolated resistance. U/hokislan and Ka/akslan were taken over through a series of military expeditions during the years 180 1-1881, with Turkmenistan crushed and incorporated in campa igns lasting from 1873 to 1886. However, by 1850, t he conquest of most of Central Asia was essentially co mpleted, though periodic outbreaks of local resista nce occurred even during the Soviet era. The collapse of the Soviet Union produced a dram atic historical reversal. In the course of merely a few weeks in December 1991, Russia's Asian space suddenly shr ank by about 20 percent, and the population Russia controlled in Asia was cut from 75 million to about 30 million. In addition, another 18 million reside nts in the Caucasus were also detached from Russia. Making the se reversals even more painful to the Russian polit ical elite was the awareness that the economic potential of these areas was now being targeted by foreign i nterests with the financial means to invest in, develop, and exploit resources that until very recently were ac cessible to Russia alone. Yet Russia faces a dilemma: it is too weak polit ically to seal off the region entirely from the out side and too poor financially to develop the area exclusively on its own. Moreover, sensible Russian leaders realiz e that the demographic explosion underway in the new states me ans that their failure to sustain economic growth w ill eventually create an explosive situation along Russ ia's entire southern frontier. Russia's experience in Afghanistan and Chechnya could be repeated along th e entire borderline that stretches from the Black S ea to Mongolia, especially given the national and Islamic resurgence now underway among the previously subjugated peoples. It follows that Russia must somehow find a way o f accommodating to the new postimperial reality, as it seeks to contain the Turkish and Iranian presence, to pre vent the gravitation of the new states toward its p rincipal rivals, to discourage the formation of any truly in dependent Central Asian regional cooperation, and t o limit American geopolitical influence in the newly sovere ign capitals. The issue thus is no longer that of i mperial restoration— which would be too costly and would be fiercely resisted—but instead involves creating a new web of relations that would constrain the new state s and preserve Russia's dominant geopolitical and e conomic position. The chosen instrument for accomplishing that ta sk has primarily been the CIS, though in some place s the use of the Russian military and the skillful employment of Russian diplomacy to \"divide and rule\" has serv ed the Kremlin's interests just as well. Moscow has used i ts leverage to seek from the new states the maximum degree of compliance to its vision of an increasingly inte grated \"commonwealth\" and has pressed for a central ly"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"directed system of control over the external border s of the CIS; for closer military integration, with in the framework of a common foreign policy; and for the f urther expansion of the existing (originally Soviet ) pipeline network, to the exclusion of any new ones that could skirt Russia. Russian strategic analyses have explicitly stated that Moscow views the area as its own special geopolitical space, even if it is no l onger an integral part of its empire. A clue to Russian geopolitical intentions is pro vided by the insistence with which the Kremlin has sought to retain a Russian military presence on the territori es of the new states. Taking advantage of the Abkha zian secession movement, Moscow obtained basing rights i n Georgia, legitimated its military presence on Arm enian soil by exploiting Armenia's need for support in th e war against Azerbaijan, and applied political and financial pressure to obtain Kazakstan's agreement to Russian bases; in addition, the civil war in Tajikistan ma de possible the continued presence there of the former Soviet army. In defining its policy, Moscow has proceeded on the apparent expectation that its postimperial web of relationships with Central Asia will gradually emas culate the substance of the sovereignty of the indi vidually weak new states and that it will place them in a su bordinate relationship to the command center of the \"integrated\" CIS. To accomplish that goal, Russia i s discouraging the new states from creating their o wn separate armies, from fostering the use of their di stinctive languages (in which they are gradually re placing the Cyrillic alphabet with the Latin), from cultivating close ties with outsiders, and from developing new pipelines directly to outlets in the Arabian or Mediterranean Seas. If the policy succeeds, Russia could then do minate their foreign relations and determine revenue shari ng. In pursuing that goal, Russian spokesmen often i nvoke, as we have seen in chapter 4, the example of the Kuropenn Union. In fact, however, Russia's policy t oward the Central Asian states and the Caucasus is much more reminiscent of the Francophone African communi ty—with the French military contingents and budgeta ry subsidies determining the politics and policies of the French-speaking postcolonial African states. While the restoration of the maximum feasible de gree of Russian political and economic influence in the region is the overall goal and the reinforcement of the CIS is the principal mechanism for achieving i t, Moscow's primary geopolitical targets for political subordination appear to be Azerbaijan and Kazaksta n. For a Russian political counteroffensive to be successful , Moscow must not only cork access to the region bu t must also penetrate its geographic shield. For Russia, Azerbaijan has to be a priority tar get. Its subordination would help to seal off Centr al Asia from the West, especially from Turkey, thereby further i ncreasing Russia's leverage vis-a-vis the recalcitr ant Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. To that end, tactical cooperation with Iran regarding such controversial issues as how to divide the drilling concessions to the Caspi an seabed serves the important objective of compell ing Baku to accommodate itself to Moscow's wishes. A subserv ient Azerbaijan would also facilitate the consolida tion of a dominant Russian position in both Georgia and Arm enia. Kazakstan offers an especially tempting primary target as well, because its ethnic vulnerability m akes it impossible for the Kazak government to prevail in a n open confrontation with Moscow. Moscow can also exploit the Kazak fear of China's growing dynamism, as well as the likelihood of growing Kazak resentm ent over the Sinification of the adjoining Xinjiang Pro vince in China. Kazakstan's gradual subordination w ould have the geopolitical effect of almost automaticall y drawing Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan into Moscow's s phere of control, while exposing both Uzbekistan and Turk menistan to more direct Russian pressure. The Russian strategy, however, runs counter to t he aspirations of almost all of the states located in the Eurasian Balkans. Their new political elites will n ot voluntarily yield the power and privilege they h ave gained through independence. As the local Russians gradual ly vacate their previously privileged positions, th e new elites are rapidly developing a vested interest in sovereignty, a dynamic and socially contagious proc ess. Moreover, the once politically passive populations are also becoming more nationalistic and, outside o f Georgia and Armenia, also more conscious of their Islamic i dentity. Insofar as foreign affairs are concerned, both Georgia and Armenia (despite the latter's dependenc e on Russian support against Azerbaijan) would like to b ecome gradually more associated with Europe. The"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"resource-rich Central Asian states, along with Azer baijan, would like to maximize the economic presenc e on their soil of American, European, Japanese, and lat ely Korean capital, hoping thereby to greatly accel erate their own economic development and consolidate their inde pendence. To this end, they also welcome the increa sing role of Turkey and Iran, seeing in them a counterwe ight to Russian power and a bridge to the large Mus lim world to the south. Azerbaijan—encouraged by both Turkey and Americ a—has thus not only rejected Russian demands for military bases but it also defied Russian demands f or a single pipeline to a Russian Black Sea port, o pting instead for a dual solution involving a second pipe line through Georgia to Turkey. (A pipeline southwa rd through Iran, to be financed by an American company , had to be abandoned because of the U.S. financial embargo on deals with Iran.) In 1995, amid much fan fare, a new rail link between Turkmenistan and Iran was opened, making it feasible for Europe to trade with Central Asia by rail, skirting Russia altogether. There was a touch of symbolic drama to this reopening of the an cient Silk Route, with Russia thus no longer able t o separate Europe from Asia. Uzbekistan has also become increasingly asserti ve in its opposition to Russia's efforts at \"integr ation.\" Its foreign minister declared flatly in August 1996 tha t \"Uzbekistan opposes the creation of CIS supranati onal institutions which can be used as instruments of ce ntralized control.\" Its strongly nationalistic post ure had already prompted sharp denunciations in the Russian press concerning Uzbekistan's emphatically pro-Wes t orientation in the economy, the harsh invective apr opos integration treaties within the CIS, the decis ive refusal to join even the Customs Union, and a methodical an ti-Russian nationality policy (even kindergartens w hich use Russian are being closed down). .. . For the Un ited States, which is pursuing in the Asia region a policy of the weakening of Russia, this position is so attrac tive.1 Even Kazakstan, in reaction to Russian pressure s, has come to favor a secondary non-Russian route for its own outflows. As Umirserik Kasenov, the adviser to the Kazak president, put it: It is a fact that Kazakstan's search for alternativ e pipelines has been fostered by Russia's own actio ns, such as the limitation of shipments of Kazakstan's oil to Novorossiysk and of Tyumen oil to the Pavlodar Refinery. Turkmenistan's efforts to promot e the construction of a gas line to Iran are partly due to the fact that the CIS countries pay only 60 perc ent of the world price or do not pay for it at all. 2 1. Zavtru 28 (June 1996). 2. What Russia Wants in the Transcaucasus and Centr al Asia,\" Nezavisimaya Gazeta, January 24, 1995. Turkmenistan, for much the same reason, has been actively exploring the construction of a new pipel ine through Afghanistan and Pakistan to the Arabian Sea , in addition to the energetic construction of new rail links with Kazakstan and Uzbekistan to the north and with Iran and Afghanistan to the south. Very preliminar y and exploratory talks have also been held among the Kaz aks, the Chinese, and the Japanese regarding an amb itious pipeline project that would stretch from Central As ia to the China Sea (see map on page 146). With lon g-term Western oil and gas investment commitments in Azerb aijan reaching some $13 billion and in Kazakstan go ing well over $20 billion (1996 figures), the economic and political isolation of this area is clearly bre aking down in the face of global economic pressures and limite d Russian financial options."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" Fear of Russia has also had the effect of driving the Central Asian states into greater regional cooperation. The initially dormant Central Asian Economic Union, formed in January 1993, has been gradually activated. Even President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakstan, at first an articulate advocate of a new \"Eurasian Union,\" gradually became a convert to ideas of closer Central Asian cooperation, increased military collaboration among the region's states, support for Azerbaijan's efforts to channel Caspian Sea and Kazak oil through Turkey, and joint opposition to Russian and Iranian efforts to prevent the sectoral division of the Caspian Sea's continental shelf and mineral resources among the coastal states. Given the fact that the governments in the area tend to be highly authoritarian, perhaps e ven more important has been the personal reconcilia tion among the principal leaders. It was common knowledg e that the presidents of Kazakstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan were not particularly fond of one anot her (which they made eminently plain to foreign vis itors), and that personal antagonism initially made it easi er for the Kremlin to play off one against the othe r. By the mid-1990s, the three had come to realize that close r cooperation among them was essential to the prese rvation of their new sovereignty, and they began to engage in highly publicized displays of their allegedly cl ose relations, stressing that henceforth they would coo rdinate their foreign policies. But more important still has been the emergence within the CIS of an informal coalition, led by Ukr aine and Uzbekistan, dedicated to the idea of a \"cooperative ,\" but not \"integrated,\" commonwealth. Toward this end, Ukraine has signed agreements on military cooperati on with Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Georgia; and in September 1996, the foreign ministers of Ukraine an d Uzbekistan even engaged in the highly symbolic ac t of issuing a declaration, demanding that henceforth CI S summits not be chaired by Russia's president but that the chairmanship be rotated. The example set by Ukraine and Uzbekistan has ha d an impact even on the leaders who have been more deferential to Moscow's central concerns. The Kreml in must have been especially disturbed to hear Kaza kstan's Nursultan Nazarbayev and Georgia's Eduard Shevardna dze declare in September 1996 that they would leave the CIS \"if our independence is threatened.\" More g enerally, as a counter to the CIS, the Central Asia n states and Azerbaijan stepped up their level of activity i n the Organization of Economic Cooperation, a still relatively loose association of the region's Islamic states—in cluding Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan—dedicated to the enhancement of financial, economic, and transportat ion links among its members. Moscow has been public ly critical of these initiatives, viewing them, quite correctly, as diluting the pertinent states' member ship in the CIS. In a similar vein, there has been steady enhanc ement of ties with Turkey and, to a lesser extent, Iran. The Turkic-speaking countries have eagerly accepted Tur key's offers of military training for the new natio nal officer corps and the laying down of the Turkish we lcome mat for some ten thousand students. The fourt h summit meeting of the Turkic-speaking countries, he ld in Tashkent in October 1996 and prepared with Tu rkish backing, focused heavily on the enhancement of tran sportation links, on increased trade, and also on c ommon educational standards as well as closer cultural co operation with Turkey. Both Turkey and Iran have be en particularly active in assisting the new states wit h their television programming, thereby directly in fluencing large audiences."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" A ceremony in Alma-Ata, the capital of Kazakstan , in December 199(1 was particularly symbolic of Tu rkey's identification with the independence of the region' s states. On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of Kazakstan's independence, the Turkish president, Su leyman Demirel, stood at the side of President Naza rbayev at the unveiling of a gold-colored column twenty-ei ght meters high, crowned with a legendary Kazak/Tur kic warrior's figure atop a griffinlike creature. At th e event, Kazakstan hailed Turkey for \"standing by K azakstan at every step of its development as an independent sta te,\" and the Turks reciprocated by granting Kazakst an a credit line of $300 million, beyond existing privat e Turkish investment of about $1.2 billion. While neither Turkey nor Iran has the means to exclude Russia from regional influence, Turkey and (more narrowly) Iran have thus been reinforcing the will and the capacity of the new states to resist reinte gration with their northern neighbor and former master. And that certainly helps to keep the region's geopolitical future open. NEITHER DOMINION NOR EXCLUSION The geostrategic implications for America are clear : America is too distant to be dominant in this par t of Eurasia but too powerful not to be engaged. All the states in the area view American engagement as nec essary to their survival. Russia is too weak to regain imp erial domination over the region or to exclude othe rs from it, but it is also too close and too strong to be exclu ded. Turkey and Iran are strong enough to be influe ntial, but their own vulnerabilities could make the area unabl e to cope with both the challenge from the north an d the region's internal conflicts. China is too powerful not to be feared by Russia and the Central Asian st ates, yet its very presence and economic dynamism facilitates Cen tral Asia's quest for wider global outreach. It follows that America's primary interest is t o help ensure that no single power comes to control this geopolitical space and that the global community ha s unhindered financial and economic access to it. Geopolitical pluralism will become an enduring real ity only when a network of pipeline and transportat ion routes links the region directly to the major cente rs of global economic activity via the Mediterranea n and Arabian Seas, as well as overland. Hence, Russian e fforts to monopolize access need to be opposed as i nimical to regional stability. However, the exclusion of Russia from the area is neither desirable nor feasible, nor is the fanni ng of hostility between the area's new states and Russia. In fact, Russia's active economic participation in the region's development is essential to the area's stability—an d having Russia as a partner, but not as an exclusi ve dominator, can also reap significant economic benef its as a result. Greater stability and increased we alth within the region would contribute directly to Russia's we ll-being and give real meaning to the \"commonwealth \" promised by the acronym CIS. But that cooperative o ption will become Russia's policy only when much mo re ambitious, historically anachronistic designs that are painfully reminiscent of the original Balkans a re effectively precluded. The states deserving America's strongest geopoli tical support are Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, and (outs ide this region) Ukraine, all three being geopolitically piv otal. Indeed, Kiev's role reinforces the argument t hat Ukraine is the critical state, insofar as Russia's own futu re evolution is concerned. At the same time, Kazaks tan—given its size, economic potential, and geographically im portant location—is also deserving of prudent inter national backing and especially of sustained economic assist ance. In time, economic growth in Kazakstan might h elp to bridge the ethnic split that makes this Central Asi an \"shield\" so vulnerable to Russian pressure. In this region, America shares a common interest not only with a stable, pro-Western Turkey but als o with Iran and China. A gradual improvement in American-I ranian relations would greatly increase global acce ss to the region and, more specifically, reduce the more immediate threat to Azerbaijan's survival. China's growing economic presence in the region and its political s take in the area's independence are also congruent with America's interests. China's backing of Pakistan's efforts in Afghanistan is also a positive factor, f or closer Pakistani-Afghan relations would make international access to Turkmenistan more feasible, thereby help ing to reinforce both that state and Uzbekistan (in the ev ent that Kazakstan were to falter). Turkey's evolution and orientation are likely to be especially decisive for the future of the Cauca sian states. If Turkey sustains its path to Kurope—and if Europe do es not close its doors to Turkey—the states of the"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Caucasus are also likely to gravitate into the Euro pean orbit, a prospect they fervently desire. But i f Turkey's Europeanization grinds to a halt, for either intern al or external reasons, then Georgia and Armenia wi ll have no choice but to adapt to Russia's inclinations. Their future will then become a function of Russia's own evolving relationship with the expanding Europe, for good or ill. Iran's role is likely to be even more problemat ic. A return to a pro-Western posture would certain ly facilitate the stabilization and consolidation of the region, and it is therefore strategically desirable for Ame rica to encourage such a turn in Iran's conduct. But until that happens, Iran is likely to play a negative rol e, adversely affecting Azerbaijan's prospects, even as it takes positive steps like opening Turkmenistan to the wor ld and, despite Iran's current fundamentalism, reinforcing the Central Asians' sense of their religious herita ge. Ultimately, Central Asia's future is likely to be shaped by an even more complex set of circumstan ces, with the fate of its states determined by the intricate interplay of Russian, Turkish, Iranian, and Chinese interests, as well as by the degree to which the United States co nditions its relations with Russia on Russia's resp ect for the independence of the new states. The reality of that interplay precludes either empire or monopoly as a meaningful goal for any of the geostrategic players involved. Rather, the basic choice is between a de licate regional balance—which would permit the gradual inc lusion of the area in the emerging global economy w hile the states of the region consolidate themselves and probably also acquire a more pronounced Islamic id entity— or ethnic conflict, political fragmentation, and po ssibly even open hostilities along Russia's souther n frontiers. The attainment and consolidation of that regional b alance has to be a major goal in any comprehensive U.S. geostrategy for Eurasia."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Chapter 6. The Far Eastern Anchor AN EFFECTIVE AMERICAN POLICY for Eurasia has to hav e a Far Eastern anchor. That need will not be met if America is ex-cluded or excludes itself from the Asian mainland. A close relationship with mari time Japan is essential for America's global policy, but a cooperative relationship with mainland China is imperative for America's Eurasian geostrategy. The implication s of that reality need to be faced, for the ongoing interaction in the Far East between three major pow ers—America, China, and Japan— creates a potentiall y dangerous regional conundrum and is almost certain to generate geopolitically tectonic shifts. For China, America across the Pacific should be a natural ally since America has no designs on the Asian mainland and has historically opposed both Japanese and Russian encroachments on a weaker China. To th e Chinese, Japan has been the principal enemy over th e last century; Russia, \"the hungry land\" in Chines e, has long been distrusted; and India, too, now looms as a potential rival! The principle \"my neighbor's nei ghbor is my ally\" thus fits the geopolitical and historical relationship between China and America. However, America is no longer Japan's adversary across the ocean but is now closely allied with Ja pan. America also has strong ties with Taiwan and with s everal of the Southeast Asian nations. The Chinese are also sensitive to America's doctrinal reservations regar ding the internal character of the current Chinese regime. Thus, America is also seen as the principal obstacl e in China's quest not only to become globally pree minent but even just regionally predominant. Is a collisio n between America and China, therefore, inevitable? For Japan, America has been the umbrella under which the country could safely recover from a devas tating defeat, regain its economic momentum, and on that b asis progressively attain a position as one of the world's prime powers. But the very fact of that umbrella im poses a limit on Japan's freedom of action, creatin g the paradoxical situation of a world-class power being simultaneously a protectorate. For Japan, America c ontinues to be the vital partner in Japan's emergence as an international leader. But America is also the main reason for Japan's continued lack of national self-reliance in the security area. How long can this situation end ure? In other words, in the foreseeable future two c entrally important—and very directly interacting—ge opolitical issues will define America's role in Eurasia's Far East: 1. What is the practical definition and—from Americ a's point of view—the acceptable scope of China's potential emer gence as the dominant regional power and of its growing as pirations for the status of a global power? 2. As Japan seeks to define a global role for itsel f, how should America manage the regional consequences of the in evitable reduction in the d egree of Japan's acquiescence in its status as an American protectorate? The East Asian geopolitical scene is currently characterized by metastable power relations. Metast ability involves a condition of external rigidity but of re latively little flexibility, in that regard more re miniscent of iron than steel. It is vulnerable to a destructive chain reaction generated by a powerful jarring blow. Tod ay's Far East is experiencing extraordinary economic dynamism alo ng side growing political uncertainty. Asian econom ic growth may in fact even contribute to that uncertai nty, because prosperity obscures the region's polit ical vulnerabilities even as it intensifies national amb itions and expands social expectations. That Asia is an economic success without parall el in human development goes without saying. Just a few basic statistics dramatically highlight that realit y. Less than four decades ago, East Asia (including Japan) accounted for a mere 4 percent or so of the world's total GNP, while North America led with approximat ely 35- 40 percent; by the mid-1990s, the two regions were roughly equal (in the neighborhood of 25 percent). Moreover, Asia's pace of growth has been historical ly unprecedented. Economists have noted that in the takeoff stage of industrialization, Great Britain took more than fifty years and America just somewhat less th an fifty years to double their respective outputs per head, whereas both China and South Korea accomplished the same gain in approximately ten years. Barring some massi ve regional disruption, within a quarter of a centu ry, Asia is likely to outstrip both North America and Europe in total GNP."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" However, in addition to becoming the world's ce nter of economic gravity, Asia is also its potentia l political volcano. Although surpassing Europe in economic dev elopment, Asia is singularly deficient in regional political development. It lacks the cooperative mul tilateral structures that so dominate the European political landscape and that dilute, absorb, and contain Euro pe's more traditional territorial, ethnic, and nati onal conflicts. There is nothing comparable in Asia to e ither the European Union or NATO. None of the three regional associations—ASEAN (Association of Southea st Asian Nations), ARF (Asian Regional Forum, ASEAN's platform for a political-security dialogue) , and APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Group )— even remotely approximates the web of multilateral and regional cooperative ties that bind Europe toge ther. On the contrary, Asia is today the seat of the world's greatest concentration of rising and recent ly awakened mass nationalisms, fueled by sudden access to mass communications, hyperactivated by expanding social expectations generated by growing economic prosperi ty as well as by widening disparities in social wea lth, and made more susceptible to political mobilization by the explosive increase both In population and urban ization. This condition is rendered even more ominous by the scale of Asia's arms buildup. In 1995, the region became—according to the International Institute of Strategic Studies—the world's biggest importer of a rms, outstripping Europe and the Middle East. In brief, East Asia is seething with dynamic activity, which so far has been channeled in peaceful directions by the region's rapid pace of economic growth. But that safety valve could at some point be overwhelmed by unleashed political passions, once they have been triggered by some flash point, even a relatively trivial one. The potential for such a flash point is present in a large number of contentious issues, each vulnerable to demagogic exploitation and thus potentially explosive: • China's resentment of Taiwan's separate status is intensify ing as China gains in strength and as the increasingly pros perous Taiwan begins to flirt with a formally separate status as a nation-state. • The Paracel and Spratly Islands in the South Chin a Sea pose the risk of a collision between China an d several Southeast Asian states over access to poten tially valuable seabed en ergy sources, with China imperially viewing the South China Sea as its legit imate national patrimony. • The Senkaku Islands are contested by both Japan a nd China (with the rivals Taiwan and mainland China ferociously of a single mind on this issue), and the historical rivalry for regional preeminence between Japan and China infuses this issue with sym bolic significance as well. • The division of Korea and the inherent instabilit y of North Korea—made all the more dangerous by North Korea's quest for nuclear capability—pose the risk that a sudden explosion could engulf the peninsula in warfare, which in turn would engage th e United States and indirectly involve Japan. "},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"• The issue of the southernmost Kuril Islands, unil aterally seized in 1945 by the Soviet Union, contin ues to paralyze and poison Russo-Japanese relations. • Other latent territorial-ethnic conflicts involve Russo-Chi-nese, Chinese-Vietnamese, Japanese- Korean, and Chinese-Indian border issues; ethnic un rest in Xinjiang Province; and Chinese-Indonesian disputes over oceanic boundaries. (See map above.) The distribution of power in the region is also unbalanced. China, with its nuclear arsenal and it s large armed forces, is clearly the dominant military power (see table on page 156). The Chinese navy has already a dopted a strategic doctrine of \"offshore active defense,\" se eking to acquire within the next fifteen years an o ceangoing capability for \"effective control of the seas withi n the first island chain,\" meaning the Taiwan Strai t and the South China Sea. To be sure, Japan's military capab ility is also increasing, and in terms of quality, it has no regional peer. At present, however, the Japanese ar med forces are not a tool of Japanese foreign polic y and are largely viewed as an extension of the American mili tary presence in the region. \"Taiwan has 150 F-16s, 60 Mirage, and 130 other fighter jets on order and several naval vessels under construction. \"Malaysia is purchasing 8 F-18s and possibly 18 MiG-29s.

The emergence of China has already prompted its southeastern neighbors to be increasingly deferent ial to Chinese concerns. It is noteworthy that during the minicrisis of early 1996 concerning Taiwan (in whic h China engaged in some threatening military maneuvers and barred air and sea access to a zone near Taiwan, precipitating a demonstrative U.S. naval deployment ), the foreign minister of Thailand hastily declare d that such a ban was normal, his Indonesian counterpart s tated that this was purely a Chinese affair, and th e Philippines and Malaysia declared a policy of neutr ality on the issue. The absence of a regional balance of power has in recent years prompted both Australia and Indones ia— heretofore rather wary of each other—to initiate gr owing military coordination. Both countries made li ttle secret of their anxiety over the longer-range prosp ects of Chinese regional military domination and ov er the staying power of the United States as the region's security guarantor. This concern has also caused Si ngapore to explore closer security cooperation with these nati ons. In fact, throughout the region, the central bu t unanswered question among strategists has become th is: \"For how long can peace in the world's most pop ulated and increasingly most armed region be assured by on e hundred thousand American soldiers, and for how m uch longer in any case are they likely to stay?\""},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" It is in this volatile setting of intensifying n ationalisms, increasing populations, growing prospe rity, exploding expectations, and overlapping power aspirations tha t genuinely tectonic shifts are occurring in East A sia's geopolitical landscape: • China, whatever its specific prospects, is a risi ng and poten tially dominant power. • America's security role is becoming increasingly dependent on collaboration with Japan. • Japan is groping for a more defined and autonomou s politi cal role. • Russia's role has greatly diminished, while the f ormerly Russian-dominated Central Asia has become an object of in ternational rivalry. • The division of Korea is becoming less tenable, m aking Korea's future orientation a matter of increasing geostrategic interest to its major neigh bors. These tectonic shifts give added salience to th e two central issues posed at the outset of this ch apter. CHINA: NOT GLOBAL BUT REGIONAL China's history is one of national greatness. The c urrently intense nationalism of the Chinese people is new only in its social pervasiveness, for it engages the sel f-identification and the emotions of an unprecedent ed number of Chinese. It is no longer a phenomenon confined l argely to the students who, in the early years of t his century, formed the precursors of the Kuomintang an d the Chinese Communist Party. Chinese nationalism is now a mass phenomenon, defining the mindset of the world's most populous state. That mindset has deep historical roots. History has predisposed the Chinese elite to think of Chin a as the natural center of the world. In fact, the Chinese w ord for China—Chung-kuo, or the \"Middle Kingdom\"—bo th conveys the notion of China's centrality in world a ffairs and reaffirms the importance of national uni ty. That perspective also implies a hierarchical radiation o f influence from the center to the peripheries, and thus China as the center expects deference from others. Moreover, since time immemorial, China, with it s vast population, has been a distinctive and proud civilization all its own. That civilization was hig hly advanced in all areas: philosophy, culture, the arts, social skills, technical inventiveness, and political powe r. The Chinese recall that until approximately 1600 , China led the world in agricultural productivity, industrial innovation, and standard of living. But unlike the European and the Islamic civilizations, which have spawned some seventy-five-odd states, China has remained for mos t of its history a single state, which at the time of Americ a's declaration of independence already contained m ore than 200 million people ^and was also the world's leadin g manufacturing power. From that perspective, China's fall from greatn ess—the last 150 years of China's humiliation—is an aberration, a desecration of China's special qualit y, and a personal insult to every individual Chines e. It must be erased, and its perpetrators deserve due punishment . These perpetrators, in varying degrees, have prim arily been four: Great Britain, Japan, Russia, and Americ a—Great Britain, because of the Opium War and its consequent shameful debasement of China; Japan, bec ause of the predatory wars spanning the last centur y, resulting in terrible (and still unrepentecl) infli ction of suffering on the Chinese people; Russia, b ecause of protracted encroachment on Chinese territories in t he North as well as Stalin's domineering in-sensiti vity toward Chinese self-esteem; and finally America, be cause through its Asian presence and support of Jap an, it stands in the way of China's external aspirations. In the Chinese view, two of these four powers ha ve already been punished, so to speak, by history. Great Britain is no longer an empire, and the lowering of the Union Jack in Hong Kong forever closes that particularly painful chapter. Russia remains next d oor, though much diminished in stature, prestige, a nd territory. It is America and Japan that pose the mo st serious problems for China, and it is in the int eraction with them that China's regional and global role will be substantively defined."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" That definition, however, will depend in the fi rst instance on how China itself evolves, on how mu ch of an economic and military power it actually becomes. On this score, the prognosis for China is generally p romising, though not without some major uncertainties and qua lifications. Both the pace of China's economic grow th and the scale of foreign investment in China—each among the highest in the world—provide the statistical b asis for the conventional prognosis that within two decades or so China will become a global power, roughly on a par with the United States and Europe (assuming that th e latter both unites and expands further). China mi ght by then have a GDP considerably in excess of Japan's, and it already exceeds Russia's by a significant ma rgin. That economic momentum should permit China to acqui re military power on a scale that will be intimidat ing to all its neighbors, perhaps even to the more geograp hically distant opponents of China's aspirations. F urther strengthened by the incorporation of Hong Kong and Macao, and perhaps also eventually by the political subordination of Taiwan, a Greater China will emerg e not only as the dominant state in the Far East bu t as a world power of the first rank. However, there are pitfalls in any such prognos is for the \"Middle Kingdom's\" inevitable resurrecti on as a central global power, the most obvious of which per tains to the mechanical reliance on statistical pro jection. That very error was made not long ago by those who prophesied that Japan would supplant the United Sta tes as the world's leading economy and that Japan was dest ined to be the new superstate. That perspective fai led to take into account both the factor of Japan's econom ic vulnerability and the problem of political disco ntinuity— and the same error is being made by those who procl aim, and also fear, the inevitable emergence of Chi na as a world power. First of all, it is far from certain that China 's explosive growth rates can be maintained over th e next two decades. An economic slowdown cannot be excluded, a nd that by itself would discredit the conventional prognosis. In fact, for these rates to be sustained over a historically long period of time would requ ire an unusually felicitous combination of effective natio nal leadership, political tranquillity, domestic so cial discipline, high rates of savings, continued very h igh inflow of foreign investment, and regional stab ility. A prolonged combination of all of these positive fact ors is problematic. Moreover, China's fast pace of growth is likely to produce political side effects that could limit its freedom of action. Chinese consumption of energy is already ex panding at a rate that far exceeds domestic product ion. That excess will widen in any case, but especially so if China's rate of growth continues to be very high. The same is the case with food. Even given the slowdown in Chin a's demographic growth, the Chinese population is s till increasing in large absolute numbers, with food imp orts becoming more essential to internal well-being and political stability. Dependence on imports will not only impose strains on Chinese economic resources because of higher costs, but they will also make China more vulnerable to external pressures. Militarily, China might partially qualify as a global power, since the very size of its economy an d its high growth rates should enable its rulers to divert a s ignificant ratio of the country's GDP to sustain a major expansion and modernization of China's armed forces , including a further buildup of its strategic nucl ear arsenal. However, if that effort is excessive (and according to some Western estimates, in the mid-199 0s it was already consuming about 20 percent of China's GDP), it could have the same negative effect on China's long- term economic growth that the failed attempt by the Soviet Union to compete in the arms race with the United States had on the Soviet economy. Furthermore, a ma jor Chinese effort in this area would be likely to precipitate a countervailing Japanese arms buildup, thereby negating some of the political benefits of China's growing military prowess. And one must not ignore t he fact that outside of its nuclear forces, China i s likely to lack the means, for some time to come, to project i ts military power beyond its regional perimeter. Tensions within China could also intensify, as a result of the inevitable unevenness of highly acc elerated economic growth, driven heavily by the uninhibited exploitation of marginal advantages. The coastal So uth and East as well as the principal urban centers—more ac cessible to foreign investment and overseas trade—h ave so far been the major beneficiaries of China's impress ive economic growth. In contrast, the inland rural areas in general and some of the outlying regions have lagge d (with upward of 100 million rural unemployed). The resulting resentment over regional disparit ies could begin to interact with anger over social inequality. China's rapid growth is widening the social gap in the distribution of wealth. At some point, either b ecause the"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"government may seek to limit such differences or be cause of social resentment from below, the regional disparities and the wealth gap could in turn impact on the country's political stability. The second reason for cautious skepticism regar ding the widespread prognoses of China's emergence during the next quarter of a century as a dominating power in global affairs is, indeed, the future of China' s politics. The dynamic character of China's nonsta-tist econom ic transformation, including its social openness to the rest of the world, is not mutually compatible in the lon g run with a relatively closed and bureaucratically rigid Communist dictatorship. The proclaimed communism of that dictatorship is progressively less a matter o f ideological commitment and more a matter of bureauc ratic vested interest. The Chinese political elite remains organized as a self-contained, rigid, disciplined, and monopolisti-cally intolerant hierarchy, still r itualistically proclaiming its fidelity to a dogma that is said to justify its power but that the same elite is no lo nger implementing socially. At some point, these two dim ensions of life will collide head-on, unless Chines e politics begin to adapt gradually to the social imperatives of China's economics. Thus, the issue of democratization cannot be eva ded indefinitely, unless China suddenly makes the s ame decision it made in the year 1474: to isolate itsel f from the world, somewhat like contemporary North Korea. To do that, China would have to recall its more tha n seventy thousand students currently studying in A merica, expel foreign businessmen, shut down its computers, and tear down satellite dishes from millions of Ch inese homes. It would be an act of madness, reminiscent o f the Cultural Revolution. Perhaps for a brief mome nt, in the context of a domestic struggle for power, a dog matic wing of the ruling but fading Chinese Communi st Party might attempt to emulate North Korea, but it could not be more than a brief episode. More likely than not, it would produce economic stagnation and then promp t a political explosion. In any case, self-isolation would mean the end of any serious Chinese aspirations not only to glob al power but even to regional primacy. Moreover, the country has too much of a stake in access to the world, an d that world, unlike that of 1474, is simply too intrusive to be effectively excluded. There is thus no pract ical, economically productive, and politically viable alt ernative to China's continued openness to the world . Democratization will thus increasingly haunt Ch ina. Neither that issue nor the related question of human rights can be evaded for too long. China's future p rogress, as well as its emergence as a major power, will thus depend to a large degree on how skillfully the ruli ng Chinese elite handles the two related problems o f power succession from the present generation of rulers to a younger team and of coping with the growing tens ion between the country's economic and political system s. The Chinese leaders might perhaps succeed in pro moting a slow and evolutionary transition to a very limited electoral authoritarianism, in which some low-level political choice is tolerated, and only thereafter move toward more genuine political pluralism, including more emphasis on incipient constitutional rule. Suc h a controlled transition would be more compatible with the imperatives of the increasingly open economic dynamics of the country than persistence in maintai ning exclusive Party monopoly on political power. To accomplish such controlled democratization, the Chinese political elite will have to be led wit h extraordinary skill, guided by pragmatic common sen se, and stay relatively united and willing to yield some of its monopoly on power (and personal privilege)— whi le the population at largo will have to be both pat ient and undemanding. That combination of felicitous circums tances may prove difficult to attain. Experience te aches that pressures for democratization from below, eith er from those who have felt themselves politically suppressed (intellectuals and students) or economic ally exploited (the new urban labor class and the r ural poor), generally tend to outpace the willingness of rulers to yield. At some point, the politically and the s ocially disaffected in China are likely to join forces in d emanding more democracy, freedom of expression, and respect for human rights. That did not happen in Tiananmen Square in 1989, but it might well happen the next t ime. Accordingly, it is unlikely that China will be able to avoid a phase of political unrest. Given it s size, the reality of growing regional differences, and the le gacy of some fifty years of doctrinal dictatorship, such a phase could be disruptive both politically and econ omically. Even the Chinese leaders themselves seem to expect as much, with internal Communist Party studi es undertaken in the early 1990s foreseeing potenti ally serious political unrest.1 Some China experts have even prophesied that China might spin into one of i ts historic cycles of internal fragmentation, thereby halting China's march to greatness altogether. But the"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"probability of such an extreme eventuality is dimin ished by the twin impacts of mass nationalism and m odern communications, both of which work in favor of a un ified Chinese state. 1. \"Official Document Anticipates Disorder During t he Post-Deng Period,\" Cheng Ming (Hong Kong), February 1, 1995, provides a detailed summary of tw o analyses prepared for the Party leadership concer ning various forms of potential unrest. A Western perspe ctive on the same topic is contained in Richard Bfu nn, \"China After Deng: Ten Scenarios in Search of Reali ty,\" China Quarterly (March 1996). There is, finally, a third reason for skepticis m regarding the prospects of China's emergence in t he course of the next twenty or so years as a truly major—and to some Americans, already menacing—global power. Eve n if China avoids serious political disruptions and e ven if it somehow manages to sustain its extraordin arily high rates of economic growth over a quarter of a centur y—which are both rather big \"ifs\"—China would still be relatively very poor. Even a tripling of GDP would leave China's population in the lower ranks of the world's nations in per capita income, not to mention the ac tual poverty of a significant portion of its people .2 Its comparative standing in per capita access to teleph ones, cars, and computers, let alone consumer goods , would be very low. 2. In the somewhat optimistic report titled \"China' s Economy Toward the 21st Century\" (Zou xiang 21 sh i ji de Zhongguo jinji), issued in 1996 by the Chinese Inst itute for Quantitative Economic and Technological S tudies, it was estimated that the per capita income in Chin a in 2010 will be approximately $735, or less than $30 higher than the World Rank definition of a low-inco me country. To sum up: even by the year 2020, it is quite u nlikely even under the best of circumstances that C hina could become truly competitive in the key dimensions of g lobal power. Even so, however, China is well on the way to becoming the preponderant regional power in East As ia. It is already geopolitically dominant on the ma inland. Its military and economic power dwarfs its immediat e neighbors, with the exception of India. It is, th erefore, only natural that China will increasingly assert it self regionally, in keeping with the dictates of it s history, geography, and economics. Chinese students of their country's history kno w that as recently as 1840, China's imperial sway e xtended throughout Southeast Asia, all the way down to the Strait of Malacca, including Burma, parts of today' s Bangladesh as well as Nepal, portions of today's Ka zakstan, all of Mongolia, and the region that today is called the Russian Far Eastern Province, north of where th e Amur River flows into the ocean (see map on page 14 in chapter 1). These areas were either under some form of Chinese control or paid tribute to China. Franc o-British colonial expansion ejected Chinese influence from S outheast Asia during the years 1885-95, while two t reaties imposed by Russia in 1858 and 1864 resulted in terr itorial losses in the Northeast and Northwest. In 1 895, following the Sino-Japanese War, China also lost Ta iwan. It is almost certain that history and geography will make the Chinese increasingly insistent—even emotionally charged—regarding the necessity of the eventual reunification of Taiwan with the mainland. It is also reasonable to assume that China, as its power grows, will make that goal its principal objective during the first decade of the next century, following the eco nomic absorption and political digestion of Hong Ko ng. Perhaps a peaceful reunification—maybe under a form ula of \"one nation, several systems\" (a variant of Deng Xiaoping's 1984 slogan \"one country, two systems\")— might become appealing to Taiwan and would not be resisted by America, but only if China has been suc cessful in sustaining its economic progress and ado pting significant democratizing reforms. Otherwise, even a regionally dominant China is still likely to lack the military means to impose its will, especially in th e face of American opposition, in which case the is sue is bound to continue galvanizing Chinese nationalism w hile souring American-Chinese relations. Geography is also an important factor driving t he Chinese interest in making an alliance with Paki stan and establishing a military presence in Burma. In both cases, India is the geostrategic target. Close mili tary cooperation with Pakistan increases India's securit y dilemmas and limits India's ability to establish itself as the regional hegemon in South Asia and as a geopolitica l rival to China. Military cooperation with Burma g ains China access to naval facilities on several Burmese offshore islands in the Indian Ocean, thereby also providing some further strategic leverage in Southeast Asia g enerally and in the Strait of Malacca particularly. And if"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"China were to control the Strait of Malacca and the geostrategic choke point at Singapore, it would co ntrol Japan's access to Middle Eastern oil and European m arkets. Geography, reinforced by history, also dictates China's interest in Korea. At one time a tributary state, a reunited Korea as an extension of American (and ind irectly also of Japanese) influence would be intole rable to China. At the very minimum, China would insist that a reunited Korea be a nonaligned buffer between Ch ina and Japan and would also expect that the historical ly rooted Korean animosity toward Japan would of it self draw Korea into the Chinese sphere of influence. Fo r the time being, however, a divided Korea suits Ch ina best, and thus China is likely to favor the continued exi stence of the North Korean regime. Economic considerations are also bound to influ ence the thrust of China's regional ambitions. In t hat regard, the rapidly growing demand for new energy sources h as already made China insistent on a dominant role in any regional exploitation of the seabed deposits of the South China Sea. For the same reason, China is beg inning to display an increasing interest in the independence of llu- energy-rich Central Asian states. In April 1996, China, Russia, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan signe d a joint border and security agreement; and during President Jiang Zemin's visit to Kazakstan in July of the same year, the Chinese side was quoted as ha ving provided assurances of China's support for \"the eff orts made by Kazakstan to defend its independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.\" The forego ing clearly signaled China's growing involvement in the geopolitics of Central Asia. History and economics also conspire to increase the interest of a regionally more powerful China in Russia's Far East. For the first time since China and Russia have come to share a formal border, China is the economically more dynamic and politically stronger party. Seepage into the Russian area by Chinese immigrants and traders has already assumed signific ant proportions, and China is becoming more active in promoting Northeast Asian economic cooperation that also engages Japan and Korea. In that cooperation, Russia now holds a much weaker card, while the Russ ian Far East increasingly becomes economically dependent on closer links with China's Manchuria. S imilar economic forces are also at work in China's relations with Mongolia, which is no longer a Russian satelli te and whose formal independence China has reluctan tly recognized. A Chinese sphere of regional influence is thus i n the making. A sphere of influence, however, shoul d not be confused with a zone of exclusive political dominat ion, such as the Soviet Union exercised in Eastern Europe. It is socioeconomically more porous and politically less monopolistic. Nonetheless, it entails a geogr aphic space in which its various states, when formulating their own policies, pay special deference to the i nterests, views, and anticipated reactions of the regionally predominant power. In brief, a Chinese sphere of in fluence— perhaps a sphere of deference would be a more accurate formulation—can be defined as one in which the very first question asked in the various capitals regarding any given issue is \"What is Beijing's view on this?\" The map that follows traces out the potential range over the next quarter of a century of a regionally dominant China and also of China as a global power, in the event that—despite the internal and external obstacles already noted—China should actually become one. A regionally dominant Greater China, which would mobilize the political support of its enormously rich and economically powerful diaspora in Singapore, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, and Jakarta, not to"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"speak of Taiwan and Hong Kong (see footnote below f or some startling data)3 and which would penetrate into both Central Asia and the Russian Far East, would t hus approximate in its radius the scope of the Chin ese Empire before the onset of its decline some 150 yea rs ago, even expanding its geopolitical range throu gh the alliance with Pakistan. As China rises in power and prestige, the wealthy overseas Chinese are likely to identify themselves more and more with China's aspirations a nd will thus become a powerful vanguard of China's imperial momentum. The Southeast Asian states may f ind it prudent to defer to China's political sensit ivities and economic interests—and they are increasingly do ing so.4 Similarly, the new Central Asian states increasingly view China as a power that has a stake in their independence and in their role as buffers between China and Russia. 3. According to Yazhou Zhoukan (Asiaweek), Septembe r 25, 1994, the aggregate assets of the 500 leading Chinese-owned companies in Southeast Asia totaled a bout $540 billion. Other estimates are even higher: International Economy,. November/December 1996, rep orted that the annual in-c'ome of the 50 million overseas Chinese was approximately the above amount and thus roughly equal to the GDP of, China's mainland. The overseas Chinese were said to control about 90 percent of Indonesia's economy, 75 percen t of Thailand's, 50-60 percent of Malaysia's, and the wh ole economy in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Concern over this condition even led a former Indon esian ambassador to Japan to warn publicly of a \"Ch inese economic intervention in the region,\" which might n ot only exploit such Chinese presence but which cou ld even lead to Chinese-sponsored \"puppet governments\" (Say diman Suryohadiprojo, \"How to Deal with China and Taiwan,\" AsahiShimbun [Tokyo], September 23, 1996). The scope of China as a global power would most probably involve a significantly deeper southern b ulge, with both Indonesia and the Philippines compelled t o adjust to the reality of the Chinese navy as the dominant force in the South China Sea. Such a China might be much more tempted to resolve the issue of Taiwan b y force, irrespective of America's attitude. In the W est, Uzbekistan, the Central Asian state most deter mined to resist Russian encroachments on its former imperial domain, might favor a countervailing alliance with China, as might Turkmenistan; and China might also become more assertive in the ethnically divided and thus nationally vulnerable Kazakstan. A China that becom es truly both a political and an economic giant mig ht also project more overt political influence into the Rus sian Far East, while sponsoring Korea's unification under its aegis (see map on page 167). But such a bloated China would also be more lik ely to encounter strong external opposition. The pr evious map makes it evident that in the West, both Russia and India would have good geopolitical reasons to a lly in seeking to push back China's challenge. Cooperation between them would be likely to focus heavily on C entral Asia and Pakistan, whence China would threaten thei r interests the most. In the south, opposition woul d be strongest from Vietnam and Indonesia (probably back ed by Australia). In the east, America, probably ba cked by Japan, would react adversely to any Chinese effo rts to gain predominance in Korea and to incorporat e Taiwan by force, actions that would reduce the Amer ican political presence in the Far East to a potent ially unstable and solitary perch in Japan. 4. Symptomatic in that regard was the report publis hed in the Bangkok English-language daily, The Nati on (March 31, 1997), on the visit to Beijing by the Th ai Prime Minister, Chavalit Yongchaiyudh. The purpo se of the visit was defined as establishing a firm strate gic alliance with \"Greater China.\" The Thai leaders hip was said to have \"recognized China as a superpower that has a global role,\" and as wishing to serve as \"a bridge between China and ASEAN.\" Singapore has gone even f arther in stressing ils idcnlilicalion with China. Ultimately, the probability of either scenario s ketched out on the maps fully coming to pass depend s not only on how China itself develops but also very much on American conduct and presence. A disengaged America would make the second scenario much more likely, bu t even the comprehensive emergence of the first wou ld require some American accommodation and self-restra int. The Chinese know this, and hence Chinese polic y has to be focused primarily on influencing both Ame rican conduct and, especially, the critical America n- Japanese connection, with China's other relationshi ps manipulated tactically with that strategic conce rn in mind. China's principal objection to America relates less to what America actually does than to what Ame rica currently is and where it is. America is seen by Ch ina as the world's current hege-mon, whose very pre sence in the region, based on its dominant position in Japan , works to contain China's influence. In the words of a"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Chinese analyst employed in the research arm of the Chinese Foreign Ministry: \"The U.S. strategic aim is to seek hegemony in the whole world and it cannot tole rate the appearance of any big power on the Europea n and Asian continents that will constitute a threat to i ts leading position.\"5 Hence, simply by being what it is and where it is, America becomes China's unintentional adversary rather than its natural ally. 5. Song Yimin. \"A Discussion of the Division and Gr ouping of Forces in the World After the End of the Cold War,\" International Studies (China Institute of Int ernational Studies, Beijing) 6-8 (1996):10. That th is assessment of America represents the view of China' s top leadership is indicated by the fact that a sh orter version of the analysis appeared in the mass-circul ation official organ of the Party, Renmin Ribao (Pe ople's Daily), April 29, 1996. Accordingly, the task of Chinese policy—in keepi ng with Sun Tsu's ancient strategic wisdom—is to us e American power to peacefully defeat American hegemo ny, but without unleashing any latent Japanese regi onal aspirations. To that end, China's geostrat-egy must pursue two goals simultaneously, as somewhat obliq uely denned in August 1994 by Deng Xiaoping: \"First, to oppose hege-monism and power politics and safeguard world peace; second, to build up a new internationa l political and economic order.\" The first obviousl y targets the United States and has as its purpose the reduct ion in American preponderance, while carefully avoi ding a military collision that would end China's drive for economic power; the second seeks to revise the dis tribution of global power, capitalizing on the resentment in some key states against the current global pecking order, in which the United States is perched at the top, supp orted by Europe (or Germany) in the extreme west of Eurasia and by Japan in the extreme east. China's second objective prompts Beijing to pur sue a regional geostrategy that seeks to avoid any serious conflicts with its immediate neighbors, even while continuing its quest for regional preponderance. A tactical improvement in Sino-Russian relations is particular ly timely, especially since Russia is now weaker th an China. Accordingly, in April 1997, both countries joined i n denouncing \"hegemonism\" and declaring NATO's expansion \"impermissible.\" However, it is unlikely that China would seriously consider any long-term a nd comprehensive Russo-Chinese alliance against Americ a. That would work to deepen and widen the scope of the American-Japanese alliance, which China would like to dilute slowly, and it would also isolate China f rom critically important sources of modern technology a nd capital. As in Sino-Russian relations, it suits China to avoid any direct collision with India, even while continuing to sustain its close military cooperation with Pakista n and Burma. A policy of overt antagonism would hav e the negative effect of complicating China's tactically expedient accommodation with Russia, while also pus hing India toward a more cooperative relationship with A merica. To the extent that India also shares an und erlying and somewhat anti-Western predisposition against th e existing global \"hegemony,\" a reduction in Sino-I ndian tensions is also in keeping with China's broader ge ostrategic focus. The same considerations generally apply to China 's ongoing relations with Southeast Asia. Even whil e unilaterally asserting their claims to the South Ch ina Sea, the Chinese have simultaneously cultivated Southeast Asian leaders (with the exception of the historical ly hostile Vietnamese), exploiting the more outspok en anti- Western sentiments (particularly on the issue of We stern values and human rights) that in recent years have been voiced by the leaders of Malaysia and Singapor e. They have especially welcomed the occasionally s trident anti-American rhetoric of Prime Minister Datuk Maha thir of Malaysia, who in a May 1996 forum in Tokyo even publicly questioned the need for the U.S.-Japa n Security Treaty, demanding to know the identity o f the enemy the alliance is supposed to defend against an d asserting that Malaysia does not need allies. The Chinese clearly calculate that their influence in the regio n will be automatically enhanced by any diminution of America's standing. In a similar vein, patient pressure appears to be the motif of China's current policy toward Taiwa n. While adopting an uncompromising position with regard to Taiwan's international status— to the point of even being willing to deliberately generate international tens ions in order to convey China's seriousness on this matter (as in March 1996)—the Chinese leaders presumably reali ze that for the time being they will continue to la ck the power to compel a satisfactory solution. They reali ze that a premature reliance on force would only se rve to precipitate a self-defeating clash with America, wh ile strengthening America's role as the regional gu arantor of"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"peace. Moreover, the Chinese themselves acknowledge that how effectively Hong Kong is first absorbed i nto China will greatly determine the prospects for the emergence of a Greater China. The accommodation that has been taking place in China's relations with South Korea is also an inte gral part of the policy of consolidating its flanks in order to be able to concentrate more effectively on the c entral goal. Given Korean history and public emotions, a Sino-Ko rean accommodation of itself contributes to a reduc tion in Japan's potential regional role and prepares the gr ound for the reemergence of the more traditional re lationship between China and (either a reunited or a still-div ided) Korea. Most important, the peaceful enhancement of Chi na's regional standing will facilitate the pursuit of the central objective, which ancicnl China's strategist Sun Tsu might have formulated as follows: to dilut e American regional power to the point that a diminis hed America will come to need a regionally dominant China as its ally and eventually even a globally po werful China as its partner. This goal is to be sou ght and accomplished in a manner that does not precipitate either a defensive expansion in the scope of the Am erican- Japanese alliance or the regional replacement of Am erica's power by that of Japan. To attain the central objective, in the short r un, China seeks to prevent the consolidation and ex pansion of American-Japanese security cooperation. China was p articularly alarmed at the implied increase in earl y 1996 in the range of U.S.-Japanese security cooperation from the narrower \"Far East\" to a wider \"Asia-Pacif ic,\" perceiving in it not only an immediate threat to Ch ina's interests but also the point of departure for an American-dominated Asian system of security aimed a t containing China (in which Japan would be the vit al linchpin,6 much as Germany was in NATO during the C old War). The agreement was generally perceived in Beijing as facilitating Japan's eventual emergence as a major military power, perhaps even capable of relying on force to resolve outstanding economic or maritim e disputes on its own. China thus is likely to fan energetically the still strong Asian fears of any s ignificant Japanese military role in the region, in order to restrain America and intimidate Japan. 6. An elaborate examination of America's alleged in tent to construct such an anti-China Asian system i s contained in Wang Chunyin, \"Looking Ahead to Asia-P acific Security in the Early Twenty-first Century,\" Guoji Zhanwang (World Outlook), February 1996. Another Chinese commentator argued that the Amer ican-Japanese security arrangement has been altered from a \"shield of defense\" aimed at containing Sovi et power to a \"spear of attack\" pointed at China (Y ang Baijiang, \"Implications of Japan-U.S. Security Decl aration Outlined,\" Xiandai Guoji Guanxi [Contempora ry International Relations], June 20, 1996). On Januar y 31, 1997, the authoritative daily organ of the Ch inese Communist Party, Renmin Ribao, published an article entitled \"Strengthening Military Alliance Does Not Conform with Trend of the Times,\" in which the rede finition of the scope of the U.S.-Japanese military cooperation was denounced as \"a dangerous move.\" However, in the longer run, according to China' s strategic calculus, American hegemony cannot last . Although some Chinese, especially among the militar y, tend to view America as China's implacable foe, the predominant expectation in Beijing is that America will become regionally more isolated because of its excessive reliance on Japan and that consequently A merica's dependence on Japan will grow even further , but so will American-Japanese contradictions and Americ an fears of Japanese militarism. That will then mak e it possible for China to play off America and Japan ag ainst each other, as China did earlier in the case of the United States and the Soviet Union. In Beijing's vi ew, the time will come when America will realize th at—to remain an influential Asia-Pacific power—it has no choice but to turn to its natural partner on the As ian mainland. JAPAN: NOT REGIONAL BUT INTERNATIONAL How the American-Japanese relationship evolves is t hus a critical dimension in China's geopolitical fu ture. Since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, Ame rica's policy in the Far East has been based on Jap an. At first only the site for the occupying American mili tary, Japan has since become the basis for America' s political-military presence in the Asia-Pacific reg ion and America's centrally important global ally, yet also a security protectorate. The emergence of China, howe ver, does pose the question whether—and to what end —"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"the close American-Japanese relationship can endure in the altering regional context. Japan's role in an anti- China alliance would be clear; but what should Japa n's role be if China's rise is to be accommodated i n some fashion even as it reduces America's primacy in the region? Like China, Japan is a nation-state with a deepl y ingrained sense of its unique character and speci al status. Its insular history, even its imperial mythology, has p redisposed the highly industrious and disciplined J apanese people to see themselves as endowed with a distinct ive and superior way of life, which Japan first def ended by splendid isolation and then, when the world imposed itself in the nineteenth century, by emulating the European empires in seeking to create one of its own on the Asian mainland. The disaster of World War II then f ocused the Japanese people on the one-dimensional goal of economic recovery, but it also left them uncertain regarding their country's wider mission. Current American fears of a dominant China are reminiscent of the relatively recent American paran oia regarding Japan. Japanopho-bia has now yielded to S inophobia. A mere decade ago, predictions of Japan' s inevitable and imminent appearance as the world's \" superstate\"—poised not only to dethrone America (ev en to buy it out!) but to impose some sort of a \"Pax Nipp onica\"—were a veritable cottage industry among Amer ican commentators and politicians. But not only among th e Americans. The Japanese themselves soon became ea ger imitators, with a series of best-sellers in Japan p ropounding the thesis that Japan was destined to pr evail in its high-tech rivalry with the United States and that J apan would soon become the center of a global \"info rmation empire,\" while America was allegedly sliding into a decline because of historical fatigue and social s elf- indulgence. These facile analyses obscured the degree to wh ich Japan was, and remains, a vulnerable country. I t is vulnerable to the slightest disruptions in the orde rly global flow of resources and trade, not to ment ion global stability more generally, and it is beset by surfac ing domestic weaknesses—demographic, social, and po litical. Japan is simultaneously rich, dynamic, and economic ally powerful, but it is also regionally isolated a nd politically limited by its security dependence on a powerful ally that happens to be the principal kee per of global stability (on which Japan so depends) as wel l as Japan's main economic rival. It is unlikely that Japan's current position—on the one hand, as a globally respected economic powe rhouse and, on the other, as a geopolitical extension of A merican power—will remain acceptable to the new generations of Japanese, no longer traumatized and shamed by the experience of World War II. For reaso ns of both history and self-esteem, Japan is a country no t entirely satisfied with the global status quo, th ough in a more subdued fashion than China. It feels, with som e justification, that it is entitled to formal reco gnition as a world power but is also aware that the regionally u seful (and, to its Asian neighbors, reassuring) sec urity dependence on America inhibits that recognition. Moreover, China's growing power on the mainland of Asia, along with the prospect that its influenc e may soon radiate into the maritime regions of economic iniporl.nicc lo Japan, intcnsilics the Japanese sen se of ambiguity regarding the country's geopolitical futu re. On the one hand, there is in Japan a strong cul tural and emotional identification with China as well as a la tent sense of a common Asian identity. Some Japanes e may also feel that the emergence of a stronger China ha s the expedient effect of enhancing Japan's importa nce to the United States as America's regional para-mountcy is reduced. On the other hand, for many Japanese, Chi na is the traditional rival, a former enemy, and a potent ial threat to the stability of the region. That mak es the security tie with America more important than ever, even if it increases the resentment of some of the more nat ionalistic Japanese concerning the irksome restraints on Japan 's political and military independence. There is a superficial similarity between Japan' s situation in Eurasia's Far East and Germany's in Eurasia's Far West. Both are the principal regional allies of the United States. Indeed, American power in Europe an d Asia is derived directly from the close alliances with thes e two countries. Both have respectable military establishments, but neither is independent in that regard: Germany is constrained by its military inte gration into NATO, while Japan is restricted by its own (though American-designed) constitutional limitations and t he U.S.- Japan Security Treaty. Both are trade and financial powerhouses, regionally dominant and also preemine nt on the global scale. Both can be classified as quasi-g lobal powers, and both chafe at the continuing deni al to them of formal recognition through permanent seats on th e UN Security Council."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" But the differences in their respective geopolit ical conditions are pregnant with potentially signi ficant consequences. Germany's actual relationship with NA TO places the country on a par with its principal European allies, and under the North Atlantic Treat y, Germany has formal reciprocal defense obligation s with the United States. The U.S.-Japan Security Treaty s tipulates American obligations to defend Japan, but it does not provide (even if only formally) for the use of the Japanese military in the defense of America. Th e treaty in effect codifies a protective relationship. Moreover, Germany, by its proactive membership in the European Union and NATO, is no longer seen a s a threat by those neighbors who in the past were vict ims of its aggression but is viewed instead as a de sirable economic and political partner. Some even welcome t he potential emergence of a German-led Mitteleuropa , witli Germany seen as a benign regional power. That is far from the case with Japan's Asian neighbors, who harbor lingering animosity toward Japan over World War II. A contributing factor to neighborly resentm ent is the appreciation of the yen, which has not only pro mpted bitter complaints but has impeded reconciliat ion with Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and even Chin a, 30 percent of whose large long-term debts to Jap an are in yen. Japan also has no equivalent in Asia to Germany 's France: that is, a genuine and more or less equa l regional partner. There is admittedly a strong cultural attr action to China, mingled perhaps with a sense of gu ilt, but that attraction is politically ambiguous in that neither side trusts the other and neither is prepared to a ccept the other's regional leadership. Japan also has no equi valent to Germany's Poland: that is, a much weaker but geopolitically important neighbor with whom reconci liation and even cooperation is becoming a reality. Perhaps Korea, especially so after eventual reunifi cation, could become that equivalent, but Japanese- Korean relations are only formally good, with the Korean m emories of past domination and the Japanese sense o f cultural superiority impeding any genuine social re conciliation.7 Finally, Japan's relations with Russ ia have been much cooler than Germany's. Russia still retai ns the southern Kuril Islands by force, which it se ized just before the end of World War II, thereby freezing th e Russo-Japanese relationship. In brief, Japan is p olitically isolated in its region, whereas Germany is not. 7. The Japan Digest, February 25, 1997, reported th at, according to a governmental poll, only 36 perce nt of the Japanese felt friendly toward South Korea. In addition, Germany shares with its neighbors both common democratic principles and Europe's broa der Christian heritage. It also seeks to identify and e ven sublimate itself within an entity and a cause l arger than itself, namely, that of \"Europe.\" In contrast, ther e is no comparable \"Asia.\" Indeed, Japan's insular past and even its current democratic system tend to separate it from the rest of the region, in spite of the em ergence in recent years of democracy in several Asian countrie s. Many Asians view Japan not only as nationally se lfish but also as overly imitative of the West and reluct ant to join them in questioning the West's views on human rights and on the importance of individualism. Thus , Japan is perceived as not truly Asian by many Asi ans, even as the West occasionally wonders to what degre e Japan has truly become Western. In effect, though in Asia, Japan is not comfort ably Asian. That condition greatly limits its geost rategic options. A genuinely regional option, that of a reg ionally preponderant Japan that overshadows China—e ven if no longer based on Japanese domination but rather o n benign Japanese-led regional cooperation—does not seem viable for solid historical, political, and cu ltural reasons. Furthermore, Japan remains dependen t on American military protection and international spon sorship. The abrogation or even the gradual emascul ation of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty would render Japan i nstantly vulnerable to the disruptions that any ser ious manifestation of regional or global turmoil might p roduce. The only alternatives then would be either to accept China's regional predominance or to undertake a mas sive—and not only costly but also very dangerous— program of military rearmament. Understandably, many Japanese find their countr y's present position—simultaneously a quasi-global power and a security protectorate—to be anomalous. But dr amatic and viable alternatives to the existing arra ngements are not self-evident. If it can be said that China' s national goals, notwithstanding the inescapable v ariety of views among the Chinese strategists on specific asp ects, are reasonably clear and the regional thrust of China's geopolitical ambitions relatively predictable, Japa n's geostrategic vision tends to be relatively clou dy and the Japanese public mood much more ambiguous."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" Most Japanese realize that a strategically sign ificant and abrupt change of course could be danger ous. Can Japan become a regional power in a region where it is still the object of resentment and where China i s emerging as the regionally preeminent power? Yet sh ould Japan simply acquiesce in such a Chinese role? Can Japan become a truly comprehensive global power (in all its dimensions) without jeopardizing American support and galvanizing even more regional animosit y? And will America, in any case, stay put in Asia, and if it does, how will its reaction to China's growing i nfluence impinge on the priority so far given to th e American- Japanese connection? For most of the Cold War, none of these (|iieslions ever ťť .ê ť In be raised. Today, they have become slrategically salient and are propellin g an increasingly lively debate in Japan. Since the 1950s, Japanese foreign policy has be en guided by four basic principles promulgated by p ostwar Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida. The Yoshida Doctrin e postulated that (1) Japan's main goal should be economic development, (2) Japan should be lightly a rmed and should avoid involvement in international conflicts, (3) Japan should follow the political le adership of and accept military protection from the United States, and (4) Japanese diplomacy should be nonide ological and should focus on international cooperat ion. However, since many Japanese also felt uneasy about the extent of Japan's involvement in the Cold War, the fiction of semineutrality was simultaneously cultiv ated. Indeed, as late as 1981, Foreign Minister Mas ayoshi Ito was forced to resign for having permitted the term \"alliance\" (domef) to be used in characterizing U.S .-Japan relations. That is now all past. Japan was then recovering , China was self-isolated, and Eurasia was polarize d. By contrast, Japan's political elite now senses that a rich Japan, economically involved in the world, ca n no longer define self-enrichment as its central national purp ose without provoking international resentment. Fur ther, an economically powerful Japan, especially one that co mpetes with America, cannot simply be an extension of American foreign policy while at the same time avoi ding any international political responsibilities. A politically more influential Japan, especially one that seeks global recognition (for example, a perma nent seat on the UN Security Council), cannot avoid taking st ands on the more critical security or geopolitical issues affecting world peace. As a result, recent years have seen a proliferat ion of special studies and reports by a variety of Japanese public and private bodies, as well as a plethora of often controversial books by well-known politician s and professors, outlining new missions for Japan in the post-Cold War era.8 Many of these have involved speculation regarding the durability and desirabili ty of the American-Japanese security alliance and h ave advocated a more active Japanese diplomacy, especia lly toward China, or a more energetic Japanese mili tary role in the region. If one were to judge the state of the American-Japanese connection on the basis of the public dialogue, one would be justified in concluding that by the mid-1990s relations between the two countri es had entered a crisis stage. 8. For example, the Higuchi Commission, a prime-min isterial advisory board that outlined the \"Three Pi llars of Japanese Security Policy\" in a report issued in the summer of 1994, stressed the primacy of the Americ an- Japanese security ties but also advocated an Asian multilateral security dialogue; the 1994 O/awa Coin millcr report, \"Uliieprinl for a New Japan\"; the Yomiuri Shimbun 's outline for \"A Comprehensive Security Policy\" of May 1995, advocating among other items the use abro ad of the Japanese military for peacekeeping; the A pril 1996 report of the Japan Association of Corporate E xecutives (keizai doyukai), prepared with the assis tance of the Fuji Bank think tank, urging greater symmetry i n the American-Japanese defense system; the report entitled \"Possibility and Role of a Security System in the A sian-Pacific Region,\" submitted to the prime minist er in June 1996 by the Japan Forum on International Affairs; a s well as numerous books and articles published ove r the last several years, often much more polemical and e xtreme in their recommendations and more often cite d by the Western media than the above-mentioned mostly m ainstream reports. For example, in 1996 a book edit ed by a Japanese general evoked widespread press comme ntaries when it dared to speculate that under some circumstances the United States might fail to prote ct Japan and hence Japan should augment its nationa l defense capabilities (see General Yasuhiro Morino, ed., Next deneralion (Imund Self-Defense I'orc.e an d the commentary on it in \"Myths of the U.S. Coming to Ou r Aid,\" Sunhei Sliimbun, March 4, 1996). However, on the level of public policy, the ser iously discussed recommendations have been, on the whole, relatively sober, measured, and moderate. The extre me options—that of outright pacifism (tinged with a n anti- U.S. flavor) or of unilateral and major rearmament (requiring a revision of the Constitution and pursu ed"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"presumably in defiance of an adverse American and r egional reaction)—have won few adherents. The publi c appeal of pacifism has, if anything, waned in recen t years, and unilateralism and militarism have also failed to gain much public support, despite the advocacy of s ome flamboyant spokesmen. The public at large and certainly the influential business elite viscerally sense that neither option provides a real policy c hoice and, in fact, could only endanger Japan's well-being. The politically dominant public discussions hav e primarily involved differences in emphasis regard ing Japan's basic international posture, with some seco ndary variations concerning geopolitical priorities . In broad terms, three major orientations, and perhaps a mino r fourth one, can be identified and labeled as foll ows: the unabashed \"America Firsters,\" the global mercantili sts, the proactive realists, and the international visionaries. However, in the final analysis, all four share the same rather general goal and partake of the same ce ntral concern: to exploit the special relationship with t he United States in order to gain global recognitio n for Japan, while avoiding Asian hostility and without prematur ely jeopardizing the American security umbrella. The first orientation takes as its point of dep arture the proposition that the maintenance of the existing (and admittedly asymmetrical) American-Japanese relation ship should remain the central core of Japan's geostrategy. Its adherents desire, as do most Japan ese, greater international recognition for Japan an d more equality in the alliance, but it is their cardinal article of faith, as Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa put it in January 1993, that \"the outlook for the world going into the twenty-first century will largely depend on whether or not Japan and the United States ... are able to provide coordinated leadership under a shared visio n.\" This viewpoint has been dominant within the internationa list political elite and the foreign policy establi shment that has held power over the course of the last two or s o decades. On the key geostrategic issues of China' s regional role and America's presence in Korea, that leadersh ip has been supportive of the United States, but it also sees its role as a source of restraint on any American p ropensity to adopt a confrontationist posture towar d China. In fact, even this group has become increasingly incli ned to emphasize the need for closer Japanese-Chine se relations, ranking them in importance just below th e ties with America. The second orientation does not contest the geo strategic identification of Japan's policy with Ame rica's, but it sees Japanese interests as best served by the frank recognition and acceptance of the fact that Japan is primarily an economic power. This outlook is most often assoc iated with the traditionally influential bureaucrac y of the MITI (Ministry of International Trade and Industry) and with the country's trading and export business leadership. In this view, Japan's relative demilita rization is an asset worth preserving. With America assuring the security of the country, Japan is free to pursu e a policy of global economic engagement, which qui etly enhances its global standing. In an ideal world, the second orientation would be inclined to favor a policy of at least de facto neutralism, with America offsetting China's regional power and thereby protecting Taiwan and South Korea, thus mak ing Japan free to cultivate a closer economic relations hip with the mainland and with Southeast Asia. Howe ver, given the existing political realities, the global mercantilists accept the American-Japanese alliance as a necessary arrangement, including the relatively mod est budgetary outlays for the Japanese armed forces (still not much exceeding 1 percent of the country's GDP), but they are not eager to infuse the alliance with any regionally significant substance. The third group, the proactive realists, tend to be the new breed of politicians and geopolitical t hinkers. They believe that as a rich and successful democracy Jap an has both the opportunity and the obligation to m ake a real difference in the post-Cold War world. By doing so, it can also gain the global recognition to which J apan is entitled as an economic powerhouse that historicall y ranks among the world's few truly great nations. The appearance of such a more muscular Japanese posture was foreshadowed in the 1980s by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, but perhaps the best-known expos ition of that perspective was contained in the controversial Ozawa Committee report, published in 1994 and entitled suggestively \"Blueprint for a New Japan: The Rethinking of a Nation.\" Named after the committee's chairman, Ichiro Oz awa, a rapidly rising centrist political leader, th e report advocated both a democratization of the country's h ierarchical political culture and a rethinking of J apan's international posture. Urging Japan to become \"a no rmal country,\" the report recommended the retention of the American-Japanese security connection but also coun seled that Japan should abandon its international p assivity"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"by becoming actively engaged in global politics, es pecially by taking the lead in international peacek eeping efforts. To that end, the report recommended that t he country's constitutional limitations on the disp atch abroad of Japanese armed forces be lifted. Left unsaid but implied by the cMiiphasis on \"a nor mal country\" was also the notion of a more signific ant geopolitical emancipation from America's security b lanket. The advocates of this viewpoint tended to a rgue that on matters of global importance, Japan should not h esitate to speak up for Asia, instead of automatica lly following the American lead. However, they remained characteristically vague on such sensitive matters as the growing regional role of China or the future of Kor ea, not differing much from their more traditionali st colleagues. Thus, in regard to regional security, t hey^paitook of the still strong Japanese inclinatio n to let both matters remain primarily the responsibility of Amer ica, with Japan merely exercising a moderating role on any excessive American zeal. By the second half of the 1990s, this proactive realist orientation was beginning to dominate publi c thinking and affect the formulation of Japanese foreign poli cy. In the first half of 1996, the Japanese governm ent started to speak of Japan's \"independent diplomacy\" (jishu gaiko), even though the ever-cautious Japanese Fore ign Ministry chose to translate the Japanese phrase as the vaguer (and to America presumably less pointed) term \"proactive diplomacy.\" The fourth orientation, that of the internation al visionaries, has been less influential than any of the preceding, but it occasionally serves to infuse the Japanese viewpoint with more idealistic rhetoric. It tends to be associated publicly with outstanding individuals —like Akio Morita of Sony—who personally dramatize the importance to Japan of a demonstrative commitment t o morally desirable global goals. Often invoking th e notion of \"a new global order,\" the visionaries cal l on Japan—precisely because it is not burdened by geopolitical responsibilities—to be a global leader in the development and advancement of a truly huma ne agenda for the world community. All four orientations are in agreement on one ke y regional issue: that the emergence of more multil ateral Asia-Pacific cooperation is in Japan's interest. Su ch cooperation can have, over time, three positive effects: it can help to engage (and also subtly to restrain) Ch ina; it can help to keep America in Asia, even whil e gradually reducing its predominance; and it can help to mitig ate anti-Japanese resentment and thus increase Japa n's influence. Although it is unlikely l<> ereate ;i Ja panese sphere of regional inlluence, it might gain Japan some degree of regional deference, especially in the off shore maritime countries that may be uneasy over Ch ina's growing power. All four viewpoints also agree that a cautious cultivation of China is much to be preferred over a ny American-led effort toward the direct containment o f China. In fact, the notion of an American-led str ategy to contain China, or even the idea of an informal bala ncing coalition confined to the island states of Ta iwan, the Philippines, Brunei, and Indonesia, backed by Japan and America, has had no significant appeal for the Japanese foreign policy establishment. In the Japan ese perspective, any effort of that sort would not only require an indefinite and major American military p resence in both Japan and Korea but—by creating an incendiary geopolitical overlap between Chinese and American-Japanese regional interests (see map on p age 184)—would be likely to become a self-fulfilling pr ophesy of a collision with China.9 The result would be to inhibit Japan's evolutionary emancipation and threa ten the Far East's economic well-being. 9. Some conservative Japanese have been tempted by the notion of a special Japan-Taiwan connection, an d in 1996 a \"Japan-Taiwan Parliamentarians' Association\" was formed to promote that goal. The Chinese react ion has been predictably hostile. By the same token, few favor the opposite: a gr and accommodation between Japan and China. The regi onal consequences of such a classical reversal of allian ces would be too unsettling: an American withdrawal from the region as well as the prompt subordination of b oth Taiwan and Korea to China, leaving Japan at Chi na's mercy. This is not an appealing prospect, save perh aps to a few extremists. With Russia geopolitically marginalized and historically despised, there is th us no alternative to the basic consensus that the l ink with America remains Japan's central lifeline. Without i t, Japan can neither ensure itself a steady supply of oil nor"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"protect itself from a Chinese (and perhaps soon, al so a Korean) nuclear bomb. The only real policy iss ue is how best to manipulate the American connection in order to advance Japanese interests. Accordingly, the Japanese have gone along with A merican desires to enhance American-Japanese milita ry cooperation, including the seemingly increased scop e from the more specific \"Far East\" to a broader \"A sia- Pacific formula.\" Consistent with this, in early 19 96 in its review of the so-called Japan-U.S. defens e guidelines, the Japanese government also broadened its reference to the possible use of Japanese defen se forces from in \"Far East emergencies\" to \"emergencies in J apan's neighboring regions.\" Japanese willingness t o accommodate America on this matter has also been dr iven by percolating doubts regarding America's long -term staying power in Asia and by concerns that China's rise—and America's seeming anxiety over it—could at some point in the future still impose on Japan an u nacceptable choice: to stand with America against C hina or without America and allied with China. For Japan, that fundamental dilemma also contai ns a historic imperative: since becoming a dominant regional power is not a viable goal and since without a regional base the attainment of truly comprehensive global power is unrealistic, it follows that Japan can best attain the status of a global leader through active involvement in worldwide peacekeeping and economic development. By taking advantage of the American-Japanese military alliance to ensure the stability of the Far East—but without letting it evolve into an anti-Chinese coalition—Japan can safely carve out a distinctive and influential global mission as the power that promotes the emergence of genuinely international and more effectively institutionalized cooperation. Japan could thus become a much more powerful and globally influential equivalent of Canada: a state that is respected for the constructive use of its wealth and power but one that is neither feared nor resented. AMERICA'S GEOSTRATEGIC ADJUSTMENT It should be the task of American policy to make ce rtain that Japan pursues such a choice and that Chi na's rise to regional preeminence does not preclude a stable triangular balance of East Asian power. The effort to manage both Japan and China and to maintain a stabl e three-way interaction that also involves America will severely tax American diplomatic skills and politic al imagination. Shedding past fixation on the threa t allegedly posed by Japan's economic ascension and eschewing f ears of Chinese political muscle could help to infu se cool realism into a policy that must be based on careful strategic calculus: how to channel Japanese energy in the international direction and how to steer Chinese po wer into a regional accommodation. Only in this manner will America be able to for ge on the eastern mainland of Eurasia a geopolitica lly congenial equivalent to Europe's role on the wester n periphery of Eurasia, that is, a structure of reg ional power based on shared interests. However, unlike the Euro pean case, a democratic bridgehead on the eastern m ainland will not soon emerge. Instead, in the Far East the redirected alliance with Japan must also serve as t he basis for an American accommodation with a regionally preemin ent China. For America, several important geostrategic con clusions flow from the analysis contained in the pr eceding two sections of this chapter:"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" The prevailing wisdom that China is the next glo bal power is breeding paranoia abonl China and fost ering megalomania within China. Fears of an aggressive an d antagonistic China that before long is destined t o be the next global power are, at best, premature; and, at worst, they can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. It follows that it would be counterproductive to organize a co alition designed to contain China's rise to global power. That would only ensure that a regionally influential Chi na would be hostile. At the same time, any such eff ort would strain the American-Japanese relationship, since mo st Japanese would be likely to oppose such a coalit ion. Accordingly, the United States should desist from p ressing Japan to assume larger defense responsibili ties in the Asia-Pacific region. Efforts to that effect wil l merely hinder the emergence of a stable relations hip between Japan and China, while also further isolating Japan in the region. But precisely because China is in fact not like ly to emerge soon as a global power—and because for that very reason it would be unwise to pursue a policy of Chi na's regional containment—it is desirable to treat China as a globally significant player. Drawing China into wid er international cooperation and granting it the st atus it craves can have the effect of dulling the sharper e dges of China's national ambitions. An important st ep in that direction would be to include China in the annual s ummit of the world's leading countries, the so-call ed G-7 (Group of Seven), especially since Russia has also been invited to it. Despite appearances, China does not in fact hav e grand strategic options. China's continued econom ic success remains heavily dependent on the inflow of Western capital and technology and on access to for eign markets, and that severely limits China's options. An alliance with an unstable and impoverished Russi a would not enhance China's economic or geopolitical prospe cts (and for Russia it would mean subordination to China). It is thus not a viable geostrategic option, even i f it is tactically tempting for both China and Russ ia to toy with the idea. Chinese aid to Iran and Pakistan is of mo re immediate regional and geopolitical significance to China, but that also does not provide the point of departu re for a serious quest for global power status. An \"antihegemonic\" coalition could become a last-resor t option if China came to feel that its national or regional aspirations were being blocked by the United States (with Japan's support). But it would be a coalitio n of the poor, who would then be likely lo remain collective ly poor for quite sonic time. A Greater China is emerging as the regionally do minant power. As such, it may attempt to impose its elf on its neighbors in a manner that is regionally destabiliz ing; or it may be satisfied with exercising its inf luence more indirectly, in keeping with past Chinese imperial h istory. Whether a hegemonic sphere of influence or a vaguer sphere of deference emerges will depend in part on how brutal and authoritarian the Chinese regime rem ains and in part also on the manner in which the key out side players, notably America and Japan, react to t he emergence of a Greater China. A policy of simple ap peasement could encourage a more assertive Chinese posture; but a policy of merely obstructing the eme rgence of such a China would also be likely to prod uce a similar outcome. Cautious accommodation on some iss ues and a precise drawing of the line on others mig ht avoid either extreme. In any case, in some areas of Eurasia, a Greate r China may exercise a geopolitical influence that is compatible with America's grand geostrategic intere sts in a stable but politically pluralistic Eurasia . For example, China's growing interest in Central Asia i nevitably constrains Russia's freedom of action in seeking to achieve any form of political reintegration of the region under Moscow's control. In this connection a nd as related to the Persian Gulf, China's growing need f or energy dictates a common interest with America i n maintaining free access to and political stability in the oil-producing regions. Similarly, China's su pport for Pakistan restrains India's ambitions to subordinate that country and offsets India's inclination to co operate with Russia in regard to Afghanistan and Central Asia. F inally, Chinese and Japanese involvement in the development of eastern Siberia can likewise help to enhance regional stability. These common interests should be explored through a sustained strategic dialogue. 10 10. In a meeting in 1996 with China's top national security and defense officials, I identified (using occasionally deliberately vague formulations) the f ollowing areas of common strategic interest as the basis for such a dialogue: (1) a peaceful Southeast Asia; (2) nonuse of force in the resolution of offshore issu es; (3) peaceful reunification of China; (4) stability in K orea; (5) independence of Central Asia; (6) balance between India and Pakistan; (7) an economically dynamic and internationally benign Japan; (8) a stable but not too strong Russia."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" There are also areas where Chinese ambitions mig ht clash with American (and also Japanese) interest s, especially if these ambitions were to be pursued th rough historically more familiar strong-arm tactics . This applies particularly to Southeast Asia, Taiwan, and Korea. Southeast Asia is potentially too rich, geograp hically too spread out, and simply too big to be ea sily subordinated by even a powerful China—but it is als o too weak and politically too fragmented not to be come at least a sphere of deference for China. China's regi onal influence, abetted by the Chinese financial an d economic presence in all of the area's countries, is bound t o grow as China's power increases. Much depends on how China applies that power, but it is not self-eviden t that America has any special interest in opposing it directly or in becoming involved in such issues as the South China Sea dispute. The Chinese have considerable historical experience in subtly managing unequal (o r tributary) relationships, and it would certainly be in China's own interest to exercise self-restraint in order to avoid regional fears of Chinese imperialis m. That fear could generate a regional anti-Chinese coalition (a nd some overtones of that are already present in th e nascent Indonesian-Australian military cooperation), which would then most likely seek support from the United States, Japan, and Australia. A Greater China, especially after digesting Hon g Kong, will almost certainly seek more energetical ly to achieve Taiwan's reunification with the mainland. I t is important to appreciate the fact that China ha s never acquiesced in the indefinite separation of Taiwan. Therefore, at some point, that issue could generate a head-on American-Chinese collision. Its consequences for al l concerned would be most damaging: China's economi c prospects would be set back; America's ties with Ja pan could become severely strained; and American ef forts to create a stable balance of power in eastern Eurasia could be derailed. Accordingly, it is essential to attain and main tain reciprocally the utmost clarity on this issue. Even if for the foreseeable future China is likely to lack the mean s to effectively coerce Taiwan, Beijing must unders tand—and be credibly convinced—that American acquiescence in an attempt at the forcible reintegration of Taiwan , sought by the use of military power, would be so de vastating to America's position in the Far East tha t America simply could not afford to remain militarily passive; if Taiwan were unable to protect itself. In other words, America would have to intervene not for the sake of a separate Taiwan but for the sake of America's geopolitical interests in the Asia-Pacifi c area. This is an important distinction. The Unite d States does not have, per se, any special interest in a se parate Taiwan. In fact, its official position has b een, and should remain, that there is only one China. But how China seeks reunification can impinge on vital American interests, and the Chinese have to be clearly aware of that. The issue of Taiwan also gives America a legiti mate reason for raising the human rights question i n its dealings with China without justifying the accusati on of interference in Chinese domestic affairs. It is perfectly appropriate to reiterate to Beijing that reunificat ion will be accomplished only when China becomes mo re prosperous and more democratic. Only such a China w ill be able to attract Taiwan and assimilate it wit hin a Greater China that is also prepared to be a confede ration based on the principle of \"one country, seve ral systems.\" In any case, because of Taiwan, it is in China's own interest to enhance respect for human r ights, and it is appropriate in that context for America to ad dress the matter. At the same time, it behooves the United States —in keeping with its promise to China—to abstain fr om directly or indirectly supporting any international upgrading of Taiwan's status. In the 1990s, some U .S.- Taiwanese official contacts conveyed the impression that the United States was tacitly beginning to tr eat Taiwan as a separate state, and the Chinese anger o ver this issue was understandable, as was Chinese resentment of the intensifying effort by Taiwanese officials to gain international recognition for Tai wan's separate status. The United States should not be shy, therefore, in making it clear that its attitude toward Taiwan will be adversely affected by Taiwanese efforts to alter th e long-established and deliberate ambiguities gover ning the China-Taiwan relationship. Moreover, if China does prosper and does democratize and if its absorption of Hong Kong does not involve a retrogression regardin g civil rights, American encouragement of a serious cross-"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Strait dialogue regarding the terms of an eventual reunification would also help generate pressure for increased democratization within China, while fostering a wid er strategic accommodation between the United State s and a Greater China. Korea, the geopolitically pivotal state in Nort heast Asia, could again become a source of contenti on between America and China, and its future will also impact directly on the American-Japanese connection. As lo ng as Korea remains divided and potentially vulnerable to a war between the unstable North and the increasin gly rich South, American forces will have to remain on the p eninsula. Any unilateral U.S. withdrawal would not only be likely to precipitate a new war but would, in all p robability, also signal the end of the American mil itary presence in Japan. It is difficult to conceive of t he Japanese continuing to rely on continued U.S. de ployment on Japanese soil in the wake of an American abandonmen t of South Korea. Rapid Japanese rearmament would b e the most likely consequence, with broadly destabili zing consequences in the region as a whole. Korea's reunification, however, would also be l ikely to pose serious geopolitical dilemmas. If Ame rican forces were to remain in a reunified Korea, they wo uld inevitably be viewed by the Chinese as pointed against China. In fact, it is doubtful that the Chinese wou ld acquiesce in reunification under these circumsta nces. If that reunification were taking place by stages, involvin g a so-called soft landing, China would obstruct it politically and support those elements in North Korea that rema ined opposed to reunification. If that reunificatio n were taking place violently, with North Korea \"crash lan ding,\" even Chinese military intervention could not be precluded. From the Chinese perspective, a reunifie d Korea would be acceptable only if it is not simul taneously a direct extension of American power (with Japan in the background as its springboard). However, a reunified Korea without U.S. troops on its soil would be quite likely to gravitate firs t toward a form of neutrality between China and Japan and then gradually—driven in part by residual but still int ense anti- Japanese feelings—toward a Chinese sphere of either politically more assertive influence or somewhat m ore delicate deference. The issue would then arise as t o whether Japan would still be willing to serve as the only Asian base for American power. At the very least, t he issue would be most divisive within Japanese dom estic politics. Any resulting retraction in the scope of U.S. military reach in the Far East would in turn m ake the maintenance of a stable Eurasian balance of power m ore difficult. These considerations thus enhance th e American and Japanese stakes in the Korean status q uo (though in each case, for somewhat different rea sons), and if that status quo is to be altered, it must oc cur in very slow stages, preferably in a setting of a deepening American-Chinese regional accommodation. In the meantime, a true Japanese-Korean reconci liation would contribute significantly to a more st able regional setting for any eventual reunification. Th e various international complications that could en sue from Korean reintegration would be mitigated by a genuin e reconciliation between Japan and Korea, resulting in an increasingly cooperative and binding political rela tionship between these two countries. The United St ates could play the critical role in promoting that reco nciliation. Many specific steps that were taken to advance first the German-French reconciliation and later that bet ween Germany and Poland (for example, ranging from joint university programs eventually to combined military formations) could be adapted to this case. A comprehensive and regionally stabilizing Japanese-K orean partnership would, in turn, facilitate a cont inuing American presence in the Far East even perhaps afte r Korea's unification. It almost goes without saying that a close poli tical relationship with Japan is in America's globa l geostrategic interest. But whether Japan is to be America's vass al, rival, or partner depends on the ability of the Americans and Japanese to define more clearly what internatio nal goals the countries should seek in common and t o demarcate more sharply the dividing line between th e U.S. geostrategic mission in the Far East and Jap an's aspirations for a global role. For Japan, despite t he domestic debates about Japan's foreign policy, t he relationship with America still remains the central beacon for its own sense of international directio n. A disoriented Japan, lurching toward either rearmamen t or a separate accommodation with China, would spe ll the end of the American role in the Asia-Pacific region 7 and would foreclose the emergence of a regionally stable triangular arrangement involving America, Japan, an d China. That, in turn, would preclude the shaping of an American-managed political equilibrium throughout E urasia. In brief, a disoriented Japan would be like a be ached whale: thrashing around helplessly but danger ously. It could destabilize Asia, but it could not create a v iable alternative to the needed stabilizing balance among"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"America, Japan, and China. It is only through a clo se alliance with Japan that America will be able to accommodate China's regional aspirations and constr ain its more arbitrary manifestations. Only on that basis can an intricate three-way accommodation—one that i nvolves America's global power, China's regional preeminence, and Japan's international leadership—b e contrived. It follows that in the foreseeable future, reduc tion of the existing levels of U.S. forces in Japan (and, by extension, in Korea) is not desirable. By the same token, however, any significant increase in the geo political scope and the actual magnitude of the Japanese mili tary effort is also undesirable. A significant U.S. withdrawal would most probably prompt a major Japan ese armament program in the context of an unsettlin g strategic disorientation, whereas American pressure on Japan to assume a greater military role can onl y damage the prospects for regional stability, impede a wide r regional accommodation with a Greater China, dive rt Japan from undertaking a more constructive international mission, and thereby complicate the effort to foste r stable geopolitical pluralism throughout Eurasia. It also follows that Japan—if it is to turn its face to the world and away from Asia—must be given a meaningful incentive and a special status, so that its own national interest is thereby well served. U nlike China, which can^seek global power by first becoming a reg ional power, Japan can gain global influence by eschewing the quest for regional power. But that ma kes it all the more important for Japan to feel tha t it is America's special partner in a global vocation that is as politically satisfying as it is economically beneficial. To that end, the United States would do well to consid er the adoption of an American-Japanese free trade agreement, thereby creating a common American-Japan ese economic space. Such a step, formalizing the growing linkage between the two economies, would pr ovide the geopolitical underpinning both for Americ a's continued presence in the Ãàã Kasl and for Japan's constructive global engagement.\" 11. A strong case for this initiative, pointing out the mutual economic benefits thereof, is made by K urt Tong, \"Revolutionizing America's Japan Policy,\" Foreign P olicy (Winter 1996-1997). To conclude: For America, Japan should be its v ital and foremost partner in the construction of an increasingly cooperative and pervasive system of gl obal cooperation but not primarily its military all y in any regional arrangement designed to contest China's re gional preeminence. In effect, Japan should be Amer ica's global partner in tackling the new agenda of world affairs. A regionally preeminent China should becom e America's Far Eastern anchor in the more traditiona l domain of power politics, helping thereby to fost er a Eurasian balance of power, with Greater China in Eu rasia's East matching in that respect the role of a n enlarging Europe in Eurasia's West."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Chapter 7. Conclusion THE TIME HAS COME for the United States to formulat e and prosecute an integrated, comprehensive, and long-term geostrategy for all of Eurasia. This need arises out of the interaction between two fundamen tal realities: America is now the only global superpowe r, and Eurasia is the globe's central arena. Hence, what happens to the distribution of power on the Eurasia n continent will be of decisive importance to Ameri ca's global primacy and to America's historical legacy. American global primacy is unique in its scope a nd character. It is a hegemony of a new type that r eflects many of the features of the American democratic sys tem: it is pluralistic, permeable, and flexible. At tained in the course of less than a century, the principal ge opolitical manifestation of that hegemony is Americ a's unprecedented role on the Eurasian landmass, hither to the point of origin of all previous contenders f or global power. America is now Eurasia's arbiter, with no ma jor Eurasian issue soluble without America's partic ipation or contrary to America's interests. How the United States both manipulates and acco mmodates the principal geostrategic players on the Eurasian chessboard and how it manages Eurasia's ke y geopolitical pivots will be critical to the longe vity and stability of America's global primacy. In Europe, t he key players will continue to be France and Germa ny, and America's central goal should be to consolidate and expand the existing democratic bridgehead on Euras ia's western periphery. In Eurasia's Far East, China is likely to be increasingly central, and America will not have a political foothold on the Asian mainland unless an American-Chinese geostrategic consensus is successf ully nurtured. In the center of Eurasia, the space betwe en an enlarging Europe and a regionally rising Chin a will remain a geopolitical black hole at least until Rus sia resolves its inner struggle over its postim-per ial self- definition, while the region to the south of Russia —the Eurasian Balkans—threatens to become a cauldro n of ethnic conflict and great-power rivalry. In that context, for some time to come—for more than a generation—America's status as the world's premier power is unlikely to be contested by any single cha llenger. No nation-state is likely to match America in the four key dimensions of power (military, economic, t echnological, and cultural) that cumulatively produ ce decisive global political clout. Short of a deliber ate or unintentional American abdication, the only real alternative to American global leadership in the fo reseeable future is international anarchy. In that respect, it is correct to assert that America has become, as Presi dent Clinton put it, the world's \"indispensable nat ion.\" It is important to stress here both the fact of that indispensabil-ity and the actuality of the po tential for global anarchy. The disruptive consequences of population explosion, poverty-driven migration, radicalizing urbanization, ethnic and religious hostilities, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction w ould become unmanageable if the existing and underlying nation-state-based framework of even rudimentary geopolitical stability were itself to fragment. Wit hout sustained and directed American involvement, b efore long the forces of global disorder could come to do minate the world scene. And the possibility of such a fragmentation is inherent in the geopolitical tensi ons not only of today's Eurasia but of the world mo re generally. The resulting risks to global stability are like ly to be further increased by the prospect of a mor e general degradation of the human condition. Particularly in the poorer countries of the world, the demographic explosion and the simultaneous urbanization of thes e populations are rapidly generating a congestion n ot only of the disadvantaged but especially of the hundreds of millions of unemployed and increasingly restles s young, whose level of frustration is growing at an exponen tial rate. Modern communications intensify their ru pture with traditional authority, while making them incre asingly conscious—and resentful—of global inequalit y and thus more susceptible to extremist mobilization. On the one hand, the rising phenomenon of global migr ations, already reaching into the tens of millions, may act as a temporary safety valve, but on the other hand , it is also likely to serve as a vehicle for the transcontinent al conveyance of ethnic and social conflicts. The global stewardship that America has inherit ed is hence likely to be buffeted by turbulence, te nsion, and at least sporadic violence. The new and complex int ernational order, shaped by American hegemony and w ithin which \"the threat of war is off the table,\" is like ly to be restricted to those parts of the world whe re American"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"power has been reinforced by democratic sociopoliti cal systems and by elaborate external multilateral— but also American-dominated—frameworks. An American geostrategy for Eurasia will thus be competing with the forces of turbulence. In Europe , there are signs that the momentum for integration and enl argement is waning and that traditional European nationalisms may reawaken before long. Large-scale unemployment persists even in the most successful European states, breeding xenophobic reactions that could suddenly cause a lurch in French or German p olitics toward significant political extremism and inward-o riented chauvinism. Indeed, a genuinely prerevoluti onary situation could even be in the making. The historic al timetable for Europe, outlined in chapter 3, wil l be met only if Europe's aspirations for unity are both enc ouraged and even prodded by the United States. The uncertainties regarding Russia's future are even greater and the prospects for a positive evolu tion much more tenuous. It is therefore imperative for Americ a to shape a geopolitical context that is congenial to Russia's assimilation into a larger setting of growing Europ ean cooperation and that also fosters the self-reli ant independence of its newly sovereign neighbors. Yet the viability of, say, Ukraine or Uzbekistan (not t o speak of the ethnically bifurcated Kazakstan) will remain un certain, especially it American attention becomes d iverted by new internal crises in Europe, by a growing gap between Turkey and Europe, or by intensifying hosti lity in American-Iranian relations. The potential for an eventual grand accommodati on with China could also be aborted by a future cri sis over Taiwan; or because internal Chinese political dynam ics prompt the emergence of an aggressive and hosti le regime; or simply because American-Chinese relation s turn sour. China could then become a highly destabilizing force in the world, imposing enormous strains on the American-Japanese relationship and perhaps also generating a disruptive geopolitical disorient ation in Japan itself. In that setting, the stabili ty of Southeast Asia would certainly be at risk, and one can only s peculate how the confluence of these events would i mpact on the posture and cohesion of India, a country critic al to the stability of South Asia. These observations serve as a reminder that nei ther the new global problems that go beyond the sco pe of the nation-state nor more traditional geopolitical conc erns are likely to be resolved, or even contained, if the underlying geopolitical structure of global power b egins to crumble. With warning signs on the horizon across Europe and Asia, any successful American policy mus t focus on Eurasia as a whole and be guided by a geostrategic design. A GEOSTRATEGY FOR EURASIA The point of departure for the needed policy has to be hard-nosed recognition of the three unprecedent ed conditions that currently define the geopolitical s tate of world affairs: for the first time in histor y, (1) a single state is a truly global power, (2) a non-Eurasian s tate is globally the preeminent state, and (3) the globe's central arena, Eurasia, is dominated by a non-Eurasian powe r. However, a comprehensive and integrated geostra tegy for Eurasia must also be based on recognition of the limits of America's effective power and the inevita ble attrition over time of its scope. As rioted ear lier, the very scale and diversity of Eurasia, as well as the pote ntial power of some of its states, limit the depth of American ³ï ťťť ê ź íò and the degree of control over the course of eve nts. This condition places a premium on geostrategi c Insight and on the deliberately selective deploymen t of America's resources on the huge Eurasian chess board. And since America's unprecedented power is bound to diminish over time, the priority must be to manage the rise of other regional powers in ways that do not t hreaten America's global primacy. As in chess, American global planners must think several moves ahead, anticipating possible counter moves. A sustainable geostrategy must therefore distinguis h between the short-run perspective (the next five or so years), the middle term (up to twenty or so years), and the long run (beyond twenty years). Moreover, these phases must be viewed not as watertight compartment s but as part of a continuum. The first phase must gradually and consistently lead into the second—ind eed, be deliberately pointed toward it—and the seco nd must then lead subsequently into the third."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" In the short run, it is in America's interest to consolidate and perpetuate the prevailing geopolit ical pluralism on the map of Eurasia. That puts a premium on maneu ver and manipulation in order to prevent the emerge nce of a hostile coalition that could eventually seek t o challenge America's primacy, not to mention the r emote possibility of any one particular state seeking to do so. By the middle term, the foregoing should gra dually yield to a greater emphasis on the emergence of increasin gly important but strategically compatible partners who, prompted by American leadership, might help to shap e a more cooperative trans-Eurasian security system . Eventually, in the much longer run still, the foreg oing could phase into a global core of genuinely sh ared political responsibility. The most immediate task is Jo make certain that no state or combination of states gains the capacit y to expel the United States from Eurasia or even to diminish significantly its decisive arbitrating role. Howeve r, the consolidation of transcontinental geopolitical plur alism should not be viewed as an end in itself but only as a means to achieve the middle-term goal of shaping ge nuine strategic partnerships in the key regions of Eurasia. It is unlikely that democratic America will wish to be permanently engaged in the difficult, absorbing , and costly task of managing Eurasia by constant manipul ation and maneuver, backed by American military resources, in order to prevent regional domination by any one power. The first phase must, therefore, logically and deliberately lead into the second, one in which a benign American hegemony still discourages other s from posing a challenge not only by making the costs of the challenge too high but also by not threatening the vital interests of Eurasia's potential regional aspirants . What that requires specifically, as the middle- term goal, is the fostering of genuine partnerships , predominant among them those with a more united and politically defined Europe and with a regionally preeminent Ch ina, as well as with (one hopes) a postimpe-rial and Eur ope-oriented Russia and, on the southern fringe of Eurasia, with a regionally stabilizing and democratic India. But it will be the success or failure of the effor t to forge broader strategic relationships with Europe and Chi na, respectively, that will shape the defining cont ext for Russia's role, either positive or negative. It follows that a wider Europe and an enlarged NATO will serve well both the short-term and the lo nger-term goals of U.S. policy. A larger Europe will expand t he range of American influence—and, through the adm ission of new Central European members, also increase in t he European councils the number of states with a pr o- American proclivity—without simultaneously creating a Europe politically so integrated that it could s oon challenge the United States on geopolitical matters of high importance to America elsewhere, particula rly in the Middle East. A politically defined Europe is also e ssential to the progressive assimilation of Russia into a system of global cooperation. Admittedly, America cannot on its own generate a more united Europe—that is up to the Europeans, especially the French and the Germans—but America c an obstruct the emergence of a more united Europe. And that could prove calamitous for stability in Eurasi a and thus also for America's own interests. Indeed , unless Europe becomes more united, it is likely to become more disunited again. Accordingly, as stated earlie r, it is vital that America work closely with both France an d Germany in seeking a Europe that is politically v iable, a Europe that remains linked to the United States, an d a Europe that widens the scope of the cooperative democratic international system. Making a choice be tween France and Germany is not the issue. Without either France or Germany, there will be no Europe, and wit hout Europe there will be no trans-Eurasian system. In practical terms, the foregoing will require gradual accommodation to a shared leadership in NAT O, greater acceptance of France's concerns for a Europ ean role not only in Africa but also in the Middle East, and continued support for the eastward expansion of the EU, even as the EU becomes a more politically and economically assertive global player.1 A Transatlan tic Free Trade Agreement, already advocated by a nu mber of prominent Atlantic leaders, could also mitigate the risk of growing economic rivalry between a more united EU and the United States. In any case, the EU's eve ntual success in burying the centuries-old European nationalist antagonisms, with their globally disrup tive effects, would be well worth some gradual dimi nution in America's decisive role as Eurasia's current arbitr ator. 1. A number of constructive proposals to that end w ere advanced at the CSIS (Center for International and Strategic Studies) Conference on America and Europe , held in Brussels in February 1997. They ranged fr om joint efforts at structural reform, designed to red uce government deficits, to the development of an e nhanced"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"European defense industrial base, which would enhan ce transatlantic defense collaboration and a greate r European role in NATO. A useful list of similar and other initiatives, meant to generate a greater Eur opean role, is contained in David C. Gompert and F. Stepl uMi Larrabee, eds., America and Europe: A Partnersh ip for a New Era (Santa Monica, Calif.: RAND, 1997). The enlargement of NATO and the EU would serve t o reinvigo-rate Europe's own waning sense of a larg er vocation, while consolidating, to the benefit of bo th America and Europe, the democratic gains won thr ough the successful termination of the Cold War. At stake in this effort is nothing less than America's long-ra nge relationship with Europe itself. A new Europe is st ill taking shape, and if that new Europe is to rema in geopolitically a part of the \"Euro-Atlantic\" space, the expansion of NATO is essential. By the same to ken, a failure to widen NATO, now that the commitment has been made, would shatter the concept of an expandin g Europe and demoralize the Central Europeans. It cou ld even reignite currently dormant or dying Russian geopolitical aspirations in Central Europe. Indeed, the failure of the American-led effort t o expand NATO could reawaken even more ambitious Ru ssian desires. It is not yet evident—and the historical r ecord is strongly to the contrary that the Russian political elite shares Europe's desire for a strongand enduring Ame rican political and military presence. Therefore, w hile the fostering of an increasingly cooperative relationsh ip with Russia is clearly desirable, it is importan t for America to send a clear message about its global priorities . If a choice has to be made between a larger Euro- Atlantic system and a better relationship with Russia, the f ormer has to rank incomparably higher to America. For that reason, any accommodation with Russia on the issue of NATO enlargement should not entail an outcome that has the effect of making Russia a de f acto decision-making member of the alliance, thereb y diluting NATO's special Euro-Atlantic character whi le simultaneously relegating its newly admitted mem bers to second-class status. That would create opportuni ties for Russia to resume not only the effort to re gain a sphere of influence in Central Europe but to use it s presence within NATO to play on any American-Euro pean disagreements in order to reduce the American role in European affairs. It is also crucial that, as Central Europe ente rs NATO, any new security assurances to Russia rega rding the region be truly reciprocal and thus mutually reassu ring. Restrictions on the deployment of NATO troops and nuclear weapons on the soil of new members can be a n important factor in allaying legitimate Russian concerns, but these should be matched by symmetrica l Russian assurances regarding the demilitarization of the potentially strategically menacing salient of Kalin ingrad and by limits on major troop deployments nea r the borders of the prospective new members of NATO and the EU. While all of Russia's newly independent western neighbors are anxious to have a stable and cooperative relationship with Russia, the fact is t hat they continue to fear it for historically understandable reasons. Hence, the emergence of an equitable NATO /EU accommodation with Russia would be welcomed by all Europeans as a signal that Russia is finally making the much-desired postimperial choice in favor of Europe . That choice could pave the way for a wider effor t to enhance Russia's status and esteem. Formal mem bership in the G-7, as well as the upgrading of the policy- making machinery of the OSCE (within which a specia l security committee composed of America, Russia, and several key European countries could be establishe d), would create opportunities for constructive Russian engagement in shaping both the political and secur ity dimensions of Europe. Coupled with ongoing Western financial assistance to Russia, along with the development of much more ambitious schemes for link ing Russia more closely to Europe through new highw ay and railroad networks, the process of giving substa nce to a Russian choice in favor of Europe could mo ve forward significantly. Russia's longer-term role in Eurasia will depen d largely on the historic choice that Russia has to make, perhaps still in the course of this decade, regardi ng its own self-definition. Even with Europe and Ch ina increasing the radius of their respective regional influence, Russia will remain in charge of the worl d's largest single piece of real estate. It spans ten time zone s and is territorially twice as large as either the United States or China, dwarfing in that regard even an enlarged Eur ope. Hence, territorial deprivation is not Russia's central problem. Rather, the huge Russia has to face square ly and draw the proper implications from the fact t hat both Europe and China are already economically more powe rful and that China is also threatening to outpace Russia on the road to social modernization."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" In these circumstances, it should become more e vident to the Russian political elite that Russia's first priority is to modernize itself rather than to engage in a f utile effort to regain its former status as a globa l power. Given the enormous size and diversity of the country, a d ecentralized political system, based on the free ma rket, would be more likely to unleash the creative potent ial of both the Russian people and the country's va st natural resources. In turn, such a more decentralized Russi a would be less susceptible to imperial mobilizatio n. A loosely confederated Russia—composed of a European Russia, a Siberian Republic, and a Far Eastern Republic—would also find it easier to cultivate clo ser economic relations with Europe, with the new st ates of Central Asia, and with the Orient, which would ther eby accelerate Russia's own development. Each of th e three confederated entities would also be more able to ta p local creative potential, stifled for centuries b y Moscow's heavy bureaucratic hand. A clear choice by Russia in favor of the Europea n option over the imperial one will be more likely if America successfully pursues the second imperative strand o f its strategy toward Russia: namely, reinforcing t he prevailing geopolitical pluralism in the post-Sovie t space. Such reinforcement will serve to discourag e any imperial temptations. A postimperial and Europe-ori ented Russia should actually view American efforts to that end as helpful in consolidating regional stability and in reducing the possibility of conflicts along its new, potentially unstable southern frontiers. But the po licy of consolidating geopolitical pluralism should not be conditioned on the existence of a good relationship with Russia. Rather, it is also important insuranc e in case such a good relationship fails to develop, as it cr eates impediments to the reemergence of any truly t hreatening Russian imperial policy. It follows that political and economic support for the key newly independent states is an integral part of a broader strategy for Eurasia. The consolidation of a sovereign Ukraine, which in the meantime redefine s itself as a Central European state and engages in closer i ntegration with Central Europe, is a critically imp ortant component of such a policy, as is the fostering of a closer relationship with such strategically pivot al states as Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan, in addition to the more generalized effort to open up Central Asia (in spit e of Russian impediments) to the global economy. Large-scale international investment in an incr easingly accessible Caspian-Central Asian region wo uld not only help to consolidate the independence of its ne w countries but in the long run would also benefit a postimperial and democratic Russia. The tapping of the region's energy and mineral resources would gen erate prosperity, prompting a greater sense of stability and security in the area, while perhaps also reduci ng the risks of Balkan-type conflicts. The benefits of accelerat ed regional development, funded by external investm ent, would also radiate to the adjoining Russian provinc es, which tend to be economically underdeveloped. Moreover, once the region's new ruling elites come to realize that Russia acquiesces in the region's i ntegration into the global economy, they will become less fear ful of the political consequences of close economic relations with Russia. In time, a nonimperial Russia could th us gain acceptance as the region's preeminent econo mic partner, even though no longer its imperial ruler. To promote a stable and independent southern Cau casus and Central Asia, America must be careful not to alienate Turkey and should explore whether an impro vement in American-Iranian relations is feasible. A Turkey that feels thai it is an outcast from Europe , which it has been seeking to join, will become a more Islamic Turkey, more likely to veto the enlargement of NATO out of spite and less likely to cooperate with the West in seeking both to stabilize and integrate a s ecular Central Asia into the world community. Accordingly, America should use its influence in Europe to encourage Turkey's eventual admission to the EU and should make a point of treating Turkey as a Eur opean state—provided internal Turkish politics do n ot take a dramatic turn in the Islamist direction. Regular consultations with Ankara regarding the future of t he Caspian Sea basin and Central Asia would foster in Turkey a sense of strategic partnership with the United Sta tes. America should also strongly support Turkish aspira tions to have a pipeline from Baku in Azerbaijan to Ceyhan on the Turkish Mediterranean coast serve as major o utlet for the Caspian Sea basin energy sources. In addition, it is not in America's interest to perpetuate American-Iranian hostility. Any eventual reconciliation should be based on the recognition o f a mutual strategic interest in stabilizing what c urrently is a very volatile regional environment for Iran. Admitt edly, any such reconciliation must be pursued by bo th sides and is not a favor granted by one to the other.

In the meantime, American long-range interests in Eura sia would be better served by abandoning existing U .S. objections to closer Turkish-Iranian economic coope ration, especially in the construction of new pipel ines, and also to the construction of other links between Ira n, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan. Long-term American participation in the financing of such projects wou ld in fact also beJn the American interest.2 2. It is appropriate to quote here the wise advice offered by my colleague at CSIS, Anthony H. Cordesm an (in his paper on \"The American Threat to the United Sta tes,\" February 1997, p. 16, delivered as a speech t o the Army War College), who has warned against the Ameri can propensity to demonize issues and even nations. As he put it: \"Iran, Iraq, and Libya are cases where t he U.S. has taken hostile regimes that pose real, b ut limited threats and 'de-monized' them without developing an y workable mid- to long-term end game for its strat egy. U.S. planners cannot hope to totally isolate these states, and it makes no sense to treat them as if t hey were identical 'rogue' or 'terrorist' states. ... The U. S. lives in a morally gray world and cannot succeed by trying to make il black and white.\" India's potential role needs also to be highlig hted, although it is currently a relatively passive player on the Eurasian scene. India is contained geopolitically b y the Chinese-Pakistani coalition, while a weak Rus sia cannot offer it the political support once provided by the Soviet Union. However, the survival of its democra cy is of importance in that it refutes better than volumes o f academic debate the notion that human rights and democracy are purely a parochial Western manifestat ion. India proves that antidemocratic \"Asian values ,\" propagated by spokesmen from Singapore to China, ar e simply antidemocratic but not necessarily charact eristic of Asia. India's failure, by the same token, would be a blow to the prospects for democracy and would remove from the scene a power that contributes to greater balance on the Asian scene, especially given China' s rise to geopolitical preeminence. It follows that a progres sive engagement of India in discussions pertaining to regional stability, especially regarding the future of Central Asia, is becoming timely, not to mentio n the promotion of more directly bilateral connections be tween American and Indian defense communities. Geopolitical pluralism in Eurasia as a whole wi ll neither be attainable nor stable without a deepe ning strategic understanding between America and China. It follows that a policy of engaging China in a ser ious strategic dialogue, eventually perhaps in a three-w ay effort that involves Japan as well, is the neces sary first step in enhancing China's interest in an accommodat ion with America that reflects the several geopolit ical interests (especially in Northeast Asia and in Cent ral Asia) the two countries in fact share in common . It also behooves America to eliminate any uncertainties reg arding America's own commitment to the one-China policy, lest the Taiwan issue fester and worsen, es pecially after China's absorption of Hong Kong. By the same token, it is in China's own interest to make that a bsorption a successful demonstration of the princip le that even a Greater China can tolerate and safeguard increase d diversity in its internal political arrangements. While—as argued earlier in chapters 4 and 6—any would-be Chinese-Russian-Iranian coalition against America is unlikely to jell beyond some occasional tactical posturing, it is important for the United Stales to deal with China in a fashion that floes not drive B eijing in that direction. In any such \"antihegemoni c\" alliance, China would be the linchpin. It would be the strong est, the most dynamic, and thus the leading compone nt. Such a coalition could only emerge around a disaffe cted, frustrated, and hostile China. Neither Russia nor Iran has the wherewithal to be the central magnet for su ch a coalition. An American-Chinese strategic dialogue regarding the areas that both countries desire to see free o f domination by other aspiring hegemons is therefore imperative. But to make progress, the dialogue shou ld be sustained and serious. In the course of such commun ication, more contentious issues pertaining to Taiw an and even to human rights could then be addressed more p ersuasively. Indeed, the point can be made quite cr edibly that the issue of China's internal liberalization i s not a purely domestic Chinese affair, since only a democratizing and prosperous China has any prospect of peacefully enticing Taiwan. Any attempt at forc ible reunification would not only place the American-Chi nese relationship in jeopardy but would inevitably generate adverse consequences for China's capacity to attract foreign capital and sustain its developm ent. China's own aspirations to regional preeminence and global status would thereby be victimized. Although China is emerging as a regionally domin ant power, it is not likely to become a global one for a long time to come (for reasons stated in chapter 6)—and paranoiac fears of China.as a global power are bree ding"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"megalomania in China, while perhaps also becoming t he source of a self-fulfilling prophesy of intensif ied American-Chinese hostility. Accordingly, China shou ld be neither contained nor propitiated. It should be treated with respect as the world's largest develop ing state, and—so far at least—a rather successful one. Its geopolitical role not only in the Far East but in E urasia as a whole is likely to grow as well. Hence, it would make sense to coopt China into the G-7 annual summi t of the world's leading countries, especially sinc e Russia's inclusion has widened the summit's focus f rom economics to politics. As China becomes more integrated into the world system and hence less able and less inclined to exp loit its regional primacy in a politically obtuse fashion, i t also follows that a de facto emergence of a Chine se sphere of deference in areas of historic Interest to China is likely to be part of the emerging Kurasian slriicl ure of geopolitical accommodation. Whether a united Korea will oscillate toward such a sphere depends much on the degree of Japanese-Korean reconciliation (which Ame rica should more actively encourage), but in any ca se, the reunification of Korea without an accommodation wit h China is unlikely. A Greater China at some point will inevitably p ress for a resolution of the issue of Taiwan, but t he degree of China's inclusion in an increasingly binding set of international economic and political links may als o have a positive impact on the nature of Chinese domestic p olitics. If China's absorption of Hong Kong proves not to be repressive, Deng's formula for Taiwan of \"one count ry, two systems\" can become redefined as \"one count ry, several systems.\" That might make reunification mor e acceptable to the parties concerned—which again reinforces the point that without some political ev olution of China itself, a peaceful reconstitution of one China will not be possible. In any case, for historic as well as geopolitic al reasons, China should consider America its natur al ally. Unlike Japan or Russia, America has never had any t erritorial designs on China; and, unlike Great Brit ain, it never humiliated China. Moreover, without a viable strategic consensus with America, China is not like ly to be able to keep attracting the massive foreign investm ent so necessary to its economic growth and thus al so to its attainment of regional preeminence. For the same re ason, without an American-Chinese strategic accommodation as the eastern anchor of America's in volvement in Eurasia, America will not have a geost rategy for mainland Asia; and without a geostrategy for ma inland Asia, America will not have a geostrategy fo r Eurasia. Thus for America, China's regional power, co-opted into a wider framework of international cooperation, can be a vitally important geostrategi c asset—in that regard coequally important with Eur ope and more weighty than Japan—in assuring Eurasia's stabi lity. However, unlike the European situation, a democ ratic bridgehead on the eastern mainland will not e merge soon. That makes it all the more important that Ame rica's efforts to nurture a deepening strategic rel ationship with China be based on the unambiguous acknowledgme nt that a democratic and economically successful Japan Is America's premier Pacific and key global p artner. A1though Japan cannot become a dominant Asi an regional power, given the strong regional aversion it evokes, it can become a leading international on e. Tokyo can carve out a globally influential role by cooper ating closely with the United States regarding what might be called the new agenda of global concerns, while avo iding any futile and potentially counterproductive effort to become a regional power itself. The task of America n statesmanship should hence be to steer Japan in t hat direction. An American-Japanese free trade agreemen t, creating a common economic space, would fortify the connection and promote the goal, and hence its util ity should be jointly examined. It is through a close political relationship wit h Japan that America will more safely be able to ac commodate China's regional aspirations, while opposing its mo re arbitrary manifestations. Only on that basis can an intricate three-way accommodation—one that involves America's global power, China's regional preeminen ce, and Japan's international leadership—be contrived. However, that broad geostrategic accommodation coul d be undermined by an unwise expansion of American-Japan ese military cooperation. Japan's central role shou ld not be that of America's unsinkable aircraft carrier in the Far East, nor should it be America's principal Asian military partner or a potential Asian regional powe r. Misguided efforts to promote any of the foregoin g would serve to cut America off from the Asian mainland, t o vitiate the prospects for reaching a strategic co nsensus with China, and thus to frustrate America's capacit y to consolidate stable geopolitical pluralism thro ughout Eurasia. "},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"A TRANS-EURASIAN SECURITY SYSTEM The stability of Eurasia's geopolitical pluralism, precluding the appearance of a single dominant powe r, would be enhanced by the eventual emergence, perhaps some time early in the next century, of a Trans-Eurasian Security System (TESS). Such a transcontinental sec urity agreement should embrace an expanded NATO— connected by a cooperative charter with Russia—and China as well as Japan (which would still be connec ted to the United States by the bilateral security treaty) . But to get there, NATO must first expand, while e ngaging Russia in a larger regional framework of security c ooperation. In addition, the Americans and Japanese must closely consult and collaborate in setting in motio n a triangular political-security dialogue in the F ar East that engages China. Three-way American-Japanese-Chinese security talks could eventually involve more Asian participants and later lead to a dialogue between t hem and the Organization for Security and Cooperati on in Europe. In turn, such a dialogue could pave the way for a series of conferences by all European and As ian states, thereby beginning the process of institutio nalizing a transcontinental security system. In time, a more formal structure could begin to take shape, prompting the emergence of a Trans-Eur asian Security System that for the first time would span the entire continent. The shaping of that system—de nning its substance and then institutionalizing it— could bec ome the major architectural initiative of the next decade, once the policies outlined earlier have created the necessary preconditions. Such a broad transcontine ntal security framework could also contain a standing se curity committee, composed of the major Eurasian en tities, in order to enhance TESS's ability to promote effec tive cooperation on issues critical to global stabi lity. America, Europe, China, Japan, a confederated Russi a, and India, as well as perhaps some other countri es, might serve together as the core of such a more str uctured transcontinental system. The eventual emerg ence of TESS could gradually relieve America of some of its burdens, even while perpetuating its decisive role as Eurasia's stabilizer and arbitrator. BEYOND THE LAST GLOBAL SUPERPOWER In the long run, global politics are bound to becom e increasingly uncongenial to the concentration of hegemonic power in the hands of a single state. Hen ce, America is not only the first, as well as the o nly, truly global superpower, but it is also likely to be the very last. That is so not only because nation-states are gr adually becoming increasingly permeable but also be cause knowledge as power is becoming more diffuse, more s hared, and less constrained by national boundaries. Economic' power is also likely to become more dispe rsed. In the years to come, no single power is like ly to reach the level of 30 percent or so of the world's GDP that America sustained throughout much of this century, not to speak of the 50 percent at which it crested in 1945. Some estimates suggest that by the end of this decade, America will still account for about 20 percent of global GDP, declining perhaps to about 10-15 percen t by 2020 as other powers—Europe, China, Japan—increase their relative share to more or less the American l evel. But global economic preponderance by a single entit y, of the sort that America attained in the course of this century, is unlikely, and that has obviously far-re aching military and political implications. Moreover, the very multinational and exceptiona l character of American society has made it easier for America to universalize its hegemony without lettin g it appear to be a strictly national one. For exam ple, an effort by China to seek global primacy would inevit ably be viewed by others as an attempt to impose a national hegemony. To put it very simply, anyone can become an American, but only a Chinese can be Chinese—and that places an additional and significant barrier i n the way of any essentially national global hegemo ny. Accordingly, once American leadership begins to fade, America's current global predominance is unli kely to be replicated by any single state. Thus, the key qu estion for the future is \"What will America bequeat h to the world as the enduring legacy of its primacy?\" The answer depends in part on how long that pri macy lasts and on how energetically America shapes a framework of key power partnerships that over time can be more formally institutionalized. In fact, th e window ofTiistorical opportunity for America's constructiv e exploitation of its global power could prove to b e relatively brief, for both domestic and external reasons.

The pursuit of power and e specially the economic costs and human sacrifice th at the"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"exercise of such power often requires are not gener ally congenial to democratic instincts. Democratiza tion is inimical to imperial mobilization. Indeed, the critical uncertainty regarding the f uture may well be whether America might become the first superpower unable or unwilling to wield its power. Might it become an impotent global power? Public op inion polls suggest thai only a small minority (13 percen t) of Americans favor the proposition that \"as the sole remaining superpower, the U.S. should continue to b e the preeminent world leader in solving internatio nal problems.\" An overwhelming majority (74 percent) pr efer that America \"do its fair share in efforts to solve international problems together with other countrie s.\"3 3. \"An Emerging Consensus—A Study of American Publi c Attitudes on America's Role in the World\" (Colleg e Park: Center for International and Security Studies at the University of Maryland, July 1996). It is n oteworthy, but not inconsistent with the foregoing, that studi es by the above center, conducted in early 1997 (un der principal investigator Steven Kull), also showed a considerable majority in favor of NATO expansion (6 2 percent in favor, with 27 percent strongly in favor ; and only 29 percent against, with 14 percent stro ngly against). Moreover, as America becomes an increasingly mu lticultural society, it may find it more difficult to fashion a consensus on foreign policy issues, except in the circumstances of a truly massive and widely percei ved direct external threat. Such a consensus generally existed throughout World War II and even during the Cold W ar. It was rooted, however, not only in deeply shared demo cratic values, which the public sensed were being threatened, but also in a cultural and ethnic affin ity for the predominantly European victims of hosti le totalitarianisms. In the absence of a comparable external challen ge, American society may find it much more difficul t to reach agreement regarding foreign policies that cannot be directly related to central beliefs and widely sha red cultural-ethnic sympathies and that still require a n enduring and sometimes costly imperial engagement . If anything, two extremely varying views on the implic ations of America's historic victory in the Cold Wa r are likely to be politically more appealing: on the one hand, the view that the end of the Cold War justif ies a significant reduction in America's global engagemen t, irrespective of the consequences for America's g lobal standing; and on the other, the perception that the time has come for genuine international multilater alism, to which America should even yield some of its soverei gnty. Both extremes command the loyalty of committe d constituencies. More generally, cultural change in America may also be uncongenial to the sustained exercise abroad of genuinely imperial power. That exercise requires a high degree of doctrinal motivation, intellectual commitment, and patriotic gratification. Yet the do minant culture of the country has become increasing ly fixated on mass entertainment that has been heavily dominated by personally hedonistic and socially es capist themes. The cumulative effect has made it increasin gly difficult to mobilize the needed political cons ensus on behalf of sustained, and also occasionally costly, American leadership abroad. Mass communications hav e been playing a particularly important role in that regar d, generating a strong revulsion against any select ive use of force that entails even low levels of casualties. In addition, both America and Western Europe hav e been finding it difficult to cope with the cultur al consequences of social hedonism and the dramatic de cline in the centrality of religious-based values i n society. (The parallels with the decline of the imperial sys tems summarized in chapter 1 are striking in that r espect.) The resulting cultural crisis has been compounded by th e spread of drugs and, especially in America, by it s linkage to the racial issue. Lastly, the rate of economic g rowth is no longer able to keep up with growing mat erial expectations, with the latter stimulated by a cultu re that places a premium on consumption. It is no e xaggeration to state that a sense of historical anxiety, perhap s even of pessimism, is becoming palpable in the mo re articulate sectors of Western society. Almost half a century ago, a noted historian, Ha ns Kohn, having observed the tragic experience of t he two world wars and the debilitating consequences of the totalitarian challenge, worried that the West may have become \"fatigued and exhausted.\" Indeed, he feared that"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"[t]wentieth century man has become less confident t han his nineteenth century ancestor was.

The Twcntntirth Century (New York: 19 49), p. 53. That lack of confidence has been intensified by widespread disappointment with the consequences of the end of the Cold War. Instead of a \"new world order\" bas ed on consensus and harmony, \"things which seemed t o belong to the past\" have all of a sudden become the future. Although ethnic-national conflicts may no longer pose the risk of a central war, they do threaten th e peace in significant parts of the globe. Thus, wa r is not likely to become obsolete for some time to come. With the more-endowed nations constrained by their own highe r technological capacity for self-destruction as well as by self-interest, war may have become a luxury that only the poor peoples of this world can afford. In the f oreseeable future, the impoverished two-thirds of h umanity may not be motivated by the restraint of the privil eged. It is also noteworthy that international confli cts and acts of terrorism have so far been remarkab ly devoid of any use of the weapons of mass destruction. How lon g that self-restraint may hold is inherently unpred ictable, but the increasing availability, not only to states but also to organized groups, of the means to infl ict massive casualties—by the use of nuclear or bacteriological weapons—also inevitably increases the probability of their employment. In brief, America as the world's premier power does face a narrow window of historical opportunity . The present moment of relative global peace may be shor t lived. This prospect underlines the urgent need f or an American engagement in the world that is deliberate ly focused on the enhancement of international geop olitical stability and that is capable of reviving in the We st a sense of historical optimism. That optimism re quires the demonstrated capacity to deal simultaneously with i nternal social and external geopolitical challenges . However, the rekindling of Western optimism and the universal-ism of the West's values are not exc lusively dependent on America and Europe. Japan and India de monstrate that the notions of human rights and the centrality of the democratic experiment can be vali d in Asian settings as well, both in highly develop ed ones and in those that are still only developing. The co ntinued democratic success of Japan and India is, t herefore, also of enormous importance in sustaining a more co nfident perspective regarding the future political shape of the globe. Indeed, their experience, as well as tha t of South Korea and Taiwan, suggests that China's continued economic growth, coupled with pressures from outsid e for change generated by greater international inc lusion, might perhaps also lead to the progressive democrat ization of the Chinese system. Meeting these challenges is America's burden as well as its unique responsibility. Given the reali ty of American democracy, an effective response will requ ire generating a public understanding of the contin uing importance of American power in shaping a widening framework of stable geopolitical cooperation, one t hat simultaneously averts global anarchy and successful ly defers the emergence of a new power challenge. T hese two goals—averting global anarchy and impeding the emergence of a power rival—are inseparable from the longer-range definition of the purpose of America's global engagement, namely, that of forging an endu ring framework of global geopolitical cooperation. Unfortunately, to date, efforts to spell out a new central and worldwide objective for the United States, in the wake of the termination of the Cold War, have been one-dimensional. They have failed to link the need to improve the human condition with the imperative of preserving the centrality of American power in worl d affairs. Several such recent attempts can be identi fied. During the first two years of the Clinton adm inistration, the advocacy of \"assertive multilateralism\" did not sufficiently take into account the basic realities of contemporary power. Later on, the alternative empha sis on the notion that America should focus on glob al \"democratic enlargement\" did not adequately take in to account the continuing importance to America of maintaining global stability or even of promoting s ome expedient (but regrettably not \"democratic\") po wer relationships, as with China."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" As the central U.S. priority, more narrowly focu sed appeals have been even less satisfactory, such as those concentrating on the elimination of prevailing inju stice in the global distribution of income, on shap ing a special \"mature strategic partnership\" with Russia, or on containing weapons proliferation. Other alte rnatives— that America should concentrate on safeguarding the environment or, more narrowly, on combating local wars—have also tended to ignore the central realiti es of global power. As a result, none of the forego ing formulations have fully addressed the need to creat e minimal global geopolitical stability as the esse ntial foundation for the simultaneous protraction of Amer ican hegemony and the effective aversion of interna tional anarchy. In brief, the U.S. policy goal must be unapolog etically twofold: to perpetuate America's own domin ant position for at least a generation and preferably l onger still; and to create a geopolitical framework that can absorb the inevitable shocks and strains of social- political change while evolving into the geopolitic al core of shared responsibility for peaceful global managemen t. A prolonged phase of gradually expanding coopera tion with key Eurasian partners, both stimulated and arb itrated by America, can also help to foster the pre conditions for an eventual upgrading of the existing and incre asingly antiquated UN structures. A new distributio n of responsibilities and privileges can then take into account the changed realities of global power, so d rastically different from those of 1945. These efforts will have the added historical ad vantage of benefiting from the new web of global li nkages that is growing exponentially outside the more tradition al nation-state system. That web—woven by multinati onal corporations, NGOs (nongovernmental organizations, with many of them transnational in character) and scientific communities and reinforced by the Intern et—already creates an informal global system that i s inherently congenial to more institutionalized and inclusive global cooperation. In the course of the next several decades, a fu nctioning structure of global cooperation, based on geopolitical realities, could thus emerge and gradually assume t he mantle of the world's current \"regent,\" which ha s for the time being assumed the burden of responsibility for world stability and peace. Geostrategic success in that cause would represent a fitting legacy of America's role as the first, only, and last truly global sup erpower."}]
