Writing about the highereducation in America, he does not observe the forms, manners and ceremonies ofwhat is called (usually by itself) the community of scholars. Yet hiscredentials are irreproachable. He is the author of an excellent book onShakespeare’s politics, and has translated Plato’s Republic and Rousseau’sEmile. It will be difficult for nettled colleagues to wave him away, and manywill want to do just that, for he is shrewd and mettlesome, as well as learned,and a great observer of what Mencken would call, when he was being mean, “thehigher learning.”But Professor Bloom is neither a debunker nor a satirist, and his conception ofseriousness carries him far beyond the positions of academia. He is notaddressing himself primarily to the professors. They are welcome to listen—andthey will listen because they come under heavy fire—but he places himself in alarger community, invoking Socrates, Plato, Machiavelli, Rousseau and Kant moreoften than he does our contemporaries: “The real community of man, in the midstof all the self-contradictory simulacra of community, is the community of thosewho seek the truth, of the potential knowers … of all men to the extent theydesire to know. But in fact, this includes only a few, the true friends, asPlato was to Aristotle at the very moment they were disagreeing about the natureof the good. … They were absolutely one soul as they looked at the problem.This, according to Plato, is the only real friendship, the only real commongood. It is here that the contact people so desperately seek is to be found. …This is the meaning of the riddle of the improbable philosopher-kings. They havea true community that is exemplary for all the other communities.”A style of this sort will seem to modern readers marred by classicalstiffness—“Truth,” “Knowers,” “the Good,” “Man”—but we can by no means deny thatbehind our objection to such language is a guilty consciousness of theflimsiness, and not infrequently the trashiness, of our modern talk about“values.”The sentences above are taken from the conclusion of Bloom’s book. Parting fromhis readers, he is at his most earnest. He writes in a different vein when he isdiscussing the power of professional economists, the separation of modernscience from the “natural philosophy” that preceded it, the phenomenon called“cultural relativism,” or the real, the bottom-line, significance of an M.B.A.degree. He often flashes out provocatively and wickedly. Speaking of the placeof the humanities in the universities, he calls them a “submerged old Atlantis,”to which we turn again to try to “find ourselves now that everybody else hasgiven up.” “The humanities are like the great old Paris Flea Market where,amidst masses of junk, people with a good eye found cast away treasures. …” Orelse, “They are like a refugee camp where all the geniuses driven out of theirjobs and countries by unfriendly regimes are idling: … The other two divisionsof the university have no use for the past …” When he is not busy with thenature of the Good, he can hit, with the best (or should I say the worst) ofthem, very hard. As a scholar he intends to enlighten us, and as a writer he haslearned from Aristophanes and other models that enlightenment should also beenjoyable. To me, this is not the book of a professor, but that of a thinker whois willing to take the risks more frequently taken by writers. It is risky in abook of ideas to speak in one’s own voice, but it reminds us that the sources ofthe truest truths are inevitably profoundly personal. Bloom tells us:“Throughout this book I have referred to Plato’s Republic, which is for me thebook on education, because it really explains to me what I experience as a manand a teacher.” Academics, even those describing themselves as existentialists,very seldom offer themselves publicly and frankly as individuals, as persons. SoProfessor Bloom is a front-line fighter in the mental wars of our times, and assuch, singularly congenial to me. (If he can be personal, I see no reason why Ishould remain the anonymous commentator.)In his concluding pages, Bloom tells of a student who, after a reading of theSymposium, said that it was hard today to imagine the magic Athenian atmosphere,“in which friendly men, educated, lively, on a footing of equality, civilizedbut natural, came together and told wonderful stories about the meaning of theirlonging. But [adds Bloom] such experiences are always accessible. Actually, thisplayful discussion took place in the midst of a terrible war that Athens wasdestined to lose, and Aristophanes and Socrates at least could foresee that thismeant the decline of Greek civilization. But they were not given to culturedespair, and in these terrible political circumstances, their abandon to the joyof nature proved the viability of what is best in man, independent of accidents,of circumstance. We feel ourselves too dependent on history and culture…. Whatis essential about … any of the Platonic dialogues is reproducible in almost alltimes and places…. This thinking might be what it is all for. That’s where weare beginning to fail. But it is right under our noses, improbable but alwayspresent.”I take this statement very seriously and am greatly moved by it, seeing in itthe seed from which my life grew. For as a Midwesterner, the son of immigrantparents, I recognized at an early age that I was called upon to decide formyself to what extent my Jewish origins, my surroundings (the accidentalcircumstances of Chicago), my schooling, were to be allowed to determine thecourse of my life. I did not intend to be wholly dependent on history andculture. Full dependency must mean that I was done for. The commonest teachingof the civilized world in our time can be stated simply: “Tell me where you comefrom and I will tell you what you are.” There was not a chance in the world thatChicago, with the agreement of my eagerly Americanizing extended family, wouldmake me in its image. Before I was capable of thinking clearly, my resistance toits material weight took the form of obstinacy. I couldn’t say why I would notallow myself to become the product of an environment. But gainfulness, utility,prudence, business, had no hold on me. My mother wanted me to be a fiddler or,failing that, a rabbi. I had my choice between playing dinner music at thePalmer House or presiding over a synagogue. In traditional orthodox familiessmall boys were taught to translate Genesis and Exodus, so I might easily havegone on to the rabbinate if the great world, the world of the streets, had notbeen so seductive. Besides, a life of pious observance was not for me. Anyway, Ihad begun at an early age to read widely, and I was quickly carried away fromthe ancient religion. Reluctantly, my father allowed me at seventeen to enterthe university, where I was an enthusiastic (wildly excited) but erratic andcontrary student. If I signed up for Economics 201, I was sure to spend all mytime reading Ibsen and Shaw. Registering for a poetry course, I was soon boredby meters and stanzas, and shifted my attention to Kropotkin’s Memoirs of aRevolutionist and Lenin’s What Is to Be Done? My tastes and habits were those ofa writer. I preferred to read poetry on my own without the benefit of lectureson the caesura. To rest my book-strained eyes I played pool and Ping-Pong at themen’s club.I was soon aware that in the view of advanced European thinkers, the culturalexpectations of a young man from Chicago, that center of brutal materialism,were bound to be disappointed. Put together the slaughterhouses, the steelmills, the freight yards, the primitive bungalows of the industrial villagesthat comprised the city, the gloom of the financial district, the ballparks andprizefights, the machine politicians, the prohibition gang wars, and you had asolid cover of “Social-Darwinist” darkness, impenetrable by the rays of culture.Hopeless, in the judgment of highly refined Englishmen, Frenchmen, Germans andItalians, the spokesmen for art in its most advanced modern forms. For some ofthese foreign observers, America had many advantages over Europe, it was moreproductive, more energetic, more free, largely immune from pathogenic politicsand ruinous wars, but as far as art was concerned it would be better, as WyndhamLewis put it, to have been born an Eskimo than a Minnesota Presbyterian whowanted to be a painter. Civilized Europeans, often exceptionally free from theclass prejudices of their own countries, were able conveniently to lodge theirnot fully mastered biases in the free-for-all U.S.A. What no one was able toforesee was that all civilized countries were destined to descend to a commoncosmopolitanism and that the lamentable weakening of the older branches ofcivilization would open fresh opportunities and free us from our dependency onhistory and culture—a concealed benefit of decline. There would be barbarousmanifestations certainly, but there would be also the possibility of new kindsof independence.In this regard I find myself, as Americans have taken to saying, between a rockand a hard place. European observers sometimes classify me as a hybridcuriosity, neither fully American nor satisfactorily European, stuffed withreferences to the philosophers, the historians, and poets I had consumedhiggledy-piggledy, in my Midwestern lair. I am of course, an autodidact, asmodern writers always are. That spirited newcomer, the nineteenth-centurynovelist, guessed, ventured, conjectured daringly. Independent intelligence madeits synthesis. Balzac declared, “The world belongs to me because I understandit.” Professor Bloom’s book makes me fear that the book of the world, so richlystudied by autodidacts, is being closed by the “learned” who are raising wallsof opinions to shut the world out.From a different standpoint, American readers sometimes object to a kind offoreignness in my books. I mention Old World writers, I have highbrow airs, andappear to put on the dog. I readily concede that here and there I am probablyhard to read, and I am likely to become harder as the illiteracy of the publicincreases. It is never an easy task to take the mental measure of your readers.There are things that people should know if they are to read books at all, andout of respect for them, or to save appearances, one is apt to assume morefamiliarity on their part with the history of the twentieth century than isobjectively justified. Besides, a certain psychic unity is always taken forgranted by writers. “Others are in essence like me and I am basically like them,give or take a few minor differences.” A piece of writing is an offering. Youbring it to the altar and hope it will be accepted. You pray at least thatrejection will not throw you into a rage and turn you into a Cain. Perhapsnaively, you produce your favorite treasures and pile them in an indiscriminateheap. Those who do not recognize their value now may do so later. And you do notalways feel that you are writing for any of your contemporaries. It may well bethat your true readers are not here as yet and that your books will cause themto materialize.There are times when I enjoy making fun of the educated American. Herzog, forinstance, was meant to be a comic novel: a Ph.D. from a good American universityfalls apart when his wife leaves him for another man. He is taken by anepistolary fit and writes grieving, biting, ironic and rambunctious letters notonly to his friends and acquaintances, but also to the great men, the giants ofthought, who formed his mind. What is he to do in this moment of crisis, pullAristotle or Spinoza from the shelf and storm through the pages looking forconsolation and advice? The stricken man, as he tries to put himself togetheragain, interpret his experience, make sense of life, becomes clearly aware ofthe preposterousness of such an effort. “What this country needs,” he writes atlast, surrendering to the absurdity of his state, “is a good five-centsynthesis.” Here he echoes Mr. Marshall, Woodrow Wilson’s Vice President, whohad said at about the time of the Great War, “What this country needs is a goodfive-cent cigar.” Certain readers of Herzog complained the book was difficult.Much as they might have sympathized with the unhappy and comical historyprofessor, they were occasionally put off by his long and erudite letters. Somefelt that they were being asked to sit for a difficult exam in a survey coursein intellectual history and thought it mean of me to mingle sympathy and witwith obscurity and pedantry.But I was making fun of pedantry!The reply: “If that was your purpose, you didn’t altogether succeed. Some ofyour readers thought you were setting up a challenge, something resembling anobstacle course, or an egghead crossword puzzle for members of MENSA.” A few mayhave been flattered, while others resented being tested. People reserve theirbest thinking for their professional specialties and, next in line, for seriousmatters confronting the alert citizen—economics, politics, the disposal ofnuclear waste, etc. The day’s work done, they want to be entertained. They can’tsee why their entertainment should not simply be entertaining, and in some waysI agree, for I myself, in reading Montaigne as I sometimes do, am tempted toskip his long citations from the classics, which put my high school Latin undersome strain, and it is not amusing to send oneself back to high school.To finish with Herzog, I meant the novel to show how little strength “highereducation” had to offer a troubled man. In the end he is aware that he has hadno education in the conduct of life (at the university who was there to teachhim how to deal with his erotic needs, with women, with family matters?) and hereturns, in the language of games, to square one—or as I put it to myself whilewriting the book, to some primal point of balance. Herzog’s confusion isbarbarous. Well, what else can it be? But there is one point at which, assistedby his comic sense, he is able to hold fast. In the greatest confusion there isstill an open channel to the soul. It may be difficult to find because bymidlife it is overgrown, and some of the wildest thickets that surround it growout of what we describe as our education. But the channel is always there, andit is our business to keep it open, to have access to the deepest part ofourselves—to that part of us which is conscious of a higher consciousness, bymeans of which we make final judgments and put everything together. Theindependence of this consciousness, which has the strength to be immune to thenoise of history and the distractions of our immediate surroundings, is what thelife struggle is all about. The soul has to find and hold its ground againsthostile forces, sometimes embodied in ideas which frequently deny its veryexistence, and which indeed often seem to be trying to annul it altogether.Romantic poets and other edifying theorists of the nineteenth century had itwrong—poets and novelists will never be the legislators and teachers of mankind.That poets—artists—should give new eyes to human beings, inducing them to viewthe world differently, converting them from fixed modes of experience, isambition enough, if one must offer a purposive account of the artist’s project.What makes that project singularly difficult is the disheartening expansion oftrained ignorance and bad thought. For to put the matter at its baldest, we livein a thought-world, and the thinking has gone very bad indeed. Therefore theartist, whether or not he views himself as an intellectual, is involved inthought-struggles. Thinking alone will never cure what ails him, and any artistshould be grateful for a naive grace which puts him beyond the need to reasonelaborately. For me, the university has been the place of divestiture where I amable to find help in the laborious task of discarding bad thought. It was at theuniversity that I began to work through the modern ideologies, Capitalist aswell as Marxist, and the psychologies, the social and historical theories, aswell as the philosophies (logical positivism, naturalism, existentialism, etc.).Shedding superfluities so that my mental body could recover its ability tobreathe, and protecting the root-simplicities of being, I have never viewed theuniversity as a sanctuary or shelter from “the outer world.” Life in a strictlyacademic village, in isolation from a great turbulent city, would have been atorment to me. So I have never been, as a “radical” Central European novelistrecently called me, a “campus writer.” Rather, I have trained myself to pick upthe endless variations on radical and right-wing themes so that I have becomeable (not an enviable skill) to detect the untreated sewage odors of a centuryof revolutionary rhetoric or, from another direction, to identify in GoreVidal’s recent outburst of “original” geopolitics nothing other than the HearstSunday Supplement theme of the “Yellow Peril,” the odor of which is no morepleasant now than it was in the thirties. There is nothing at all new in thefiery posturing of these agitational and “activist” writers. If they were ableto come up with something of their own, the universities would not hold theirmonopoly on the intellectual life.The heart of Professor Bloom’s argument is that the university, in a societyruled by public opinion, was to have been an island of intellectual freedomwhere all views were investigated without restriction. Liberal democracy in itsgenerosity made this possible, but by consenting to play an active or“positive,” a participatory role in society, the university has become inundatedand saturated with the backflow of society’s “problems.” Preoccupied withquestions of Health, Sex, Race, War, academics make their reputations and theirfortunes and the university has become society’s conceptual warehouse of oftenharmful influences. Any proposed reforms of liberal education which might bringthe university into conflict with the whole of the U.S.A. are unthinkable.Increasingly, the people “inside” are identical in their appetites and motiveswith the people “outside” the university. This is what I take Bloom to besaying, and if he were making a polemical statement merely it would be easyenough to set aside. What makes it formidably serious is the accurate historicalbackground accompanying the argument. He explains with an admirable command ofpolitical theory how all this came to be, how modern democracy originated, whatMachiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau and the other philosophers of enlightenmentintended, and how their intentions succeeded or failed.The heat of the dispute between Left and Right has grown so fierce in the lastdecade that the habits of civilized discourse have suffered a scorching.Antagonists seem no longer to listen to one another. It would be a pity ifintelligent adversaries were not to read Professor Bloom’s book withdisinterested attention. It makes an important statement and deserves carefulstudy. What it provides, whether or not one agrees with its conclusions, is anindispensable guide for discussion, not a mere skimming of the tradition, but acompletely articulated, historically accurate summary, a trustworthy resumé ofthe development of the higher mental life in the democratic U.S.A.SAUL BELLOW"},{"pageContent":"PREFACEThis essay—a meditation on the state of our souls, particularly those of theyoung, and their education—is written from the perspective of a teacher. Such aperspective, although it has grave limitations and is accompanied by dangeroustemptations, is a privileged one. The teacher, particularly the teacherdedicated to liberal education, must constantly try to look toward the goal ofhuman completeness and back at the natures of his students here and now, everseeking to understand the former and to assess the capacities of the latter toapproach it. Attention to the young, knowing what their hungers are and whatthey can digest, is the essence of the craft. One must spy out and elicit thosehungers. For there is no real education that does not respond to felt need;anything else acquired is trifling display. What each generation is can be bestdiscovered in its relation to the permanent concerns of mankind. This in turncan best be discovered in each generation’s tastes, amusements, and especiallyangers (this is above all true in an age that prides itself on calmself-awareness). Particularly revealing are the various impostors whose businessit is to appeal to the young. These culture peddlers have the strongest ofmotives for finding out the appetites of the young—so they are useful guidesinto the labyrinths of the spirit of the times.The teacher’s standpoint is not arbitrary. It is neither simply dependent onwhat students think they want or happen to be in this place or time, nor is itimposed on him by the demands of a particular society or the vagaries of themarket. Although much effort has been expended in trying to prove that theteacher is always the agent of such forces, in fact he is, willy-nilly, guidedby the awareness, or the divination, that there is a human nature, and thatassisting its fulfillment is his task. He does not come to this by way ofabstractions or complicated reasoning. He sees it in the eyes of his students.Those students are only potential, but potential points beyond itself; and thisis the source of the hope, almost always disappointed but ever renascent, thatman is not just a creature of accident, chained to and formed by the particularcave in which he is born. Midwifery—i.e., the delivery of real babies of whichnot the midwife but nature is the cause—describes teaching more adequately thandoes the word socialization. The birth of a robust child, independent of themidwife, is the teacher’s true joy, a pleasure far more effective in motivatinghim than any disinterested moral duty would be, his primary experience of acontemplation more satisfying than any action. No real teacher can doubt thathis task is to assist his pupil to fulfill human nature against all thedeforming forces of convention and prejudice. The vision of what that nature ismay be clouded, the teacher may be more or less limited, but his activity issolicited by something beyond him that at the same time provides him with astandard for judging his students’ capacity and achievement. Moreover there isno real teacher who in practice does not believe in the existence of the soul,or in a magic that acts on it through speech. The soul, so the teacher mustthink, may at the outset of education require extrinsic rewards and punishmentsto motivate its activity; but in the end that activity is its own reward and isself-sufficient.These are the reasons that help to explain the perversity of an adult whoprefers the company of youths to that of grownups. He prefers the promising“might be” to the defective “is.” Such an adult is subject to manytemptations—particularly vanity and the desire to propagandize rather thanteach—and the very activity brings with it the danger of preferring teaching toknowing, of adapting oneself to what the students can or want to learn, ofknowing oneself only by one’s students.Thus, teaching can be a threat to philosophy because philosophizing is asolitary quest, and he who pursues it must never look to an audience. But it istoo much to ask that teachers be philosophers, and a bit of attachment to one’saudience is almost inevitable. And if it is well resisted, the very vice canturn into something of a virtue and encourage philosophizing. Fascination withone’s students leads to an awareness of the various kinds of soul and theirvarious capacities for truth and error as well as learning. Such experience is acondition of investigating the question, “What is man?,” in relation to hishighest aspirations as opposed to his low and common needs.A liberal education means precisely helping students to pose this question tothemselves, to become aware that the answer is neither obvious nor simplyunavailable, and that there is no serious life in which this question is not acontinuous concern. Despite all the efforts to pervert it (a few of which willbe discussed in this book), the question that every young person asks, “Who amI?,” the powerful urge to follow the Delphic command, “Know thyself,” which isborn in each of us, means in the first place “What is man?” And in our chroniclack of certainty, this comes down to knowing the alternative answers andthinking about them. Liberal education provides access to these alternatives,many of which go against the grain of our nature or our times. The liberallyeducated person is one who is able to resist the easy and preferred answers, notbecause he is obstinate but because he knows others worthy of consideration.Although it is foolish to believe that book learning is anything like the wholeof education, it is always necessary, particularly in ages when there is apoverty of living examples of the possible high human types. And book learningis most of what a teacher can give—properly administered in an atmosphere inwhich its relation to life is plausible. Life will happen to his students. Themost he can hope is that what he might give will inform life. Most students willbe content with what our present considers relevant; others will have a spiritof enthusiasm that subsides as family and ambition provide them with otherobjects of interest; a small number will spend their lives in an effort to beautonomous. It is for these last, especially, that liberal education exists.They become the models for the use of the noblest human faculties and hence arebenefactors to all of us, more for what they are than for what they do. Withouttheir presence (and, one should add, without their being respectable), nosociety—no matter how rich or comfortable, no matter how technically adept orfull of tender sentiments—can be called civilized.From the teacher’s standpoint, thus understood, I have for more than thirtyyears, with the most intense interest, watched and listened to students. Whatthey bring to their higher education, in passions, curiosities, longings, andespecially previous experience, has changed; and there-with the task ofeducating them has changed. In this book I am attempting to make a contributionto understanding this generation. I am not moralizing; I no more want to beJeremiah than Pollyanna. More than anything else, this book is to be taken as areport from the front. The reader can judge for himself the gravity of oursituation. Every age has its problems, and I do not claim that things werewonderful in the past. I am describing our present situation and do not intendany comparison with the past to be used as grounds for congratulating or blamingourselves but only for the sake of clarifying what counts for us and what isspecial in our situation.A word about my “sample” in this study. It consists of thousands of students ofcomparatively high intelligence, materially and spiritually free to do prettymuch what they want with the few years of college they are privileged to have—inshort, the kind of young persons who populate the twenty or thirty bestuniversities. There are other kinds of students whom circumstances of one sortor another prevent from having the freedom required to pursue a liberaleducation. They have their own needs and may very well have very differentcharacters from those I describe here. My sample, whatever its limits, has theadvantage of concentrating on those who are most likely to take advantage of aliberal education and to have the greatest moral and intellectual effect on thenation. It is sometimes said that these advantaged youths have less need of ourattention and resources, that they already have enough. But they, above all,most need education, inasmuch as the greatest talents are most difficult toperfect, and the more complex the nature the more susceptible it is toperversion.There is no need to prove the importance of education; but it should be remarkedthat for modern nations, which have founded themselves on reason in its varioususes more than did any nations in the past, a crisis in the university, the homeof reason, is perhaps the profoundest crisis they face.This book has concentrated my mind on the experiences of a lifetime of teaching.Because my career has been an unusually happy one, gratitude is the leadingsentiment evoked in reviewing it. My acknowledgments, therefore, reflectcontributions to that total experience rather than to this particular book. Soabove all, I must thank all the students to whom I have had the privilege ofteaching classic texts for more than thirty years, especially those I came toknow well and from whom I learned so much about the questions discussed here.Among them are those old students, now very independent thinkers and friends,who have told me of their experiences and observations and helped me interpretmine: Christopher J. Bruell, Hillel G. Fradkin, James H. Nichols, Jr., CliffordOrwin, Thomas L. Pangle, Abram N. Shulsky, Nathan and Susan Tarcov. David S.Bolotin, in particular, responded to my thesis and in turn persuaded me of itsseriousness. All of them contributed to and tempered my enthusiasms, each in hisown special way. Michael Z. Wu has assisted me enormously with his sharp insightand criticism.Among my colleagues with whom I share conversation and students, I want to makemention of Saul Bellow and Werner J. Dannhauser. The former, with his specialgenerosity, entered into my thoughts and encouraged me in paths I had neverbefore taken; the latter, my intellectual companion throughout my adult life,undertook as usual to read my manuscript and gave me the benefit of hispenetration and honesty.In the preparation of the manuscript, Judy Chernick, Terese Denov, and EricaAronson worked as loyal friends with total reliability, making the most boringphases in the production of a book seem exciting. I have been particularly happyin my editors, Robert Asahina, of Simon and Schuster, and Bernard de Fallois, ofEditions Julliard, who pushed me to write the book and then spent more timeworking on it than I could have imagined. The Earhart Foundation and the John M.Olin Foundation have supported me as teacher and scholar for a long time, and Iam very grateful to their officers.Finally, I want to express my admiration for Allan P. Sindler, who has been forme the model of the selfless university man. His lifelong behavior proves thatthe enterprise is still possible and worthwhile.I must say, and not only pro forma, that my mention of these persons in no wayimplies that they endorse my views.ALLAN BLOOMChicago, May 1986"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION:OUR VIRTUEThere is one thing a professor can be absolutely certain of: almost everystudent entering the university believes, or says he believes, that truth isrelative. If this belief is put to the test, one can count on the students’reaction: they will be uncomprehending. That anyone should regard theproposition as not self-evident astonishes them, as though he were calling intoquestion 2 + 2 = 4. These are things you don’t think about. The students’backgrounds are as various as America can provide. Some are religious, someatheists; some are to the Left, some to the Right; some intend to be scientists,some humanists or professionals or businessmen; some are poor, some rich. Theyare unified only in their relativism and in their allegiance to equality. Andthe two are related in a moral intention. The relativity of truth is not atheoretical insight but a moral postulate, the condition of a free society, orso they see it. They have all been equipped with this framework early on, and itis the modern replacement for the inalienable natural rights that used to be thetraditional American grounds for a free society. That it is a moral issue forstudents is revealed by the character of their response when challenged—acombination of disbelief and indignation: “Are you an absolutist?,” the onlyalternative they know, uttered in the same tone as “Are you a monarchist?” or“Do you really believe in witches?” This latter leads into the indignation, forsomeone who believes in witches might well be a witch-hunter or a Salem judge.The danger they have been taught to fear from absolutism is not error butintolerance. Relativism is necessary to openness; and this is the virtue, theonly virtue, which all primary education for more than fifty years has dedicateditself to inculcating. Openness—and the relativism that makes it the onlyplausible stance in the face of various claims to truth and various ways of lifeand kinds of human beings—is the great insight of our times. The true believeris the real danger. The study of history and of culture teaches that all theworld was mad in the past; men always thought they were right, and that led towars, persecutions, slavery, xenophobia, racism, and chauvinism. The point isnot to correct the mistakes and really be right; rather it is not to think youare right at all.The students, of course, cannot defend their opinion. It is something with whichthey have been indoctrinated. The best they can do is point out all the opinionsand cultures there are and have been. What right, they ask, do I or anyone elsehave to say one is better than the others? If I pose the routine questionsdesigned to confute them and make them think, such as, “If you had been aBritish administrator in India, would you have let the natives under yourgovernance burn the widow at the funeral of a man who had died?,” they eitherremain silent or reply that the British should never have been there in thefirst place. It is not that they know very much about other nations, or abouttheir own. The purpose of their education is not to make them scholars but toprovide them with a moral virtue—openness.Every educational system has a moral goal that it tries to attain and thatinforms its curriculum. It wants to produce a certain kind of human being. Thisintention is more or less explicit, more or less a result of reflection; buteven the neutral subjects, like reading and writing and arithmetic, take theirplace in a vision of the educated person. In some nations the goal was the piousperson, in others the warlike, in others the industrious. Always important isthe political regime, which needs citizens who are in accord with itsfundamental principle. Aristocracies want gentlemen, oligarchies men who respectand pursue money, and democracies lovers of equality. Democratic education,whether it admits it or not, wants and needs to produce men and women who havethe tastes, knowledge, and character supportive of a democratic regime. Over thehistory of our republic, there have obviously been changes of opinion as to whatkind of man is best for our regime. We began with the model of the rational andindustrious man, who was honest, respected the laws, and was dedicated to thefamily (his own family—what has in its decay been dubbed the nuclear family).Above all he was to know the rights doctrine; the Constitution, which embodiedit; and American history, which presented and celebrated the founding of anation “conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men arecreated equal.” A powerful attachment to the letter and the spirit of theDeclaration of Independence gently conveyed, appealing to each man’s reason, wasthe goal of the education of democratic man. This called for something verydifferent from the kinds of attachment required for traditional communitieswhere myth and passion as well as severe discipline, authority, and the extendedfamily produced an instinctive, unqualified, even fanatic patriotism, unlike thereflected, rational, calm, even self-interested loyalty—not so much to thecountry but to the form of government and its rational principles—required inthe United States. This was an entirely new experiment in politics, and with itcame a new education. This education has evolved in the last half-century fromthe education of democratic man to the education of the democratic personality.The palpable difference between these two can easily be found in the changedunderstanding of what it means to be an American. The old view was that, byrecognizing and accepting man’s natural rights, men found a fundamental basis ofunity and sameness. Class, race, religion, national origin or culture alldisappear or become dim when bathed in the light of natural rights, which givemen common interests and make them truly brothers. The immigrant had to putbehind him the claims of the Old World in favor of a new and easily acquirededucation. This did not necessarily mean abandoning old daily habits orreligions, but it did mean subordinating them to new principles. There was atendency, if not a necessity, to homogenize nature itself.The recent education of openness has rejected all that. It pays no attention tonatural rights or the historical origins of our regime, which are now thought tohave been essentially flawed and regressive. It is progressive andforward-looking. It does not demand fundamental agreement or the abandonment ofold or new beliefs in favor of the natural ones. It is open to all kinds of men,all kinds of life-styles, all ideologies. There is no enemy other than the manwho is not open to everything. But when there are no shared goals or vision ofthe public good, is the social contract any longer possible?From the earliest beginnings of liberal thought there was a tendency in thedirection of indiscriminate freedom. Hobbes and Locke, and the American Foundersfollowing them, intended to palliate extreme beliefs, particularly religiousbeliefs, which lead to civil strife. The members of sects had to obey the lawsand be loyal to the Constitution; if they did so, others had to leave themalone, however distasteful their beliefs might be. In order to make thisarrangement work, there was a conscious, if covert, effort to weaken religiousbeliefs, partly by assigning—as a result of a great epistemologicaleffort—religion to the realm of opinion as opposed to knowledge. But the rightto freedom of religion belonged to the realm of knowledge. Such rights are notmatters of opinion. No weakness of conviction was desired here. All to thecontrary, the sphere of rights was to be the arena of moral passion in ademocracy.It was possible to expand the space exempt from legitimate social and politicalregulation only by contracting the claims to moral and political knowledge. Theinsatiable appetite for freedom to live as one pleases thrives on this aspect ofmodern democratic thought. In the end it begins to appear that full freedom canbe attained only when there is no such knowledge at all. The effective way todefang the oppressors is to persuade them they are ignorant of the good. Theinflamed sensitivity induced by radicalized democratic theory finallyexperiences any limit as arbitrary and tyrannical. There are no absolutes;freedom is absolute. Of course the result is that, on the one hand, the argumentjustifying freedom disappears and, on the other, all beliefs begin to have theattenuated character that was initially supposed to be limited to religiousbelief.The gradual movement away from rights to openness was apparent, for example,when Oliver Wendell Holmes renounced seeking for a principle to determine whichspeech or conduct is not tolerable in a democratic society and invoked insteadan imprecise and practically meaningless standard—clear and present danger—whichto all intents and purposes makes the preservation of public order the onlycommon good. Behind his opinion there was an optimistic view about progress, onein which the complete decay of democratic principle and a collapse intobarbarism are impossible and in which the truth unaided always triumphs in themarketplace of ideas. This optimism had not been shared by the Founders, whoinsisted that the principles of democratic government must be returned to andconsulted even though the consequences might be harsh for certain points ofview, some merely tolerated and not respected, others forbidden outright. Totheir way of thinking there should be no tolerance for the intolerant. Thenotion that there should be no limitation on free expression unless it can beshown to be a clear and present danger would have made it impossible for Lincolnto insist that there could be no compromise with the principle of equality, thatit did not depend on the people’s choice or election but is the condition oftheir having elections in the first place, that popular sovereignty on thequestion of black slavery was impermissible even if it would enable us to avoidthe clear and present danger of a bloody civil war.But openness, nevertheless, eventually won out over natural rights, partlythrough a theoretical critique, partly because of a political rebellion againstnature’s last constraints. Civic education turned away from concentrating on theFounding to concentrating on openness based on history and social science. Therewas even a general tendency to debunk the Founding, to prove the beginnings wereflawed in order to license a greater openness to the new. What began in CharlesBeard’s Marxism and Carl Becker’s historicism became routine. We are used tohearing the Founders charged with being racists, murderers of Indians,representatives of class interests. I asked my first history professor in theuniversity, a very famous scholar, whether the picture he gave us of GeorgeWashington did not have the effect of making us despise our regime. “Not atall,” he said, “it doesn’t depend on individuals but on our having gooddemocratic values.” To which I rejoined, “But you just showed us that Washingtonwas only using those values to further the class interests of the Virginiasquirearchy.” He got angry, and that was the end of it. He was comforted by agentle assurance that the values of democracy are part of the movement ofhistory and did not require his elucidation or defense. He could carry on hishistorical studies with the moral certitude that they would lead to greateropenness and hence more democracy. The lessons of fascism and the vulnerabilityof democracy, which we had all just experienced, had no effect on him.Liberalism without natural rights, the kind that we knew from John Stuart Milland John Dewey, taught us that the only danger confronting us is being closed tothe emergent, the new, the manifestations of progress. No attention had to bepaid to the fundamental principles or the moral virtues that inclined men tolive according to them. To use language now popular, civic culture wasneglected. And this turn in liberalism is what prepared us for culturalrelativism and the fact-value distinction, which seemed to carry that viewpointfurther and give it greater intellectual weight.History and social science are used in a variety of ways to overcome prejudice.We should not be ethnocentric, a term drawn from anthropology, which tells usmore about the meaning of openness. We should not think our way is better thanothers. The intention is not so much to teach the students about other times andplaces as to make them aware of the fact that their preferences are onlythat—accidents of their time and place. Their beliefs do not entitle them asindividuals, or collectively as a nation, to think they are superior to anyoneelse. John Rawls is almost a parody of this tendency, writing hundreds of pagesto persuade men, and proposing a scheme of government that would force them, notto despise anyone. In A Theory of Justice, he writes that the physicist or thepoet should not look down on the man who spends his life counting blades ofgrass or performing any other frivolous or corrupt activity. Indeed, he shouldbe esteemed, since esteem from others, as opposed to self-esteem, is a basicneed of all men. So indiscriminateness is a moral imperative because itsopposite is discrimination. This folly means that men are not permitted to seekfor the natural human good and admire it when found, for such discovery iscoeval with the discovery of the bad and contempt for it. Instinct and intellectmust be suppressed by education. The natural soul is to be replaced with anartificial one.At the root of this change in morals was the presence in the United States ofmen and women of a great variety of nations, religions, and races, and the factthat many were badly treated because they belonged to these groups. FranklinRoosevelt declared that we want “a society which leaves no one out.” Althoughthe natural rights inherent in our regime are perfectly adequate to the solutionof this problem, provided these outsiders adhere to them (i.e., they becomeinsiders by adhering to them), this did not satisfy the thinkers who influencedour educators, for the right to vote and the other political rights did notautomatically produce social acceptance. The equal protection of the laws didnot protect a man from contempt and hatred as a Jew, an Italian, or a Black.The reaction to this problem was, in the first place, resistance to the notionthat outsiders had to give up their “cultural” individuality and make themselvesinto that universal, abstract being who participates in natural rights or elsebe doomed to an existence on the fringe; in the second place, anger at themajority who imposed a “cultural” life on the nation to which the Constitutionis indifferent. Openness was designed to provide a respectable place for these“groups” or “minorities”—to wrest respect from those who were not disposed togive it—and to weaken the sense of superiority of the dominant majority (morerecently dubbed WASPs, a name the success of which shows something of thesuccess of sociology in reinterpreting the national consciousness). Thatdominant majority gave the country a dominant culture with its traditions, itsliterature, its tastes, its special claim to know and supervise the language,and its Protestant religions. Much of the intellectual machinery oftwentieth-century American political thought and social science was constructedfor the purposes of making an assault on that majority. It treated the foundingprinciples as impediments and tried to overcome the other strand of ourpolitical heritage, majoritarianism, in favor of a nation of minorities andgroups each following its own beliefs and inclinations. In particular, theintellectual minority expected to enhance its status, presenting itself as thedefender and spokesman of all the others.This reversal of the founding intention with respect to minorities is moststriking. For the Founders, minorities are in general bad things, mostlyidentical to factions, selfish groups who have no concern as such for the commongood. Unlike older political thinkers, they entertained no hopes of suppressingfactions and educating a united or homogeneous citizenry. Instead theyconstructed an elaborate machinery to contain factions in such a way that theywould cancel one another and allow for the pursuit of the common good. The goodis still the guiding consideration in their thought, although it is arrived at,less directly than in classical political thought, by tolerating faction. TheFounders wished to achieve a national majority concerning the fundamental rightsand then prevent that majority from using its power to overturn thosefundamental rights. In twentieth-century social science, however, the commongood disappears and along with it the negative view of minorities. The very ideaof majority—now understood to be selfish interest—is done away with in order toprotect the minorities. This breaks the delicate balance between majority andminority in Constitutional thought. In such a perspective, where there is nocommon good, minorities are no longer problematic, and the protection of thememerges as the central function of government. Where this leads is apparent in,for example, Robert Dahl’s A Preface to Democratic Theory. Groups or individualswho really care, as opposed to those who have lukewarm feelings, deserve specialattention or special rights for their “intensity” or “commitment,” the newpolitical validation, which replaces reason. The Founding Fathers wished toreduce and defang fanaticism, whereas Dahl encourages it.The appeal of the minority formula was enormous for all kinds of people,reactionary and progressive, all those who in the twenties and thirties stilldid not accept the political solution imposed by the Constitution. Thereactionaries did not like the suppression of class privilege and religiousestablishment. For a variety of reasons they simply did not accept equality.Southerners knew full well that the Constitution’s heart was a moral commitmentto equality and hence condemned segregation of blacks. The Constitution was notjust a set of rules of government but implied a moral order that was to beenforced throughout the entire Union. Yet the influence, which has not beensufficiently noted, of Southern writers and historians on the American view oftheir history has been powerful. They were remarkably successful incharacterizing their “peculiar institution” as part of a charming diversity andindividuality of culture to which the Constitution was worse than indifferent.The ideal of openness, lack of ethnocentricity, is just what they needed for amodern defense of their way of life against all the intrusions of outsiders whoclaimed equal rights with the folks back home. The Southerners’ romanticcharacterization of the alleged failings of the Constitution, and theirhostility to “mass society” with its technology, its money-grubbing way of life,egoistic individuals and concomitant destruction of community, organic androoted, appealed to malcontents of all political colorations. The New Left inthe sixties expressed exactly the same ideology that had been developed toprotect the South from the threat to its practices posed by the Constitutionalrights and the Federal Government’s power to enforce them. It is the oldalliance of Right and Left against liberal democracy, parodied as “bourgeoissociety.”The progressives of the twenties and thirties did not like the Constitutionalprotection of private property or the restraints on majority will and on livingas one pleased. For them, equality had not gone far enough. Stalinists alsofound the definition of democracy as openness useful. The Constitution clashedtoo violently with the theory and practice of the Soviet Union. But if democracymeans open-endedness, and respect for other cultures prevents doctrinaire,natural-rights-based condemnation of the Soviet reality, then someday their waysmay become ours. I remember my grade-school history textbook, newly printed onfine glossy paper, showing intriguing pictures of collective farms where farmersworked and lived together without the profit motive. (Children cannot understandthe issues, but they are easy to propagandize.) This was very different from ourway of life, but we were not to be closed to it, to react to it merely on thebasis of our cultural prejudices.Sexual adventurers like Margaret Mead and others who found America too narrowtold us that not only must we know other cultures and learn to respect them, butwe could also profit from them. We could follow their lead and loosen up,liberating ourselves from the opinion that our taboos are anything other thansocial constraints. We could go to the bazaar of cultures and find reinforcementfor inclinations that are repressed by puritanical guilt feelings. All suchteachers of openness had either no interest in or were actively hostile to theDeclaration of Independence and the Constitution.The civil rights movement provides a good example of this change in thought. Inits early days almost all the significant leaders, in spite of tactical andtemperamental differences, relied on the Declaration of Independence and theConstitution. They could charge whites not only with the most monstrousinjustices but also with contradicting their own most sacred principles. Theblacks were the true Americans in demanding the equality that belongs to them ashuman beings by natural and political right. This stance implied a firmconviction of the truth of the principles of natural right and of theirfundamental efficacy within the Constitutional tradition, which, althoughtarnished, tends in the long run toward fulfilling those principles. Theytherefore worked through Congress, the Presidency, and, above all, theJudiciary. By contrast, the Black Power movement that supplanted the older civilrights movement—leaving aside both its excesses and its very understandableemphasis on self-respect and refusal to beg for acceptance—had at its core theview that the Constitutional tradition was always corrupt and was constructed asa defense of slavery. Its demand was for black identity, not universal rights.Not rights but power counted. It insisted on respect for blacks as blacks, notas human beings simply.Yet the Constitution does not promise respect for blacks, whites, yellows,Catholics, Protestants, or Jews. It guarantees the protection of the rights ofindividual human beings. This has not proved to be enough, however, to what isperhaps by now a majority of Americans.The upshot of all this for the education of young Americans is that they knowmuch less about American history and those who were held to be its heroes. Thiswas one of the few things that they used to come to college with that hadsomething to do with their lives. Nothing has taken its place except asmattering of facts learned about other nations or cultures and a few socialscience formulas. None of this means much, partly because little attention hasbeen paid to what is required in order truly to convey the spirit of otherplaces and other times to young people, or for that matter to anyone, partlybecause the students see no relevance in any of it to the lives they are goingto lead or to their prevailing passions. It is the rarest of occurrences to finda youngster who has been infused by this education with a longing to know allabout China or the Romans or the Jews.All to the contrary. There is an indifference to such things, for relativism hasextinguished the real motive of education, the search for a good life. YoungAmericans have less and less knowledge of and interest in foreign places. In thepast there were many students who actually knew something about and lovedEngland, France, Germany, or Italy, for they dreamed of living there or thoughttheir lives would be made more interesting by assimilating their languages andliteratures. Such students have almost disappeared, replaced at most by studentswho are interested in the political problems of Third World countries and inhelping them to modernize, with due respect to their old cultures, of course.This is not learning from others but condescension and a disguised form of a newimperialism. It is the Peace Corps mentality, which is not a spur to learningbut to a secularized version of doing good works.Actually openness results in American conformism—out there in the rest of theworld is a drab diversity that teaches only that values are relative, whereashere we can create all the life-styles we want. Our openness means we do notneed others. Thus what is advertised as a great opening is a great closing. Nolonger is there a hope that there are great wise men in other places and timeswho can reveal the truth about life—except for the few remaining young peoplewho look for a quick fix from a guru. Gone is the real historical sense of aMachiavelli who wrested a few hours from each busy day in which “to don regaland courtly garments, enter the courts of the ancients and speak with them.”None of this concerns those who promote the new curriculum. The point is topropagandize acceptance of different ways, and indifference to their realcontent is as good a means as any. It was not necessarily the best of times inAmerica when Catholics and Protestants were suspicious of and hated one another;but at least they were taking their beliefs seriously, and the more or lesssatisfactory accommodations they worked out were not simply the result of apathyabout the state of their souls. Practically all that young Americans have todayis an insubstantial awareness that there are many cultures, accompanied by asaccharine moral drawn from that awareness: We should all get along. Why fight?In 1980, during the crisis with Iran, the mother of one of the hostagesexpressed our current educational principles very well. She went to Iran to begfor her son’s release, against the express wishes of the government of hercountry, the very week a rescue of the hostages was attempted. She justified herconduct by explaining that a mother has a right to try to save her son and alsoto learn a new culture. These are two basic rights, and her trip enabled her tokill two birds with one stone.Actually the problem of cultural difference could have been faced more easilyhere in America forty years ago. When I was in college, a young Mississippianwas lodged in my dormitory room for a few days during a visit of the Universityof Virginia debating team, of which he was a member. It was my first meetingwith an intelligent, educated Southerner. He explained the inferiority of blacksto me, the reasons for Jim Crow, and how all that was a part of a unique way oflife. He was an attractive, lively, amiable, healthy youngster. I, however, washorrified by him because I was still ethnocentric. I took my Northern beliefs tobe universal. The “different strokes for different folks” philosophy had not yettaken full hold. Fortunately the homogenization of American culture that hasoccurred since that enables us to avoid such nasty confrontations. Onlyobviously pathological lower-class types now hold the racist views of my youngvisitor. Southerners helped to fashion our theoretical view of culture, but theSouthern culture they intended to defend disappeared.One of the techniques of opening young people up is to require a college coursein a non-Western culture. Although many of the persons teaching such courses arereal scholars and lovers of the areas they study, in every case I have seen thisrequirement—when there are so many other things that can and should be learnedbut are not required, when philosophy and religion are no longer required—has ademagogic intention. The point is to force students to recognize that there areother ways of thinking and that Western ways are not better. It is again not thecontent that counts but the lesson to be drawn. Such requirements are part ofthe effort to establish a world community and train its member—the person devoidof prejudice. But if the students were really to learn something of the minds ofany of these non-Western cultures—which they do not—they would find that eachand every one of these cultures is ethnocentric. All of them think their way isthe best way, and all others are inferior. Herodotus tells us that the Persiansthought that they were the best, that those nations bordering on them were nextbest, that those nations bordering on the nations bordering on them were thirdbest, and so on, their worth declining as the concentric circles were fartherfrom the Persian center. This is the very definition of ethnocentrism. Somethinglike this is as ubiquitous as the prohibition against incest between mother andson.Only in the Western nations, i.e., those influenced by Greek philosophy, isthere some willingness to doubt the identification of the good with one’s ownway. One should conclude from the study of non-Western cultures that not only toprefer one’s own way but to believe it best, superior to all others, is primaryand even natural—exactly the opposite of what is intended by requiring studentsto study these cultures. What we are really doing is applying a Westernprejudice—which we covertly take to indicate the superiority of our culture—anddeforming the evidence of those other cultures to attest to its validity. Thescientific study of other cultures is almost exclusively a Western phenomenon,and in its origin was obviously connected with the search for new and betterways, or at least for validation of the hope that our own culture really is thebetter way, a validation for which there is no felt need in other cultures. Ifwe are to learn from those cultures, we must wonder whether such scientificstudy is a good idea. Consistency would seem to require professors of opennessto respect the ethnocentrism or closedness they find everywhere else. However,in attacking ethnocentrism, what they actually do is to assert unawares thesuperiority of their scientific understanding and the inferiority of the othercultures which do not recognize it at the same time that they reject all suchclaims to superiority. They both affirm and deny the goodness of their science.They face a problem akin to that faced by Pascal in the conflict between reasonand revelation, without the intellectual intransigence that forced him toabandon science in favor of faith.The reason for the non-Western closedness, or ethnocentrism, is clear. Men mustlove and be loyal to their families and their peoples in order to preserve them.Only if they think their own things are good can they rest content with them. Afather must prefer his child to other children, a citizen his country to others.That is why there are myths—to justify these attachments. And a man needs aplace and opinions by which to orient himself. This is strongly asserted bythose who talk about the importance of roots. The problem of getting along withoutsiders is secondary to, and sometimes in conflict with, having an inside, apeople, a culture, a way of life. A very great narrowness is not incompatiblewith the health of an individual or a people, whereas with great openness it ishard to avoid decomposition. The firm binding of the good with one’s own, therefusal to see a distinction between the two, a vision of the cosmos that has aspecial place for one’s people, seem to be conditions of culture. This is whatreally follows from the study of non-Western cultures proposed forundergraduates. It points them back to passionate attachment to their own andaway from the science which liberates them from it. Science now appears as athreat to culture and a dangerous uprooting charm. In short, they are lost in ano-man’s-land between the goodness of knowing and the goodness of culture, wherethey have been placed by their teachers who no longer have the resources toguide them. Help must be sought elsewhere.Greek philosophers were the first men we know to address the problem ofethnocentrism. Distinctions between the good and one’s own, between nature andconvention, between the just and the legal are the signs of this movement ofthought. They related the good to the fulfillment of the whole natural humanpotential and were aware that few, if any, of the nations of men had ways thatallowed such fulfillment. They were open to the good. They had to use the good,which was not their own, to judge their own. This was a dangerous businessbecause it tended to weaken wholehearted attachment to their own, hence toweaken their peoples as well as to expose themselves to the anger of family,friends, and countrymen. Loyalty versus quest for the good introduced anunresolvable tension into life. But the awareness of the good as such and thedesire to possess it are priceless humanizing acquisitions.This is the sound motive contained, along with many other less sound ones, inopenness as we understand it. Men cannot remain content with what is given themby their culture if they are to be fully human. This is what Plato meant to showby the image of the cave in the Republic and by representing us as prisoners init. A culture is a cave. He did not suggest going around to other cultures as asolution to the limitations of the cave. Nature should be the standard by whichwe judge our own lives and the lives of peoples. That is why philosophy, nothistory or anthropology, is the most important human science. Only dogmaticassurance that thought is culture-bound, that there is no nature, is what makesour educators so certain that the only way to escape the limitations of our timeand place is to study other cultures. History and anthropology were understoodby the Greeks to be useful only in discovering what the past and other peopleshad to contribute to the discovery of nature. Historians and anthropologistswere to put peoples and their conventions to the test, as Socrates didindividuals, and go beyond them. These scientists were superior to theirsubjects because they saw a problem where others refused to see one, and theywere engaged in the quest to solve it. They wanted to be able to evaluatethemselves and others.This point of view, particularly the need to know nature in order to have astandard, is uncomfortably buried beneath our human sciences, whether they likeit or not, and accounts for the ambiguities and contradictions I have beenpointing out. They want to make us culture-beings with the instruments that wereinvented to liberate us from culture. Openness used to be the virtue thatpermitted us to seek the good by using reason. It now means accepting everythingand denying reason’s power. The unrestrained and thoughtless pursuit ofopenness, without recognizing the inherent political, social, or culturalproblem of openness as the goal of nature, has rendered openness meaningless.Cultural relativism destroys both one’s own and the good. What is mostcharacteristic of the West is science, particularly understood as the quest toknow nature and the consequent denigration of convention—i.e., culture or theWest understood as a culture—in favor of what is accessible to all men as menthrough their common and distinctive faculty, reason. Science’s latest attemptsto grasp the human situation—cultural relativism, historicism, the fact-valuedistinction—are the suicide of science. Culture, hence closedness, reignssupreme. Openness to closedness is what we teach.Cultural relativism succeeds in destroying the West’s universal orintellectually imperialistic claims, leaving it to be just another culture. Sothere is equality in the republic of cultures. Unfortunately the West is definedby its need for justification of its ways or values, by its need for discoveryof nature, by its need for philosophy and science. This is its culturalimperative. Deprived of that, it will collapse. The United States is one of thehighest and most extreme achievements of the rational quest for the good lifeaccording to nature. What makes its political structure possible is the use ofthe rational principles of natural right to found a people, thus uniting thegood with one’s own. Or, to put it otherwise, the regime established herepromised untrammeled freedom to reason—not to everything indiscriminately, butto reason, the essential freedom that justifies the other freedoms, and on thebasis of which, and for the sake of which, much deviance is also tolerated. Anopenness that denies the special claim of reason bursts the mainspring keepingthe mechanism of this regime in motion. And this regime, contrary to all claimsto the contrary, was founded to overcome ethnocentrism, which is in no sense adiscovery of social science.It is important to emphasize that the lesson the students are drawing from theirstudies is simply untrue. History and the study of cultures do not teach orprove that values or cultures are relative. All to the contrary, that is aphilosophical premise that we now bring to our study of them. This premise isunproven and dogmatically asserted for what are largely political reasons.History and culture are interpreted in the light of it, and then are said toprove the premise. Yet the fact that there have been different opinions aboutgood and bad in different times and places in no way proves that none is true orsuperior to others. To say that it does so prove is as absurd as to say that thediversity of points of view expressed in a college bull session proves there isno truth. On the face of it, the difference of opinion would seem to raise thequestion as to which is true or right rather than to banish it. The naturalreaction is to try to resolve the difference, to examine the claims and reasonsfor each opinion.Only the unhistorical and inhuman belief that opinions are held for no reasonwould prevent the undertaking of such an exciting activity. Men and nationsalways think they have reasons, and it could be understood to be historians’ andsocial scientists’ most important responsibility to make explicit and test thosereasons. It was always known that there were many and conflicting opinions aboutthe good, and nations embodying each of them. Herodotus was at least as aware aswe are of the rich diversity of cultures. But he took that observation to be aninvitation to investigate all of them to see what was good and bad about eachand find out what he could learn about good and bad from them. Modernrelativists take that same observation as proof that such investigation isimpossible and that we must be respectful of them all. Thus students, and therest of us, are deprived of the primary excitement derived from the discovery ofdiversity, the impulse of Odysseus, who, according to Dante, traveled the worldto see the virtues and vices of men. History and anthropology cannot provide theanswers, but they can provide the material on which judgment can work.I know that men are likely to bring what are only their prejudices to thejudgment of alien peoples. Avoiding that is one of the main purposes ofeducation. But trying to prevent it by removing the authority of men’s reason isto render ineffective the instrument that can correct their prejudices. Trueopenness is the accompaniment of the desire to know, hence of the awareness ofignorance. To deny the possibility of knowing good and bad is to suppress trueopenness. A proper historical attitude would lead one to doubt the truth ofhistoricism (the view that all thought is essentially related to and cannottranscend its own time) and treat it as a peculiarity of contemporary history.Historicism and cultural relativism actually are a means to avoid testing ourown prejudices and asking, for example, whether men are really equal or whetherthat opinion is merely a democratic prejudice.One might well wonder whether our historical and anthropological wisdom is notjust a disguised and rather muddled version of the Romantic dilemma that seemedso compelling and tragic at the beginning of the nineteenth century and produceda longing for the distant past or exotic new lands and an art to satisfy thatlonging. As the heirs of science, so the argument goes, we know more than didthe peoples of other times and places with their unscientific prejudices andillusions, but they were, or are, happier. This dilemma is expressed in thedistinction between naive and sentimental art. Lévi-Strauss is an unwillingwitness to my hypothesis. With a half-digested Rousseauism, he thinks the bestculture is to be found at that moment when men have left the state of nature andlive together in simple communities, without real private property or theexplosion of amour-propre. Such a view requires science, which in turn requiresdeveloped and corrupted society, in order to emerge. Science is itself one ofthe modifications of amour-propre, the love of inequality. So this viewsimultaneously produces melancholy about science. But the dilemma seems socompelling only if we are certain that we know so much, which depends onscience. Abandon that certainty, and we might be willing to test the beliefs ofthose happier peoples in order to see if they know something we do not know.Maybe Homer’s genius was not so naive as Schiller thought it was. If we abandonthis pride in our knowledge, which presents itself as humility, the discussiontakes on a new dimension. Then we could go in one of two directions: abandonmentof science, or the reestablishment of the theoretical life as both possible anditself productive of self-sufficient happiness. The Romantic posture is a way ofnot facing these extremes that masquerades as heroic endurance. Our shuttlingback and forth between science and culture is a trivialized spin-off from thatposture.Thus there are two kinds of openness, the openness of indifference—promoted withthe twin purposes of humbling our intellectual pride and letting us be whateverwe want to be, just as long as we don’t want to be knowers—and the openness thatinvites us to the quest for knowledge and certitude, for which history and thevarious cultures provide a brilliant array of examples for examination. Thissecond kind of openness encourages the desire that animates and makesinteresting every serious student—“I want to know what is good for me, what willmake me happy”—while the former stunts that desire.Openness, as currently conceived, is a way of making surrender to whatever ismost powerful, or worship of vulgar success, look principled. It ishistoricism’s ruse to remove all resistance to history, which in our day meanspublic opinion, a day when public opinion already rules. How often I have heardthe abandonment of requirements to learn languages or philosophy or sciencelauded as a progress of openness. Here is where the two kinds of openness clash.To be open to knowing, there are certain kinds of things one must know whichmost people don’t want to bother to learn and which appear boring andirrelevant. Even the life of reason is often unappealing; and useless knowledge,i.e., knowledge that is not obviously useful for a career, has no place in thestudent’s vision of the curriculum. So the university that stands intransigentlyfor humane learning must necessarily look closed and rigid. If openness means to“go with the flow,” it is necessarily an accommodation to the present. Thatpresent is so closed to doubt about so many things impeding the progress of itsprinciples that unqualified openness to it would mean forgetting the despisedalternatives to it, knowledge of which makes us aware of what is doubtful in it.True openness means closedness to all the charms that make us comfortable withthe present.When I was a young teacher at Cornell, I once had a debate about education witha professor of psychology. He said that it was his function to get rid ofprejudices in his students. He knocked them down like tenpins. I began to wonderwhat he replaced those prejudices with. He did not seem to have much of an ideaof what the opposite of a prejudice might be. He reminded me of the little boywho gravely informed me when I was four that there is no Santa Claus, who wantedme to bathe in the brilliant light of truth. Did this professor know what thoseprejudices meant for the students and what effect being deprived of them wouldhave? Did he believe that there are truths that could guide their lives as didtheir prejudices? Had he considered how to give students the love of the truthnecessary to seek unprejudiced beliefs, or would he render them passive,disconsolate, indifferent, and subject to authorities like himself, or the bestof contemporary thought? My informant about Santa Claus was just showing off,proving his superiority to me. He had not created the Santa Claus that had to bethere in order to be refuted. Think of all we learn about the world from men’sbelief in Santa Clauses, and all that we learn about the soul from those whobelieve in them. By contrast, merely methodological excision from the soul ofthe imagination that projects Gods and heroes onto the wall of the cave does notpromote knowledge of the soul; it only lobotomizes it, cripples its powers.I found myself responding to the professor of psychology that I personally triedto teach my students prejudices, since nowadays—with the general success of hismethod—they had learned to doubt beliefs even before they believed in anything.Without people like me, he would be out of business. Descartes had a wholewonderful world of old beliefs, of prescientific experience and articulations ofthe order of things, beliefs firmly and even fanatically held, before he evenbegan his systematic and radical doubt. One has to have the experience of reallybelieving before one can have the thrill of liberation. So I proposed a divisionof labor in which I would help to grow the flowers in the field and he could mowthem down.Prejudices, strong prejudices, are visions about the way things are. They aredivinations of the order of the whole of things, and hence the road to aknowledge of that whole is by way of erroneous opinions about it. Error isindeed our enemy, but it alone points to the truth and therefore deserves ourrespectful treatment. The mind that has no prejudices at the outset is empty. Itcan only have been constituted by a method that is unaware of how difficult itis to recognize that a prejudice is a prejudice. Only Socrates knew, after alifetime of unceasing labor, that he was ignorant. Now every high-school studentknows that. How did it become so easy? What accounts for our amazing progress?Could it be that our experience has been so impoverished by our various methods,of which openness is only the latest, that there is nothing substantial enoughleft there to resist criticism, and we therefore have no world left of which tobe really ignorant? Have we so simplified the soul that it is no longerdifficult to explain? To an eye of dogmatic skepticism, nature herself, in allher lush profusion of expressions, might appear to be a prejudice. In her placewe put a gray network of critical concepts, which were invented to interpretnature’s phenomena but which strangled them and therewith destroyed their ownraison d’être. Perhaps it is our first task to resuscitate those phenomena sothat we may again have a world to which we can put our questions and be able tophilosophize. This seems to me to be our educational challenge."},{"pageContent":"PART ONEImage [../images/img01_045.jpg]STUDENTS"},{"pageContent":"THE CLEAN SLATEI used to think that young Americans began whatever education they were to getat the age of eighteen, that their early lives were spiritually empty and thatthey arrived at the university clean slates unaware of their deeper selves andthe world beyond their superficial experience. The contrast between them andtheir European counterparts was set in high relief in the European novels andmovies into which we were initiated at the university. The Europeans got most ofthe culture they were going to get from their homes and their public schools,lyceés, or gymnasiums, where their souls were incorporated into their specificliterary traditions, which in turn expressed, and even founded, their traditionsas peoples. It was not simply or primarily that these European schoolchildrenhad a vastly more sophisticated knowledge of the human heart than we wereaccustomed to in the young or, for that matter, the old. It was that theirself-knowledge was mediated by their book learning and that their ambitions wereformed as much by models first experienced in books as in everyday life. Theirbooks had a substantial existence in everyday life and constituted much of whattheir society as a whole looked up to. It was commonplace for children of whatthey called good families to fill their imaginations with hopes of seriousliterary or philosophic careers, as do ours with hopes of careers inentertainment or business. All this was given to them early on, and by the timethey were in their late teens it was part of the equipment of their souls, alens through which they saw everything and which would affect all their laterlearning and experience. They went to the university to specialize.Young Americans seemed, in comparison, to be natural savages when they came tothe university. They had hardly heard the names of the writers who were thedaily fare of their counterparts across the Atlantic, let alone took it intotheir heads that they could have a relationship to them. “What’s Hecuba to himor he to Hecuba?” They belonged to the whole world, using their reason to seethe things all men have in common, to solve the problems of survival, all thetime innocently and unaware trampling on the altars sacred to the diversepeoples and nations of the earth who believe themselves constituted by theirparticular gods and heroes rather than by the common currency of the body. ThisAmerican intellectual obtuseness could seem horrifying and barbarous, a stuntingof full humanity, an incapacity to experience the beautiful, an utter lack ofengagement in the civilization’s ongoing discourse.But for me, and for many better observers, this constituted a large part of thecharm of American students. Very often natural curiosity and love of knowingappeared to come into their own in the first flush of maturity. Withouttraditional constraints or encouragements, without society’s rewards andpunishments, without snobbism or exclusivity, some Americans discovered thatthey had a boundless thirst for significant awareness, that their souls hadspaces of which they were unaware and which cried out for furnishing. Europeanstudents whom I taught always knew all about Rousseau and Kant, but such writershad been drummed into them from childhood and, in the new world after the war,they had become routine, as much a part of childhood’s limitations as shortpants, no longer a source of inspiration. So these students became suckers forthe new, the experimental. But for Americans the works of the great writerscould be the bright sunlit uplands where they could find the outside, theauthentic liberation for which this essay is a plea. The old was new for theseAmerican students, and in that they were right, for every important old insightis perennially fresh. It is possible that Americans would always lack theimmediate, rooted link to the philosophic and artistic achievements that appearto be part of the growth of particular cultures. But their approach to theseworks bespoke a free choice and the potential for man as man, regardless oftime, place, station or wealth, to participate in what is highest. It would be asad commentary on the human condition if the brotherhood of man is founded onwhat is lowest in him, while the higher cultivation required unbridgeablyseparate “cultures.” The American disposition gave witness to an optimisticbelief that the two universalities, of the body and of the soul, are possible,that access to the best is not dependent on chance. Young Americans, that is,some young Americans, gave promise of a continuing vitality for the traditionbecause they did not take it to be tradition.The enchanting prospect provided by the American student was particularlypowerful when I first started teaching good undergraduates in this country inthe years just after Sputnik. In 1965 I wrote: The current generation of students is unique and very different in outlook fromits teachers. I am referring to the good students in the better colleges anduniversities, those to whom a liberal education is primarily directed and whoare the objects of a training which presupposes the best possible material.These young people have never experienced the anxieties about simple physicalwell-being that their parents experienced during the depression. They have beenraised in comfort and with the expectation of ever increasing comfort. Hencethey are largely indifferent to it; they are not proud of having acquired it andhave not occupied themselves with the petty and sometimes deforming concernsnecessary to its acquisition. And, because they do not particularly care aboutit, they are more willing to give it up in the name of grand ideals; as a matterof fact, they are eager to do so in the hope of proving that they are notattached to it and are open to higher callings. In short, these students are akind of democratic version of an aristocracy. The unbroken prosperity of thelast twenty years gives them the confidence that they can always make a living.So they are ready to undertake any career or adventure if it can be made toappear serious. The ties of tradition, family, and financial responsibility areweak. And, along with all this, goes an open, generous character. They tend tobe excellent students and extremely grateful for anything they learn. A look atthis special group tends to favor a hopeful prognosis for the country’s moraland intellectual health. There was, at that moment, a spiritual yearning, a powerful tension of the soulwhich made the university atmosphere electric. The Soviets’ beating us intospace shocked the nation and, for a moment, leveling education was set back onits heels. There seemed to be no time for that nonsense. Survival itselfdepended on better education for the best people. External necessity injectedinto the easygoing educational world the urgency that should always be there.Money and standards emerged in the twinkling of an eye. The goal was to producescientific technicians who would save us from being at the mercy of tyrants. Thehigh schools concentrated on math and physics, and there was honor and thepromise of great futures for those who excelled in them. The Scholastic AptitudeTest became authoritative. Intellectual effort became a national pastime. Themere exercise of unused and flabby muscles is salutary, and the national effortboth trained and inspired the mind. The students were better, more highlymotivated.Then I began to notice strange things. For example, for the first time, Americanstudents were really learning languages. And there were the signs of anincipient longing for something else. Science had been oversold. The truescientific vocation is very rare, and in the high schools it was presented intechnical and uninspired fashion. The students apparently learned what they wereasked to learn, but boredom was not wholly compensated for by greatexpectations. The new mental activity and desire for achievement had not quitefound their objects. I observed that many of the best students’ dedication toscience was very thin. The great theoretical difficulty of modern naturalscience—that it cannot explain why it is good—was having its practical effect.The why question was coming close to the surface. As a result, although the soleinterest of the public officials was in natural science, social science and thehumanities also began to profit (inasmuch as the universities could not avoidsaying they counted too). A little liberal learning easily attracted many of themost gifted away from natural science. They felt the alternatives had beenhidden from them. And, once in the university, they could, this being a freecountry, change their minds about their interests when they discovered thatthere is something in addition to science. It was a tense moment, full ofcravings that lacked clearly perceived goals.I was convinced in the early sixties that what was wanted was a liberaleducation to give such students the wherewithal to examine their lives andsurvey their potential. This was the one thing the universities were unequippedand unwilling to offer them. The students’ wandering and wayward energiesfinally found a political outlet. By the mid-sixties universities were offeringthem every concession other than education, but appeasement failed and soon thewhole experiment in excellence was washed away, leaving not a trace. The variousliberations wasted that marvelous energy and tension, leaving the students’souls exhausted and flaccid, capable of calculating, but not of passionateinsight.It may very well be that I was wrong, that what was building up in the earlysixties was only a final assault on the last remaining inhibitions, that theappearance of intellectual longing was really only a version of the mostpowerful of modern longings—for the overcoming of necessity, tension, andconflict, a resting of the soul from its eternal travail. I still think,however, that there was much of true intellectual longing, and it only ended inrelaxation as a result of our wasted opportunities.But the students who have succeeded that generation of the late fifties andearly sixties, when the culture leeches, professional and amateur, began theirgreat spiritual bleeding, have induced me to wonder whether my conviction—theold Great Books conviction—was correct. That conviction was that nature is theonly thing that counts in education, that the human desire to know is permanent,that all it really needs is the proper nourishment, and that education is merelyputting the feast on the table. At the very best, it is clear to me now thatnature needs the cooperation of convention, just as man’s art is needed to foundthe political order that is the condition of his natural completeness. At worst,I fear that spiritual entropy or an evaporation of the soul’s boiling blood istaking place, a fear that Nietzsche thought justified and made the center of allhis thought. He argued that the spirit’s bow was being unbent and risked beingpermanently unstrung. Its activity, he believed, comes from culture, and thedecay of culture meant not only the decay of man in this culture but the decayof man simply. This is the crisis he tried to face resolutely: the veryexistence of man as man, as a noble being, depended on him and on men likehim—so he thought. He may not have been right, but his case looks stronger allthe time. At all events, the impression of natural savagery that Americans usedto make was deceptive. It was only relative to the impression made by theEuropeans. Today’s select students know so much less, are so much more cut offfrom the tradition, are so much slacker intellectually, that they make theirpredecessors look like prodigies of culture. The soil is ever thinner, and Idoubt whether it can now sustain the taller growths.Consider by contrast the education that still persists, in very attenuated form,in France. To overstate only a bit, there are two writers who between them shapeand set the limits to the minds of educated Frenchmen. Every Frenchman is born,or at least early on becomes, Cartesian or Pascalian. (Something similar couldbe said about Shakespeare as educator of the English, Goethe of the Germans, andDante and Machiavelli of the Italians.) Descartes and Pascal are nationalauthors, and they tell the French people what their alternatives are, and afforda peculiar and powerful perspective on life’s perennial problems. They weave thefabric of souls. On my last trip to France I heard a waiter call one of hisfellow waiters “a Cartesian.” It was not pretentiousness; he was just referringto what was for him a type. It is not so much that the French get principlesfrom these sources; rather they produce a cast of mind. Descartes and Pascalrepresent a choice between reason and revelation, science and piety, the choicefrom which everything else follows. One or the other of these total visionsalmost always presents itself to the minds of Frenchmen when they think aboutthemselves and their problems. These great opponents whom no synthesis canunite—the opposition between bon sens and faith against all odds—set in motion adualism that we recognize when we speak both of French clarity and of Frenchpassion. No country has had such a persistent and irreconcilable quarrel betweenthe secular and the religious as France, where the two parties find no commonground, where the aspirations of citizens who share the same country have suchdifferent senses about the meaning of life. Shakespeare provided a mediation ofthese two poles for the English, but no one succeeded in doing it for theFrench, although Rousseau, a Swiss, made a noble attempt. Both Enlightenment andCatholic thought have found their special home in France for more than threecenturies. Descartes and Pascal gave accounts for the French of the West’scommon faith, Christianity, and at the same time situated them with respect tothat other, more distant, source of inspiration, Greece. The succeedinggenerations of writers who began from the Descartes-Pascal tension developed andvaried their themes, and the essential spiritual experiences are repeated inVoltaire, Montesquieu, Constant, Balzac and Zola, on the one hand, andMalebranche, Chateaubriand, De Maistre, Baudelaire, Proust and Céline, on theother, each aware of the others and carrying on a dialogue with or confrontinghis opposite number.It was, therefore, very French of Tocqueville to say that the Americans’ methodof thought was Cartesian without their ever having read Descartes, and to wonderwhether they could understand a Pascal or produce one. America was not for him apeople with a book. A Frenchman was a creature of sentiments informed by aliterary tradition, while an American was a man of rational principles. Theseprinciples were first elaborated, of course, by writers but were such, as Kantsaid about his own moral philosophy, as to express what every well-brought-upchild knows. Reciprocal recognition of rights needs little training, nophilosophy, and abstracts from all differences of national character. Americanswere, in effect, told that they could be whatever they wanted to be or happenedto be as long as they recognized that the same applied to all other men and theywere willing to support and defend the government that guaranteed thatdispensation. It is possible to become an American in a day. And this is not tomake light of what it means to be an American. The cooperation of naturalpassion and natural reason defies the ancient maxims that insisted that a citybe like an organic unity, generated by the motherland, with a citizen’s relationto it like a leaf’s to a tree. It is, however, impossible, or it was until onlyyesterday, to become a Frenchman, for a Frenchman is a complex harmony, ordissonance, of historic echoes, from birth on. The French language, which theFrench used to learn very well, did not exist for the sake of conveyinginformation, for communicating men’s common needs; it was indistinguishable froma historical consciousness. Frenchness is defined by participation in thislanguage, its literature and the entire range of effects it produces. Somehowthe legalistic arguments about rights do not touch the privilege conveyed byparticipation in it. In America there are in principle no real outsiders, whilein France persons who, although citizens, are marginal to this tradition, forexample, Jews, have always had to think hard about what it is they belong to. InFrance, the Jew’s relation to what is constitutively French is a great andcomplex literary theme. The response to the issue is not universal and causesthe development of an interesting spectrum of human types. A Jew in America, bycontrast, is as American as anyone; and if he is singled out or treateddifferently, unconditional outrage is the appropriate response.The lack of American equivalents to Descartes, Rascal, or, for that matter,Montaigne, Rabelais, Racine, Montesquieu and Rousseau is not a question ofquality, but of whether there are any writers who are necessary to building ourspiritual edifice, whom one must have read, or rather lived with, to be callededucated, and who are the interpreters and even makers of our national life. Onecan think of American writers and writings that should be read and frequentlyare read; but, to the extent that Americans are readers, the whole world istheir bookshelf; there has not been the deep necessity to absorb their owncountry’s writings that citizens of other nations experience. A phenomenon likeWagner’s Gesamtkunstwerk, a high work of art which is intended to be whollyGerman, of Germans, for Germans and by Germans, and is an expression ofcollective consciousness, is inconceivable to Americans. And it is astonishinghow little a Frenchman knows, or has a feeling for, things that are not French.But to Americans, Homer, Virgil, Dante, Shakespeare, Goethe belong to everyoneor to “civilization.” And perhaps they do, in the long run. But this was not theview of Greeks, Romans, Italians, Englishmen and Germans, or of the Jews withtheir book that belonged to them, that told their story, and embodied, so tospeak, their instinct. Americans believe in equal access. Mortimer Adler’sbusiness genius recognized this and made a roaring commercial success out of theGreat Books. He was not even concerned about the translations he used, let aloneabout learning languages. Most writers in older lands despaired of beingunderstood by those who had not lived their language. Heidegger, who desperatelytried to maintain and revitalize this view, thought that “Language is the houseof Being,” that it is the height of superficiality to suppose that translationis even possible.Yet my early experience of American simplicity had persuaded me that we wereright, that we could begin with nothing, that uncultivated nature sufficed. Ihad not, however, paid sufficient attention to what students actually used tobring with them, the education that was once in the air that helped launch them.Most students could be counted on to know the Bible, that ubiquitous source ofthe older traditions. In America it was not filtered through great nationalinterpreters, but approached directly in the manner of early Protestantism,every man his own interpreter. The Bible was thus a mirror of that indifferenceto national cultures inherent in the American method. Most students alsoparticipated in a remarkably unified and explicit political tradition thatpossesses one writing known to everyone and probably believed by most, theDeclaration of Independence.Contrary to much contemporary wisdom, the United States has one of the longestuninterrupted political traditions of any nation in the world. What is more,that tradition is unambiguous; its meaning is articulated in simple, rationalspeech that is immediately comprehensible and powerfully persuasive to allnormal human beings. America tells one story: the unbroken, ineluctable progressof freedom and equality. From its first settlers and its political foundings on,there has been no dispute that freedom and equality are the essence of justicefor us. No one serious or notable has stood outside this consensus. You had tobe a crank or a buffoon (e.g., Henry Adams or H. L. Mencken, respectively) toget attention as a nonbeliever in the democracy. All significant politicaldisputes have been about the meaning of freedom and equality, not about theirrightness. Nowhere else is there a tradition or a culture whose message is sodistinct and unequivocal—certainly not in France, Italy, Germany, or evenEngland. There the greatest events and the greatest men speak for monarchy andaristocracy as well as for democracy, for established religion as well as fortolerance, for patriotism that takes primacy over liberty, for privilege thattakes primacy over equality of right. Belonging to one of these peoples may beexplained as a sentiment, an attachment to one’s own, akin to the attachment tofather and mother, but Frenchness, Englishness, Germanness remain, nonetheless,ineffable. Everybody can, however, articulate what Americanness is. And thatAmericanness generated a race of heroes—Franklin, Washington, Hamilton,Jefferson, Lincoln and so on—all of whom contributed to equality. Ourimagination is not turned toward a Joan of Arc, a Louis XIV or a Napoleon whocounterbalance our equivalent of 1789. Our heroes and the language of theDeclaration contribute to a national reverence for our Constitution, also aunique phenomenon. All this is material for self-consciousness and provides asuperior moral significance to humdrum lives as well as something to study.But the unity, grandeur and attendant folklore of the founding heritage wasattacked from so many directions in the last half-century that it graduallydisappeared from daily life and from textbooks. It all began to seem likeWashington and the cherry tree—not the sort of thing to teach childrenseriously. What is influential in the higher intellectual circles always ends upin the schools. The leading ideas of the Declaration began to be understood aseighteenth-century myths or ideologies. Historicism, in Carl Becker’s version(The Declaration of Independence: A Study in the History of Political Ideas,1922), both cast doubt on the truth of the natural rights teaching andoptimistically promised that it would provide a substitute. Similarly Dewey’spragmatism—the method of science as the method of democracy, individual growthwithout limits, especially natural limits—saw the past as radically imperfectand regarded our history as irrelevant or as a hindrance to rational analysis ofour present. Then there was Marxist debunking of the Charles Beard variety,trying to demonstrate that there was no public spirit, only private concern forproperty, in the Founding Fathers, thus weakening our convictions of the truthor superiority of American principles and our heroes (An Economic Interpretationof the Constitution, 1913). Then the Southern historians and writers avenged thevictory of the antislavery Union by providing low motives for the North(incorporating European critiques of commerce and technology) and idealizing theSouth’s way of life. Finally, in curious harmony with the Southerners, theradicals in the civil rights movement succeeded in promoting a popularconviction that the Founding was, and the American principles are, racist. Thebad conscience they promoted killed off the one continuing bit of popularculture that celebrated the national story—the Western.Thus, openness has driven out the local deities, leaving only the speechless,meaningless country. There is no immediate, sensual experience of the nation’smeaning or its project, which would provide the basis for adult reflection onregimes and statesmanship. Students now arrive at the university ignorant andcynical about our political heritage, lacking the wherewithal to be eitherinspired by it or seriously critical of it.The other element of fundamental primary learning that has disappeared isreligion. As the respect for the Sacred—the latest fad—has soared, real religionand knowledge of the Bible have diminished to the vanishing point. The godsnever walked very tall in our political life or in our schools. The Lord’sPrayer we mumbled in grade school when I was a child affected us less than thePledge of Allegiance we also recited. It was the home—and the houses of worshiprelated to it—where religion lived. The holy days and the common language andset of references that permeated most households constituted a large part of thefamily bond and gave it a substantial content. Moses and the Tables of the Law,Jesus and his preaching of brotherly love, had an imaginative existence.Passages from the Psalms and the Gospels echoed in children’s heads. Attendingchurch or synagogue, praying at the table, were a way of life, inseparable fromthe moral education that was supposed to be the family’s special responsibilityin this democracy. Actually, the moral teaching was the religious teaching.There was no abstract doctrine. The things one was supposed to do, the sensethat the world supported them and punished disobedience, were all incarnated inthe Biblical stories. The loss of the gripping inner life vouchsafed those whowere nurtured by the Bible must be primarily attributed not to our schools orpolitical life, but to the family, which, with all its rights to privacy, hasproved unable to maintain any content of its own. The dreariness of the family’sspiritual landscape passes belief. It is as monochrome and unrelated to thosewho pass through it as are the barren steppes frequented by nomads who taketheir mere subsistence and move on. The delicate fabric of the civilization intowhich the successive generations are woven has unraveled, and children areraised, not educated.I am speaking here not of the unhappy, broken homes that are such a prominentpart of American life, but the relatively happy ones, where husband and wifelike each other and care about their children, very often unselfishly devotingthe best parts of their lives to them. But they have nothing to give theirchildren in the way of a vision of the world, of high models of action orprofound sense of connection with others. The family requires the most delicatemixture of nature and convention, of human and divine, to subsist and performits function. Its base is merely bodily reproduction, but its purpose is theformation of civilized human beings. In teaching a language and providing namesfor all things, it transmits an interpretation of the order of the whole ofthings. It feeds on books, in which the little polity—the family—believes, whichtell about right and wrong, good and bad and explain why they are so. The familyrequires a certain authority and wisdom about the ways of the heavens and ofmen. The parents must have knowledge of what has happened in the past, andprescriptions for what ought to be, in order to resist the philistinism or thewickedness of the present. Ritual and ceremony are now often said to benecessary for the family, and they are now lacking. The family, however, has tobe a sacred unity believing in the permanence of what it teaches, if its ritualand ceremony are to express and transmit the wonder of the moral law, which italone is capable of transmitting and which makes it special in a world devotedto the humanly, all too humanly, useful. When that belief disappears, as it has,the family has, at best, a transitory togetherness. People sup together, playtogether, travel together, but they do not think together. Hardly any homes haveany intellectual life whatsoever, let alone one that informs the vital interestsof life. Educational TV marks the high tide for family intellectual life.The cause of this decay of the family’s traditional role as the transmitter oftradition is the same as that of the decay of the humanities: nobody believesthat the old books do, or even could, contain the truth. So books have become,at best, “culture,” i.e., boring. As Tocqueville put it, in a democracytradition is nothing more than information. With the “information explosion,”tradition has become superfluous. As soon as tradition has come to be recognizedas tradition, it is dead, something to which lip service is paid in the vainhope of edifying the kids. In the United States, practically speaking, the Biblewas the only common culture, one that united simple and sophisticated, rich andpoor, young and old, and—as the very model for a vision of the order of thewhole of things, as well as the key to the rest of Western art, the greatestworks of which were in one way or another responsive to the Bible—providedaccess to the seriousness of books. With its gradual and inevitabledisappearance, the very idea of such a total book and the possibility andnecessity of world-explanation is disappearing. And fathers and mothers havelost the idea that the highest aspiration they might have for their children isfor them to be wise—as priests, prophets or philosophers are wise. Specializedcompetence and success are all that they can imagine. Contrary to what iscommonly thought, without the book even the idea of the order of the whole islost.Parents do not have the legal or moral authority they had in the Old World. Theylack self-confidence as educators of their children, generously believing thatthey will be better than their parents, not only in well-being, but in moral,bodily and intellectual virtue. There is always a more or less open belief inprogress, which means the past appears poor and contemptible. The future, whichis open-ended, cannot be prescribed to by parents, and it eclipses the pastwhich they know to be inferior.Along with the constant newness of everything and the ceaseless moving fromplace to place, first radio, then television, have assaulted and overturned theprivacy of the home, the real American privacy, which permitted the developmentof a higher and more independent life within democratic society. Parents can nolonger control the atmosphere of the home and have even lost the will to do so.With great subtlety and energy, television enters not only the room, but alsothe tastes of old and young alike, appealing to the immediately pleasant andsubverting whatever does not conform to it. Nietzsche said the newspaper hadreplaced the prayer in the life of the modern bourgeois, meaning that the busy,the cheap, the ephemeral, had usurped all that remained of the eternal in hisdaily life. Now television has replaced the newspaper. It is not so much the lowquality of the fare provided that is troubling. It is much more the difficultyof imagining any order of taste, any way of life with pleasures and learningthat naturally fit the lives of the family’s members, keeping itself distinctfrom the popular culture and resisting the visions of what is admirable andinteresting with which they are bombarded from within the household itself.The improved education of the vastly expanded middle class in the lasthalf-century has also weakened the family’s authority. Almost everyone in themiddle class has a college degree, and most have an advanced degree of somekind. Those of us who can look back to the humble stations of our parents orgrandparents, who never saw the inside of an institution of higher learning, canhave cause for self-congratulation. But—inevitably but—the impression that ourgeneral populace is better educated depends on an ambiguity in the meaning ofthe word education, or a fudging of the distinction between liberal andtechnical education. A highly trained computer specialist need not have had anymore learning about morals, politics or religion than the most ignorant ofpersons. All to the contrary, his narrow education, with the prejudices and thepride accompanying it, and its literature which comes to be and passes away in aday and uncritically accepts the premises of current wisdom, can cut him offfrom the liberal learning that simpler folk used to absorb from a variety oftraditional sources. It is not evident to me that someone whose regular readingconsists of Time, Playboy and Scientific American has any profounder wisdomabout the world than the rural schoolboy of yore with his McGuffey’s reader.When a youngster like Lincoln sought to educate himself, the immediatelyavailable obvious things for him to learn were the Bible, Shakespeare andEuclid. Was he really worse off than those who try to find their way through thetechnical smorgasbord of the current school system, with its utter inability todistinguish between important and unimportant in any way other than by thedemands of the market?My grandparents were ignorant people by our standards, and my grandfather heldonly lowly jobs. But their home was spiritually rich because all the things donein it, not only what was specifically ritual, found their origin in the Bible’scommandments, and their explanation in the Bible’s stories and the commentarieson them, and had their imaginative counterparts in the deeds of the myriad ofexemplary heroes. My grandparents found reasons for the existence of theirfamily and the fulfillment of their duties in serious writings, and theyinterpreted their special sufferings with respect to a great and ennobling past.Their simple faith and practices linked them to great scholars and thinkers whodealt with the same material, not from outside or from an alien perspective, butbelieving as they did, while simply going deeper and providing guidance. Therewas a respect for real learning, because it had a felt connection with theirlives. This is what a community and a history mean, a common experience invitinghigh and low into a single body of belief.I do not believe that my generation, my cousins who have been educated in theAmerican way, all of whom are M.D.s or Ph.D.s, have any comparable learning.When they talk about heaven and earth, the relations between men and women,parents and children, the human condition, I hear nothing but cliches,superficialities, the material of satire. I am not saying anything so trite asthat life is fuller when people have myths to live by. I mean rather that a lifebased on the Book is closer to the truth, that it provides the material fordeeper research in and access to the real nature of things. Without the greatrevelations, epics and philosophies as part of our natural vision, there isnothing to see out there, and eventually little left inside. The Bible is notthe only means to furnish a mind, but without a book of similar gravity, readwith the gravity of the potential believer, it will remain unfurnished.The moral education that is today supposed to be the great responsibility of thefamily cannot exist if it cannot present to the imagination of the young avision of a moral cosmos and of the rewards and punishments for good and evil,sublime speeches that accompany and interpret deeds, protagonists andantagonists in the drama of moral choice, a sense of the stakes involved in suchchoice, and the despair that results when the world is “disenchanted.”Otherwise, education becomes the vain attempt to give children “values.” Beyondthe fact that parents do not know what they believe, and surely do not have theself-confidence to tell their children much more than that they want them to behappy and fulfill whatever potential they may have, values are such pallidthings. What are they and how are they communicated? The courses in“value-clarification” springing up in schools are supposed to provide models forparents and get children to talk about abortion, sexism or the arms race, issuesthe significance of which they cannot possibly understand. Such education islittle more than propaganda, and propaganda that does not work, because theopinions or values arrived at are will-o’-the-wisps, insubstantial, withoutground in experience or passion, which are the bases of moral reasoning. Such“values” will inevitably change as public opinion changes. The new moraleducation has none of the genius that engenders moral instinct or second nature,the prerequisite not only of character but also of thought. Actually, thefamily’s moral training now comes down to inculcating the bare minima of socialbehavior, not lying or stealing, and produces university students who can saynothing more about the ground of their moral action than “If I did that to him,he could do it to me”—an explanation which does not even satisfy those who utterit.This gradual stilling of the old political and religious echoes in the souls ofthe young accounts for the difference between the students I knew at thebeginning of my teaching career and those I face now. The loss of the books hasmade them narrower and flatter. Narrower because they lack what is mostnecessary, a real basis for discontent with the present and awareness that thereare alternatives to it. They are both more contented with what is and despairingof ever escaping from it. The longing for the beyond has been attenuated. Thevery models of admiration and contempt have vanished. Flatter, because withoutinterpretations of things, without the poetry or the imagination’s activity,their souls are like minors, not of nature, but of what is around. Therefinement of the mind’s eye that permits it to see the delicate distinctionsamong men, among their deeds and their motives, and constitutes real taste, isimpossible without the assistance of literature in the grand style.So there is less soil in which university teaching can take root, less of theenthusiasm and curiosity of young Glaucon in Plato’s Republic, whose eros makeshim imagine that there are splendid satisfactions in store for him about whichhe does not wish to be fooled and for knowledge of which he seeks a teacher. Itis much more difficult today to attach the classic books to any experience orfelt need the students have."},{"pageContent":"BOOKSI have begun to wonder whether the experience of the greatest texts from earlychildhood is not a prerequisite for a concern throughout life for them and forlesser but important literature. The soul’s longing, its intolerable irritationunder the constraints of the conditional and limited, may very well requireencouragement at the outset. At all events, whatever the cause, our studentshave lost the practice of and the taste for reading. They have not learned howto read, nor do they have the expectation of delight or improvement fromreading. They are “authentic,” as against the immediately preceding universitygenerations, in having few cultural pretensions and in refusing hypocriticalritual bows to high culture.When I first noticed the decline in reading during the late sixties, I beganasking my large introductory classes, and any other group of younger students towhich I spoke, what books really count for them. Most are silent, puzzled by thequestion. The notion of books as companions is foreign to them. Justice Blackwith his tattered copy of the Constitution in his pocket at all times is not anexample that would mean much to them. There is no printed word to which theylook for counsel, inspiration or joy. Sometimes one student will say “theBible.” (He learned it at home, and his Biblical studies are not usuallycontinued at the university.) There is always a girl who mentions Ayn Rand’s TheFountainhead, a book, although hardly literature, which, with itssub-Nietzschean assertiveness, excites somewhat eccentric youngsters to a newway of life. A few students mention recent books that struck them and supportedtheir own self-interpretation, like The Catcher in the Rye. (Theirs is usuallythe most genuine response and also shows a felt need for help inself-interpretation. But it is an uneducated response. Teachers should takeadvantage of the need expressed in it to show such students that better writerscan help them more.) After such sessions I am pursued by a student or two whowants to make it clear that he or she is really influenced by books, not just byone or two but by many. Then he recites a list of classics he may have grazed inhigh school.Imagine such a young person walking through the Louvre or the Uffizi, and youcan immediately grasp the condition of his soul. In his innocence of the storiesof Biblical and Greek or Roman antiquity, Raphael, Leonardo, Michelangelo,Rembrandt and all the others can say nothing to him. All he sees are colors andforms—modern art. In short, like almost everything else in his spiritual life,the paintings and statues are abstract. No matter what much of modern wisdomasserts, these artists counted on immediate recognition of their subjects and,what is more, on their having a powerful meaning for their viewers. The workswere the fulfillment of those meanings, giving them a sensuous reality and hencecompleting them. Without those meanings, and without their being somethingessential to the viewer as a moral, political and religious being, the workslose their essence. It is not merely the tradition that is lost when the voiceof civilization elaborated over millennia has been stilled in this way. It isbeing itself that vanishes beyond the dissolving horizon. One of the mostflattering things that ever happened to me as a teacher occurred when I receiveda postcard from a very good student on his first visit to Italy, who wrote, “Youare not a professor of political philosophy but a travel agent.” Nothing couldhave better expressed my intention as an educator. He thought I had prepared himto see. Then he could begin thinking for himself with something to think about.The real sensation of the Florence in which Machiavelli is believable is worthall the formulas of metaphysics ten times over. Education in our times must tryto find whatever there is in students that might yearn for completion, and toreconstruct the learning that would enable them autonomously to seek thatcompletion.In a less grandiose vein, students today have nothing like the Dickens who gaveso many of us the unforgettable Pecksniffs, Micawbers, Pips, with which wesharpened our vision, allowing us some subtlety in our distinction of humantypes. It is a complex set of experiences that enables one to say so simply, “Heis a Scrooge.” Without literature, no such observations are possible and thefine art of comparison is lost. The psychological obtuseness of our students isappalling, because they have only pop psychology to tell them what people arelike, and the range of their motives. As the awareness that we owed almostexclusively to literary genius falters, people become more alike, for want ofknowing they can be otherwise. What poor substitutes for real diversity are thewild rainbows of dyed hair and other external differences that tell the observernothing about what is inside.Lack of education simply results in students’ seeking for enlightenment whereverit is readily available, without being able to distinguish between the sublimeand trash, insight and propaganda. For the most part students turn to themovies, ready prey to interested moralisms such as the depictions of Gandhi orThomas More—largely designed to further passing political movements and toappeal to simplistic needs for greatness—or to insinuating flattery of theirsecret aspirations and vices, giving them a sense of significance. Kramer vs.Kramer may be up-to-date about divorces and sex roles, but anyone who does nothave Anna Karenina or The Red and the Black as part of his viewing equipmentcannot sense what might be lacking, or the difference between an honestpresentation and an exercise in consciousness-raising, trashy sentimentality andelevated sentiment. As films have emancipated themselves from the literarytyranny under which they suffered and which gave them a bad conscience, the oneswith serious pretensions have become intolerably ignorant and manipulative. Thedistance from the contemporary and its high seriousness that students most needin order not to indulge their petty desires and to discover what is most seriousabout themselves cannot be found in the cinema, which now only knows thepresent. Thus, the failure to read good books both enfeebles the vision andstrengthens our most fatal tendency—the belief that the here and now is allthere is.The only way to counteract this tendency is to intervene most vigorously in theeducation of those few who come to the university with a strong urge for un jene sais quoi, who fear that they may fail to discover it, and that thecultivation of their minds is required for the success of their quest. We arelong past the age when a whole tradition could be stored up in all students, tobe fruitfully used later by some. Only those who are willing to take risks andare ready to believe the implausible are now fit for a bookish adventure. Thedesire must come from within. People do what they want, and now the most needfulthings appear so implausible to them that it is hopeless to attempt universalreform. Teachers of writing in state universities, among the noblest and mostdespised laborers in the academy, have told me that they cannot teach writing tostudents who do not read, and that it is practically impossible to get them toread, let alone like it. This is where high schools have failed most, filledwith teachers who are products of the sixties and reflecting the pallor ofuniversity-level humanities. The old teachers who loved Shakespeare or Austen orDonne, and whose only reward for teaching was the perpetuation of their taste,have all but disappeared.The latest enemy of the vitality of classic texts is feminism. The strugglesagainst elitism and racism in the sixties and seventies had little direct effecton students’ relations to books. The democratization of the university helpeddismantle its structure and caused it to lose its focus. But the activists hadno special quarrel with the classic texts, and they were even a bit infected bytheir Frankfurt School masters’ habit of parading their intimacy with highculture. Radicals had at an earlier stage of egalitarianism already dealt withthe monarchic, aristocratic and antidemocratic character of most literaryclassics by no longer paying attention to their manifest political content.Literary criticism concentrated on the private, the intimate, the feelings,thoughts and relations of individuals, while reducing to the status of aliterary convention of the past the fact that the heroes of many classic workswere soldiers and statesmen engaged in ruling and faced with political problems.Shakespeare, as he has been read for most of this century, does not constitute athreat to egalitarian right thinking. And as for racism, it just did not play arole in the classic literature, at least in the forms in which we are concernedabout it today, and no great work of literature is ordinarily considered racist.But all literature up to today is sexist. The Muses never sang to the poetsabout liberated women. It’s the same old chanson from the Bible and Homerthrough Joyce and Proust. And this is particularly grave for literature, sincethe love interest was most of what remained in the classics after politics waspurged in the academy, and was also what drew students to reading them. Thesebooks appealed to eros while educating it. So activism has been directed againstthe content of books. The latest translation of Biblical text—sponsored by theNational Council of the Churches of Christ—suppresses gender references to God,so that future generations will not have to grapple with the fact that God wasonce a sexist. But this technique has only limited applicability. Another tacticis to expunge the most offensive authors—for example, Rousseau—from theeducation of the young or to include feminist responses in college courses,pointing out the distorting prejudices, and using the books only as evidence ofthe misunderstanding of woman’s nature and the history of injustice to it.Moreover, the great female characters can be used as examples of the variousways women have coped with their enslavement to the sexual role. But never,never, must a student be attracted to those old ways and take them as models forhim or herself. However, all this effort is wasted. Students cannot imagine thatthe old literature could teach them anything about the relations they want tohave or will be permitted to have. So they are indifferent.Having heard over a period of years the same kinds of responses to my questionabout favorite books, I began to ask students who their heroes are. Again, thereis usually silence, and most frequently nothing follows. Why should anyone haveheroes? One should be oneself and not form oneself in an alien mold. Herepositive ideology supports them: their lack of hero-worship is a sign ofmaturity. They posit their own values. They have turned into a channel firstestablished in the Republic by Socrates, who liberated himself from Achilles,and picked up in earnest by Rousseau in Emile. Following on Rousseau, Tolstoydepicts Prince Andrei in War and Peace, who was educated in Plutarch and isalienated from himself by his admiration for Napoleon. But we tend to forgetthat Andrei is a very noble man indeed and that his heroic longings give him asplendor of soul that dwarfs the petty, vain, self-regarding concerns of thebourgeoisie that surrounds him. Only a combination of natural sentiment andunity with the spirit of Russia and its history can, for Tolstoy, produce humanbeings superior to Andrei, and even they are only ambiguously superior. But inAmerica we have only the bourgeoisie, and the love of the heroic is one of thefew counterpoises available to us. In us the contempt for the heroic is only anextension of the perversion of the democratic principle that denies greatnessand wants everyone to feel comfortable in his skin without having to sufferunpleasant comparisons. Students have not the slightest notion of what anachievement it is to free oneself from public guidance and find resources forguidance within oneself. From what source within themselves would they draw thegoals they think they set for themselves? Liberation from the heroic only meansthat they have no resource whatsoever against conformity to the current “rolemodels.” They are constantly thinking of themselves in terms of fixed standardsthat they did not make. Instead of being overwhelmed by Cyrus, Theseus, Moses orRomulus, they unconsciously act out the roles of the doctors, lawyers,businessmen or TV personalities around them. One can only pity young peoplewithout admirations they can respect or avow, who are artificially restrainedfrom the enthusiasm for great virtue.In encouraging this deformity, democratic relativism joins a branch ofconservatism that is impressed by the dangerous political consequences ofidealism. These conservatives want young people to know that this tawdry oldworld cannot respond to their demands for perfection. In the choice between thesomewhat arbitrarily distinguished realism and idealism, a sensible person wouldwant to be both, or neither. But, momentarily accepting a distinction I reject,idealism as it is commonly conceived should have primacy in an education, forman is a being who must take his orientation by his possible perfection. Toattempt to suppress this most natural of all inclinations because of possibleabuses is, almost literally, to throw out the baby with the bath. Utopianism is,as Plato taught us at the outset, the fire with which we must play because it isthe only way we can find out what we are. We need to criticize falseunderstandings of Utopia, but the easy way out provided by realism is deadly. Asit now stands, students have powerful images of what a perfect body is andpursue it incessantly. But deprived of literary guidance, they no longer haveany image of a perfect soul, and hence do not long to have one. They do not evenimagine that there is such a thing.Following on what I learned from this second question, I began asking a third:Who do you think is evil? To this one there is an immediate response: Hitler.(Stalin is hardly mentioned.) After him, who else? Up until a couple of yearsago, a few students said Nixon, but he has been forgotten and at the same timeis being rehabilitated. And there it stops. They have no idea of evil; theydoubt its existence. Hitler is just another abstraction, an item to fill up anempty category. Although they live in a world in which the most terrible deedsare being performed and they see brutal crime in the streets, they turn aside.Perhaps they believe that evil deeds are performed by persons who, if they gotthe proper therapy, would not do them again—that there are evil deeds, not evilpeople. There is no Inferno in this comedy. Thus, the most common student viewlacks an awareness of the depths as well as the heights, and hence lacksgravity."},{"pageContent":"MUSICThough students do not have books, they most emphatically do have music. Nothingis more singular about this generation than its addiction to music. This is theage of music and the states of soul that accompany it. To find a rival to thisenthusiasm, one would have to go back at least a century to Germany and thepassion for Wagner’s operas. They had the religious sense that Wagner wascreating the meaning of life and that they were not merely listening to hisworks but experiencing that meaning. Today, a very large proportion of youngpeople between the ages of ten and twenty live for music. It is their passion;nothing else excites them as it does; they cannot take seriously anything aliento music. When they are in school and with their families, they are longing toplug themselves back into their music. Nothing surrounding them—school, family,church—has anything to do with their musical world. At best that ordinary lifeis neutral, but mostly it is an impediment, drained of vital content, even athing to be rebelled against. Of course, the enthusiasm for Wagner was limitedto a small class, could be indulged only rarely and only in a few places, andhad to wait on the composer’s slow output. The music of the new votaries, on theother hand, knows neither class nor nation. It is available twenty-four hours aday, everywhere. There is the stereo in the home, in the car; there areconcerts; there are music videos, with special channels exclusively devoted tothem, on the air nonstop; there are the Walkmans so that no place—not publictransportation, not the library—prevents students from communing with the Muse,even while studying. And, above all, the musical soil has become tropicallyrich. No need to wait for one unpredictable genius. Now there are many geniuses,producing all the time, two new ones rising to take the place of every fallenhero. There is no dearth of the new and the startling.The power of music in the soul—described to Jessica marvelously by Lorenzo inthe Merchant of Venice—has been recovered after a long period of desuetude. Andit is rock music alone that has effected this restoration. Classical music isdead among the young. This assertion will, I know, be hotly disputed by manywho, unwilling to admit tidal changes, can point to the proliferation oncampuses of classes in classical music appreciation and practice, as well asperformance groups of all kinds. Their presence is undeniable, but they involvenot more than 5 to 10 percent of the students. Classical music is now a specialtaste, like Greek language or pre-Columbian archeology, not a common culture ofreciprocal communication and psychological shorthand. Thirty years ago, mostmiddle-class families made some of the old European music a part of the home,partly because they liked it, partly because they thought it was good for thekids. University students usually had some early emotive association withBeethoven, Chopin and Brahms, which was a permanent part of their makeup and towhich they were likely to respond throughout their lives. This was probably theonly regularly recognizable class distinction between educated and uneducated inAmerica. Many, or even most, of the young people of that generation also swungwith Benny Goodman, but with an element of self-consciousness—to be hip, toprove they weren’t snobs, to show solidarity with the democratic ideal of a popculture out of which would grow a new high culture. So there remained a classdistinction between high and low, although private taste was beginning to createdoubts about whether one really liked the high very much. But all that haschanged. Rock music is as unquestioned and unproblematic as the air the studentsbreathe, and very few have any acquaintance at all with classical music. This isa constant surprise to me. And one of the strange aspects of my relations withgood students I come to know well is that I frequently introduce them to Mozart.This is a pleasure for me, inasmuch as it is always pleasant to give peoplegifts that please them. It is interesting to see whether and in what ways theirstudies are complemented by such music. But this is something utterly new to meas a teacher; formerly my students usually knew much more classical music than Idid.Music was not all that important for the generation of students preceding thecurrent one. The romanticism that had dominated serious music since Beethovenappealed to refinements—perhaps overrefinements—of sentiments that are hardly tobe found in the contemporary world. The lives people lead or wish to lead andtheir prevailing passions are of a different sort than those of the highlyeducated German and French bourgeoisie, who were avidly reading Rousseau andBaudelaire, Goethe and Heine, for their spiritual satisfaction. The music thathad been designed to produce, as well as to please, such exquisite sensibilitieshad a very tenuous relation to American lives of any kind. So romantic musicalculture in America had had for a long time the character of a veneer, as easilysusceptible to ridicule as were Margaret Dumont’s displays of coquettishchasteness, so aptly exploited by Groucho Marx in A Night At The Opera. Inoticed this when I first started teaching and lived in a house for giftedstudents. The “good” ones studied their physics and then listened to classicalmusic. The students who did not fit so easily into the groove, some of them justvulgar and restive under the cultural tyranny, but some of them also serious,were looking for things that really responded to their needs. Almost always theyresponded to the beat of the newly emerging rock music. They were a bit ashamedof their taste, for it was not respectable. But I instinctively sided with thissecond group, with real, if coarse, feelings as opposed to artificial and deadones. Then their musical sans-culotteism won the revolution and reigns unabashedtoday. No classical music has been produced that can speak to this generation.Symptomatic of this change is how seriously students now take the famouspassages on musical education in Plato’s Republic. In the past, students, goodliberals that they always are, were indignant at the censorship of poetry, as athreat to free inquiry. But they were really thinking of science and politics.They hardly paid attention to the discussion of music itself and, to the extentthat they even thought about it, were really puzzled by Plato’s devoting time torhythm and melody in a serious treatise on political philosophy. Theirexperience of music was as an entertainment, a matter of indifference topolitical and moral life. Students today, on the contrary, know exactly whyPlato takes music so seriously. They know it affects life very profoundly andare indignant because Plato seems to want to rob them of their most intimatepleasure. They are drawn into argument with Plato about the experience of music,and the dispute centers on how to evaluate it and deal with it. This encounternot only helps to illuminate the phenomenon of contemporary music, but alsoprovides a model of how contemporary students can profitably engage with aclassic text. The very fact of their fury shows how much Plato threatens what isdear and intimate to them. They are little able to defend their experience,which had seemed unquestionable until questioned, and it is most resistant tocool analysis. Yet if a student can—and this is most difficult and unusual—drawback, get a critical distance on what he clings to, come to doubt the ultimatevalue of what he loves, he has taken the first and most difficult step towardthe philosophic conversion. Indignation is the soul’s defense against the woundof doubt about its own; it reorders the cosmos to support the justice of itscause. It justifies putting Socrates to death. Recognizing indignation for whatit is constitutes knowledge of the soul, and is thus an experience morephilosophic than the study of mathematics. It is Plato’s teaching that music, byits nature, encompasses all that is today most resistent to philosophy. So itmay well be that through the thicket of our greatest corruption runs the path toawareness of the oldest truths.Plato’s teaching about music is, put simply, that rhythm and melody, accompaniedby dance, are the barbarous expression of the soul. Barbarous, not animal. Musicis the medium of the human soul in its most ecstatic condition of wonder andterror. Nietzsche, who in large measure agrees with Plato’s analysis, says inThe Birth of Tragedy (not to be forgotten is the rest of the title, Out of theSpirit of Music) that a mixture of cruelty and coarse sensuality characterizedthis state, which of course was religious, in the service of gods. Music is thesoul’s primitive and primary speech and it is alogon, without articulate speechor reason. It is not only not reasonable, it is hostile to reason. Even whenarticulate speech is added, it is utterly subordinate to and determined by themusic and the passions it expresses.Civilization or, to say the same thing, education is the taming or domesticationof the soul’s raw passions—not suppressing or excising them, which would deprivethe soul of its energy—but forming and informing them as art. The goal ofharmonizing the enthusiastic part of the soul with what develops later, therational part, is perhaps impossible to attain. But without it, man can never bewhole. Music, or poetry, which is what music becomes as reason emerges, alwaysinvolves a delicate balance between passion and reason, and, even in its highestand most developed forms—religious, warlike and erotic—that balance is alwaystipped, if ever so slightly, toward the passionate. Music, as everyoneexperiences, provides an unquestionable justification and a fulfilling pleasurefor the activities it accompanies: the soldier who hears the marching band isenthralled and reassured; the religious man is exalted in his prayer by thesound of the organ in the church; and the lover is carried away and hisconscience stilled by the romantic guitar. Armed with music, man can damnrational doubt. Out of the music emerge the gods that suit it, and they educatemen by their example and their commandments.Plato’s Socrates disciplines the ecstasies and thereby provides littleconsolation or hope to men. According to the Socratic formula, the lyrics—speechand, hence, reason—must determine the music—harmony and rhythm. Pure music cannever endure this constraint. Students are not in a position to know thepleasures of reason; they can only see it as a disciplinary and repressiveparent. But they do see, in the case of Plato, that that parent has figured outwhat they are up to. Plato teaches that, in order to take the spiritualtemperature of an individual or a society, one must “mark the music.” To Platoand Nietzsche, the history of music is a series of attempts to give form andbeauty to the dark, chaotic, premonitory forces in the soul—to make them serve ahigher purpose, an ideal, to give man’s duties a fullness. Bach’s religiousintentions and Beethoven’s revolutionary and humane ones are clear enoughexamples. Such cultivation of the soul uses the passions and satisfies themwhile sublimating them and giving them an artistic unity. A man whose noblestactivities are accompanied by a music that expresses them while providing apleasure extending from the lowest bodily to the highest spiritual, is whole,and there is no tension in him between the pleasant and the good. By contrast aman whose business life is prosaic and unmusical and whose leisure is made up ofcoarse, intense entertainments, is divided, and each side of his existence isundermined by the other.Hence, for those who are interested in psychological health, music is at thecenter of education, both for giving the passions their due and for preparingthe soul for the unhampered use of reason. The centrality of such education wasrecognized by all the ancient educators. It is hardly noticed today that inAristotle’s Politics the most important passages about the best regime concernmusical education, or that the Poetics is an appendix to the Politics. Classicalphilosophy did not censor the singers. It persuaded them. And it gave them agoal, one that was understood by them, until only yesterday. But those who donot notice the role of music in Aristotle and despise it in Plato went to schoolwith Hobbes, Locke and Smith, where such considerations have become unnecessary.The triumphant Enlightenment rationalism thought that it had discovered otherways to deal with the irrational part of the soul, and that reason needed lesssupport from it. Only in those great critics of Enlightenment and rationalism,Rousseau and Nietzsche, does music return, and they were the most musical ofphilosophers. Both thought that the passions—and along with them theirministerial arts—had become thin under the rule of reason and that, therefore,man himself and what he sees in the world have become correspondingly thin. Theywanted to cultivate the enthusiastic states of the soul and to re-experience theCorybantic possession deemed a pathology by Plato. Nietzsche, particularly,sought to tap again the irrational sources of vitality, to replenish ourdried-up stream from barbaric sources, and thus encouraged the Dionysian and themusic derivative from it.This is the significance of rock music. I do not suggest that it has any highintellectual sources. But it has risen to its current heights in the educationof the young on the ashes of classical music, and in an atmosphere in whichthere is no intellectual resistance to attempts to tap the rawest passions.Modern-day rationalists, such as economists, are indifferent to it and what itrepresents. The irrationalists are all for it. There is no need to fear that“the blond beasts” are going to come forth from the bland souls of ouradolescents. But rock music has one appeal only, a barbaric appeal, to sexualdesire—not love, not eros, but sexual desire undeveloped and untutored. Itacknowledges the first emanations of children’s emerging sensuality andaddresses them seriously, eliciting them and legitimating them, not as littlesprouts that must be carefully tended in order to grow into gorgeous flowers,but as the real thing. Rock gives children, on a silver platter, with all thepublic authority of the entertainment industry, everything their parents alwaysused to tell them they had to wait for until they grew up and would understandlater.Young people know that rock has the beat of sexual intercourse. That is whyRavel’s Bolero is the one piece of classical music that is commonly known andliked by them. In alliance with some real art and a lot of pseudo-art, anenormous industry cultivates the taste for the orgiastic state of feelingconnected with sex, providing a constant flood of fresh material for voraciousappetites. Never was there an art form directed so exclusively to children.Ministering to and according with the arousing and cathartic music, the lyricscelebrate puppy love as well as polymorphous attractions, and fortify themagainst traditional ridicule and shame. The words implicitly and explicitlydescribe bodily acts that satisfy sexual desire and treat them as its onlynatural and routine culmination for children who do not yet have the slightestimagination of love, marriage or family. This has a much more powerful effectthan does pornography on youngsters, who have no need to watch others do grosslywhat they can so easily do themselves. Voyeurism is for old perverts; activesexual relations are for the young. All they need is encouragement.The inevitable corollary of such sexual interest is rebellion against theparental authority that represses it. Selfishness thus becomes indignation andthen transforms itself into morality. The sexual revolution must overthrow allthe forces of domination, the enemies of nature and happiness. From love comeshate, masquerading as social reform. A worldview is balanced on the sexualfulcrum. What were once unconscious or half-conscious childish resentmentsbecome the new Scripture. And then comes the longing for the classless,prejudice-free, conflictless, universal society that necessarily results fromliberated consciousness—“We Are the World,” a pubescent version of Alle Menschenwerden Brüder, the fulfillment of which has been inhibited by the politicalequivalents of Mom and Dad. These are the three great lyrical themes: sex, hateand a smarmy, hypocritical version of brotherly love. Such polluted sourcesissue in a muddy stream where only monsters can swim. A glance at the videosthat project images on the wall of Plato’s cave since MTV took it over sufficesto prove this. Hitler’s image recurs frequently enough in exciting contexts togive one pause. Nothing noble, sublime, profound, delicate, tasteful or evendecent can find a place in such tableaux. There is room only for the intense,changing, crude and immediate, which Tocqueville warned us would be thecharacter of democratic art, combined with a pervasiveness, importance andcontent beyond Tocqueville’s wildest imagination.Picture a thirteen-year-old boy sitting in the living room of his family homedoing his math assignment while wearing his Walkman headphones or watching MTV.He enjoys the liberties hard won over centuries by the alliance of philosophicgenius and political heroism, consecrated by the blood of martyrs; he isprovided with comfort and leisure by the most productive economy ever known tomankind; science has penetrated the secrets of nature in order to provide himwith the marvelous, lifelike electronic sound and image reproduction he isenjoying. And in what does progress culminate? A pubescent child whose bodythrobs with orgasmic rhythms; whose feelings are made articulate in hymns to thejoys of onanism or the killing of parents; whose ambition is to win fame andwealth in imitating the drag-queen who makes the music. In short, life is madeinto a nonstop, commercially prepackaged masturbational fantasy.This description may seem exaggerated, but only because some would prefer toregard it as such. The continuing exposure to rock music is a reality, not oneconfined to a particular class or type of child. One need only ask first-yearuniversity students what music they listen to, how much of it and what it meansto them, in order to discover that the phenomenon is universal in America, thatit begins in adolescence or a bit before and continues through the collegeyears. It is the youth culture and, as I have so often insisted, there is now noother countervailing nourishment for the spirit. Some of this culture’s powercomes from the fact that it is so loud. It makes conversation impossible, sothat much of friendship must be without the shared speech that Aristotle assertsis the essence of friendship and the only true common ground. With rock,illusions of shared feelings, bodily contact and grunted formulas, which aresupposed to contain so much meaning beyond speech, are the basis of association.None of this contradicts going about the business of life, attending classes anddoing the assignments for them. But the meaningful inner life is with the music.This phenomenon is both astounding and indigestible, and is hardly noticed,routine and habitual. But it is of historic proportions that a society’s bestyoung and their best energies should be so occupied. People of futurecivilizations will wonder at this and find it as incomprehensible as we do thecaste system, witch-burning, harems, cannibalism and gladiatorial combats. Itmay well be that a society’s greatest madness seems normal to itself. The childI described has parents who have sacrificed to provide him with a good life andwho have a great stake in his future happiness. They cannot believe that themusical vocation will contribute very much to that happiness. But there isnothing they can do about it. The family spiritual void has left the field opento rock music, and they cannot possibly forbid their children to listen to it.It is everywhere; all children listen to it; forbidding it would simply causethem to lose their children’s affection and obedience. When they turn on thetelevision, they will see President Reagan warmly grasping the daintilyproffered gloved hand of Michael Jackson and praising him enthusiastically.Better to set the faculty of denial in motion—avoid noticing what the words say,assume the kid will get over it. If he has early sex, that won’t get in the wayof his having stable relationships later. His drug use will certainly stop atpot. School is providing real values. And popular historicism provides the finalsalvation: there are new life-styles for new situations, and the oldergeneration is there not to impose its values but to help the younger one to findits own. TV, which compared to music plays a comparatively small role in theformation of young people’s character and taste, is a consensus monster—theRight monitors its content for sex, the Left for violence, and many otherinterested sects for many other things. But the music has hardly been touched,and what efforts have been made are both ineffectual and misguided about thenature and extent of the problem.The result is nothing less than parents’ loss of control over their children’smoral education at a time when no one else is seriously concerned with it. Thishas been achieved by an alliance between the strange young males who have thegift of divining the mob’s emergent wishes—our versions of Thrasymachus,Socrates’ rhetorical adversary—and the record-company executives, the new robberbarons, who mine gold out of rock. They discovered a few years back thatchildren are one of the few groups in the country with considerable disposableincome, in the form of allowances. Their parents spend all they have providingfor the kids. Appealing to them over their parents’ heads, creating a world ofdelight for them, constitutes one of the richest markets in the postwar world.The rock business is perfect capitalism, supplying to demand and helping tocreate it. It has all the moral dignity of drug trafficking, but it was sototally new and unexpected that nobody thought to control it, and now it is toolate. Progress may be made against cigarette smoking because our absence ofstandards or our relativism does not extend to matters of bodily health. In allother things the market determines the value. (Yoko Ono is among America’s smallgroup of billionaires, along with oil and computer magnates, her late husbandhaving produced and sold a commodity of worth comparable to theirs.) Rock isvery big business, bigger than the movies, bigger than professional sports,bigger than television, and this accounts for much of the respectability of themusic business. It is difficult to adjust our vision to the changes in theeconomy and to see what is really important. McDonald’s now has more employeesthan U.S. Steel, and likewise the purveyors of junk food for the soul havesupplanted what still seem to be more basic callings.This change has been happening for some time. In the late fifties, De Gaullegave Brigitte Bardot one of France’s highest honors. I could not understandthis, but it turned out that she, along with Peugeot, was France’s biggestexport item. As Western nations became more prosperous, leisure, which had beenput off for several centuries in favor of the pursuit of property, the means toleisure, finally began to be of primary concern. But, in the meantime, anynotion of the serious life of leisure, as well as men’s taste and capacity tolive it, had disappeared. Leisure became entertainment. The end for which theyhad labored for so long has turned out to be amusement, a justified conclusionif the means justify the ends. The music business is peculiar only in that itcaters almost exclusively to children, treating legally and naturally imperfecthuman beings as though they were ready to enjoy the final or completesatisfaction. It perhaps thus reveals the nature of all our entertainment andour loss of a clear view of what adulthood or maturity is, and our incapacity toconceive ends. The emptiness of values results in the acceptance of the naturalfacts as the ends. In this case infantile sexuality is the end, and I suspectthat, in the absence of other ends, many adults have come to agree that it is.It is interesting to note that the Left, which prides itself on its criticalapproach to “late capitalism” and is unrelenting and unsparing in its analysisof our other cultural phenomena, has in general given rock music a free ride.Abstracting from the capitalist element in which it flourishes, they regard itas a people’s art, coming from beneath the bourgeoisie’s layers of culturalrepression. Its antinomianism and its longing for a world without constraintmight seem to be the clarion of the proletarian revolution, and Marxistscertainly do see that rock music dissolves the beliefs and morals necessary forliberal society and would approve of it for that alone. But the harmony betweenthe young intellectual Left and rock is probably profounder than that. HerbertMarcuse appealed to university students in the sixties with a combination ofMarx and Freud. In Eros and Civilization and One Dimensional Man he promisedthat the overcoming of capitalism and its false consciousness will result in asociety where the greatest satisfactions are sexual, of a sort that thebourgeois moralist Freud called polymorphous and infantile. Rock music touchesthe same chord in the young. Free sexual expression, anarchism, mining of theirrational unconscious and giving it free rein are what they have in common. Thehigh intellectual life I shall describe in Part Two and the low rock world arepartners in the same entertainment enterprise. They must both be interpreted asparts of the cultural fabric of late capitalism. Their success comes from thebourgeois’ need to feel that he is not bourgeois, to have undangerousexperiments with the unlimited. He is willing to pay dearly for them. The Leftis better interpreted by Nietzsche than by Marx. The critical theory of latecapitalism is at once late capitalism’s subtlest and crudest expression.Anti-bourgeois ire is the opiate of the Last Man.This strong stimulant, which Nietzsche called Nihiline, was for a very longtime, almost fifteen years, epitomized in a single figure, Mick Jagger. Ashrewd, middle-class boy, he played the possessed lower-class demon andteen-aged satyr up until he was forty, with one eye on the mobs of children ofboth sexes whom he stimulated to a sensual frenzy and the other eye winking atthe unerotic, commercially motivated adults who handled the money. In his act hewas male and female, heterosexual and homosexual; unencumbered by modesty, hecould enter everyone’s dreams, promising to do everything with everyone; and,above all, he legitimated drugs, which were the real thrill that parents andpolicemen conspired to deny his youthful audience. He was beyond the law, moraland political, and thumbed his nose at it. Along with all this, there were nastylittle appeals to the suppressed inclinations toward sexism, racism andviolence, indulgence in which is not now publicly respectable. Nevertheless, hemanaged not to appear to contradict the rock ideal of a universal classlesssociety founded on love, with the distinction between brotherly and bodilyblurred. He was the hero and the model for countless young persons inuniversities, as well as elsewhere. I discovered that students who boasted ofhaving no heroes secretly had a passion to be like Mick Jagger, to live hislife, have his fame. They were ashamed to admit this in a university, although Iam not certain that the reason has anything to do with a higher standard oftaste. It is probably that they are not supposed to have heroes. Rock musicitself and talking about it with infinite seriousness are perfectly respectable.It has proved to be the ultimate leveler of intellectual snobbism. But it is notrespectable to think of it as providing weak and ordinary persons with afashionable behavior, the imitation of which will make others esteem them andboost their own self-esteem. Unaware and unwillingly, however, Mick Jaggerplayed the role in their lives that Napoleon played in the lives of ordinaryyoung Frenchmen throughout the nineteenth century. Everyone else was so boringand unable to charm youthful passions. Jagger caught on.In the last couple of years, Jagger has begun to fade. Whether Michael Jackson,Prince or Boy George can take his place is uncertain. They are even weirder thanhe is, and one wonders what new strata of taste they have discovered. Althougheach differs from the others, the essential character of musical entertainmentis not changing. There is only a constant search for variations on the theme.And this gutter phenomenon is apparently the fulfillment of the promise made byso much psychology and literature that our weak and exhausted Westerncivilization would find refreshment in the true source, the unconscious, whichappeared to the late romantic imagination to be identical to Africa, the darkand unexplored continent. Now all has been explored; light has been casteverywhere; the unconscious has been made conscious, the repressed expressed.And what have we found? Not creative devils, but show business glitz. MickJagger tarting it up on the stage is all that we brought back from the voyage tothe underworld.My concern here is not with the moral effects of this music—whether it leads tosex, violence or drugs. The issue here is its effect on education, and I believeit ruins the imagination of young people and makes it very difficult for them tohave a passionate relationship to the art and thought that are the substance ofliberal education. The first sensuous experiences are decisive in determiningthe taste for the whole of life, and they are the link between the animal andspiritual in us. The period of nascent sensuality has always been used forsublimation, in the sense of making sublime, for attaching youthful inclinationsand longings to music, pictures and stories that provide the transition to thefulfillment of the human duties and the enjoyment of the human pleasures.Lessing, speaking of Greek sculpture, said “beautiful men made beautifulstatues, and the city had beautiful statues in part to thank for beautifulcitizens.” This formula encapsulates the fundamental principle of the estheticeducation of man. Young men and women were attracted by the beauty of heroeswhose very bodies expressed their nobility. The deeper understanding of themeaning of nobility comes later, but is prepared for by the sensuous experienceand is actually contained in it. What the senses long for as well as what reasonlater sees as good are thereby not at tension with one another. Education is notsermonizing to children against their instincts and pleasures, but providing anatural continuity between what they feel and what they can and should be. Butthis is a lost art. Now we have come to exactly the opposite point. Rock musicencourages passions and provides models that have no relation to any life theyoung people who go to universities can possibly lead, or to the kinds ofadmiration encouraged by liberal studies. Without the cooperation of thesentiments, anything other than technical education is a dead letter.Rock music provides premature ecstasy and, in this respect, is like the drugswith which it is allied. It artificially induces the exaltation naturallyattached to the completion of the greatest endeavors—victory in a just war,consummated love, artistic creation, religious devotion and discovery of thetruth. Without effort, without talent, without virtue, without exercise of thefaculties, anyone and everyone is accorded the equal right to the enjoyment oftheir fruits. In my experience, students who have had a serious fling withdrugs—and gotten over it—find it difficult to have enthusiasms or greatexpectations. It is as though the color has been drained out of their lives andthey see everything in black and white. The pleasure they experienced in thebeginning was so intense that they no longer look for it at the end, or as theend. They may function perfectly well, but dryly, routinely. Their energy hasbeen sapped, and they do not expect their life’s activity to produce anythingbut a living, whereas liberal education is supposed to encourage the belief thatthe good life is the pleasant life and that the best life is the most pleasantlife. I suspect that the rock addiction, particularly in the absence of strongcounterattractions, has an effect similar to that of drugs. The students willget over this music, or at least the exclusive passion for it. But they will doso in the same way Freud says that men accept the reality principle—as somethingharsh, grim and essentially unattractive, a mere necessity. These students willassiduously study economics or the professions and the Michael Jackson costumewill slip off to reveal a Brooks Brothers suit beneath. They will want to getahead and live comfortably. But this life is as empty and false as the one theyleft behind. The choice is not between quick fixes and dull calculation. This iswhat liberal education is meant to show them. But as long as they have theWalkman on, they cannot hear what the great tradition has to say. And, after itsprolonged use, when they take it off, they find they are deaf."},{"pageContent":"RELATIONSHIPSSELF-CENTEREDNESSStudents these days are, in general, nice. I choose the word carefully. They arenot particularly moral or noble. Such niceness is a facet of democraticcharacter when times are good. Neither war nor tyranny nor want has hardenedthem or made demands on them. The wounds and rivalries caused by classdistinction have disappeared along with any strong sense of class (as it onceexisted in universities in America and as it still does, poisonously, inEngland). Students are free of most constraints, and their families makesacrifices for them without asking for much in the way of obedience or respect.Religion and national origin have almost no noticeable effect on their sociallife or their career prospects. Although few really believe in “the system,”they do not have any burning sentiment that injustice is being done to them. Thedrugs and the sex once thought to be forbidden are available in the quantitiesrequired for sensible use. A few radical feminists still feel the old-timereligion, but most of the women are comfortably assured that not much stands inthe way of their careers. There is an atmosphere of easy familiarity with theirelders, and even of the kind of respect of free young people for them thatTocqueville asserted equality encourages. Above all, there are none of thelongings, romantic or otherwise, that used to make bourgeois society, or societyin general, repugnant to the young. The impossible dreams of the sixties provedto be quite possible within the loosened fabric of American life. Students thesedays are pleasant, friendly and, if not great-souled, at least not particularlymean-spirited. Their primary preoccupation is themselves, understood in thenarrowest sense.I had a revelatory experience when I chatted quite frankly one evening with agroup of bright students at an Ivy League college where I was a visitingprofessor for a short time. I had succeeded in establishing a certain commonground with them in class, for serious reading of Plato frequently has theeffect of making students speak, at least for the moment, outside of theirconventions. We had a farewell picnic and the atmosphere was easy and conduciveto candor. Somewhat disingenuously I introduced some themes into theconversation about which I was eager to know the current state of opinion. I hadbeen primed for this encounter by a conversation I had had the previous eveningat a dinner with members of the faculty and the administration. The wife of oneof the high officials told me of her son’s activities. He had a law degree, but,she said, he and his friends had little ambition and had moved from one thing toanother. She did not seem to be very distressed by his behavior—perhaps even abit proud of it—a modern parent willing to believe in the superiority of theyounger generation to her own, especially when the former is most disrespectfulof the latter’s standards. So I asked her why she thought they behaved this way.She responded firmly, quietly and without hesitation, “Fear of nuclear war.”This prompted me to ask my group of students whether they were frightened ofnuclear war. The response was a universal, somewhat embarrassed giggle. Theyknew what their daily thoughts were about, and those thoughts had hardlyanything to do with public questions. And they also knew that there are a greatmany right-thinking adults who expect them to use the nuclear threat as anexcuse for demanding a transformation of the world political order and who alsowant to produce their maimed souls in evidence against our politicians’ madpursuit of the “arms race.” Students today—and I have now asked the questionover and over again—are morally unpretentious, and they look at themselves withirony when it comes to the big moral questions. Some look back with nostalgia atstudents of the sixties as persons who believed in something. The prospect ofbeing drafted to fight in Vietnam was really frightening. But youngsters todayare, with few exceptions, no more taken in by the psychological quacks whoexplain their apathy with respect to nuclear war as “denial,” who enlist sciencein the service of proving that there are causes without effects, than was theAmerican public by a President who tried to persuade it that he sat arounddiscussing nuclear war with his little daughter. Their concerns lie elsewhere.There is, indeed, a certain listlessness about them, an absence of a broad viewof the future, but it is as plausible to attribute that to the lack of afrontier to conquer in the American West, or the death of God, as to fear ofnuclear war.It is difficult to say just why this generation tends to be so honest incomparison with the preceding one. And, of course, there are plenty of publicposturers among them, as is evident from the vote of the student body at Brown(an institution that was at the forefront of dismantling liberal education inthe sixties), which demanded that cyanide be made available by the university incase of nuclear attack. This was a “statement” telling us all about the tormentto which we subject young people. But the great majority of students, althoughthey as much as anyone want to think well of themselves, are aware that they arebusy with their own careers and their relationships. There is a certain rhetoricof self-fulfillment that gives a patina of glamor to this life, but they can seethat there is nothing particularly noble about it. Survivalism has taken theplace of heroism as the admired quality. This turning in on themselves is not,as some would have it, a return to normalcy after the hectic fever of thesixties, nor is it preternatural selfishness. It is a new degree of isolationthat leaves young people with no alternative to looking inward. The things thatalmost naturally elicit attention to broader concerns are simply not present.Starvation in Ethiopia, mass murder in Cambodia, as well as nuclear war, are allreal calamities worthy of attention. But they are not immediate, not organicallyconnected to students’ lives. The affairs of daily life rarely involve concernfor a larger community in such a way as to make the public and private merge inone’s thought. It is not merely that one is free to participate or not toparticipate, that there is no need to do so, but that everything militatesagainst one’s doing so. Tocqueville describes the tip of the iceberg of advancedegalitarianism when he discusses the difficulty that a man without family lands,or a family tradition for whose continuation he is responsible, will have inavoiding individualism and seeing himself as an integral part of a past and afuture, rather than as an anonymous atom in a merely changing continuum. Themodern economic principle that private vice makes public virtue has penetratedall aspects of daily life in such a way that there seems to be no reason to be aconscious part of civic existence. As Saul Bellow has put it, public virtue is akind of ghost town into which anyone can move and declare himself sheriff.Country, religion, family, ideas of civilization, all the sentimental andhistorical forces that stood between cosmic infinity and the individual,providing some notion of a place within the whole, have been rationalized andhave lost their compelling force. America is experienced not as a common projectbut as a framework within which people are only individuals, where they are leftalone. To the extent that there is a project, it is to put those who are said tobe disadvantaged in a position to live as they please too. The advanced Lefttalks about self-fulfillment; the Right, in its most popular form, isLibertarian, i.e., the right-wing form of the Left, in favor of everybody’sliving as he pleases. The only forms of intrusion on the private-lifecharacteristic of liberal democracies—taxes and military service—are not nowpresent in student life. If there is an inherent political impulse in man, it iscertainly being frustrated. But this impulse has already been so attenuated bymodernity that it is hardly experienced.Students may indeed feel a sense of impotence, a sense that they have little orno influence over the collective life, but essentially they live comfortablywithin the administrative state that has replaced politics. Nuclear war isindeed a frightening prospect, but only when it appears imminent does it crosstheir minds. Even such a powerful, concerted effort as the nuclear-freezecommotion, with its attendant entertainments like The Day After, has nothing todo with the lives students lead and is little more than a distraction. Very fewof them are destined for a political life; and if they do actually enterpolitics, it is by accident, and does not follow from their early training orexpectations. In the universities about which I am speaking, there are almost nostudents born of families that have inherited the privilege and responsibilityof public service, for almost no such families remain. Neither duty nor pleasureinvolves students with the political, and our lives exhibit in the extreme whatBurke and Tocqueville said about the disappearance of citizens and statesmen.The petty personal interests of youth—“making it,” finding a place foroneself—persevere throughout life. The honesty of this generation of studentscauses them to laugh when asked to act as though they were powerful agents inworld history. They know the truth of Tocqueville’s dictum that “in democraticsocieties, each citizen is habitually busy with the contemplation of a verypetty object, which is himself,” a contemplation now intensified by a greaterindifference to the past and the loss of a national view of the future. The onlycommon project engaging the youthful imagination is the exploration of space,which everyone knows to be empty.The resulting inevitable individualism, endemic to our regime, has beenreinforced by another unintended and unexpected development, the decline of thefamily, which was the intermediary between individual and society, providingquasi-natural attachments beyond the individual, that gave men and womenunqualified concern for at least some others and created an entirely differentrelation to society from that which the isolated individual has. Parents,husbands, wives and children are hostages to the community. They palliateindifference to it and provide a material stake in its future. This is not quiteinstinctive love of country, but it is love of country for love of one’s own. Itis the gentle form of patriotism, one that flows most easily out ofself-interest, without the demand for much self-denial. The decay of the familymeans that community would require extreme self-abnegation in an era when thereis no good reason for anything but self-indulgence.Apart from the fact that many students have experienced the divorce of theirparents and are informed by statistics that there is a strong possibility ofdivorce in their futures, they hardly have an expectation that they will have tocare for their parents or any other blood relatives, or that they will even seemuch of them as they grow older. Social security, retirement funds and healthinsurance for old people free their children from even having to give themfinancial support, let alone taking them into their own homes to live. When achild goes away to college, it is really the beginning of the end of his vitalconnection with his family, though he scarcely realizes it at the time. Parentshave little authority over their children when they leave home, and the childrenare forced to look outward and forward. They are not coldhearted; the substanceof their interests merely lies elsewhere. Spiritually, the family was prettyempty, anyway, and new objects fill their field of vision as the old ones fade.American geography plays a role in this separation. This is a large country, andpeople are very mobile, particularly since World War II and the expansion of airtravel. Practically no student knows where he is going to live when he hascompleted his education. Very likely it will be far away from his parents andhis birthplace. In Canada or France, by contrast, even if the same fundamentalcultural winds are blowing, people have almost no place to go. For anEnglish-speaking Canadian born in Toronto there is, practically speaking, onlyVancouver as an attractive alternative, and for a Parisian there is noalternative whatsoever. The unlimited, or dissolving, horizon, which is thehallmark of our age, is in these places somewhat less visible. People are notreally more rooted in them, but they are stuck. Hence they continue to see theirrelatives and all the people they grew up with. Their landscape is unchanging.But a young American really begins all over again, and everything is open. Hecan live in the North, South, East or West, in the city, the suburbs, or thecountry—who knows which? There are arguments for each, and he is absolutelyunconstrained in his choice. The accidents of where he finds a job and ofvariable inclination are likely to take him far away from all he has beenconnected with, and he is psychically prepared for this. His investments in hispast and those who peopled it are necessarily limited.This indeterminate or open-ended future and the lack of a binding past mean thatthe souls of young people are in a condition like that of the first men in thestate of nature—spiritually unclad, unconnected, isolated, with no inherited orunconditional connection with anything or anyone. They can be anything they wantto be, but they have no particular reason to want to be anything in particular.Not only are they free to decide their place, but they are also free to decidewhether they will believe in God or be atheists, or leave their options open bybeing agnostic; whether they will be straight or gay, or, again, keep theiroptions open; whether they will marry and whether they will stay married;whether they will have children—and so on endlessly. There is no necessity, nomorality, no social pressure, no sacrifice to be made that militates going in orturning away from any of these directions, and there are desires pointing towardeach, with mutually contradictory arguments to buttress them. The young areexaggerated versions of Plato’s description of the young in democracies: [The democratic youth] lives along day by day, gratifying the desire that occursto him, at one time drinking and listening to the flute, at another downingwater and reducing, now practicing gymnastic, and again idling and neglectingeverything; and sometimes spending his time as though he were occupied withphilosophy. Often he engages in politics and, jumping up, says and does whateverchances to come to him; and if he admires any soldiers, he turns in thatdirection; and if it’s moneymakers, in that one, and there is neither order nornecessity in his life, but calling it sweet, free and blessed, he follows itthroughout. (Republic, 561c-d) Why are we surprised that such unfurnished persons should be preoccupiedprincipally with themselves and with finding means to avoid permanent free fall?No wonder that the one novel that remains continuously popular with students isCamus’s The Stranger.EQUALITYIn addition to their self-ironical niceness, the other striking quality of thesestudents is their egalitarianism. Whatever their politics, they believe that allmen—and women—are created equal and have equal rights. It is more than a belief,it is an instinct, felt in their bones. Whenever they meet anyone,considerations of sex, color, religion, family, money, nationality, play no rolein their reactions. The very understanding that such considerations once reallycounted for something has departed; it belongs to mythology. This may seemsurprising inasmuch as there is such interest in roots, ethnicity and thesacred—the things that once separated men. But it is precisely because they areno longer real that they fascinate. A real Italian immigrant in 1920 did notworry about ethnicity. He had it, and although he was an American, his life wasby necessity and choice Italian, and he lived with Italians. His grandson atHarvard today might wish to recover Italianness—the social disadvantages ofwhich his father struggled to shake off—but his friends will be the individualshe likes, willy-nilly, not because of his Italian origin but as a result of thecommon features of American life. His sexual attractions, and hence hismarriage, will not be influenced by his national origin or even by histraditional Catholicism. And this will not be because he is attracted byopposites or is trying to join the establishment. It is simply because suchthings do not really count now, even if there is a conscious effort to make themcount. There is no society out there that will banish him for marrying out oforder, or even parents who will object very strenuously. He is not in anyimportant way looked on as an Italian by his peers. Even if students have goneto parochial schools, where they were religiously and in effect ethnicallysegregated, the general culture usually prevails, and when they enter theuniversity they almost immediately find themselves associating primarily withthose who were formerly outsiders to them. They simply drop their culturalbaggage. There is none of the solemnity of the interfaith or interethnicget-togethers I knew as a child, where people who felt themselves to be verydifferent and who were quite often both prejudiced and victims of prejudice,pointed piously to the brotherhood of man. These kids just do not haveprejudices against anyone. Whether this is because man has been reduced to anaked animal without any of the trappings of civilization that differentiatehim, or because we have recognized our essential humankindness, is a matter ofinterpretation. But the fact is that everyone is an individual—if not veryindividual—in our major universities. They are all just persons. Being human isenough for what is important. It does not occur to students to think that any ofthe things that classically divided people, even in egalitarian America, shouldkeep them away from anyone else.Thus Harvard, Yale and Princeton are not what they used to be—the last resortsof aristocratic sentiment within the democracy. The differentiations based onold family or old wealth have vanished. The old wounds that used to be inflictedby the clubbable on the unclubbable, in our muted version of the English classsystem, have healed because the clubs are not anything to be cared aboutseriously. All this began after World War II, with the GI Bill. College was foreveryone. And the top universities gradually abandoned preference for thechildren of their alumni and the exclusion of outsiders, especially Jews.Academic records and tests became the criterion for selection. New kinds ofpreference—particularly for blacks—replaced the old ones, which were classpreserving, whereas these are class destroying. Now the student bodies of allthe major universities are pretty much alike, drawn from the best applicants,with “good” meaning good at the academic disciplines. There is hardly a Harvardman or a Yale man any more. No longer do any universities have the vocation ofproducing gentlemen as well as scholars. Snobbism of the old sort is dead. Ofcourse students are, no matter what they say, proud to be at one of these selectuniversities. They are distinguished by it. But they believe, and they areprobably right, that they are there not because of anything other than naturaltalent and hard work at their earlier studies. To the extent that their parents’wealth may have contributed to their excelling in high school whereas poorerchildren were disadvantaged, they believe this to be a social injustice. Butthey are not very much bothered, at least not so far as whites are concerned,for the country is largely middle class now, and scholarship aid is easilyavailable for those unable to pay. They see around them students who come fromall kinds of families. Very few feel themselves culturally deprived, outsiderslooking resentfully in at the privileged whose society is closed to them. Norare there social climbers, for there is no vision of a high society into whichto climb. Similarly, there are no longer schools of thought, as there alwaysused to be, that despise democracy and equality. Again, World War II finishedall that. All the students are egalitarian meritocrats, who believe eachindividual should be allowed to develop his special—and unequal—talents withoutreference to race, sex, religion, family, wealth or national origin. This is theonly form of justice they know, and they cannot even imagine that there could beany substantial argument in favor of aristocracy or monarchy. These wereinexplicable follies of the past.Again, although the difference between girls and boys still has a livingmeaning—unlike the difference between Jew and Catholic, German and Irish, oldfamily and new family, which are mere memories of their parents’ day and do notconstitute differences in present way of life—students take women’s equality ineducation, their legitimate pursuit of exactly the same careers as men and theirequal and often superior performance in them, completely in stride. There are nojokes, no self-consciousness, in short, no awareness that this state of affairsis any less normal in human history than is breathing. None of their beliefsresult from principle, a project, an effort. They are pure feeling, a way oflife, the actualization of the democratic dream of each man taken as man, theessential, abstracted from everything else. Except no abstraction is takingplace. Contrary to fashionable opinion, universities are melting pots, no matterwhat may be true of the rest of society. Ethnicity is no more important a factthan tall or short, black-haired or blond. What these young people have incommon infinitely outweighs what separates them. The quest for traditions andrituals both proves my point and may teach something about the price paid forthis homogenization. The lack of prejudice is a result of students’ failing tosee differences and of the gradual eradication of differences. When studentstalk about one another, one almost never hears them saying things that divideothers into groups or kinds. They always speak about the individual. Thesensitivity to national character, sometimes known as stereotyping, hasdisappeared.RACEThe one eccentric element in this portrait, the one failure—a particularly graveone inasmuch as it was the part most fraught with hope—is the relation betweenblacks and whites. White and black students do not in general become realfriends with one another. Here the gulf of difference has proved unbridgeable.The forgetting of race in the university, which was predicted and confidentlyexpected when the barriers were let down, has not occurred. There is now a largeblack presence in major universities, frequently equivalent to their proportionin the general population. But they have, by and large, proved indigestible.Most keep to themselves. White students act as though their relations with blackstudents were just as immediate and unself-conscious as with others (includingOrientals). But although the words are right, the music is off-key. Here thereis an atmosphere of right-thinking, principle and project—of effort rather thaninstinct. The automatic character of current student camaraderie is absent; andthe really intimate attachment that knows no barriers stops here. Theprogrammatic brotherhood of the sixties did not culminate in integration butveered off toward black separation. White students feel uncomfortable about thisand do not like to talk about it. This is not the way things are supposed to be.It does not fit their prevailing view that human beings are all pretty muchalike, and that friendship is another aspect of equal opportunity. They pretendnot to notice the segregated tables in dining halls where no white student wouldcomfortably sit down. This is only one of the more visible aspects of aprevailing segregation in the real life of universities—which includesseparation in housing and in areas of study, particularly noticeable in thepaucity of blacks in theoretical sciences and humanities. The universities areformally integrated, and blacks and whites are used to seeing each other. Butthe substantial human contact, indifferent to race, soul to soul, that prevailsin all other aspects of student life simply does not usually exist between thetwo races. There are exceptions, perfectly integrated black students, but theyare rare and in a difficult position.I do not believe this somber situation is the fault of the white students, whoare rather straightforward in such matters and frequently embarrassingly eagerto prove their liberal credentials in the one area where Americans areespecially sensitive to a history of past injustice. These students have madethe adjustment, without missing a beat, to a variety of religions andnationalities, the integration of Orientals and the change in women’saspirations and roles. It would require a great deal of proof to persuade methat they remain subtly racist. Although preferential treatment of blacks goesagainst a deep-seated conviction that equal rights belong to individuals and arecolor-blind, white students have been willing by and large to talk themselvesinto accepting affirmative action as a temporary measure on the way to equality.Still this makes them uncomfortable because, although they are very used topropaganda and to the imposition of new moralities on them, in daily life theylike to act as they think and feel. And they do not think that black isbeautiful any more than they think white is beautiful, and they do not thinkthat a student who is not qualified is qualified. So the tendency among whitestudents is to suppress the whole question, act as though it were not there, andassociate with the minority of blacks who want to be associated with and forgetthe rest. They cannot befriend blacks as blacks, and the heady days of a commonpurpose are gone. The discriminatory laws are ancient history, and there arelarge numbers of blacks in the universities. There is nothing more that whitestudents can do to make great changes in their relations to black students.Thus, just at the moment when everyone else has become a “person,” blacks havebecome blacks. I am not speaking about doctrine, although there was muchdoctrine at the beginning, but about feeling. “They stick together” was a phraseoften used in the past by the prejudiced about this or that distinctive group,but it has become true, by and large, of the black students. In general, theexpectation of anything other than routine contact in classes or at campusjobs—usually quite polite—has vanished. This is peculiar inasmuch as race isless spiritually substantial than religion, and also inasmuch as integration wasboth the goal and the practice of blacks in universities prior to the latesixties, when numbers were smaller and human difficulties greater. Further, itis peculiar in that blacks seem to be the only group that has picked up“ethnicity”—the discovery or the creation of the sixties—in an instinctive way.At the same time, there has been a progressive abandonment on their part ofbelief or interest in a distinctive black “culture.” Blacks are not sharing aspecial positive intellectual or moral experience; they partake fully in thecommon culture, with the same goals and tastes as everyone else, but they aredoing it by themselves. They continue to have the inward sentiments ofseparateness caused by exclusion when it no longer effectively exists. The heatis under the pot, but they do not melt as have all other groups.There are obviously some good reasons for this, and it is the right of any partof the large community in a pluralistic society to separate itself. But themovement of the blacks goes counter not only to that of the rest of society, andtends to put them at odds with it, but also to their own noblest claims andtraditions in this country. And it is connected with a dangerous severing of theraces in the intellectual world, where there can be no justification forseparatism and where the ideal of common humanity must prevail. Theconfrontations and indignations of the political realm have become firmly fixedin the university. For this the university’s loss of conviction in itsuniversalizing mission must bear a part of the blame. Since the end of World WarII there was in most major universities an effort—ever increasing inintensity—to educate more blacks, in the sincere American belief that educationis good and the inclusion of blacks at the highest levels of intellectualachievement would be decisive in the resolving the American dilemma. Practicallynobody hesitated, and there were private discussions about whether, at least inthe beginning, standards should not be informally lowered for talented butdeprived blacks in order to help them catch up. Decent men took different sideson this question, some believing that blacks, for the sake of the example theywere to set and for their own self-respect, should be held to the higheststandards of achievement, others believing that gains would be incremental overgenerations. No person of goodwill doubted that one way or another it would workout, that what had happened with respect to religion and nationality would alsohappen with race. At the peak of the civil rights movement there was a sense ofurgency about enrolling greater numbers of blacks in order to prove the absenceof discrimination. A sign of the times was the reappearance of pictures onapplications so that blacks could be identified, whereas pictures had beenbanished a decade previously so that blacks could not be identified. High schoolrecords and standardized tests began to be criticized as insufficient guides toreal talent. But the goal was unchanged—to educate black students as any studentis educated and to evaluate them according to the same standards. Everyone wasstill integrationist. The belief was that insufficient energy had been devotedto the recruitment of talented black students. Cornell, where I taught forseveral years, was one of many institutions that announced great increases ingoals for enrollment of blacks. The president, adding a characteristic twist,also announced that not only would it seek blacks, but that it would find themnot among privileged blacks but in the inner cities. At the beginning of the1967 academic year there were many more blacks on campus and, of course, inorder to get so many, particularly poor blacks, standards of admission hadsilently and drastically been altered. Nothing had been done to prepare thesestudents for the great intellectual and social challenges awaiting them in theuniversity. Cornell now had a large number of students who were manifestlyunqualified and unprepared, and therefore it faced an inevitable choice: failmost of them or pass them without their having learned. Moralism and pressrelations made the former intolerable; the latter was only partially possible(it required consenting faculty and employers after college who expected andwould accept incompetence) and was unbearably shameful to black students anduniversity alike. It really meant that blacks would be recognizably second-classcitizens.Black power, which hit the universities like a tidal wave at just that moment,provided a third way. Integrationism was just an ideology for whites and UncleToms. Who says that what universities teach is the truth rather than just themyths necessary to support the system of domination? Black students aresecond-class not because they are academically poor but because they are beingforced to imitate white culture. Relativism and Marxism made some of this claimbelievable. And the discomfort of the times made it more so. Blacks were to beproud, and from them the university could learn its failings. Such a perspectivewas decidedly attractive to the kids who were the victims of the university’smanipulations. Courses in black studies and black English, and many other suchconcessions, became the way out. It was hopefully assumed that these would notfundamentally transform the university or the educational goals of blackstudents. They were merely supposed to be an enrichment. But this was really acop-out, and the license for a new segregationism that would allow the whiteimpresarios to escape from the corner they had painted themselves into. The waywas opened for black students to live and study the black experience, to becomfortable, rather than be constrained by the learning accessible to man asman.When the black students at Cornell became aware that they could intimidate theuniversity and that they were not just students but negotiating partners in theprocess of determining what an education is, they demanded the dismissal of thetough-minded, old-style integrationist black woman who was assistant dean ofstudents. In short order the administration complied with this demand. From thatmoment on, the various conciliatory arrangements with which we are now sofamiliar came into being.The black studies programs largely failed because what was serious in them didnot interest the students, and the rest was unprofitable hokum. So theuniversity curriculum returned to a debilitated normalcy. But a kind of blackdomain, not quite institutional, but accepted, a shadow of the university life,was created: permanent quotas in admission, preference in financial assistance,racially motivated hiring of faculty, difficulty in giving blacks failing marks,and an organized system of grievance and feeling aggrieved. And everywherehypocrisy, contempt-producing lies about what is going on and how the wholescheme is working. This little black empire has gained its legitimacy from thealleged racism surrounding it and from which it defends its subjects. Itsvisible manifestations are to be found in those separate tables in the dininghalls, which reproduce the separate facilities of the Jim Crow South. At Cornelland elsewhere, the black militants had to threaten—and to do—bodily harm toblack students with independent inclinations in order to found this system. Nowthe system is routine. For the majority of black students, going to theuniversity is therefore a different experience from that of the other students,and the product of the education is also different. The black student who wishesto be just a student and to avoid allegiance to the black group has to pay aterrific price, because he is judged negatively by his black peers and becausehis behavior is atypical in the eyes of whites. White students have silently andunconsciously adjusted to a group presence of blacks, and they must readjust fora black who does not define himself by the group. He is painfully conscious thatmany whites, well-meaning ones, judge him by special standards. All this isdaunting. The university’s acquiescence in the interference with its primaryresponsibility of providing educational opportunity to those capable ofeducation should be a heavy burden on its collective conscience.Affirmative action now institutionalizes the worst aspects of separatism. Thefact is that the average black student’s achievements do not equal those of theaverage white student in the good universities, and everybody knows it. It isalso a fact that the university degree of a black student is also tainted, andemployers look on it with suspicion, or become guilty accomplices in thetoleration of incompetence. The worst part of all this is that the blackstudents, most of whom avidly support this system, hate its consequences. Adisposition composed of equal parts of shame and resentment has settled on manyblack students who are beneficiaries of preferential treatment. They do not likethe notion that whites are in the position to do them favors. They believe thateveryone doubts their merit, their capacity for equal achievement. Theirsuccesses become questionable in their own eyes. Those who are good studentsfear that they are equated with those who are not, that their hard-woncredentials are not credible. They are the victims of a stereotype, but one thathas been chosen by black leadership. Those who are not good students, but havethe same advantages as those who are, want to protect their position but arehaunted by the sense of not deserving it. This gives them a powerful incentiveto avoid close associations with whites, who might be better qualified than theyare and who might be looking down on them. Better to stick together, so thesesubtle but painful difficulties will not arise. It is no surprise that extremistblack politics now gets a kind of support among middle and upper-class blacksunheard of in the past. The common source that united the races at the peaks inthe past has been polluted. Reason cannot accommodate the claims of any kind ofpower whatever, and democratic society cannot accept any principle ofachievement other than merit. White students, as I have said, do not reallybelieve in the justice of affirmative action, do not wish to deal with thefacts, and turn without mentioning it to their all-white—or, rather, becausethere are now so many Orientals, non-black—society. Affirmative action (quotas),at least in universities, is the source of what I fear is a long-termdeterioration of the relations between the races in America.SEXContrary to the popular prejudice that America is the nation of unintellectualand anti-intellectual people, where ideas are at best means to ends, America isactually nothing but a great stage on which theories have been played as tragedyand comedy. This is a regime founded by philosophers and their students. All therecalcitrant matter of the historical is gave way here before the practical andphilosophical ought to be, as the raw natural givens of this wild continentmeekly submitted to the yoke of theoretical science. Other peoples wereautochthonous, deriving guidance from the gods of their various places. Whenthey too decided to follow the principles we pioneered, they hobbled alongawkwardly, unable to extricate themselves gracefully from their pasts. Our storyis the majestic and triumphant march of the principles of freedom and equality,giving meaning to all that we have done or are doing. There are almost noaccidents; everything that happens among us is a consequence of one or both ofour principles—a triumph over some opposition to them, a discovery of a freshmeaning in them, a dispute about which of the two has primacy, etc.Now we have arrived at one of the ultimate acts in our drama, the informing andreforming of our most intimate private lives by our principles. Sex and itsconsequences—love, marriage and family—have finally become the theme of thenational project, and here the problem of nature, always present but alwaysrepressed in the reconstruction of man demanded by freedom and equality, becomesinsistent. In order to intuit the meaning of equality, we have no need for thewild imaginative genius of Aristophanes, who in The Assembly of Women contrivesthe old hags entitled by law to sexual satisfaction from handsome young males,or of Plato, who in the Republic prescribed naked exercises for men and womentogether. We only have to look around us, if we have eyes to see.The change in sexual relations, which now provide an unending challenge to humaningenuity, came over us in two successive waves in the last two decades. Thefirst was the sexual revolution; the second, feminism. The sexual revolutionmarched under the banner of freedom; feminism under that of equality. Althoughthey went arm in arm for a while, their differences eventually put them at oddswith each other, as Tocqueville said freedom and equality would always be. Thisis manifest in the squabble over pornography, which pits liberated sexual desireagainst feminist resentment about stereotyping. We are presented with theamusing spectacle of pornography clad in armor borrowed from the heroicstruggles for freedom of speech, and using Miltonic rhetoric, doing battle withfeminism, newly draped in the robes of community morality, using argumentsassociated with conservatives who defend traditional sex roles, and also defyingan authoritative tradition in which it was taboo to suggest any relation betweenwhat a person reads and sees and his sexual practices. In the background standthe liberals, wringing their hands in confusion because they wish to favor bothsides and cannot.Sexual liberation presented itself as a bold affirmation of the senses and ofundeniable natural impulse against our puritanical heritage, society’sconventions and repressions, bolstered by Biblical myths about original sin.From the early sixties on there was a gradual testing of the limits on sexualexpression, and they melted away or had already disappeared without anybody’shaving noticed it. The disapproval of parents and teachers of youngsters’sleeping or living together was easily overcome. The moral inhibitions, the fearof disease, the risk of pregnancy, the family and social consequences ofpremarital intercourse and the difficulty of finding places in which to haveit—everything that stood in its way suddenly was no longer there. Students,particularly the girls, were no longer ashamed to give public evidence of sexualattraction or of its fulfillment. The kind of cohabitations that were dangerousin the twenties, and risqué or bohemian in the thirties and forties, became asnormal as membership in the Girl Scouts. I say “particularly” girls becauseyoung men were always supposed to be eager for immediate gratification, whereasyoung women, inspired by modesty, were supposed to resist it. It was amodification or phasing out of female modesty that made the new arrangementspossible. Since, however, modesty was supposed to be mere convention or habit,no effort was required to overcome it. This emancipation had in its intentionand its effect the accentuation of the difference between the sexes. Making lovewas to be the primary activity, so men and women were to be more emphaticallymale and female. Of course, homosexuals were also liberated, but for the greatmass of people, being free and natural meant achieving heterosexualsatisfactions, opposite sexes made for each other.The immediate promise of sexual liberation was, simply, happiness understood asthe release of energies that had been stored up over millennia during the darknight of repression, in a great continuous Bacchanalia. However, the lionroaring behind the door of the closet turned out, when that door was opened, tobe a little, domesticated cat. In fact, seen from a long historical perspective,sexual liberation might be interpreted as the recognition that sexual passion isno longer dangerous in us, and that it is safer to give it free course than torisk rebellion by restraining it. I once asked a class how it could be that nottoo long ago parents would have said, “Never darken our door again,” to waywarddaughters, whereas now they rarely protest when boyfriends sleep over in theirhomes. A very nice, very normal, young woman responded, “Because it’s no bigdeal.” That says it all. This passionlessness is the most striking effect, orrevelation, of the sexual revolution, and it makes the younger generation moreor less incomprehensible to older folks.In all this, the sexual revolution was precisely what it said it was—aliberation. But some of the harshness of nature asserted itself beneath theshattered conventions: the young were more apt to profit from the revolutionthan the old, the beautiful more than the ugly. The old veil of discretion hadhad the effect of making these raw and ill-distributed natural advantages lessimportant in life and marriage. But now there was little attempt to applyegalitarian justice in these matters, as did Aristophanes’ older Athenian womenwho, because of their very repulsiveness, had a right to enjoy handsome youngmen before beautiful young women did. The undemocratic aspects of free sex werecompensated for in our harmless and mildly ridiculous way: “Beauty is in the eyeof the beholder” was preached more vigorously than formerly; the cosmeticsindustry had a big boom; and education and therapy in the style of Masters andJohnson, promising great orgasms to every subscriber, became common. My favoritewas a course in sex for the elderly given at a local YMCA and advertised overthe radio with the slogan “Use It or Lose It.” These were the days whenpornography slipped its leash.Feminism, on the other hand, was, to the extent it presented itself asliberation, much more a liberation from nature than from convention or society.Therefore it was grimmer, unerotic, more of an abstract project, and requirednot so much the abolition of law but the institution of law and politicalactivism. Instinct did not suffice. The negative sentiment of imprisonment wasthere, but what was wanted, as Freud suggested, was unclear. The programmaticlanguage shifted from “living naturally” (with reference to very definite bodilyfunctions) to vaguer terms such as “self-definition,” “self-fulfillment,”“establishing priorities,” “fashioning a lifestyle,” etc. The women’s movementis not founded on nature. Although feminism sees the position of women as aresult of nurture and not nature, its crucial contention is that biology shouldnot be destiny, and biology is surely natural. It is not self-evident, althoughit may be true, that women’s roles were always determined by human relations ofdomination, like those underlying slavery. This thesis requires interpretationand argument, and is not affirmed by the bodily desires of all concerned, as wasthe sexual revolution. Moreover, it is very often asserted that science’sconquest of nature—in the form of the pill and labor-saving devices—has madewoman’s emancipation from the home possible. It is certain that feminism hasbrought with it an unrelenting process of consciousness-raising and changingthat begins in what is probably a permanent human inclination and is surely amodern one—the longing for the unlimited, the unconstrained. It ends, as do manymodern movements that seek abstract justice, in forgetting nature and usingforce to refashion human beings to secure that justice.Feminism is in accord with and encourages many elements of the sexualrevolution, but uses them to different ends. Libertinism allows for what evenRousseau called the greatest pleasure. But in making sex easy, it cantrivialize, de-eroticize and demystify sexual relations. A woman who can easilysatisfy her desires and does not invest her emotions in exclusive relationshipsis liberated from the psychological tyranny of men, to do more important things.Feminism acted as a depressant on the Bacchanalian mood of the sexualrevolution, as nakedness in Plato’s Republic led not to great indulgences but toan unromantic regulation and manipulation of sexual desire for public purposes.Just as smoking and drinking overcame puritanical condemnation only to findthemselves, after a brief moment of freedom, under equally moralistic attacks inthe name not of God but of the more respectable and powerful names of health andsafety, so sex had a short day in the sun before it had to be reined in toaccommodate the feminist sensibility. As a people, we are good not at gratifyingourselves but at delaying gratification for the sake of projects which promisefuture good. In this case the project is overcoming what is variously calledmale dominance, machismo, phallocracy, patriarchy, etc., to which men and theirfemale collaborators seem very attached, inasmuch as so many machines of warmust be mounted against them.Male sexual passion has become sinful again because it culminates in sexism.Women are made into objects, they are raped by their husbands as well as bystrangers, they are sexually harassed by professors and employers at school andat work, and their children, whom they leave in day-care centers in order topursue their careers, are sexually abused by teachers. All these crimes must belegislated against and punished. What sensitive male can avoid realizing howdangerous his sexual passion is? Is there perhaps really original sin? Men hadfailed to read the fine print in the Emancipation Proclamation. The newinterference with sexual desire is more comprehensive, more intense, moredifficult to escape than the older conventions, the grip of which was sorecently relaxed. The July 14 of the sexual revolution was really only a daybetween the overthrow of the Ancien Régime and the onset of the Terror. The newreign of virtue, accompanied by relentless propaganda on radio and televisionand in the press, has its own catechism, inducing an examination of theconscience and the inmost sentiments for traces of possessiveness, jealousy,protectiveness—all those things men used to feel for women. There are, ofcourse, a multitude of properly indignant censors equipped with loudspeakers andinquisitional tribunals.Central to the feminist project is the suppression of modesty, in which thesexual revolution played a critical preparatory role, just as capitalism, in theMarxist scheme, prepared the way for socialism by tearing the sacred veils fromthe charade of feudal chivalry. The sexual revolution, however, wanted men andwomen to get together bodily, while feminism wanted them to be able easily toget along separately. Modesty in the old dispensation was the female virtue,because it governed the powerful desire that related men to women, providing agratification in harmony with the procreation and rearing of children, the riskand responsibility of which fell naturally—that is, biologically—on women.Although modesty impeded sexual intercourse, its result was to make suchgratification central to a serious life and to enhance the delicate interplaybetween the sexes, which makes acquiescence of the will as important aspossession of the body. Diminution or suppression of modesty certainly makesattaining the end of desire easier—which was the intention of the sexualrevolution—but it also dismantles the structure of involvement and attachment,reducing sex to the thing-in-itself. This is where feminism enters.Female modesty extends sexual differentiation from the sexual act to the wholeof life. It makes men and women always men and women. The consciousness ofdirectedness toward one another, and its attractions and inhibitions, informevery common deed. As long as modesty operates, men and women together are neverjust lawyers or pilots together. They have something else, always potentiallyvery important, in common—ultimate ends, or as they say, “life goals.” Iswinning this case or landing this plane what is most important, or is it loveand family? As lawyers or pilots, men and women are the same, subservient to theone goal. As lovers or parents they are very different, but inwardly related bysharing the naturally given end of continuing the species. Yet their workingtogether immediately poses the questions of “roles” and, hence, “priorities,” ina way that men working together or women working together does not. Modesty is aconstant reminder of their peculiar relatedness and its outer forms and innersentiments, which impede the self’s free creation or capitalism’s technicaldivision of labor. It is a voice constantly repeating that a man and a womanhave a work to do together that is far different from that found in themarketplace, and of a far greater importance.This is why modesty is the first sacrifice demanded by Socrates in Plato’sRepublic for the establishment of a city where women have the same education,live the same lives and do the same jobs as men. If the difference between menand women is not to determine their ends, if it is not to be more significantthan the difference between bald men and men with hair, then they must strip andexercise naked together just as Greek men did. With some qualifications,feminists praise this passage in Plato and look upon it as prescient, for itculminates in an absolute liberation of women from the subjection of marriageand childbearing and-rearing, which become no more important than any othernecessary and momentary biological event. Socrates provides birth control,abortion and day-care centers, as well as marriages that last a day or a nightand have as their only end the production of sound new citizens to replenish thecity’s stock, cared for by the city. He even adds infanticide to the list ofconveniences available. A woman will probably have to spend no more time andeffort on children’s business than a man would in curing a case of the measles.Only then can women be thought to be naturally fit to do the same things as men.Socrates’ radicalism extends to the relation of parent and child. The citizensare not to know their own children, for, if they were to love them above others,then the means that brought them into being, the intercourse of this man andthis woman, would be judged to be of special significance. Then we would be backto the private family and the kinds of relatedness peculiar to it.Socrates’ proposal especially refers to one of the most problematic cases forthose who seek equal treatment for women—the military. These citizens arewarriors, and he argues that just as women can be liberated from subjection tomen and take their places alongside them, men must be liberated from theirspecial concern for women. A man must have no more compunction about killing theadvancing female enemy than the male, and he must be no more protective of theheroine fighting on his right side than of the hero on his left. Equalopportunity and equal risk. The only concern is the common good, and the onlyrelationship is to the community, bypassing the intermediate relationships thattend to take on a life of their own and were formerly thought to have naturalroots in sexual attraction and love of one’s own children. Socrates consciouslyrips asunder the delicate web of relations among human beings woven out of theirsexual nature. Without it, the isolation of individuals is inevitable. He makesexplicit how equal treatment of women necessitates the removal of meaning fromthe old kind of sexual relations—whether they were founded on nature orconvention—and a consequent loss of the human connections that resulted fromthem which he replaces with the common good of the city.In this light we can discern the outlines of what has been going on recentlyamong us. Conservatives who have been heartened by the latest developmentswithin the women’s movement are mistaken if they think that they and themovement are on common ground. Certainly both sides are against pornography. Butthe feminists are against it because it is a reminiscence of the old loverelationship, which involved differentiated sexual roles—roles now interpretedas bondage and domination. Pornography demystifies that relationship, leavingthe merely sexual component of male-female relationships without their erotic,romantic, moral and ideal accompaniments. It caters to and encourages thelonging men have for women and its unrestrained if impoverished satisfaction.This is what feminist anti-pornographers are against—not the debasement ofsentiment or the threat to the family. That is why they exempt homosexualpornography from censorship. It is by definition not an accomplice to thedomination of females by males and even helps to undermine it. Actually,feminists favor the demystifying role of pornography. It unmasks the true natureof the old relationships. Their purpose is not to remystify the worn-out systemsbut to push on toward the realm of freedom. They are not for a return to the oldromances, Brief Encounter, for example, which gave charm to love in the old way.They know that is dead, and they are now wiping up the last desperate,untutored, semicriminal traces of a kind of desire that no longer has a place inthe world.It is one thing, however, to want to prevent women from being ravished andbrutalized because modesty and purity should be respected and their weaknessprotected by responsible males, and quite another to protect them from maledesire altogether so that they can live as they please. Feminism makes use ofconservative moralism to further its own ends. This is akin to, and actuallypart of, the fatal old alliance between traditional conservatives and radicals,which has had such far-reaching effects for more than a century. They hadnothing in common but their hatred of capitalism, the conservatives looking backto the revival of throne and altar in the various European nations, and topiety, the radicals looking forward to the universal, homogeneous society and tofreedom—reactionaries and progressives united against the present. They feed offthe inner contradictions of the bourgeoisie. Of course fundamentalists andfeminists can collaborate to pass local ordinances banning smut, but thefeminists do so to demonstrate their political clout in furthering theircampaign against “bourgeois rights,” which are, sad to say, enjoyed by peoplewho want to see dirty movies or buy equipment to act out comically distortedfantasies. It is doubtful whether the fundamentalists gain much from this deal,because it guarantees the victory of a surging moral force that is “antifamilyand antilife.” See how they do together on the abortion issue! People who watchpornography, on the other hand, are always at least a little ashamed andunwilling to defend it as such. At best, they sound a weak and uncertain trumpetfor the sanctity of the Constitution and the First Amendment, of which they hopeto be perceived as defenders. They pose no threat in principle to anything.Similarly, some conservatives are heartened by recent feminist discussion aboutthe differences between men and women and about the special fulfillment of“parenting,” forbidden subjects at earlier stages of the movement, when equalrights was the primary theme. However, this discussion has really only been madepossible by the success of those earlier stages. There may indeed be a femininenature or self, but it has been definitively shaken loose from its teleologicalmoorings. The feminine nature is not in any reciprocal relation to the malenature, and they do not define one another. The male and female sexual organsthemselves now have no more evident purposiveness than do white and black skin,are no more naturally pointed toward one another than white master and blackslave, or so the legend goes. Women do have different physical structures, butthey can make of them what they will—without paying a price. The feminine natureis a mystery to be worked out on its own, which can now be done because the maleclaim to it has been overcome. The fact that there is today a more affirmativedisposition toward childbearing does not imply that there is any natural impulseor compulsion to establish anything like a traditional fatherhood to complementmotherhood. The children are to be had on the female’s terms, with or withoutfathers, who are not to get in the way of the mother’s free development.Children have always been, and still are, more the mother’s anyway. Ninety percent or more of children of divorced parents stay with their mothers, whosepreeminent stake in children has been enhanced by feminist demands and by aconsequent easy rationalization of male irresponsibility. So we havereproduction without family—if family includes the presence of a male who hasany kind of a definite function. The return to motherhood as a feminist ideal isonly possible because feminism has triumphed over the family as it was onceknown, and women’s freedom will not be limited by it. None of this meansreturning to family values or even bodes particularly well for the family as aninstitution, although it does mean that women have become freer to come to termswith the complexity of their situation.The uneasy bedfellowship of the sexual revolution and feminism produced an oddtension in which all the moral restraints governing nature disappeared, but sodid nature. The exhilaration of liberation has evaporated, however, for it isunclear what exactly was liberated or whether new and more onerousresponsibilities have not been placed on us. And this is where we return to thestudents, for whom everything is new. They are not sure what they feel for oneanother and are without guidance about what to do with whatever they may feel.The students of whom I am speaking are aware of all the sexual alternatives, andhave been from very early on in their lives, and they feel that all sexual actswhich do not involve real harm to others are licit. They do not think theyshould feel guilt or shame about sex. They have had sex education in school, of“the biological facts, let them decide the values for themselves” variety, ifnot “the options and orientations” variety. They have lived in a world where themost explicit discussions and depictions of sex are all around them. They havehad little fear of venereal disease.1 Birth-control devices and ready abortionhave been available to them since puberty. For the great majority, sexualintercourse was a normal part of their lives prior to college, and there was nofear of social stigma or even much parental opposition. Girls have had lesssupervision in their relations with boys than at any time in history. They arenot precisely pagan, but there is an easy familiarity with others’ bodies andless inhibition about using their own for a broad range of erotic purposes.There is no special value placed on virginity in oneself or in one’s partners.It is expected that there were others before and, incredibly to older folks,this does not seem to bother them, even though it provides a ground forpredictions about the future. They are not promiscuous or given to orgies orcasual sex, as it used to be understood. In general, they have one connection ata time, but most have had several serially. They are used to coed dormitories.Many live together, almost always without expectation of marriage. It is just aconvenient arrangement. They are not couples in the sense of having simulacra ofmarriage or a way of life different from that of other students not presently soattached. They are roommates, which is what they call themselves, with sex andutilities included in the rent. Every single obstacle to sexual relationshipsbetween young unmarried persons has disappeared, and these relationships areroutine. To strangers from another planet, what would be the most striking thingis that sexual passion no longer includes the illusion of eternity.Men and women are now used to living in exactly the same way and studyingexactly the same things and having exactly the same career expectations. No manwould think of ridiculing a female premed or prelaw student, or believe thatthese are fields not proper for women, or assert that a woman should put familybefore career. The law schools and medical schools are full of women, and theirnumbers are beginning to approach their proportion in the general population.There is very little ideology or militant feminism in most of the women, becausethey do not need it. The strident voices are present, and they get attention inthe university newspapers and in student governments. But, again, the battlehere has been won. Women students do not generally feel discriminated against ordespised for their professional aspirations. The economy will absorb them, andthey have rising expectations. They do not need the protection of NOW any morethan do women in general, who see they are doing at least as well with Reagan asthey did with Carter. Academically, students are comfortably unisexual; theyrevert to dual sexuality only for the sex act. Sex no longer has any politicalagenda in universities except among homosexuals, who are not yet quite satisfiedwith their situation. But the fact that there is an open homosexual presence,with rights at least formally recognized by university authorities and almostall students, tells us much about current university life.Students today understandably believe that they are the beneficiaries ofprogress. They have a certain benign contempt for their parents, particularlyfor their poor mothers, who were sexually inexperienced and had no profession tobe taken as seriously as their fathers’. Superior sexual experience was alwaysone of the palpable advantages that parents and teachers had over youngsters whowere eager to penetrate the mysteries of life. But this is no longer the case,nor do students believe it to be so. They quietly smile at professors who try toshock them or talk explicitly about the facts of life in the way once soeffective in enticing more innocent generations of students to pay attention tothe words of their elders. Freud and D. H. Lawrence are very old hat. Better notto try.Even less do students expect to learn anything about their situation from oldliterature, which from the Garden of Eden on made coupling a very dark andcomplicated business. On reflection, today’s students wonder what all the fusswas about. Many think their older brothers and sisters discovered sex, as we nowknow it to be, in the sixties. I was impressed by students who, in a course onRousseau’s Confessions, were astounded to learn that he had lived with a womanout of wedlock in the eighteenth century. Where could he have gotten the idea?There is, of course, literature that affects a generation profoundly but has nointerest at all for the next generation because its central theme provedephemeral, whereas the greatest literature addresses the permanent problems ofman. Ibsen’s Ghosts, for example, lost all its force for young people whensyphilis ceased to be a threat. Aristotle teaches that pity for the plight ofothers requires that the same thing could happen to us. Now, however, the samethings that used to happen to people, at least in the relations between thesexes, do not happen to students anymore. And one must begin to wonder whetherthere is any permanent literature for them, because there do not seem to them tobe permanent problems for them. As I have suggested earlier, this is the firstfully historical or historicized generation, not only in theory but also inpractice, and the result is not the cultivation of the vastest sympathies forlong ago and far away, but rather an exclusive interest in themselves. AnnaKarenina and Madame Bovary are adulteresses, but the cosmos no longer rebels attheir deed. Anna’s son today would probably have been awarded to her in theamicable divorce arrangements of the Karenins. All the romantic novels withtheir depictions of highly differentiated men and women, their steamy,sublimated sensuality and their insistence on the sacredness of the marriagebond just do not speak to any reality that concerns today’s young people.Neither do Romeo and Juliet, who must struggle against parental opposition,Othello and his jealousy, or Miranda’s carefully guarded innocence. SaintAugustine, as a seminarian told me, had sexual hang-ups. And let us not speak ofthe Bible, every no in which is now a yes. With the possible exception ofOedipus, they are all gone, and they departed in the company of modesty.When young people today have crushing problems in what used to be called sexualrelationships, they cannot trace them back to any moral ambiguity in man’ssexual nature. That was, of course, what was erroneously done in the past.SEPARATENESSCivilization has seemingly led us around full circle, back to the state ofnature taught to us by the founding fathers of modern thought. But now it ispresent not in rhetoric but in reality. Those who first taught the state ofnature proposed it as a hypothesis. Liberated from all the conventionalattachments to religion, country and family that men actually did have, howwould they live and how would they freely reconstruct those attachments? It wasan experiment designed to make people recognize what they really care about andengage their loyalties on the basis of this caring. But a young person today, toexaggerate only a little, actually begins de novo, without the givens orimperatives that he would have had only yesterday. His country demands little ofhim and provides well for him, his religion is a matter of absolutely freechoice and—this is what is really fresh—so are his sexual involvements. He cannow choose, but he finds he no longer has a sufficient motive for choice that ismore than whim, that is binding. Reconstruction is proving impossible.The state of nature should culminate in a contract, which constitutes a societyout of individuals. A contract requires not only a common interest between thecontracting parties but also an authority to enforce its fulfillment by them. Inthe absence of the former, there is no relationship; in the absence of thelatter, there can be no trust, only diffidence. In the state of natureconcerning friendships and love today, there is doubt about both, and the resultis a longing for the vanished common ground, called roots, without the means torecover it, and timidity and self-protectiveness in associations guaranteed byneither nature nor convention. The pervasive feeling that love and friendshipare groundless, perhaps the most notable aspect of the current feeling ofgroundlessness, has caused them to give way to the much vaguer and more personalidea of commitment, that choice in the void whose cause resides only in the willor the self. The young want to make commitments, which constitute the meaning oflife, because love and nature do not suffice. This is what they talk about, butthey are haunted by the awareness that the talk does not mean very much and thatcommitments are lighter than air.At the origins of modern natural rights teachings, freedom and equality werepolitical principles intended to bring both justice and effectiveness to therelationships of ruling and being ruled, which in the conventional order wereconstituted by pretended rights of strength, wealth, tradition, age and birth.The relations of king and subject, master and slave, lord and vassal, patricianand pleb, rich and poor, were revealed to be purely manmade and hence notmorally binding, apart from the consent of the parties to them, which became theonly source of political legitimacy. Civil society was to be reconstructed onthe natural ground of man’s common humanity. Then it would appear that allrelationships or relatedness within civil society would also depend on the freeconsent of individuals. Yet the relationships between man and woman, parent andchild, are less doubtfully natural and less arguably conventional than therelations between rulers and ruled, especially as they are understood by modernnatural rights teachings. They cannot be understood simply as contractualrelationships, as resulting from acts of human freedom, since they would therebylose their character and dissolve. Instead they seem to constrain that freedom,to argue against the free arrangements of consent dominant in the politicalorder. But it is difficult to argue that nature both does and does not prescribecertain relations in civil society. The radical transformation of the relationsbetween men and women and parents and children was the inevitable consequence ofthe success of the new politics of consent.It might be said, with some exaggeration, that the first state-of-natureteachers paid little attention to the natural teleology of sex because they wereprimarily concerned with analyzing away the false appearances of teleology inthe existing political arrangements. (I mean by teleology nothing but theevident, everyday observation and sense of purposiveness, which may be onlyillusory, but which ordinarily guides human life, the kind everyone sees in thereproductive process.) Hobbes and Locke marshaled their great talents to explodemyths of rulership that protected corrupt and selfish regimes, such as Menenius’tale: There was a time when all the body’s membersRebelled against the belly; thus accused it:That only like a gulf it did remainI’ the midst o’ the body, idle and unactive,Still cupboarding the viand, never bearingLike labor with the rest; where the other instrumentsDid see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,And, mutually participate, did ministerUnto the appetite and affection commonOf the whole body. The belly answered …To the discontented members, the mutinous partsThat envied his receipt; even so most fitlyAs you malign our senators for thatThey are not such as you …‘True is it, my incorporate friends,’ quoth he,‘That I receive the general food at firstWhich you do live upon; and fit it is,Because I am the storehouse and the shopOf the whole body. But, if you do remember,I send it through the rivers of your blood,Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o’ the brain;And, through the cranks and offices of man,The strongest nerves and small inferior veinsFrom me receive that natural competencyWhereby they live. And …… though all at once cannotSee what I do deliver out to each,Yet I can make my audit up, that allFrom me do back receive the flour of all,And leave me but the bran….The senators of Rome are this good belly,And you the mutinous members; for, examineTheir counsels and their cares, digest things rightlyTouching the weal o’ the common, you shall findNo public benefit which you receiveBut it proceeds or comes from them to you,And no way from yourselves.(Shakespeare, Coriolanus, 1. 95-156)In the place of such an “organic” tale they provided a rational account oflegitimacy that made each individual the judge of his own best interests andgave him the right to choose rulers who were bound to protect him, abstractingfrom the habits of thought and feeling that permitted patricians under thecolors of the common good to make use of plebs for their own greedy purposes.Hobbes and Locke gave the plebs equal rights to selfishness. The ruled are notdirected by nature to the rulers any more than the rulers naturally care onlyfor the good of the ruled. Rulers and ruled can consciously craft a compact bywhich the separate interests of each are protected. But they are never one,sharing the same highest end, like the organs in Menenius’ body. There is nobody politic, only individuals who have come together voluntarily and canseparate voluntarily without maiming themselves.Hobbes and Locke supposed that, although the political order would beconstituted out of individuals, the subpolitical units would remain largelyunaffected. Indeed, they counted on the family, as an intermediate betweenindividual and the state, partially to replace what was being lost in passionateattachment to the polity. The immediate and reliable love of one’s own property,wife and children can more effectively counterpoise purely individualselfishness than does the distant and abstract love of country. Moreover,concern for the safety of one’s family is a powerful reason for loyalty to thestate, which protects them. The nation as a community of families is a formulathat until recently worked very well in the United States. However, it is veryquestionable whether this solution is viable over the very long run, becausethere are two contrary views of nature present here. And, as the politicalphilosophers have always taught, the one that is authoritative in the politicalregime will ultimately inform its parts. In the social contract view, nature hasnothing to say about relationships and rank order; in the older view, which ispart and parcel of ancient political philosophy, nature is prescriptive. Are therelations between men and women and parents and children determined by naturalimpulse or are they the product of choice and consent? In Aristotle’s Politics,the subpolitical or prepolitical family relations point to the necessity ofpolitical rule and are perfected by it, whereas in the state-of-natureteachings, political rule is derived entirely from the need for protection ofindividuals, bypassing their social relations completely. Are we dealing withpolitical actors or with men and women? In the former case, persons are free toconstruct whatever relations they please with one another; in the latter, priorto any choice, a preexisting frame largely determines the relations of men andwomen.There are three classic images of the polity that clarify this issue. The firstis the ship of state, which is one thing if it is to be forever at sea, andquite another if it is to reach port and the passengers go their separate ways.They think about one another and their relationships on the ship verydifferently in the two cases. The former case is the ancient city; the latter,the modern state. The other two images are the herd and the hive, which opposeeach other. The herd may need a shepherd, but each of the animals is grazing foritself and can easily be separated from the herd. In the hive, by contrast,there are workers, drones and a queen; there is a division of labor and aproduct toward which they all work in common; separation from the hive isextinction. The herd is modern, the hive ancient. Of course, neither image is anaccurate description of human society. Men are neither atoms nor parts of abody. But this is why there have to be such images, since for the brutes thesethings are not a matter for discussion or deliberation. Man is ambiguous. In thetightest communities, at least since the days of Odysseus, there is something inman that wants out and senses that his development is stunted by being just apart of a whole, rather than a whole itself. And in the freest and mostindependent situations men long for unconditional attachments. The tensionbetween freedom and attachment, and attempts to achieve the impossible union ofthe two, are the permanent condition of man. But in modern political regimes,where rights precede duties, freedom definitely has primacy over community,family and even nature.The spirit of this choice must inevitably penetrate into all the details oflife. The ambiguity of man is well illustrated in the sexual passion and thesentiments that accompany it. Sex may be treated as a pleasure out of which menand women may make what they will, its promptings followed or rejected, itsforms matters of taste, its importance or unimportance in life decided freely byindividuals. As such, at least according to thinkers like Hobbes and Locke, itwould have to give precedence to objective natural necessity, to the imperativesof self-love or self-preservation. Or sex can be immediately constitutive of awhole law of life, to which self-preservation is subordinated and in which love,marriage and the rearing of infants is the most important business. It cannot beboth. The direction in which we have been going is obvious.Now, it is not entirely correct to say that mankind at large is able to treatsex as a matter of free choice, one which initially does not obligate us toothers. In a world where the natural basis of sexual differentiation hascrumbled, this choice is readily available to men, but less so to women. Man inthe state of nature, either in the first one or the one we have now, can walkaway from a sexual encounter and never give it another thought. But a woman mayhave a child, and in fact, as becomes ever clearer, may want to have a child.Sex can be an indifferent thing for men, but it really cannot quite be so forwomen. This is what might be called the female drama. Modernity promised thatall human beings would be treated equally. Women took that promise seriously andrebelled against the old order. But as they have succeeded, men have also beenliberated from their old constraints. And women, now liberated and with equalcareers, nevertheless find they still desire to have children, but have no basisfor claiming that men should share their desire for children or assume aresponsibility for them. So nature weighs more heavily on women. In the oldorder they were subordinated and dependent on men; in the new order they areisolated, needing men, but not able to count on them, and hampered in the freedevelopment of their individuality. The promise of modernity is not reallyfulfilled for women.The decay of the natural ground for the family relationships was largelyunanticipated and unprepared for in the early modern thinkers. But they didsuggest a certain reform of the family, reflecting the movement away from theconstraints of duty, toward reliance on those elements of the family that couldbe understood to flow out of free expressions of personal sentiment. In Locke,paternal authority is turned into parental authority, a rejection of a father’sdivine or natural right to rule and to rule permanently, in favor of a father’sand a mother’s right to care for their children as long as they need care, forthe sake of the children’s freedom—which the child will immediately recognize,when he reaches majority, to have been for his own benefit. There is nothingleft of the reverence toward the father as the symbol of the divine on earth,the unquestioned bearer of authority. Rather, sons and daughters will calculatethat they have benefited from their parents’ care, which prepared them for thefreedom they enjoy, and they will be grateful, although they have no reciprocalduty, except insofar as they wish to leave behind a plausible model for theconduct of their own children toward them. They may, if they please, obey theirfather in order to inherit his estate, if he has one, which he can dispose of ashe pleases. From the point of view of the children, the family retains itsvalidity on the basis of modern principles, and Locke prepares the way for thedemocratic family, so movingly described by Tocqueville in Democracy in America.So far, so good. The children are reconciled to the family. But the problem, itseems to me, is in the motive of the parents to care for their children. Thechildren can say to their parents: “You are strong, and we are weak. Use yourstrength to help us. You are rich, and we are poor. Spend your money on us. Youare wise, and we are ignorant. Teach us.” But why should mother and father wantto do so much, involving so much sacrifice without any reward? Perhaps parentalcare is a duty, or family life has great joys. But neither of these is aconclusive reason when rights and individual autonomy hold sway. The childrenhave unconditional need for and receive unquestionable benefits from theparents; the same cannot be asserted about parents.Locke believed, and the events of our time seem to confirm his belief, thatwomen have an instinctive attachment to children that cannot be explained asself-interest or calculation. The attachment of mother and child is perhaps theonly undeniable natural social bond. It is not always effective, and it can,with effort, be suppressed, but it is always a force. And this is what we seetoday. But what about the father? Maybe he loves imagining his own eternitythrough the generations stemming from him. But this is only an act ofimagination, one that can be attenuated by other concerns and calculations, aswell as by his losing faith in the continuation of his name for very long in theshifting conditions of democracy. Of necessity, therefore, it was understood tobe the woman’s job to get and hold the man by her charms and wiles because, bynature, nothing else would induce him to give up his freedom in favor of theheavy duties of family. But women no longer wish to do this, and they, withjustice, consider it unfair according to the principles governing us. So thecement that bound the family together crumbled. It is not the children who breakaway; it is the parents who abandon them. Women are no longer willing to makeunconditional and perpetual commitments on unequal terms, and, no matter whatthey hope, nothing can effectively make most men share equally theresponsibilities of childbearing and child-rearing. The divorce rate is only themost striking symptom of this breakdown.None of this results from the sixties, or from the appeal to masculine vanitybegun by advertisers in the fifties, or from any other superficial, pop-cultureevents. More than two hundred years ago Rousseau saw with alarm the seeds of thebreakdown of the family in liberal society, and he dedicated much of his geniusto trying to correct it. He found that the critical connection between man andwoman was being broken by individualism, and focused his efforts, theoreticaland practical, on encouraging passionate romantic love in them. He wanted torebuild and reinforce that connection, previously encumbered by now discreditedreligious and civil regulation, on modern grounds of desire and consent. Heretraced the picture of nature that had become a palimpsest under the abrasionof modern criticism, and he enticed men and women into admiring its ideologicalordering, specifically the complementarity between the two sexes, which mesh andset the machine of life in motion, each differing from and needing the other,from the depths of the body to the heights of the soul. He set utter abandon tothe sentiments and imaginations of idealized love against calculation ofindividual interest. Rousseau inspired a whole genre of novelistic and poeticliterature that lived feverishly for over a century, coexisting with thewritings of the Benthams and the Mills who were earnestly at work homogenizingthe sexes. His undertaking had the heaviest significance because human communitywas at risk. In essence he was persuading women freely to be different from menand to take on the burden of entering a positive contract with the family, asopposed to a negative, individual, self-protective contract with the state.Tocqueville picked up this theme, described the absolute differentiation ofhusband’s and wife’s functions and ways of life in the American family, andattributed the success of American democracy to its women, who freely choosetheir lot. This he contrasted to the disorder, nay, chaos, of Europe, which heattributed to a misunderstanding or misapplication of the principle ofequality—only an abstraction when not informed by nature’s imperatives.This whole effort failed and now arouses either women’s anger, as an attempt totake from them rights guaranteed to all human beings, or their indifference, asirrelevant in a time when women do exactly the same things as men and face thesame difficulties in ensuring their independence. Rousseau, Tocqueville and allthe others now have only historical significance and at most provide us with aserious alternative perspective for analyzing our situation. Romantic love isnow as alien to us as knight-errantry, and young men are no more likely to courta woman than to wear a suit of armor, not only because it is not fitting, butbecause it would be offensive to women. As a student exclaimed to me, withapproval of his fellows, “What do you expect me to do? Play a guitar under somegirl’s window?” Such a thing seemed as absurd to him as swallowing goldfish.But the parents of this same young man, it turned out, were divorced. Hestrongly, if incoherently, expressed his distress and performed the nowritualistic incantation for roots. Here Rousseau is most helpful, for hehonestly exposed the nerve of that incantation, whereas the discussion of rootsis an evasion. There is a passage in Emile, his educational novel, which keepscoming back to me as I look at my students. It occurs in the context of theteacher’s arrangements with the parents of the pupil whose total education he isundertaking, and in the absence of any organic relation between husbands andwives and parents and children after having passed through the solvent of moderntheory and practice: I would even want the pupil and the governor to regard themselves as soinseparable that the lot of each in life is always a common object for them. Assoon as they envisage from afar their separation, as soon as they foresee themoment which is going to make them strangers to one another, they are alreadystrangers. Each sets up his own little separate system; and both engrossed bythe time they will no longer be together, stay only reluctantly. (Emile, p. 53,ed. Bloom, Basic Books, 1979) That is it. Everyone has “his own little separate system.” The aptestdescription I can find for the state of students’ souls is the psychology ofseparateness.The possibility of separation is already the fact of separation, inasmuch aspeople today must plan to be whole and self-sufficient, and cannot riskinterdependence. Imagination compels everyone to look forward to the day ofseparation in order to see how he will do. The energies people should use in thecommon enterprise are exhausted in preparation for independence. What would, inthe case of union, be a building stone becomes a stumbling block on the path tosecession. The goals of those who are together naturally and necessarily mustbecome a common good; what one must live with can be accepted. But there is nocommon good for those who are to separate. The presence of choice alreadychanges the character of relatedness. And the more separation there is, the morethere will be. Death of a parent, child, husband, wife or friend is always apossibility and sometimes a fact, but separation is something very differentbecause it is an intentional rebuff to the demand for reciprocity of attachmentwhich is the heart of these relations. People can continue to live while relatedto the dead beloved; they cannot continue to be related to a living beloved whono longer loves or wishes to be loved. This continual shifting of the sands inour desert—separation from places, persons, beliefs—produces the psychic stateof nature where reserve and timidity are the prevailing dispositions. We aresocial solitaries.DIVORCEThe most visible sign of our increasing separateness and, in its turn, the causeof ever greater separateness is divorce. It has a deep influence on ouruniversities because more and more of the students are products of it, and theynot only have problems themselves but also affect other students and the generalatmosphere. Divorce in America is the most palpable indication that people arenot made to live together, and that, although they want and need to create ageneral will out of the particular wills, those particular wills constantlyreassert themselves. There is a quest, but ever more hopeless, for arrangementsand ways of putting the broken pieces back together. The task is equivalent tosquaring the circle, because everyone loves himself most but wants others tolove him more than they love themselves. Such is particularly the demand ofchildren, against which parents are now rebelling. In the absence of a commongood or common object, as Rousseau puts it, the disintegration of society intoparticular wills is inevitable. Selfishness in this case is not a moral vice ora sin but a natural necessity. The “Me generation” and “narcissism” are merelydescriptions, not causes. The solitary savage in the state of nature cannot beblamed for thinking primarily of himself, nor can a person who lives in a worldwhere the primacy of self-concern is only too evident in the most fundamentalinstitutions, where the original selfishness of the state of nature remains,where concern for the common good is hypocritical, and where morality seems tobe squarely on the side of selfishness. Or, to put it otherwise, the concernwith self-development, self-expression, or growth, which flourished as a resultof the optimistic faith in a pre-established harmony between such a concern andsociety or community, has gradually revealed itself to be inimical to community.A young person’s qualified or conditional attachment to divorced parents merelyreciprocates what he necessarily sees as their conditional attachment to him,and is entirely different from the classic problem of loyalty to families, orother institutions, which were clearly dedicated to their members. In the past,such breaking away was sometimes necessary but always morally problematic. Todayit is normal, and this is another reason why the classic literature is alien toso many of our young, for it is largely concerned with liberation from realclaims—like family, faith, or country—whereas now the movement is in theopposite direction, a search for claims on oneself that have some validity.Children who have gone to the school of conditional relationships should beexpected to view the world in the light of what they learned there.Children may be told over and over again that their parents have a right totheir own lives, that they will enjoy quality time instead of quantity time,that they are really loved by their parents even after divorce, but children donot believe any of this. They think they have a right to total attention andbelieve their parents must live for them. There is no explaining otherwise tothem, and anything less inevitably produces indignation and an inextirpablesense of injustice. To children, the voluntary separation of parents seems worsethan their death precisely because it is voluntary. The capaciousness of wills,their lack of directedness to the common good, the fact that they could beotherwise but are not—these are the real source of the war of all against all.Children learn a fear of enslavement to the wills of others, along with a needto dominate those wills, in the context of the family, the one place where theyare supposed to learn the opposite. Of course, many families are unhappy. Butthat is irrelevant. The important lesson that the family taught was theexistence of the only unbreakable bond, for better or for worse, between humanbeings.The decomposition of this bond is surely America’s most urgent social problem.But nobody even tries to do anything about it. The tide seems to beirresistible. Among the many items on the agenda of those promoting America’smoral regeneration, I never find marriage and divorce. The last time anyone inpublic office took a crack at anything like this issue was when Jimmy Carterurged Federal civil servants living together out of wedlock to get married.Meanwhile, the first conservative President elected in a half-century is adivorced man, and his Secretary of Health and Human Services, the public officermost closely connected with family matters, said she took heart from his exampleduring her own well-publicized divorce.A university teacher of liberal arts cannot help confronting special handicaps,a slight deformity of the spirit, in the students, ever more numerous, whoseparents are divorced. I do not have the slightest doubt that they do as well asothers in all kinds of specialized subjects, but I find they are not as open tothe serious study of philosophy and literature as some other students are. Iwould guess this is because they are less eager to look into the meaning oftheir lives, or to risk shaking their received opinions. In order to live withthe chaos of their experience, they tend to have rigid frameworks about what isright and wrong and how they ought to live. They are full of desperateplatitudes about self-determination, respect for other people’s rights anddecisions, the need to work out one’s individual values and commitments, etc.All this is a thin veneer over boundless seas of rage, doubt and fear.Young people habitually are able to jettison their habits of belief for anexciting idea. They have little to lose. Although this is not really philosophy,because they are not aware of how high the stakes are, in this period of theirlives they can experiment with the unconventional and acquire deeper habits ofbelief and some learning to go along with them. But children of divorced parentsoften lack this intellectual daring because they lack the natural youthfulconfidence in the future. Fear of both isolation and attachment clouds theirprospects. A large measure of their enthusiasm has been extinguished andreplaced by self-protectiveness. Similarly, their open confidence in friendshipas part of the newly discovered search for the good is somewhat stunted. TheGlauconian eros for the discovery of nature has suffered more damage in themthan in most. Such students can make their disarray in the cosmos the theme oftheir reflection and study. But it is a grim and dangerous business, and morethan any students I have known, they evoke pity. They are indeed victims.An additional factor in the state of these students’ souls is the fact that theyhave undergone therapy. They have been told how to feel and what to think aboutthemselves by psychologists who are paid by their parents to make everythingwork out as painlessly as possible for the parents, as part of no-fault divorce.If ever there was a conflict of interest, this is it. There are big bucks fortherapists in divorce, since the divorces are eager to get back to persecutingthe wretches who smoke or to ending the arms race or to saving “civilization aswe know it” Meanwhile, psychologists provide much of the ideology justifyingdivorce—e.g., that it is worse for kids to stay in stressful homes (thusmotivating the potential escapees—that is, the parents—to make it as unpleasantas possible there). Psychologists are the sworn enemies of guilt. And they havean artificial language for the artificial feelings with which they equipchildren. But it unfortunately does not permit such children to get a firm gripon anything. Of course, not every psychologist who deals with these matterssimply plays the tune called by those who pay the piper, but the givens of themarket and the capacity for self-deception, called creativity, surely influencesuch therapy. After all, parents can shop around for a psychologist just as someCatholics used to shop for a confessor. When these students arrive at theuniversity, they are not only reeling from the destructive effects of theoverturning of faith and the ambiguity of loyalty that result from divorce, butdeafened by self-serving lies and hypocrisies expressed in a pseudoscientificjargon. Modern psychology at its best has a questionable understanding of thesoul. It has no place for the natural superiority of the philosophic life, andno understanding of education. So children who are impregnated with thatpsychology live in a sub-basement and have a long climb just to get back up tothe cave, or the world of common sense, which is the proper beginning for theirascent toward wisdom. They do not have confidence in what they feel or what theysee, and they have an ideology that provides not a reason but a rationalizationfor their timidity.These students are the symbols of the intellectual-political problems of ourtime. They represent in extreme form the spiritual vortex set in motion by lossof contact with other human beings and with the natural order. But all studentsare affected, in the most practical everyday way, unaware that their situationis peculiar, because their education does not give them perspective on it.LOVEThe best point of entry into the very special world inhabited by today’sstudents is the astonishing fact that they usually do not, in what were oncecalled love affairs, say, “I love you,” and never, “I’ll always love you.” Onestudent told me that, of course, he says “I love you,” to girlfriends, “when weare breaking up.” It is the clean and easy break—no damage, no fault—at whichthey are adept. This is understood to be morality, respect for other persons’freedom.Perhaps young people do not say “I love you” because they are honest. They donot experience love—too familiar with sex to confuse it with love, toopreoccupied with their own fates to be victimized by love’s mad self-forgetting,the last of the genuine fanaticisms. Then there is distaste for love’s fatalhistorical baggage—sex roles, making women into possessions and objects withoutrespect for their self-determination. Young people today are afraid of makingcommitments, and the point is that love is commitment, and much more. Commitmentis a word invented in our abstract modernity to signify the absence of any realmotives in the soul for moral dedication. Commitment is gratuitous, motiveless,because the real passions are all low and selfish. One may be sexuallyattracted, but that does not, so people think, provide any sufficient motive forreal and lasting concern for another. Young people, and not only young people,have studied and practiced a crippled eros that can no longer take wing, anddoes not contain within it the longing for eternity and the divination of one’srelatedness to being. They are practical Kantians: whatever is tainted with lustor pleasure cannot be moral. However, they have not discovered the puremorality. It remains an empty category used to discredit all substantialinclinations that were once moralizing. Too much emphasis on authenticity hasmade it impossible to trust one’s instincts, and too much seriousness about sexhas made it impossible to take sex seriously. Young men and women distrusteroticism too much to think it a sufficient pointer toward a way of life. Theburdens implied in and blessed by eros are only burdens without it. It is notcowardice to avoid taking on responsibilities that have no charm even inanticipation.When marriage occurs it does not usually seem to result from a decision and aconscious will to take on its responsibilities. The couple have lived togetherfor a long time, and by an almost imperceptible process, they find themselvesmarried, as much out of convenience as passion, as much negatively as positively(not really expecting to do much better, since they have looked around and seenhow imperfect all fits seem to be). Among the educated, marriage these daysseems to be best acquired, as Macaulay said about the British Empire, in a fitof absence of mind.Part of the inability to make sexual commitments results from an ideology of thefeelings. Young people are always telling me such reasonable things aboutjealousy and possessiveness and even their dreams about the future. But as todreams about the future with a partner, they have none. That would be to imposea rigid, authoritarian pattern on the future, which should emerge spontaneously.This means they can foresee no future, or that the one they would naturallyforesee is forbidden them by current piety, as sexist. Similarly, why should aman or a woman be jealous if his or her partner has sexual relations withsomeone else? A serious person today does not want to force the feelings ofothers. The same goes for possessiveness. When I hear such things, all sosensible and in harmony with a liberal society, I feel that I am in the presenceof robots. This ideology only works for people who have had no experience of thefeelings, have never loved, have abstracted from the texture of life. Theseprodigies of reason need never fear Othello’s fate. Kill for love! What can thatmean? It may very well be that their apatheia is a suppression of feeling,anxiety about getting hurt. But it might also be the real thing. People may,having digested the incompatibility of ends, have developed a new kind of soul.None of the sexual possibilities students have actualized was unknown to me. Buttheir lack of passion, of hope, of despair, of a sense of the twinship of loveand death, is incomprehensible to me. When I see a young couple who have livedtogether throughout their college years leave each other with a handshake andmove out into life, I am struck dumb.Students do not date anymore. Dating was the petrified skeleton of courtship.They live in herds or packs with no more sexual differentiation than any herdshave when not in heat. Human beings can, of course, engage in sexual intercourseat any time. But today there are none of the conventions invented bycivilization to take the place of heat, to guide mating, and perhaps to channelit. Nobody is sure who is to make the advances, whether there are to be apursuer and a pursued, what the event is to mean. They have to improvise, forroles are banned, and a man pays a high price for misjudging his partner’sattitude. The act takes place but it does not separate the couple from theflock, to which they immediately return as they were before, undifferentiated.It is easier for men to get gratification than it used to be, and many men havethe advantage of being pursued. Certainly they do not have to make all kinds ofefforts and pay all kinds of attention, as men once did. There is an easyfamiliarity. But at least some of these advantages for men are offset bynervousness about their sexual performance. In the past a man could think he wasdoing a wonderful thing for a woman, and expect to be admired for what hebrought. But that was before he could be pretty sure that he was being comparedand judged, which is daunting. And certain aspects of the undeniably malebiology sometimes make it difficult for him to perform and cause him to preferbeing the one to express the desire.Women are still pleased by their freedom and their capacity to chart anindependent course for themselves. But they frequently suspect that they arebeing used, that in the long run they may need men more than men need them, andthat they cannot expect much from the feckless contemporary male. They despisewhat men used to think women had to offer (that is partly why it is now offeredso freely), but they are dogged by doubt whether men are very impressed by whatthey are now offering instead. Distrust suffuses the apparently easy commercebetween the sexes. There is an awful lot of breaking up, surely disagreeable,though nothing earthshaking. Exam time is a great moment for students toseparate. They are under too much stress and too busy to put up with muchtrouble from a relationship.“Relationships,” not love affairs, are what they have. Love suggests somethingwonderful, exciting, positive and firmly seated in the passions. A relationshipis gray, amorphous, suggestive of a project, without a given content, andtentative. You work at a relationship, whereas love takes care of itself. In arelationship the difficulties come first, and there is a search for commongrounds. Love presents illusions of perfection to the imagination and isforgetful of all the natural fissures in human connection. About relationshipsthere is ceaseless anxious talk, the kind one cannot help overhearing in studenthangouts or restaurants frequented by men and women who are “involved” with oneanother, the kind of obsessive prattle so marvelously captured in old Nicholsand May routines or Woody Allen films. In one Nichols and May bit, a couple whohave just slept together for the first time, assert with all the emptiness ofdoubt, “We are going to have a relationship.” This insight was typical of theUniversity of Chicago in the fifties, of The Lonely Crowd. The only mistake wasto encourage the belief that by becoming more “inner-directed,” going fartherdown the path of the isolated self, people will be less lonely. The problem,however, is not that people are not authentic enough, but that they have nocommon object, no common good, no natural complementarity. Selves, of course,have no relation to anything but themselves, and this is why “communication” istheir problem. Gregariousness, like that of the animals in the herd, is admittedby all. Grazing together side by side and rubbing against one another are thegiven, but there is a desire and a necessity to have something more, to make thetransition from the herd to the hive, where there is real interconnection.Hence, the hive—community, roots, extended family—is much praised, but no one iswilling to transform his indeterminate self into an all too determinate worker,drone or queen, to submit to the rank-ordering and division of labor necessaryto any whole that is more than just a heap of discrete parts. Selves want to bewholes, but have lately also taken to longing to be parts. This is the reasonwhy conversation about relationships remains so vacuous, abstract andunprogrammatic, with its whole content stored in a bottle labeled “commitment.”It is also why there is so much talk about phenomena like “bonding.” In theabsence of any connectedness in their souls, human beings seek reassurance infruitless analogy to mechanisms found in brutes. But this will not work becausehuman attachment always has an element of deliberate choice, denied by suchanalogy. One need only compare the countless novels and movies about malebonding with Aristotle’s discussion of friendship in the Ethics. Friendship,like its related phenomenon, love, is no longer within our ken because bothrequire notions of soul and nature that, for a mixture of theoretical andpolitical reasons, we cannot even consider.The reliance on relationships is a self-delusion because it is founded on aninner contradiction. Relations between the sexes have always been difficult, andthat is why so much of our literature is about men and women quarreling. Thereis certainly legitimate ground to doubt their suitability for each other giventhe spectrum—from the harem to Plato’s Republic—of imaginable and actuallyexisting relations between them, whether nature acted the stepmother or Godbotched the creation by an afterthought, as some Romantics believed. That man isnot made to be alone is all very well, but who is made to live with him? This iswhy men and women hesitated before marriage, and courtship was thought necessaryto find out whether the couple was compatible, and perhaps to give them basictraining in compatibility. No one wanted to be stuck forever with an impossiblepartner. But, for all that, they knew pretty much what they wanted from oneanother. The question was whether they could get it (whereas our question todayis much more what is wanted). A man was to make a living and protect his wifeand children, and a woman was to provide for the domestic economy, particularlyin caring for husband and children. Frequently this did not work out very wellfor one or both of the partners, because they either were not good at theirfunctions or were not eager to perform them. In order to assure the properordering of things, the transvestite women in Shakespeare, like Portia andRosalind, are forced to masquerade as men because the real men are inadequateand need to be corrected. This happens only in comedies; when there are no suchintrepid women, the situation turns into tragedy. But the assumption of malegarb observes the proprieties or conventions. Men should be doing what theimpersonating women are doing; and when the women have set things right, theybecome women again and submit to the men, albeit with a tactful, ironicalconsciousness that they are at least partially playacting in order to preserve aviable order. The arrangement implicit in marriage, even if it is onlyconventional, tells those who enter into it what to expect and what thesatisfactions are supposed to be. Very simply, the family is a sort of miniaturebody politic in which the husband’s will is the will of the whole. The woman caninfluence her husband’s will, and it is supposed to be informed by love of wifeand children.Now all of this has simply disintegrated. It does not exist, nor is itconsidered good that it should. But nothing certain has taken its place. Neithermen nor women have any idea what they are getting into anymore, or, rather, theyhave reason to fear the worst. There are two equal wills, and no mediatingprinciple to link them and no tribunal of last resort. What is more, neither ofthe wills is certain of itself. This is where the “ordering of priorities” comesin, particularly with women, who have not yet decided which comes first, careeror children. People are no longer raised to think they ought to regard marriageas the primary goal and responsibility, and their uncertainty is mightilyreinforced by the divorce statistics, which imply that putting all of one’spsychological eggs in the marriage basket is a poor risk. The goals and wills ofmen and women have become like parallel lines, and it requires a Lobachevskyanimagination to hope they may meet.The inharmoniousness of final ends finds its most concrete expression in thefemale career, which is now precisely the same as the male career. There are twoequal careers in almost every household composed of educated persons underthirty-five. And those careers are not mere means to family ends. They arepersonal fulfillments. In this nomadic country it is more than likely that oneof the partners will be forced, or have the opportunity, to take a job in a cityother than the one where his or her spouse works. What to do? They can staytogether with one partner sacrificing his career to the other, they can commute,or they can separate. None of these solutions is satisfactory. More important,what is going to happen is unpredictable. Is it the marriage or the career thatwill count most? Women’s careers today are qualitatively different from whatthey were up to twenty years ago, and such conflict is now inevitable. Theresult is that both marriage and career are devalued.For a long time middle-class women, with the encouragement of their husbands,had been pursuing careers. It was thought they had a right to cultivate theirhigher talents instead of being household drudges. Implicit in this was, ofcourse, the view that the bourgeois professions indeed offered an opportunity tofulfill the human potential, while family and particularly the woman’s workinvolved in it were merely in the realm of necessity, limited and limiting.Serious men of good conscience believed that they must allow their wives todevelop themselves. But, with rare exceptions, both parties still took it forgranted that the family was the woman’s responsibility and that, in the case ofpotential conflict, she would subordinate or give up her career. It was notquite serious, and she usually knew it. This arrangement was ultimatelyuntenable, and it was clear in which way the balance would tip. Couples agreedthat the household was not spiritually fulfilling for women and that women haveequal rights. The notion of a domestic life appropriate to women had becomeincredible. Why should not women take their careers as seriously as men taketheirs, and have them be taken as seriously by men? Terrific resentment at theinjustice done to women under the prevailing understanding of justice found itsexpression in demands seen as perfectly legitimate by both men and women, thatmen weaken the attachment to their careers, that they share equally in thehousehold and the care of the children. Women’s abandonment of the femalepersona was reinforced by the persona’s abandoning them. Economic changes madeit desirable and necessary that women work; lowering of infant mortality ratesmeant that women had to have fewer pregnancies; greater longevity and betterhealth meant that women devoted a much smaller portion of their lives to havingand rearing children; and the altered relationships within the family meant thatthey were less likely to find continuing occupation with their children andtheir children’s children. At forty-five they were finding themselves withnothing to do, and forty more years to do it in. Their formative career yearshad been lost, and they were, hence, unable to compete with men. A woman who nowwanted to be a woman in the old sense would find it very difficult to do so,even if she were to brave the hostile public opinion. In all of these ways thefeminist case is very strong indeed. But, though the terms of marriage had beenradically altered, no new ones were defined.The feminist response that justice requires equal sharing of all domesticresponsibility by men and women is not a solution, but only a compromise, anattenuation of men’s dedication to their careers and of women’s to family, witharguably an enrichment in diversity of both parties but just as arguably afragmentation of their lives. The question of who goes with whom in the case ofjobs in different cities is unresolved and is, whatever may be said about it, afestering sore, a source of suspicion and resentment, and the potential for war.Moreover, this compromise does not decide anything about the care of thechildren. Are both parents going to care more about their careers than about thechildren? Previously children at least had the unqualified dedication of oneperson, the woman, for whom their care was the most important thing in life. Ishalf the attention of two the same as the whole attention of one? Is this not aformula for neglecting children? Under such arrangements the family is not aunity, and marriage is an unattractive struggle that is easy to get out of,especially for men.And here is where the whole business turns nasty. The souls of men—theirambitious, warlike, protective, possessive character—must be dismantled in orderto liberate women from their domination. Machismo—the polemical description ofmaleness or spiritedness, which was the central natural passion in men’s soulsin the psychology of the ancients, the passion of attachment and loyalty—was thevillain, the source of the difference between the sexes. The feminists were onlycompleting a job begun by Hobbes in his project of taming the harsh elements inthe soul. With machismo discredited, the positive task is to make men caring,sensitive, even nurturing, to fit the restructured family. Thus once again menmust be re-educated according to an abstract project. They must accept the“feminine elements” in their nature. A host of Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streeptypes invade the schools, popular psychology, TV and the movies, making theproject respectable. Men tend to undergo this re-education somewhat sullenly butstudiously, in order to avoid the opprobrium of the sexist label and to keeppeace with their wives and girlfriends. And it is indeed possible to soften men.But to make them “care” is another thing, and the project must inevitably fail.It must fail because in an age of individualism, persons of either sex cannot beforced to be public-spirited, particularly by those who are becoming less so.Further, caring is either a passion or a virtue, not a description like“sensitive.” A virtue governs a passion, as moderation governs lust, or couragegoverns fear. But what passion does caring govern? One might say possessiveness,but possessiveness is not to be governed these days—it is to be rooted out. Whatis wanted is an antidote to natural selfishness, but wishes do not give birth tohorses, however much abstract moralism may demand them. The old moral order,however imperfect it may have been, at least moved toward the virtues by way ofthe passions. If men were self-concerned, that order tried to expand the scopeof self-concern to include others, rather than commanding men to cease beingconcerned with themselves. To attempt the latter is both tyrannical andineffective. A true political or social order requires the soul to be like aGothic cathedral, with selfish stresses and strains helping to hold it up.Abstract moralism condemns certain keystones, removes them, and then blames boththe nature of the stones and the structure when it collapses. The failure ofagriculture in socialist collective farming is the best political example ofthis. An imaginary motive takes the place of a real one, and when the imaginarymotive fails to produce the real effect, those who have not been motivated by itare blamed and persecuted. In family questions, inasmuch as men were understoodto be so strongly motivated by property, an older wisdom tried to attach concernfor the family to that motive: the man was allowed and encouraged to regard hisfamily as his property, so he would care for the former as he wouldinstinctively care for the latter. This was effective, although it obviously haddisadvantages from the point of view of justice. When wives and children come tothe husband and father and say, “We are not your property; we are ends inourselves and demand to be treated as such,” the anonymous observer cannot helpbeing impressed. But the difficulty comes when wives and children further demandthat the man continue to care for them as before, just when they are giving anexample of caring for themselves. They object to the father’s flawed motive andask that it be miraculously replaced by a pure one, of which they wish to makeuse for their own ends. The father will almost inevitably constrict his questfor property, cease being a father and become a mere man again, rather thanturning into a providential God, as others ask him to be. What is so intolerableabout the Republic, as Plato shows, is the demand that men give up their land,their money, their wives, their children, for the sake of the public good, theirconcern for which had previously been buttressed by these lower attachments. Thehope is to have a happy city made up entirely of unhappy men. Similar demandsare made today in an age of slack morality and self-indulgence. Plato taughtthat, however laudable justice may be, one cannot expect prodigies of virtuefrom ordinary people. Better a real city tainted by selfish motives than onethat cannot exist, except in speech, and that promotes real tyranny.I am not arguing here that the old family arrangements were good or that weshould or could go back to them. I am only insisting that we not cloud ourvision to such an extent that we believe that there are viable substitutes forthem just because we want or need them. The peculiar attachment of mothers fortheir children existed, and in some degree still exists, whether it was theproduct of nature or nurture. That fathers should have exactly the same kind ofattachment is much less evident. We can insist on it, but if nature does notcooperate, all our efforts will have been in vain. Biology forces women to takematernity leaves. Law can enjoin men to take paternity leaves, but it cannotmake them have the desired sentiments. Only the rankest ideologue could fail tosee the difference between the two kinds of leave, and the contrived andsomewhat ridiculous character of the latter. Law may prescribe that the malenipples be made equal to the female ones, but they still will not give milk.Female attachment to children is to be at least partly replaced with promissorynotes on male attachment. Will they be redeemed? Or won’t everyone set up hisown little separate psychological banking system?Similarly, women, due to the unreliability of men, have had to provide the meansfor their own independence. This has simply given men the excuse for being evenless concerned with women’s well-being. A dependent, weak woman is indeedvulnerable and puts herself at men’s mercy. But that appeal did influence a lotof men a lot of the time. The cure now prescribed for male irresponsibility isto make them more irresponsible. And a woman who can be independent of men hasmuch less motive to entice a man into taking care of her and her children. Inthe same vein, I heard a female lieutenant-colonel on the radio explaining thatthe only thing standing in the way of woman’s full equality in the military ismale protectiveness. So, do away with it! Yet male protectiveness, based onmasculine pride, and desire to gain the glory for defending a blushing woman’shonor and life, was a form of relatedness, as well as a way of sublimatingselfishness. These days, why should a man risk his life protecting a karatechampion who knows just what part of the male anatomy to go after in defendingherself? What substitute is there for the forms of relatedness that aredismantled in the name of the new justice?All our reforms have helped strip the teeth of our gears, which can therefore nolonger mesh. They spin idly, side by side, unable to set the social machine inmotion. It is at this exercise in futility that young people must look whenthinking about their future. Women are pleased by their successes, their newopportunities, their agenda, their moral superiority. But underneath everythinglies the more or less conscious awareness that they are still dual beings bynature, capable of doing most things men do and also wanting to have children.They may hope otherwise, but they fully expect to pursue careers, to have topursue careers, while caring for children alone. And what they expect and planfor is likely to happen. The men have none of the current ideological advantagesof the women, but they can opt out without too much cost. In their relationswith women they have little to say; convinced of the injustice of the old order,for which they were responsible, and practically incapable of changing thedirection of the juggernaut, they wait to hear what is wanted, try to adjust butare ready to take off in an instant. They want relationships, but the situationis so unclear. They anticipate a huge investment of emotional energy that isjust as likely as not to end in bankruptcy, to a sacrifice of their career goalswithout any clarity about what reward they will reap, other than a vaguetogetherness. Meanwhile, one of the strongest, oldest motives for marriage is nolonger operative. Men can now easily enjoy the sex that previously could only behad in marriage. It is strange that the tiredest and stupidest bromide mothersand fathers preached to their daughters—“He won’t respect you or marry you ifyou give him what he wants too easily”—turns out to be the truest and mostprobing analysis of the current situation. Women can say they do not care, thatthey want men to have the right motives or none at all, but everyone, and theybest of all, knows that they are being, at most, only half truthful withthemselves.EROSThis is the campus sexual scene. Relativism in theory and lack of relatedness inpractice make students unable to think about or look into their futures, andthey shrivel up within the confines of the present and material I. They arewilling to mutter the prescribed catechism, the substitute for thought, whichpromises them salvation, but there is little faith. As a very intelligentstudent said to me, “We are all obsessively going to the well, but we alwayscome up dry.” The rhetoric of the campus gays only confirms this. After all thedemands and the complaints against the existing order—“Don’t discriminateagainst us; don’t legislate morality; don’t put a policeman in every bedroom;respect our orientation”—they fall back into the empty talk about findinglife-styles. There is not, and cannot be, anything more specific. Allrelationships have been homogenized in their indeterminacy.The eroticism of our students is lame. It is not the divine madness Socratespraised; or the enticing awareness of incompleteness and the quest to overcomeit; or nature’s grace, which permits a partial being to recover his wholeness inthe embrace of another, or a temporal being to long for eternity in theperpetuity of his seed; or the hope that all men will remember his deeds; or hiscontemplation of perfection. Eroticism is a discomfort, but one that in itselfpromises relief and affirms the goodness of things. It is the proof, subjectivebut incontrovertible, of man’s relatedness, imperfect though it may be, toothers and to the whole of nature. Wonder, the source of both poetry andphilosophy, is its characteristic expression. Eros demands daring from itsvotaries and provides a good reason for it This longing for completeness is thelonging for education, and the study of it is education. Socrates’ knowledge ofignorance is identical with his perfect knowledge of erotics. The longing forhis conversations with which he infected his companions, and which wasintensified after his death and has endured throughout the centuries, proved himto have been both the neediest and most grasping of lovers, and the richest andmost giving of beloveds. The sex lives of our students and their reflection onthem disarm such longing and make it incomprehensible to them. Reduction hasrobbed eros of its divinatory powers. Because they do not trust it, studentshave no reverence for themselves. There is almost no remaining link visible tothem between what they learn in sex education and Plato’s Symposium.Yet only from such dangerous heights can our situation be seen in properperspective. The fact that this perspective is no longer credible is the measureof our crisis. When we recognize the Phaedrus and the Symposium as interpretingour experiences, we can be sure that we are having those experiences in theirfullness, and that we have the minimum of education. Rousseau, the founder ofthe most potent of reductionist teachings about eros, said that the Symposium isalways the book of lovers. Are we lovers anymore? This is my way of putting theeducational question of our times.In all species other than man, when an animal reaches puberty, it is all that itwill ever be. This stage is the clear end toward which all of its growth andlearning is directed. The animal’s activity is reproduction. It lives on thisplateau until it starts downhill. Only in man is puberty just the beginning. Thegreater and more interesting part of his learning, moral and intellectual, comesafterward, and in civilized man is incorporated into his erotic desire. Histaste and hence his choices are determined during this “sentimental education.”It is as though his learning were for the sake of his sexuality. Reciprocally,much of the energy for that learning obviously comes from his sexuality. Nobodytakes human children who have reached puberty to be adults. We properly sensethat there is a long road to adulthood, the condition in which they are able togovern themselves and be true mothers and fathers. This road is the serious partof education, where animal sexuality becomes human sexuality, where instinctgives way in man to choice with regard to the true, the good and the beautiful.Puberty does not provide man, as it does other animals, with all that he needsto leave behind others of his kind. This means that the animal part of hissexuality is intertwined in the most complex way with the higher reaches of hissoul, which must inform the desires with its insight, and that the most delicatepart of education is to keep the two in harmony.I cannot pretend that I understand very much of this mystery, but knowing that Ido not know keeps me attentive to, and far from the current simplifications of,the phenomena of this aspect of our nature that links the highest and the lowestin us. I believe that the most interesting students are those who have notsettled the sexual problem, who are still young, even look young for their age,who think there is much to look forward to and much they must yet grow up to,fresh and naive, excited by the mysteries to which they have not yet been fullyinitiated. There are some who are men and women at the age of sixteen, who havenothing more to learn about the erotic. They are adult in the sense that theywill no longer change very much. They may become competent specialists, but theyare flat-souled. The world is for them what it presents itself to the senses tobe; it is unadorned by imagination and devoid of ideals. This flat soul is whatthe sexual wisdom of our time conspires to make universal.The easy sex of teen-agers snips the golden thread linking eros to education.And popularized Freud finishes it for good by putting the seal of science on anunerotic understanding of sex. A youngster whose sexual longings consciously orunconsciously inform his studies has a very different set of experiences fromone in whom such motives are not active. A trip to Florence or to Athens is onething for a young man who hopes to meet his Beatrice on the Ponte Santa Trinitàor his Socrates in the Agora, and quite another for one who goes without suchaching need. The latter is only a tourist, the former is looking for completion.Flaubert, a great expert on the fate of longing in the modern world, sends hisawestruck Emma Bovary to a ball at the estate of decadent aristocrats where shesees: … at the head of the table, alone among all of these men and women, bent over,his full plate with his napkin knotted around his neck like a child, an old manate, letting drops of gravy trickle from his mouth. He had bloodshot eyes andwore a little pigtail fastened with a black ribbon. It was the Marquis’father-in-law, the old Duc de Laverdière, the former favorite of the Comted’Artois at the time of the hunts at the Vaudreuil home of the Marquis deConflans, and who had been, it was said, the lover of Queen Marie-Antoinettebetween M. de Coigny and M. de Lauzun. He had led a wild life of debauch, fullof duels, wagers, abducted women, had devoured his fortune and terrified hiswhole family. A domestic, behind his chair, speaking loudly into his ear, namedthe dishes for him to which he pointed while stuttering. And constantly Emma’seyes, of their own accord, returned to this old man with drooping lips as tosomething extraordinary and august. He had lived at court and slept in the bedof queens. Others see only a repulsive old man, but Emma sees the ancien régime. Her visionis truer, for there once really was an ancien régime, and in it there were greatlovers. The constricted present cannot teach it to us without the longing thatmakes us dissatisfied with the present. Such longing is what students most need,because the great remains of the tradition have grown senile in our care.Imagination is required to restore their youth, beauty and vitality, and thenexperience their inspiration.The student who made fun of playing the guitar under a girl’s window will neverread or write poetry under her influence. His defective eros cannot provide hissoul with images of the beautiful, and it will remain coarse and slack. It isnot that he will fail to adorn or idealize the world; it is that he will not seewhat is there.A significant number of students used to arrive at the university physically andspiritually virginal, expecting to lose their innocence there. Their lust wasmixed into everything they thought and did. They were painfully aware that theywanted something but were not quite sure exactly what it was, what form it wouldtake and what it all meant The range of satisfactions intimated by their desiremoved from prostitutes to Plato, and back, from the criminal to the sublime.Above all they looked for instruction. Practically everything they read in thehumanities and social sciences might be a source of learning about their pain,and a path to its healing. This powerful tension, this literal lust forknowledge, was what a teacher could see in the eyes of those who flattered himby giving such evidence of their need for him. His own satisfaction was promisedby having something with which to feed their hunger, an overflow to bestow ontheir emptiness. His joy was in hearing the ecstatic “Oh, yes!” as he dished upShakespeare and Hegel to minister to their need. Pimp and midwife reallydescribed him well. The itch for what appeared to be only sexual intercourse wasthe material manifestation of the Delphic oracle’s command, which is but areminder of the most fundamental human desire, to “know thyself.”Sated with easy, clinical and sterile satisfactions of body and soul, thestudents arriving at the university today hardly walk on the enchanted groundthey once did. They pass by the ruins without imagining what was once there.Spiritually detumescent, they do not seek wholeness in the university. Thesemost productive years of learning, the time when Alcibiades was growing hisfirst beard, are wasted because of artificial precociousness and a sophisticwisdom acquired in high school. The real moment for sexual education goes by,and hardly anybody has an idea of what it would be.Reciprocally, the university does not see itself as ministering to such needsand does not believe the mummies on display in its museum can speak to thevisitors or, honors, go home to live with them. The humanists are old maidlibrarians. As I reflect on it, the last fertile moment when student anduniversity made a match was the fling with Freud during the forties and fifties.He advertised a real psychology, a version of the age-old investigation of thesoul’s phenomena adjusted to the palate of modern man. Today one can hardlyimagine the excitement. What a thrill it was when my first college girlfriendtold me that the university’s bell tower was a phallic symbol. This was a realmix of my secret obsessions and the high seriousness I expected to get from theuniversity. High school was never like this. It was hard to tell whether themeaning of it all was that I was about to lose my virginity or to penetrate themysteries of being. An admirable confusion. At last everything was out on thetable. The dirty things had disappeared from the philosophy of the mind, andFreud promised to restore the soul and take seriously what happened in it. Hefancied himself a new and truer Plato and allowed us to praise Plato again asFreud’s precursor.But it turned out to be psychology without the psyche, i.e., without the soul.Freud just did not give a satisfying account of all the things we experience.Everything higher had to be a repression of something lower, and a symbol ofsomething else rather than itself. The best a Freudian vision could do for man’sreal intellectual longings was Death in Venice, clearly not a very rich row tohoe for the finer spirits. Aristotle said that man has two peaks, eachaccompanied by intense pleasure: sexual intercourse and thinking. The human soulis a kind of ellipse or hyperbola, and its phenomena are spread between its twofoci, displaying their tropical variety and ambiguity. Freud saw only one focusin the soul, the same one as the brutes have, and had to explain allpsychology’s higher phenomena by society’s repression or other such versions ofthe Indian rope trick. He really did not believe in the soul, but in the body,along with its passive instrument of consciousness, the mind. This blunted hisvision of the higher phenomena, as is apparent from his crude observations aboutart and philosophy. It was not merely sexual satisfaction students were seeking,whether they were aware of it or not, but knowledge of themselves, and Freud didnot provide it. People found that Freud’s “know thyself” led them to the couch,where they emptied their tank of the compressed fuel, which was intended topower them on their flight from opinion to knowledge. “Know thyself” did notmean to Freud knowing man’s place within the order of the whole of things. It islong since that academic psychology has had any appeal for students who have aphilosophic urge. Freudian psychology has become a big business and entered intothe mainstream of public life with a status equal to that of engineering andbanking. But it has no more intellectual appeal than do they. We must lookelsewhere for ourselves.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [010.html#f1p1ch4s4_1] It remains to be seen what effect AIDS will have.

At other times Mr. Reagan has said that the United Statesand the Soviet Union “have different values” (italics added), an assertion thatthose same persons greet at worst with silence and frequently with approval. Ibelieve he thought he was saying the same thing in both instances, and thedifferent reaction to his different words introduces us to the most importantand most astonishing phenomenon of our time, all the more astonishing in beingalmost unnoticed: there is now an entirely new language of good and evil,originating in an attempt to get “beyond good and evil” and preventing us fromtalking with any conviction about good and evil anymore. Even those who deploreour current moral condition do so in the very language that exemplifies thatcondition.The new language is that of value relativism, and it constitutes a change in ourview of things moral and political as great as the one that took place whenChristianity replaced Greek and Roman paganism. A new language always reflects anew point of view, and the gradual, unconscious popularization of new words, orof old words used in new ways, is a sure sign of a profound change in people’sarticulation of the world. When bishops, a generation after Hobbes’s death,almost naturally spoke the language of the state of nature, contract and rights,it was clear that he had defeated the ecclesiastical authorities, who were nolonger able to understand themselves as they once had. It was henceforwardinevitable that the modern archbishops of Canterbury would have no more incommon with the ancient ones than does the second Elizabeth with the first.What was offensive to contemporary ears in President Reagan’s use of the word“evil” was its cultural arrogance, the presumption that he, and America, knowwhat is good; its closedness to the dignity of other ways of life; its implicitcontempt for those who do not share our ways. The political corollary is that heis not open to negotiation. The opposition between good and evil is notnegotiable and is a cause of war. Those who are interested in “conflictresolution” find it much easier to reduce the tension between values than thetension between good and evil. Values are insubstantial stuff, existingprimarily in the imagination, while death is real. The term “value,” meaning theradical subjectivity of all belief about good and evil, serves the easygoingquest for comfortable self-preservation.Value relativism can be taken to be a great release from the perpetual tyrannyof good and evil, with their cargo of shame and guilt, and the endless effortsthat the pursuit of the one and the avoidance of the other enjoin. Intractablegood and evil cause infinite distress—like war and sexual repression—which isalmost instantly relieved when more flexible values are introduced. One need notfeel bad about or uncomfortable with oneself when just a little value adjustmentis necessary. And this longing to shuck off constraints and have one peaceful,happy world is the first of the affinities between our real American world andthat of German philosophy in its most advanced form, given expression by thecritics of the President’s speech.But there is a second side to the coin. Persons deeply committed to values areadmired. Their intense belief, their caring or concern, their believing insomething, is the proof of autonomy, freedom and creativity. Such persons arethe contrary of easygoing, and they have standards, all the more worthy becausethey are not received from tradition, and are not based on a reality all cansee, or derived from thin rationalizing confined to calculation about materialinterests. The heroic and artistic types dedicate themselves to ideals of theirown making. They are the antibourgeois. Value here serves those who are lookingfor fresh inspiration, for new beliefs about good and evil at least as powerfulas the old ones that have been disenchanted, demystified, demythologized byscientific reason. This interpretation seems to say that dying for values is thenoblest of acts and that the old realism or objectivism led to weak attachmentsto one’s goals. Nature is indifferent to good and evil; man’s interpretationsprescribe a law of life to nature.Thus our use of the value language leads us in two opposite directions—to followthe line of least resistance, and to adopt strong poses and fanatic resolutions.But these are merely different deductions from a common premise. Values are notdiscovered by reason, and it is fruitless to seek them, to find the truth or thegood life. The quest begun by Odysseus and continued over three millennia hascome to an end with the observation that there is nothing to seek. This allegedfact was announced by Nietzsche just over a century ago when he said, “Cod isdead.” Good and evil now for the first time appeared as values, of which therehave been a thousand and one, none rationally or objectively preferable to anyother. The salutary illusion about the existence of good and evil has beendefinitively dispelled. For Nietzsche this was an unparalleled catastrophe; itmeant the decomposition of culture and the loss of human aspiration. TheSocratic “examined” life was no longer possible or desirable. It was—itselfunexamined, and if there was any possibility of a human life in the future itmust begin from the naive capacity to live an unexamined life. The philosophicway of life had become simply poisonous. In short, Nietzsche with the utmostgravity told modern man that he was free-falling in the abyss of nihilism.Perhaps after having lived through this terrible experience, drunk it to thedregs, people might hope for a fresh era of value creation, the emergence of newgods.Modern democracy was, of course, the target of Nietzsche’s criticism. Itsrationalism and its egalitarianism are the contrary of creativity. Its dailylife is for him the civilized reanimalization of man. Nobody really believes inanything anymore, and everyone spends his life in frenzied work and frenziedplay so as not to face the fact, not to look into the abyss. Nietzsche’s call torevolt against liberal democracy is more powerful and more radical than isMarx’s. And Nietzsche adds that the Left, socialism, is not the opposite of thespecial kind of Right that is capitalism, but is its fulfillment. The Left meansequality, the Right inequality. Nietzsche’s call is from the Right, but a newRight transcending capitalism and socialism, which are the powers moving in theworld.But in spite of this, or perhaps because of it, the latest models of moderndemocratic or egalitarian man find much that is attractive in Nietzsche’sunderstanding of things. It is the sign of the strength of equality, and of thefailure of Nietzsche’s war against it, that he is now far better known andreally influential on the Left than on the Right.This may at first appear surprising, inasmuch as Nietzsche looks toward theextraordinary, not the ordinary, the unequal, not the equal. But the democraticman requires flattery, like any ruler, and the earliest versions of democratictheory did not provide it. They justified democracy as the regime in which veryordinary people were protected in their attempt to achieve very ordinary andcommon goals. It was also the regime dominated by public opinion, where thecommon denominator set the rule for everyone. Democracy presented itself asdecent mediocrity as over against the splendid corruption of older regimes. Butit is quite another thing to have a regime in which all the citizens can bethought to be at least potentially autonomous, creating values for themselves. Avalue-creating man is a plausible substitute for a good man, and some suchsubstitute becomes practically inevitable in pop relativism, since very fewpersons can think of themselves as just nothing. The respectable and accessiblenobility of man is to be found not in the quest for or discovery of the goodlife, but in creating one’s own “life-style,” of which there is not just one butmany possible, none comparable to another. He who has a “life-style” is incompetition with, and hence inferior to, no one, and because he has one he cancommand his own esteem and that of others.All this has become everyday fare in the United States, and the most popularschools of psychology and their therapies take value positing as the standard ofhealthy personality. Woody Allen’s comedy is nothing but a set of variations onthe theme of the man who does not have a real “self” or “identity,” and feelssuperior to the inauthentically self-satisfied people because he is conscious ofhis situation and at the same time inferior to them because they are “adjusted.”This borrowed psychology turns into a textbook in Zelig, which is the story ofan “other-directed” man, as opposed to an “inner-directed” man, termspopularized in the 1950s by David Riesman’s The Lonely Crowd, borrowed by himfrom his analyst, Erich Fromm, who himself absorbed them (e.g., innige Mensch)from a really serious thinker, Nietzsche’s heir, Martin Heidegger. I wasastounded to see how doctrinaire Woody Allen is, and how normal his way oflooking at things—which has immediate roots in the most profound Germanphilosophy—has become in the American entertainment market. One of the linksbetween Germany and the United States, the psychologist Bruno Bettelheim,actually plays a cameo role in Zelig.Zelig is a man who literally becomes whoever or whatever is expected of him—aRepublican when with the rich; a gangster when with Mafiosi; black, Chinese orfemale, when with blacks, Chinese or females. He is nothing in himself, just acollection of roles prescribed by others. He inevitably enters into psychiatrictreatment, where we learn that he was once “tradition-directed,” i.e., from afamily of silly, dancing rabbinic Jews. “Tradition-directed” means to be guidedby old values, received from old beliefs, usually religious, which give a man arole that he takes to be more than a role and a place in the world. It goeswithout saying that a return to that old mode of adjustment and apparent healthis neither possible nor desirable. One is supposed to laugh at the dancing Jew,although it is not clear whether from the point of view of alienation or health.It is sure that the Jew is a pariah, Max Weber’s category given specialnotoriety by Hannah Arendt, here meaning interesting only as an outsider who hasa special insight into the insider, but whose Jewishness has no merit in itself.His value is defined by the world currently of interest to him. His health isrestored when he becomes “inner-directed,” when he follows his real instinctsand sets his own values. When Zelig hears people say that it is a nice day, whenit manifestly is, he responds that it is not a nice day. So he is immediatelyclapped back into a mental institution by those whom he previously tried toimitate and with whose opinions he is now at war. This is the way societyimposes its values on the creator. At the end he gets around, on his own, toreading Moby Dick, which he had previously discussed without having read, inorder to impress people. His health is a mixture of petulance and facile,self-conscious smugness.Woody Allen’s haunted comedy diagnoses our ills as stemming from valuerelativism, for which the cure is value positing. And his great strength is indepicting the self-conscious role-player, never quite at home in his role,interesting because he is trying so hard to be like the others, who areridiculous because they are unaware of their emptiness. But Allen is tastelessand superficial in playing with his Jewishness, which apparently has no innerdignity for him. And where he fails completely is in his presentation of thehealthy inner-directed man, who is neither funny nor interesting. This is thefigure against which the others are understood and judged, as misers areridiculous only compared to the man who knows the real value of money. ButAllen’s inner-directed man is simply empty or nonexistent, forcing one to wonderhow profound his creator’s understanding can be. Here is where we confront thenothing, but it is not clear that Allen knows it. Inner-directedness is anegalitarian promise that enables us easily to despise and ridicule “thebourgeois” we actually see around us. This is all terribly lightweight anddisappointing, for it really tries to assure us that the agonies of the nihilismwe are living are just neuroses that can be cured by a little therapy and by alittle stiffening of our backs. Erich Fromm’s Escape from Freedom is just DaleCarnegie with a bit of middle-European cultural whipped cream on top. Get rid ofcapitalist alienation and Puritan repression, and all will be well as each manchooses for himself. But Woody Allen really has nothing to tell us aboutinner-directedness. Nor does Riesman nor, going further back, does Fromm. Onehas to get to Heidegger to learn something of all the grim facts of whatinner-directedness might really mean. Allen is never nearly as funny as wasKafka, who really took the problem seriously, without the propagandisticreassurance that Left progressivism would solve it. Zelig has a flirtation withHitler—whose appeal, it almost goes without saying, is to “other-directedpersons,” or to use an equivalent expression popularized by another Germanpsychosociologist, Theodore Adorno, to “authoritarian personalities”2—but isrescued by his psychiatricus ex machina. (Flirtation with Stalin never needsexplanation in this intellectual universe.) Woody Allen helps to make us feelcomfortable with nihilism, to Americanize it. I’m O.K., thou art O.K. too, if weagree to be a bit haunted together.In politics, in entertainment, in religion, everywhere, we find the languageconnected with Nietzsche’s value revolution, a language necessitated by a newperspective on the things of most concern to us. Words such as “charisma,”“life-style,” “commitment,” “identity” and many others, all of which can easilybe traced to Nietzsche, are now practically American slang, although they, andthe things to which they refer, would have been incomprehensible to our fathers,not to speak of our Founding Fathers. A few years ago I chatted with a taxidriver in Atlanta who told me he had just gotten out of prison, where he servedtime for peddling dope. Happily he had undergone “therapy.” I asked him whatkind. He responded, “All kinds—depth-psychology, transactional analysis, butwhat I liked best was Gestalt.” Some of the German ideas did not even requireEnglish words to become the language of the people. What an extraordinary thingit is that high-class talk from what was the peak of Western intellectual life,in Germany, has become as natural as chewing gum on American streets. It indeedhad its effect on this taxi driver. He said that he had found his identity andlearned to like himself. A generation earlier he would have found God andlearned to despise himself as a sinner. The problem lay with his sense of self,not with any original sin or devils in him. We have here the peculiarly Americanway of digesting Continental despair. It is nihilism with a happy ending.This popularization of German philosophy in the United States is of peculiarinterest to me because I have watched it occur during my own intellectuallifetime, and I feel a little like someone who knew Napoleon when he was six. Ihave seen value relativism and its concomitants grow greater in the land thananyone imagined. Who in 1920 would have believed that Max Weber’s technicalsociological terminology would someday be the everyday language of the UnitedStates, the land of the Philistines, itself in the meantime become the mostpowerful nation in the world? The self-understanding of hippies, yippies,yuppies, panthers, prelates and presidents has unconsciously been formed byGerman thought of a half-century earlier; Herbert Marcuse’s accent has beenturned into a Middle Western twang; the echt Deutsch label has been replaced bya Made in America label; and the new American life-style has become a Disneylandversion of the Weimar Republic for the whole family. So my studies have led meineluctably back to the half-hidden and thrilling origins of all this, providingme a standpoint from which I look in both directions, forward to our evolvingAmerican life and backward to the profound philosophical reflection that brokewith and then buried the philosophic tradition, with the most ambiguousintellectual, moral and political consequences. Knowledge of this fascinatingintellectual history is required in order to understand ourselves and provideourselves with real alternatives—if only intellectual historians could bepersuaded that the intellect has an effect on history, that, as Nietzsche said,“the greatest deeds are thoughts,” that “the world revolves around the inventorsof new values, revolves silently.” Nietzsche was such an inventor, and we arestill revolving around him, although rather squeakily. This is our scene, andthe spectacle consists in how his views have been trivialized by democratic mandesirous of tricking himself out in borrowed finery, in how democracy has beencorrupted by alien views and alien tastes.I got my first look at this scene at the midpoint of its development, whenAmerican university life was being revolutionized by German thought, which wasstill the preserve of earnest intellectuals. When I came to the University ofChicago in the mid-forties, just after the war, terms like “value judgment” werefresh, confined to an elite and promising special insight. There were greatexpectations in the social sciences that a new era was beginning in which manand society would be understood better than they had ever been understoodbefore. The academic character of the philosophy departments, with their tiredand tiresome methodology and positivism, had caused people interested in theperennial and live questions about man to migrate to the social sciences. Therewere two writers who dominated and generated real enthusiasm—Freud and Weber.Marx was revered but, as had been true for a long time, was little read and didnot provide inspiration for dealing with the problems really facing us. Althoughit is even now still insufficiently appreciated, Freud and Weber were boththinkers who were profoundly influenced by Nietzsche, as is obvious to anyonewho knows Nietzsche and knows what was going on in the German-speaking world inthe late nineteenth century. In a strange way they divided up Nietzsche’spsychological and social concerns between them. Freud concentrated on the id, orunconscious, the sexual as the motor of the most interesting spiritualphenomena, and the related ideas of sublimation and neurosis. Weber was mostconcerned with the problem of values, the role of religion in their formation,and community. Together Freud and Weber are the immediate source of most of thelanguage with which we are so familiar.Everyone knew that they were German thinkers, and that the professors teachingthem were a mix of German refugees from Hitler and of Americans who had eitherstudied in Germany prior to Hitler or who had learned from these emigrés. It wasnot problematic to any of them that these ideas were German. Freud and Weberwere part of that great pre-Hitlerian German classical tradition, which everyonerespected. Nietzsche himself was not at that time very respectable because histhought seemed to have some discomfiting relation to fascism, and many of thosewho had favored Nietzsche in the Anglo-Saxon world (where he had had hisgreatest direct influence on artists, most notably, of course, Ezra Pound) hadnot been sufficiently alert to the dangers of fascism and anti-Semitism(although Nietzsche himself was the very opposite of an anti-Semite). The factthat German thought had taken an antirational and antiliberal turn withNietzsche, and even more so with Heidegger, was evident. But this was simplyrepressed, and a blind eye was turned to their influence on theircontemporaries. There were some superficial attempts to blame Hegel, Fichte andNietzsche for what happened in Germany, but the German classical tradition ingeneral, as well as German historicism, remained in favor, and the special starsin our firmament were either treated as spinoffs from them or as having beengenerated spontaneously. The trouble with Weimar was simply that the bad guyswon.My professors, many of whom were to become very famous, did not tend to bephilosophic and did not dig back into the sources of the new language andcategories they were using. They thought that these were scientific discoverieslike any others, which were to be used in order to make further discoveries.They were very much addicted to abstractions and generalizations, as Tocquevillepredicted they would be. They believed in scientific progress and appeared(there may have been an element of boasting and self-irony in this) to beconvinced that they were on the verge of a historic breakthrough in the socialsciences, equivalent to that scored in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuriesin the natural sciences by Galileo, Kepler, Descartes and Newton, which wouldmake earlier social science as irrelevant as was Ptolemy after Copernicus. Theseteachers were literally inebriated by the unconscious and values. And they werealso sure that scientific progress would be related to social and politicalprogress. All were either Marxists or New Deal liberals. The war against theRight had been won domestically at the polls, and in foreign affairs on thebattlefield. The decisive question of principle had been resolved. Equality andthe welfare state were now a part of the order of things, and what remained wasto complete the democratic project. Psychotherapy would make individuals happy,as sociology would improve societies.I do not believe any of these professors noticed the darker side of Freud andWeber, let alone the Nietzsche-Heidegger extremism lying somewhere beneath thesurface. Or rather, if they did notice, they found it of autobiographical ratherthan scientific interest. It is amazing to me that the irrational source of allconscious life in Freud, and the relativity of all values in Weber, did not posea problem for them and their optimism about science. Freud was very dubiousabout the future of civilization and the role of reason in the life of man. Hecertainly was not a convinced advocate of democracy or equality. And Weber, muchmore thoughtful than Freud about science, morals and politics, lived in anatmosphere of permanent tragedy. His science was formulated as a doubtful dareagainst the chaos of things, and values certainly lay beyond its limits. This iswhat the very precarious, not to say imaginary, distinction between facts andvalues meant. Reason in politics leads to the inhumanity of bureaucracy. Weberfound it impossible to prefer rational politics to the politics of irrationalcommitment; he believed that reason and science themselves were valuecommitments like any other commitments, incapable of asserting their owngoodness, thus having lost what had always been most distinctive in them.Politics required dangerous and uncontrollable semireligious value positing, andWeber was witnessing a struggle of the gods for possession of man and society,the results of which were unpredictable. Calculating reason would end up indried-up, heartless and soulless administration of things withoutcommunity-forming and sustaining values; feeling would lead to selfishindulgence in superficial pleasures; political commitment would likely fosterfanaticism, and it was questionable whether there was enough value-positingenergy left in man. Everything was up in the air, and there was no theodicy tosustain him in his travail. Weber, along with many others in Germany underNietzsche’s influence, saw that all that we care for was threatened by hisinsight and that we were without intellectual or moral resources to govern theoutcome. We require values, which in turn require a peculiar human creativitythat is drying up and in any event has no cosmic support. Scientific analysisitself concludes that reason is powerless, while dissolving the protectivehorizon within which men can value. None of this is peculiar to Weber or comessimply from his distressed personality, which he had at least partly because ofthe bleak perspective that lay before him. There is no doubt that valuerelativism, if it is true and it is believed in, takes one into very darkregions of the soul and very dangerous political experiments. But on enchantedAmerican ground the tragic sense has little place, and the early proponents ofthe new social science gaily accepted the value insight, sure that their valueswere just fine, and went ahead with science. Compare the character and concernsof Talcott Parsons with those of Max Weber and you have the measure of thedistance between the Continent and us. In Parsons you see the routinization ofWeber. It was not until the sixties that the value insight began to have itstrue effects in the United States, as it had had in Germany thirty or fortyyears earlier. Suddenly a new generation that had not lived off inherited valuefat, that had been educated in philosophic and scientific indifference to goodand evil, came on the scene representing value commitment and taught theirelders a most unpleasant lesson.The image of this astonishing Americanization of the German pathos can be seenin the smiling face of Louis Armstrong as he belts out the words of his greathit “Mack the Knife.” As most American intellectuals know, it is a translationof the song “Mackie Messer” from The Threepenny Opera, a monument of WeimarRepublic popular culture, written by two heroes of the artistic Left, BertoltBrecht and Kurt Weill. There is a strange nostalgia among many of the Americanintelligentsia for this moment just prior to Hitler’s coming to power, and LotteLenya’s rendition of this song has long stood with Marlene Dietrich’s singing“Ich bin von Kopf bis Fuss auf Liebe eingestellt” in the Blue Angel as thesymbol of a charming, neurotic, sexy, decadent longing for some hazy fulfillmentnot quite present to the consciousness. Less known to our intelligentsia is anaphorism in Nietzsche’s Thus Spake Zarathustra, a book well known to Brecht,entitled “On the Pale Criminal,” which tells the story of a neurotic murderer,eerily resembling Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment, who does not know, cannotknow, that he committed murder out of a motive as legitimate as any other anduseful in many important situations, but delegitimized in our pacific times: helusted after “the joy of the knife.” This scenario for “Mack the Knife” is thebeginning of the supra-moral attitude of expectancy, waiting to see what thevolcano of the id will spew forth, which appealed to Weimar and its Americanadmirers. Everything is all right as long as it is not fascism! With Armstrongtaking Lenya’s place, as Mai Britt took Dietrich’s, it is all mass-marketed andthe message becomes less dangerous, although no less corrupt. All awareness offoreignness disappears. It is thought to be folk culture, all-American, part ofthe American century, just as “stay loose” (as opposed to uptight) is supposedto have been an insight of rock music and not a translation of Heidegger’sGelassenheit. The historical sense and the distance on our times, the onlyadvantages of Weimar nostalgia, are gone, and American self-satisfaction—thesense that the scene is ours, that we have nothing important to learn about lifefrom the past—is served.This image can be seen in our intellectual history, if only one substitutes MaryMcCarthy for Louis Armstrong and Hannah Arendt for Lotte Lenya, or David Riesmanfor Armstrong and Erich Fromm for Lenya, and so on through the honor roll ofAmerican intellectuals. Our stars are singing a song they do not understand,translated from a German original and having a huge popular success with unknownbut wide-ranging consequences, as something of the original message touchessomething in American souls. But behind it all, the master lyricists areNietzsche and Heidegger.In short, after the war, while America was sending out its blue jeans to unitethe young of all nations, a concrete form of democratic universalism that hashad liberalizing effects on many enslaved nations, it was importing a clothingof German fabrication for its souls, which clashed with all that and cast doubton the Americanization of the world on which we had embarked, thinking it wasgood and in conformity with the rights of man. Our intellectual skyline has beenaltered by German thinkers even more radically than has our physical skyline byGerman architects.3My insistence on the Germanness of all this is intended not as a know-nothingresponse to foreign influence, the search for a German intellectual under everybed, but to heighten awareness of where we must look if we are to understandwhat we are saying and thinking, for we are in danger of forgetting. The greatinfluence of a nation with a powerful intellectual life over less well endowednations, even if the armies of the latter are very powerful, is not rare inhuman experience. The most obvious cases are the influence of Greece on Rome andof France on Germany and Russia. But it is precisely the differences betweenthese two cases and the example of Germany and the United States that makes thelatter so problematic for us. Greek and French philosophy were universalistic inintention and fact. They appealed to the use of a faculty potentially possessedby all men everywhere and at all times. The proper noun in Greek philosophy isonly an inessential tag, as it is in French Enlightenment. (The same is true ofItalian Renaissance, a rebirth that is proof of the accidental character ofnations and of the universality of Greek thinkers.) The good life and the justregime they taught knew no limits of race, nation, religion or climate. Thisrelation to man as man was the very definition of philosophy. We are aware ofthis when we speak of science, and no one seriously talks of German, Italian orEnglish physics. And when we Americans speak seriously about politics, we meanthat our principles of freedom and equality and the rights based on them arerational and everywhere applicable. World War II was really an educationalproject undertaken to force those who did not accept these principles to do so.But German philosophy after Hegel cast doubt on them, and there was somerelationship between German politics and German thought Historicism has taughtthat the mind is essentially related to history or culture. Germanness is,according to later German philosophers, an essential part of them. For Nietzscheand those influenced by him, values are the products of folk minds and haverelevance only to those minds. The possibility of translation itself, as I havementioned, is doubted by Heidegger. For him the Latin translations of the Greekphilosophical terms are superficial and do not convey the essence of thetranslated text. German thought tended not toward liberation from one’s ownculture, as did earlier thought, but toward reconstituting the rootedness inone’s own, which has been shattered by cosmopolitanism, philosophical andpolitical. We are like the millionaire in The Ghost (Geist) Goes West who bringsa castle from brooding Scotland to sunny Florida and adds canals and gondolasfor “local color.” We chose a system of thought that, like some wines, does nottravel; we chose a way of looking at things that could never be ours and had asits starting point dislike of us and our goals. The United States was held to bea nonculture, a collection of castoffs from real cultures, seeking onlycomfortable self-preservation in a regime dedicated to superficialcosmopolitanism in thought and deed. Our desire for the German things was proofwe could not understand them. The decisive character of peoples and their valuesthat was decreed by historicism of all kinds, but particularly by Nietzsche’sradical historicism, makes the German case the opposite of the Greek one. Thedifference can be seen in the way Cicero treats Socrates as opposed to the wayNietzsche does. For Cicero, Socrates is a friend and contemporary; for Nietzschehe is an enemy and an ancient. Given our country’s extreme Enlightenmentuniversalism, nothing could be more unwelcome to Nietzsche and Heidegger thanour embrace.Whether this value relativism is harmonious with democracy is a question that isdealt with by never being raised. The social sciences have dealt with Nazism asa psychopathology, a result of authoritarian or other-directed personalities, acase for psychiatrists, as presented by Woody Allen. Social science denies thatthought, especially serious thought, even the very thought at its own root,could have had anything to do with Hitler’s success. But the Weimar Republic, soattractive in its left-wing version to Americans, also contained intelligentpersons who were attracted, at least in the beginning, to fascism, for reasonsvery like those motivating the Left ideologues, reflections on autonomy andvalue creation. Once one plunges into the abyss, there is no assurancewhatsoever that equality, democracy or socialism will be found on the otherside. At very best, self-determination is indeterminate. But the conditions ofvalue creation, particularly its authoritative and religious or charismaticcharacter, would seem to militate against democratic rationalism. The sacredroots of community are contrary to the rights of individuals and liberaltolerance. The new religiosity connected with community and culture influencedpeople who look at things from the perspective of creativity to lean toward theRight. On the Left there was only an assertion that Marx would, after hisrevolution, produce exactly what Nietzsche promised, while on the Right therewas meditation on what we know of the conditions of creativity. I shall notcomment on the Nazi period of the now de-Nazified Heidegger, other than toremark that the ever more open recognition that he was the most interestingthinker of our century, formerly chastely displaced in admiration for hisvarious proxies, gives evidence that we are playing with fire. His interest innew gods led him, as it did Nietzsche, in his teaching to honor immoderationover moderation and to ridicule morality. Both helped to constitute thatambiguous Weimar atmosphere in which liberals looked like simpletons andanything was possible for people who sang of the joy of the knife in cabarets.Decent people became used to hearing things about which they would have in thepast been horrified to think, and which would not have been allowed publicexpression. An extreme outcome in the struggle between Right and Left in Weimarwas inevitable.The great mystery is the kinship of all this to American souls that were notprepared by education or historical experience for it. Pierre Hassner once askedwhether the fantastic success of Freud in America was due simply to the factthat so many of his disciples took refuge from Hitler there and were veryeffective propagandists, or whether there was some special need for him in acountry he did not much care for. As a Chicago boy, I was always particularlystruck by the fact that Marshall Field III, the scion of the great merchandisingfamily, the archetypical success story of what Weberians call the ProtestantEthic, was psychoanalyzed by Gregory Zilboorg, one of the earliest influentialFreudians in the United States, and emerged as an ardent supporter of left-wingcauses who lost fortunes on fellow-traveling newspapers. There was evidentlymuch more going on in the store’s basement than we had suspected. Was theresomething that the American self-understanding had not sufficiently recognizedor satisfied?Once Americans had become convinced that there is indeed a basement to whichpsychiatrists have the key, their orientation became that of the self, themysterious, free, unlimited center of our being. All our beliefs issue from itand have no other validation. Although nihilism and its accompanying existentialdespair are hardly anything but a pose for Americans, as the language derivedfrom nihilism has become a part of their educations and insinuated itself intotheir daily lives, they pursue happiness in ways determined by that language.There is a whole arsenal of terms for talking about nothing—caring,self-fulfillment, expanding consciousness, and so on, almost indefinitely.Nothing determinate, nothing that has a referent, as we saw in Allen andRiesman. There is a straining to say something, a search for an inwardness thatone knows one has, but it is still a cause without an effect. The inner seems tohave no relation to the outer. The outer is dissolved and becomes formless inthe light of the inner, and the inner is a will-o’-the-wisp, or pure emptiness.No wonder the mere sound of the Existentialists’ Nothing or the Hegelians’Negation has an appeal to contemporary ears. American nihilism is a mood, a moodof moodiness, a vague disquiet. It is nihilism without the abyss.Nihilism as a state of soul is revealed not so much in the lack of firm beliefsbut in a chaos of the instincts or passions. People no longer believe in anatural hierarchy of the soul’s varied and conflicting inclinations, and thetraditions that provided a substitute for nature have crumbled. The soul becomesa stage for a repertory company that changes plays regularly—sometimes atragedy, sometimes a comedy; one day love, another day politics, and finallyreligion; now cosmopolitanism, and again rooted loyalty; the city or thecountry; individualism or community; sentimentality or brutality. And there isneither principle nor will to impose a rank order on all of these. All ages andplaces, all races and all cultures can play on this stage. Nietzsche believedthat the wild costume ball of the passions was both the disadvantage and theadvantage of late modernity. The evident disadvantage is the decomposition ofunity or “personality,” which in the long run will lead to psychic entropy. Theadvantage hoped for is that the richness and tension present in the modern soulmight be the basis for comprehensive new worldviews that would take seriouslywhat had previously been consigned to a spiritual ashcan. This richness,according to Nietzsche, consisted largely in thousands of years of inherited andnow unsatisfied religious longing. But this possible advantage does not existfor young Americans, because their poor education has impoverished theirlongings, and they are hardly aware of the great pasts that Nietzsche wasthinking of and had within himself. What they do have now is an unordered tangleof rather ordinary passions, running through their consciousnesses like amonochrome kaleidoscope. They are egotists, not in a vicious way, not in the wayof those who know the good, just or noble, and selfishly reject them, butbecause the ego is all there is in present theory, in what they are taught.We are a bit like savages who, having been discovered and evangelized bymissionaries, have converted to Christianity without having experienced all thatcame before and after the revelation. The fact that most of us never would haveheard of Oedipus if it were not for Freud should make us aware that we arealmost utterly dependent on our German missionaries or intermediaries for ourknowledge of Greece, Rome, Judaism and Christianity; that, however profound thatknowledge may be, theirs is only one interpretation; and that we have only beentold as much as they thought we needed to know. It is an urgent business for onewho seeks self-awareness to think through the meaning of the intellectualdependency that has led us to such an impasse. The following explanatorydictionary of our current language is meant to be a small contribution to thatundertaking.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------2 [012.html#f2p2ch1_2] Exactly the same point, but without Allen’s saving wit,is stressed by Bertolucci in The Conformist.3 [012.html#f3p2ch1_3] Mies van der Rohe too was a figure around Chicago beforehe really got his chance to build, and the Bauhaus was another product ofWeimar, closely allied with the currents of thought I have been describing."},{"pageContent":"TWO REVOLUTIONS AND TWOSTATES OF NATUREThe discovery of the soul’s basement, exploration into it, and attraction to itsdark contents have long been Continental specialties. Obscure longings andsearch for the elusive grounds of all things are pervasive themes of nineteenth-and twentieth-century French, German, and (prior to the revolution) Russianliterature. Continental “depth” was thought by intellectuals to be opposed toAmerican “superficiality.” American souls were, so to speak, constructed withouta basement, more reconciled to this world and not addicted to looking beyond it,not haunted by a sense of the groundlessness of their experience. Thus, whenAmericans became able to afford the luxury of indulging in Continentalliterature, as in Continental cuisine, we had to wonder whether their appetitewas real and how they would digest the fare.The issue between the Continent and us can be summed up by the word “bourgeois.”The new man of the new democratic political regime has been labeled bourgeois byContinental philosophers and artists for more than two hundred years. Thisoriginally meant a diminished, egotistical, materialistic being without grandeuror beauty of soul, and it has maintained that negative sense—best known toAmericans because of Marx—up to our day. Yet long after Nietzsche claimed thetheme had already become boring, Continental thinkers have been obsessed withbourgeois man as representing the worst and most contemptible failure ofmodernity, which must at all costs be overcome. Nihilism in its most palpablesense means that the bourgeois has won, that the future, all foreseeablefutures, belong to him, that all heights above him and all depths beneath himare illusory and that life is not worth living on these terms. It is theannouncement that all the alternatives or correctives—for example, idealism,romanticism, historicism, and Marxism—have failed. Americans, on the other hand,have generally believed that the modern democratic project is being fulfilled intheir country, can be fulfilled elsewhere, and that that project is good. Theydo not naturally apply the term “bourgeois” to themselves, or to anyone else forthat matter. They do like to call themselves middle class, but that does notcarry with it any determinate spiritual content. It is rather a good thing tobe. If there is a failure here, it is that there are poor people. The term“middle class” does not have any of the many opposites that bourgeois has, suchas aristocrat, saint, hero, or artist—all good—except perhaps for proletarian orsocialist. The spirit is at home, if not entirely satisfied, in America.Modernity is constituted by the political regimes founded on freedom andequality, hence on the consent of the governed, and made possible by a newscience of nature that masters and conquers nature, providing prosperity andhealth. This was a self-conscious philosophical project, the greatesttransformation of man’s relations with his fellows and with nature evereffected. The American Revolution instituted this system of government forAmericans, who in general were satisfied with the result and had a pretty clearview of what they had done. The questions of political principle and of righthad been solved once and for all. No further revolution would be necessary, ifrevolution means changing of the fundamental principles of legitimacy, inaccordance with reason and the natural order of things, and requiring armedcombat against those who adhere to old orders and their unjust forms of rule.Revolution, a new word in the political vocabulary, which first referred to theGlorious Revolution of 1688 in England, made in the name of very much the sameprinciples as ours, is akin to the movement of the sun from night to day.The French Revolution, called a new dawn by Kant, was a much greater event thanthe American Revolution in the eyes of the world at that time because itconcerned one of the two great powers in it, the veritable school of Europe,with one of the oldest and most civilized peoples. It was fought and won forfreedom and equality, as were the English and American revolutions. It wouldseem to have completed the irresistible triumph of modern philosophy’s projectand to give a final proof of the theodicy of liberty and equality. But, unlikeits predecessors, it gave birth to a dazzling array of interpretations and setoff reactions in all directions that have not yet exhausted the impulse it lentto them. The Right—in its only serious meaning, the party opposed to equality(not economic equality but equality of rights)—at first wanted to undo theRevolution in the name of Throne and Altar, and this reaction probably breathedits last only with Francisco Franco in 1975. Another form of the Right, as itwere a progressive Right, wanted to create and impose a new kind of inequality,a new European or German aristocracy, on the world, and it was blasted out ofexistence in Berlin in 1945. The Left, which intended to complete the Revolutionby abolishing private property, is still quite alive but has never succeeded indoing so in those nations, particularly France, most influenced by the FrenchRevolution. It was the Center, the bourgeois solution, which in the long run wonout, but after so many regrets and so many disappointed aspirations, in France,Germany, Austria, Belgium, Italy, Spain and Portugal, as it had in England andthe United States. The last really great bourgeois-haters died at about the sametime: Sartre, De Gaulle, and Heidegger. (Americans are not sufficiently awarethat hatred of the bourgeois is at least as much a thing of the Right as of theLeft.) One can expect a certain literary afterglow, since bourgeois-baiting isalmost a reflex among writers and is unlearned with great difficulty, as wasproved when so many kept at it even though there were Nazis and Communistsaround who might have merited their attention. In order to keep that flamealive, many literary persons interpreted Hitler as a bourgeois phenomenon, aninterpretation that they have made stick by force of repetition.We may now have run out of the new revolutions, and the new metaphysics requiredto justify them, which were intended to rectify the French Revolution’sperceived failures; but the reconciliation with reality is more fatigued thanenthusiastic. I use the word “perceived” because, on the basis of the variety ofreadings of the French Revolution—by monarchists, Catholics, liberals,socialists, Robespierreans, Bonapartists—which were not idle academic exercisesbut life-forming and action-engendering, Nietzsche concluded that there was notext here but only interpretation. This observation is the foundation of thecurrently popular view that there is no is but only perspectives on becoming,that the perception is as much reality as there is, that things are what theyare perceived to be. This view is, of course, allied with the notion that man isa value-creating, not a good-discovering, being. It is not surprising to findits source at least partially in the greatest events of modern politics.The misunderstanding between America and the Continent is that where Americanssaw a solution, Continentals saw a problem. The American Revolution produced aclear and unified historical reality; the French Revolution, a series ofquestions and problems. Americans have tended to look at the French Revolutionwith indulgence. It represented the good things, akin to ours, but did notsucceed in providing a stable institutional framework for them. A large segmentof intellectual opinion on the Continent, the most influential segment,4regarded the French Revolution as a failure not because it was not successful inestablishing a liberal democracy but because it had been entirely too successfulin producing the liberal democratic type of man—i.e., the bourgeois—and givinghis class, the bourgeoisie, power in society. Even so pro-American andpro-liberal a writer as Tocqueville, who understood the French difficulty to beindeed its incapacity to adapt to liberal institutions, was melancholy about theprospects for a fully human life within them.Americans found little to charm them in the ancien régime in France. Its throneand altar were the very reality of, respectively, the unjust inequality and theprejudice that the American regime was intended to replace in the world.America, they believed, would succeed in its project with relative ease becausewe began here with the equality of conditions. Americans did not have to kill aking, displace an aristocracy that would stay around and cause trouble, ordisestablish a church and perhaps abolish it. But the need to do all this, plusthe presence of the Parisian mob, which could not accept the rule of law,prevented the French from attaining the reasonable consensus required fororderly democratic government.But another view of these events dominated public discussion on the Continent.To some Europeans, the Americans represented an intolerable narrowing of thehuman horizon, and the price paid for their decent order and prosperity was toohigh. The French aristocracy had a nobility, brilliance and taste thatcontrasted sharply with the pettiness and grayness of liberal society’scommercial life and motives. The loss of what that aristocracy represented wouldimpoverish the world. More important, the religion that was dismantled could bethought to express the depth and seriousness of life. If the noble and thesacred cannot find serious expression in democracy, its choiceworthiness becomesquestionable. These are the arguments, the special pleading of thereactionaries, the disinherited of the ancien régime.More serious for us are the arguments of the revolutionaries who accepted ourprinciples of freedom and equality. Many believed that we had not thoughtthrough these cherished ideals. Can equality really only mean equal opportunityfor unequal talents to acquire property? Should shrewdness at acquisition bebetter rewarded than moral goodness? Can private property and equality sit soeasily together when even Plato required communism among equals? Communism orsocialism never really made much headway against the respect for privateproperty in the United States. Locke’s definition of property suited, and stillsuits, our tempers perfectly, and Rousseau’s critique of it made almost noimpression here, although it was and remains very potent in Europe. And freedomfor us meant merely acting as one pleases, restricted only by the minimumdemands of social existence. We had not adequately understood what reallysetting laws for ourselves required, nor had we gone beyond the merely negativefreedom of satisfying brutish impulsion. As for religion, the domesticatedchurches in America preserved the superstition of Christianity, overcoming ofwhich was perhaps the key to liberating man. Should a good regime be atheistic,or should it have a civil religion? And, finally, what in the world can we dowith the Napoleonic—heroic ambition and military glory—other than ignore ordebunk it?Such were the questions raised on the slaughter-bench of History by the FrenchRevolution, questions that we were not eager to hear. They provided the materialfor a century of serious philosophy on the Continent, to which the spirit ofphilosophy had repaired from England. Even Mill, the heir of utilitarianism,which was a still narrower and more self-satisfied version of earlier liberalthought, had to turn to a German thinker, Humboldt, for the notion ofspontaneity, to give an attractive modern account of the essence of liberty andprotect it from the dangers of the tyranny of the majority. Philosophy begins,it seems, in the confrontation with the fundamental political alternatives. Ofthe truly great philosophers since the French Revolution, only Kant was a friendof liberal democracy. And he felt constrained to reinterpret it in ways thatmade it both unrecognizable and unattractive to us. He developed a newepistemology that makes freedom possible when the science of nature isdeterministic, a new morality that makes the dignity of man possible when humannature is understood to be composed of selfish natural appetites, and a newesthetics that saves the beautiful and the sublime from mere subjectivity. Noneof this concerned the earlier egalitarian thought of the founders of liberalism.What was acted out in the American and French Revolutions had been thought outbeforehand in the writings of Locke and Rousseau, the scenarists for the dramaof modern politics. These Columbuses of the mind—Thomas Hobbes led the way, butLocke and Rousseau followed and were considered more reliable reporters—exploredthe newly discovered territory called the state of nature, where our forefathersall once dwelled, and brought the important news that by nature all men are freeand equal, and that they have rights to life, liberty and the pursuit ofproperty. This is the kind of information that causes revolutions because itpulls the magic carpet out from under the feet of kings and nobles. Locke andRousseau agreed on these basics, which became the firm foundation of modernpolitics. Where they disagreed, the major conflicts within modernity were tooccur. Locke was the great practical success; the new English and Americanregimes founded themselves according to his instructions. Rousseau, probably thegreatest literary success of all time, inspired all the later attempts inthought and deed, private and public, to alter, correct or escape from thefatality of Locke’s complete victory.It is now fashionable to deny that there ever was a state of nature. We are likearistocrats who do not care to know that our ancestors were once savages who,motivated only by fear of death and scarcity, killed one another in quarrelsover acorns. But we continue to live off the capital passed on to us by theserejected predecessors. Everyone believes in freedom and equality and the rightsconsequent to them. These were, however, brought to civil society from the stateof nature; in the absence of any other ground for them, they must be just asmythical as the tale of the state of nature told by the unreliable travelers.Instructed by the new natural science that provided their compass, they went tothe origin and not to the end, as did the older political philosophers. Socratesimagined a shining city in speech; Hobbes discovered an isolated individualwhose life was “mean, nasty, brutish and short” This opens up a very differentperspective on what one wants and hopes for from politics. Prudence points nottoward regimes dedicated to the cultivation of rare and difficult, if notimpossible, virtues, but toward a good police force to protect men from oneanother and allow them to preserve themselves as well as possible. Hobbes, Lockeand Rousseau all found that one way or another nature led men to war, and thatcivil society’s purpose was not to cooperate with a natural tendency in mantoward perfection but to make peace where nature’s imperfection causes war.The reports from the state of nature mixed bad news and good news. Perhaps themost important discovery was that there was no Garden of Eden; the Eldorado ofthe spirit turned out to be both desert and jungle. Man was not provided for atthe beginning, and his current state is not a result of his sin, but of nature’smiserliness. He is on his own. God neither looks after him nor punishes him.Nature’s indifference to justice is a terrible bereavement for man. He must carefor himself without the hope that good men have always had: that there is aprice to be paid for crime, that the wicked will suffer. But it is also a greatliberation—from God’s tutelage, from the claims of kings, nobles and priests,and from guilt or bad conscience. The greatest hopes are dashed, but some of theworst terrors and inner enslavements are dispelled.Unprotectedness, nakedness, unsuccored suffering and the awfulness of death arethe prospects that man without illusions must face. But, looking at things fromthe point of view of already established society, man can be proud of himself.He has progressed, and by his own efforts. He can think well of himself. Andnow, possessing the truth, he can be even freer to be himself and improve hissituation. He can freely make governments that, untrammeled by mythical dutiesand titles to rule, serve his interests. The explorations of Hobbes, Locke andRousseau of the origins made possible a new beginning in theory, a project forthe reconstruction of politics, just as the exploration and discovery of the NewWorld promised a new beginning in practice. The two new beginnings coincided andproduced, among other wonders, the United States.From his reflection on the state of nature, Locke drew the formula ofEnlightenment, with its particular combination of natural and political science.Its starting point is the untrammeled use of reason. In this he simply followsthe oldest opinions of the philosophers. Freedom for man consists in orderinghis life according to what he can see for himself through his most distinctivefaculty, liberated from the force of tyrants and the authority of lies, i.e.,myths. Through unaided reason, man as man, as opposed to the man of this placeor time, nation or religion, can know the causes of things, can know nature forhimself. Autonomy does not mean, as is now generally thought, the fateful,groundless decision in the void, but governing oneself according to the real.There must be an outside for the inside to have meaning.So thought Locke and his philosophic predecessors and successors. Whatdistinguished Enlightenment from earlier philosophy was its intention to extendto all men what had been the preserve of only a few: the life lived according toreason. It was not “idealism” or “optimism” that motivated these philosophersbut a new science, a “method,” and allied with them, a new political science. Aclear and distinct mathematical science of the movement of bodies, discovered bythe use of a simple method readily understood by ordinary men, could make theknowledge of nature accessible to them, if not provide them with the genius todiscover that knowledge. The various mythic or poetic views of the whole thatset the horizons for the nations of man, and within which the philosophers hadalways lived alone and misunderstood, would be dispensed with, and thefundamental difference in perspective between scientist and nonscientistovercome. Further, if man himself is taken out of the shadows of the kingdom ofdarkness and examined in the light of science, he sees that by nature he belongsto the realm of bodies in motion, and that he, like all other bodies, wishes topreserve his motion, that is, his life. Every man has a powerful fear of death,that corresponds to the way of nature. Critical, scientific, methodicalexamination of the other ends prescribed for man can show that they belong tothe realm of the imagination, of false opinion, or derive from this primary end.Such critical examination, of which all men are capable if given guidance byphilosophers, and which is supported by powerful inclinations in all men,results in a salutary unity of purpose and a useful simplification of the humanproblem: vulnerable man must seek the means to his preservation. Since this iswhat all men really want, whatever arrangements help them get food, clothing,shelter, health and, above all, protection from one another will, if they areproperly educated, win their consent and their loyalty.Once the world has been purged of ghosts or spirits, it reveals to us that thecritical problem is scarcity. Nature is a stepmother who has left us unprovidedfor. But this means we need have no gratitude. When we revered nature, we werepoor. Since there was not enough, we had to take from one another; and as aresult of this competition, there was inevitably war, the greatest threat tolife. But if, instead of fighting one another, we band together and make war onour stepmother, who keeps her riches from us, we can at the same time providefor ourselves and end our strife. The conquest of nature, which is made possibleby the insight of science and by the power it produces, is the key to thepolitical. The old commandment that we love our brothers made impossible demandson us, demands against nature, while doing nothing to provide for real needs.What is required is not brotherly love or faith, hope and charity, butself-interested rational labor. The man who contributes most to relieving humanmisery is the one who produces most, and the surest way of getting him to do sois not by exhorting him, but by rewarding him most handsomely to sacrificepresent pleasure for the sake of future benefit, or to assure avoidance of painthrough the power so gained. From the point of view of man’s well-being andsecurity, what is needed is not men who practice the Christian virtues or thoseof Aristotle, but rational (capable of calculating their interest) andindustrious men. Their opposite numbers are not the vicious, wicked or sinful,but the quarrelsome and the idle. This may include priests and nobles as well asthose who most obviously spring to mind.This scheme provides the structure for the key term of liberal democracy, themost successful and useful political notion of our world: rights. Governmentexists to protect the product of men’s labor, their property, and therewith lifeand liberty. The notion that man possesses inalienable natural rights, that theybelong to him as an individual prior, both in time and in sanctity, to any civilsociety, and that civil societies exist for and acquire their legitimacy fromensuring those rights, is an invention of modern philosophy. Rights, like theother terms discussed in this chapter, are new in modernity, not a part of thecommon-sense language of politics or of classical political philosophy. Hobbesinitiated the notion of rights, and it was given its greatest respectability byLocke. Unlike the other terms, however, we understand rights perfectly and haveimmediate access to the thought underlying them. The others are alien,problematic; and to understand them requires a great effort that, I am arguing,we do not make. But rights are ours. They constitute our being; we live them;they are our common sense. Right is not the opposite of wrong, but of duty. Itis a part of, or the essence of, freedom. It begins from man’s cherished passionto live, and to live as painlessly as possible. An analysis of universal needsand their relation to nature as a whole demonstrates that this passion is notmerely an imagination. It can be called a right and converted into a term ofpolitical relevance when a man is fully conscious of what he needs most,recognizes that he is threatened by others and that they are threatened by him.The spring that makes the social machinery tick is this recognition, whichgenerates the calculation that, if he agrees to respect the life, liberty andproperty of others (for which he has no natural respect), they can be induced toreciprocate. This is the foundation of rights, a new kind of morality solidlygrounded in self-interest.To say, “I’ve got my rights,” is as instinctive with Americans as breathing, soclear and evident is this way of looking at things. It signifies the rules ofthe game, within which men play peacefully, the necessity of which they see andaccept, and the infringement of which arouses moral indignation. It is our onlyprinciple of justice. From our knowledge of our rights flows our acceptance ofthe duties to the community that protects them. Righteousness means for usrespect for equal rights equally guaranteed by the force of government. Everyonein the world today speaks of rights, even the communists, the heirs of Marx, whoridiculed “bourgeois rights” as a sham and in whose thought there is no placefor rights. But almost every thoughtful observer knows that it is in the UnitedStates that the idea of rights has penetrated most deeply into the bloodstreamof its citizens and accounts for their unusual lack of servility. Without it wewould have nothing, only chaotic selfishness; and it is the interested source ofa certain disinterestedness. We feel people’s interests should be respected.This scheme represented a radical break with the old ways of looking at thepolitical problem. In the past it was thought that man is a dual being, one partof him concerned with the common good, the other with private interests. To makepolitics work, man, it was thought, has to overcome the selfish part of himself,to tyrannize over the merely private, to be virtuous. Locke and his immediatepredecessors taught that no part of man is naturally directed to the common goodand that the old way was both excessively harsh and ineffective, that it wentagainst the grain. They experimented with using private interest for publicinterest, putting natural freedom ahead of austere virtue. Self-interest ishostile to the common good, but enlightened self-interest is not. And this isthe best key to the meaning of enlightenment. Man’s reason can be made to seehis vulnerability and to anticipate future scarcity. This rational awareness ofthe future and its dangers is enough to set the passions in motion. In the pastmen were members of communities by divine commandment and by attachments akin tothe blood ties that constitute the family. They were, to use Rousseau’s phrase,“denatured.” Their loyalties were fanatic and repressive of their natures. Clearreasoning wiped that slate clean in order to inscribe on it contracts calmlymade with expectation of profit involving the kinds of relations found inbusiness. Calculated work is the sum of the whole affair. Thomas Watson said itall with the motto he placed on the walls of his offices and factories: “Think”;for he was addressing himself to men who were already working.Americans are Lockeans: recognizing that work is necessary (no longing for anonexistent Eden), and will produce well-being; following their naturalinclinations moderately, not because they possess the virtue of moderation butbecause their passions are balanced and they recognize the reasonableness ofthat; respecting the rights of others so that theirs will be respected; obeyingthe law because they made it in their own interest. From the point of view ofGod or heroes, all this is not very inspiring. But for the poor, the weak, theoppressed—the overwhelming majority of mankind—it is the promise of salvation.As Leo Strauss put it, the moderns “built on low but solid ground.”Rousseau believed that Hobbes and Locke did not go far enough, that they had notreached the Indies of the spirit, although they thought they had. They foundexactly what they set out to look for: a natural man whose naturalness consistedin having just those qualities necessary to constitute society. It was toosimple to be true. Natural man is entirely for himself. He is numerical unity, the absolute wholewhich is relative only to itself or its kind. Civil man is only a fractionalunity dependent on the denominator; his value is determined by his relation tothe whole, which is the social body….He who in the civil order wants to preserve the primacy of the sentiments ofnature does not know what he wants. Always in contradiction with himself, alwaysfloating between his inclinations and his duties, he will never be either man orcitizen. He will be good neither for himself nor for others. He will be one ofthese men of our days: a Frenchman, an Englishman, a bourgeois. He will benothing. (Emile, pp. 39-40, ed. Bloom, Basic Books, It was Locke who wanted to preserve the primacy of the sentiments of nature inthe civil order, and the result of his mistake is the bourgeois. Rousseauinvented the term in its modern sense, and with it we find ourselves at thegreat source of modern intellectual life. The comprehensiveness and subtlety ofhis analysis of the phenomenon left nothing new to be said about it, and theRight and the Left forever after accepted his description of modern man assimply true, while the Center was impressed, intimidated, and put on thedefensive by it. So persuasive was Rousseau that he destroyed theself-confidence of the Enlightenment at the moment of its triumph.It must not be forgotten that Rousseau begins his critique from fundamentalagreements with Locke, whom he greatly admired, about the animal man. Man is bynature a solitary being, concerned only with his preservation and his comfort.Rousseau, moreover, agrees that man makes civil society by contract, for thesake of his preservation. He disagrees with Locke that self-interest, howeverunderstood, is in any automatic harmony with what civil society needs anddemands. If Rousseau is right, man’s reason, calculating his best interest, willnot lead him to wish to be a good citizen, a law-abiding citizen. He will eitherbe himself, or he will be a citizen, or he will try to be both and be neither.In other words, enlightenment is not enough to establish society, and even tendsto dissolve it.The road from the state of nature was very long, and nature is distant from usnow. A self-sufficient, solitary being must have undergone many changes tobecome a needy, social one. On the way, the goal of happiness was exchanged forthe pursuit of safety and comfort, the means of achieving happiness. Civilsociety is surely superior to a condition of scarcity and universal war. Allthis artifice, however, preserves a being who no longer knows what he is, who isso absorbed with existing that he has forgotten his reason for existing, who inthe event of actually attaining full security and perfect comfort has no notionof what to do. Progress culminates in the recognition that life is meaningless.Hobbes was surely right to look for the most powerful sentiments in man, thosethat exist independently of opinion and are always a part of man. But fear ofdeath, however powerful it may be and however useful it may be as a motive forseeking peace and, hence, law with teeth in it, cannot be the fundamentalexperience. It presupposes an even more fundamental one: that life is good. Thedeepest experience is the pleasant sentiment of existence. The idle, savage mancan enjoy that sentiment. The busy bourgeois cannot, with his hard work and hisconcern with dealing with others rather than being himself.Nature still has something of the greatest importance to tell us. We may belaboring to master it, but the reason for mastering nature comes from nature.The fear of death on which Hobbes relied, and which is also decisive for Locke,insists on the negative experience of nature and obliterates the positiveexperience presupposed by it. This positive experience is somehow still activein us; we are full of vague dissatisfactions in our forgetfulness, but our mindsmust make an enormous effort to find the natural sweetness of life in itsfullness. The way back is at least as long as the one that brought us here. ForHobbes and Locke nature is near and unattractive, and man’s movement intosociety was easy and unambiguously good. For Rousseau nature is distant andattractive, and the movement was hard and divided man. Just when nature seemedto have been finally cast out or overcome in us, Rousseau gave birth to anoverwhelming longing for it in us. Our lost wholeness is there. One is remindedof Plato’s Symposium, but there the longing for wholeness was directed towardknowledge of the ideas, of the ends. In Rousseau longing is, in its initialexpression, for the enjoyment of the primitive feelings, found at the origins inthe state of nature. Plato would have united with Rousseau against the bourgeoisin his insistence on the essential humanness of longing for the good, as opposedto careful avoidance of the bad. Neither longing nor enthusiasm belongs to thebourgeois. The story of philosophy and the arts under Rousseau’s influence hasbeen the search for, or fabrication of, plausible objects of longing to counterbourgeois well-being and self-satisfaction. Part of that story has been thebourgeois’ effort to acquire the culture of longing as part of itsself-satisfaction.The opposition between nature and society is Rousseau’s interpretation of thecause of the dividedness of man. He finds that the bourgeois experiences thisdividedness in conflict between self-love and love of others, inclination andduty, sincerity and hypocrisy, being oneself and being alienated. Thisopposition between nature and society pervades all modern discussion of thehuman problem. Hobbes and Locke made the distinction in order to overcome allthe tensions caused in man by the demands of virtue, and then to make wholenesseasy for him. They thought that they had reduced the distance betweeninclination and duty by deriving all duty from inclination; Rousseau arguedthat, if anything, they had increased that distance. He thus restored the older,pre-modern sense of the dividedness of man and hence of the complexity of hisattainment of happiness, the pursuit of which liberal society guarantees himwhile making its attainment impossible. But the restoration takes place on verydifferent grounds, as can be seen in the fact that in the past men traced thetension to the irreconcilable demands of body and soul, not of nature andsociety. This too opens up a rich field for reflection on Rousseau’soriginality. The blame shifts, and the focus of the perennial quest for unity isaltered. Man was born whole, and it is at least conceivable that he become wholeonce again. Hope and despair of a kind not permitted by the body-souldistinction arise. What one is to think of oneself and one’s desires changes.The correctives range from revolution to therapy, but there is little place forthe confessional or for mortification of the flesh. Rousseau’s Confessions were,in opposition to those of Augustine, intended to show that he was born good,that the body’s desires are good, that there is no original sin. Man’s naturehas been maimed by a long history; and now he must live in society, for which heis not suited and which makes impossible demands on him. There is either anuneasy acquiescence to the present or the attempt in one way or another toreturn to the past, or the search for a creative synthesis of the two poles,nature and society.These are the essence of the social and political thought of the nineteenth andtwentieth centuries that took off from Rousseau’s critique of liberalism. Thenature-society distinction is more than familiar to all of us. We know it bestfrom Freud, in whose account of the unconscious is to be found lost nature, aswell as the whole harsh history that took us out of nature; in whose account ofthe neuroses one sees the effects of civilization’s demands on us; and in whoseaccount of the reality principle one recognizes grim adjustment to bourgeoissociety. The easy solution to man’s dividedness in early modern thought isrejected, but a solution is still expected. The search for solutions, easy ordifficult, to problems is the stamp of modernity, while antiquity treated thefundamental tensions as permanent.The first reaction to the self’s maladaptation to society, its recalcitrance tothe rationality of preservation and property, is the attempt to recover theself’s pristine state, to live according to its first inclinations, to “get intouch with one’s feelings,” to live naturally, simply, without society’sartificially generated desires, dependencies, hypocrisies. The side ofRousseau’s thought that arouses nostalgia for nature came to the United Statesearly on, in the life and writings of Thoreau. Recently, joined to many othermovements, it came to full flower and found a wide public. Anarchism in one formor another is an expression of this longing, which arises as soon as politicsand laws are understood to be repressions, perhaps necessary, but nonethelessrepressions of our inclinations rather than perfections of them or modes ofsatisfying them. For the first time in the history of political philosophy, nonatural impulse is thought to lead toward civil society, or to find itssatisfaction within it. Yet those who first drew the distinction between natureand society (which obviously means society is completely of human making, not inany way natural), thought that the preference would be immediately and withouthesitation for society. As a matter of fact, the distinction was made in orderto emphasize how desirable civil society is, how fragile man’s existencenaturally is, and thus to extinguish those passions based on imagining thatprotection comes from nature or God, that rebel against civil society. Man, ifhe is sensible, separates himself from nature and becomes its master andconqueror. This was and still is the prevailing belief of liberal democracies,with their peace, gentleness, prosperity, productivity and applied science,particularly medical science.All of this was held to be a great advance over the brutish natural condition.Locke said that “a day-laborer in England is better clothed, housed, and fedthan a king in America,” meaning an Indian chief. But Tocqueville notes thatthere is nevertheless something impressive about the American king. Perhaps thesavage gains something in the comparison if pride, independence, contempt fordeath, freedom from anxiety about the future and other such qualities are takeninto consideration. From the point of view of this savage, nature begins to lookgood rather than bad. Nature that excludes man and his corrupting hand becomesan object of respect. It gives guidance where previously there was only man’swhim. The old view that cities are properly the peaks of nature is neverconsidered and is barely comprehensible. The city is cut loose from nature andis a product only of man’s art. Very different values can be attached to cities,but both sides begin from the same premise. Now there are two competing viewsabout man’s relation to nature, both founded on the modern distinction betweennature and society. Nature is the raw material of man’s freedom from harshnecessity, or else man is the polluter of nature. Nature in both cases meansdead nature, or nature without man and untouched by man—mountains, forests,lakes and rivers.Our nation, a great stage for the acting out of great thoughts, presents theclassic confrontation between Locke’s views of the state of nature andRousseau’s criticism of them. On the one hand you have the farmer who neverlooked at America’s trees, fields and streams with a romantic eye. The trees areto be felled, to make clearings, build houses and heat them; the fields are tobe tilled to produce more food, or mined for whatever is necessary to makemachines run; the streams are there to be used as waterways for transportingfood, or as sources of power. On the other hand there is the Sierra Club, whichis dedicated to preventing such violations of nature from going any further, andcertainly seems to regret what was already done. More interesting is thecoexistence of these opposing sentiments in the most advanced minds of our day.Nature is raw material, worthless without the mixture of human labor; yet natureis also the highest and most sacred thing. The same people who struggle to savethe snail-darter bless the pill, worry about hunting deer and defend abortion.Reverence for nature, mastery of nature—whichever is convenient. The principleof contradiction has been repealed.This is the direct result of the two state-of-nature teachings. Locke’s isresponsible for our institutions, justifies our absorption with private propertyand the free market, and gives us our sense of right. Rousseau’s lies behind themost prevalent views of what life is about and how to seek healing for ourwounds. The former teaches that adjustment to civil society is almost automatic;the latter that such adjustment is very difficult indeed and requires all kindsof intermediaries between it and lost nature. The two outstanding intellectualtypes of our day represent these two teachings. The crisp, positive, efficient,no-nonsense economist is the Lockean; the deep, brooding, somber psychoanalystis the Rousseauan. In principle their positions are incompatible, but easygoingAmerica provides them with a modus vivendi. Economists tell us how to makemoney; psychiatrists give us a place to spend it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------4 [013.html#f4p2ch2_4] Thinkers like Tocqueville who, in a qualified way,supported the American solution, are little read or cared for in France; andMontesquieu, that Frenchman who is closest to the English and American traditionof political philosophy and most influenced the American Founders, is the one ofFrance’s truly great writers who least affects French consciousness."},{"pageContent":"THE SELFThe domain now supervised by psychiatrists, as well as other specialists in thedeeper understanding of man, is the self. It is another one of the discoveriesmade in the state of nature, perhaps the most important because it reveals whatwe really are. We are selves, and everything we do is to satisfy or fulfill ourselves. Locke was one of the early thinkers, if not the earliest, to use theword in its modern sense. From the very beginning it has been difficult todefine; and as Woody Allen helped teach us, it has become ever more difficult todo so. We are suffering from a three-hundred-year-long identity crisis. We goback and back, ever farther, hunting the self as it retreats into the forest,just a step ahead of us. Although disquieting, this may, from the point of viewof its latest interpretation, be the essence of the self: mysterious, ineffable,indefinable, unlimited, creative, known only by its deeds; in short, like God,of whom it is the impious mirror image. Above all, it is individual, unique; itis me, not some distant man in general or man-in-himself. As Ivan Ilyich inTolstoy’s story explains, the “All men are mortal” in the famous syllogism thatguarantees Socrates’ death cannot apply to this Ivan Ilyich who had a stripedleather ball when he was a child. Everyone knows that the particular asparticular escapes the grasp of reason, the form of which is the general or theuniversal. To sum up, the self is the modern substitute for the soul.All of this goes back to that audacious innovator Machiavelli, who spokeadmiringly of men who cared more for their fatherland than for the salvation oftheir souls. The higher demands made on men by the soul inevitably lead them toneglect this world in favor of the other world. Millennia of philosophizingabout the soul had resulted in no certitude about it, while those who pretendedto know it, the priests, held power or influenced it, and corrupted politics asa result. Princes were rendered ineffective by their own or their subjects’opinions about the salvation of their souls, while men slaughtered each otherwholesale because of differences of such opinion. The care of the soul crippledmen in the conduct of their lives.Machiavelli dared men literally to forget about their souls and the possibilityof eternal damnation, to do so in theory as well as in practice, as did thosemen whom he praised. Hobbes, among others, took him up on the dare with a verynew interpretation of the old Delphic inscription “Know thyself!,” whichSocrates had interpreted as an exhortation to philosophize, and Freud was tointerpret as an invitation to psychoanalysis. Freud was unknowingly following inthe line of Hobbes, who said that each man should look to what he feels—feels,not thinks; he, not another. Self is more feeling than reason, and is in thefirst place defined as the contrary of other. “Be yourself.” Astonishingly,Hobbes is the first propagandist for bohemia and preacher of sincerity orauthenticity. No wanderings to the ends of the universe on the wings ofimagination, no metaphysical foundations, no soul ordering things as well asmen. Man is perhaps a stranger in nature. But he is something and can get hisbearings by his most powerful passions. “Feel!,” Hobbes said. In particular youshould imagine how you feel when another man holds a gun to your temple andthreatens to shoot you. That concentrates all of the self in a single point,tells us what counts. At that moment one is a real self, not a falseconsciousness, not alienated by opinions of the church, the state or the public.This experience helps much more to “set priorities” than does any knowledge ofthe soul or any of its alleged emanations such as conscience.Throughout the whole tradition, religious and philosophic, man had two concerns,the care of his body and the care of his soul, expressed in the oppositionbetween desire and virtue. In principle he was supposed to long to be allvirtue, to break free from the chains of bodily desire. Wholeness would behappiness; but it is not possible, at least in this life. Machiavelli turnedthings upside down. Happiness is indeed wholeness, so let’s try the wholenessavailable to us in this life. The tradition viewed man as the incomprehensibleand self-contradictory union of two substances, body and soul. Man cannot beconceived as body only. But if the function of whatever is not body in him is tocooperate in the satisfaction of bodily desire, then man’s dividedness isovercome. Simple virtue is not possible, and love of virtue is only animagination, a kind of perversion of desire effected by society’s (i.e.,others’) demands on us. But simple desire is possible.This absoluteness of desire uninhibited by thoughts of virtue is what is foundin the state of nature. It represents the turn in philosophy away from trying totame or perfect desire by virtue, and toward finding out what one’s desire isand living according to it. This is largely accomplished by criticizing virtue,which covers and corrupts desire. Our desire becomes a kind of oracle weconsult; it is now the last word, while in the past it was the questionable anddangerous part of us. This unity of man in desire is fraught with theoreticaldifficulties, but it is, as we would say, existentially persuasive because,unlike the incomprehensible and self-contradictory union of body and soul, it isaffirmed by powerful experiences, such as fear of violent death, that do notrequire abstract reasonings or exhortations.Hobbes blazed the trail to the self, which has grown into the highway of aubiquitous psychology without the psyche (soul). But he, like Locke, did notdevelop the psychology of the self in its fullness, just as neither went verydeeply into the state of nature, because the solution seemed to be on thesurface. Once the old virtues were refuted—the piety of the religious or thehonor of the nobles—Hobbes and Locke assumed that most men would immediatelyagree that their self-preservative desires are real, that they come from withinand take primacy over any other desire. The true self is not only good forindividuals but provides a basis for consensus not provided by religions orphilosophies. Locke’s substitute for the virtuous man, the rational andindustrious one, is the perfect expression of this solution. It is not an ethicor a morality of a Protestant or any other kind of believer, but a frankadmission of enlightened selfishness (selfishness that has learned from modernphilosophy which goals are real and which imaginary), or self-interest rightlyunderstood. Locke develops the opposite, the idle and the quarrelsome man—who,we see, may be the priest or the noble (i.e., pretenders to a highermorality)—to debunk virtue in a less provocative way than Hobbes did. Locke’s,rational and industrious man partakes, as a prototype, of the charm of thesincere man who acts as he thinks and, without fraudulent pieties, seeks his owngood. Beneath his selfishness, of course, lies an expectation that it conducesmore to the good of others than does moralism. The taste of the sincereexpresses itself more in blame of Tartufferie than in praise of virtue.Terror in the face of death, an immediate and overwhelming subjective experienceof the self and what counts most for it, and the imperative following from thisexperience that death must be avoided, were confirmed by the new naturalphilosophy which sees in nature only bodies in motion, bodies blindly conservingtheir motion by the necessity of inertia. All higher purposiveness in nature,which might have been consulted by men’s reason and used to limit human passion,has disappeared. Nature tells us nothing about man specifically and provides noimperatives for his conduct. But man can be seen to behave as all other bodiesbehave, and the imaginary constraints on his following his powerfulinclinations—constraints which would cause him to behave differently fromnatural bodies—vanish. Irrational passion and rational science cooperate in anew way to establish natural law: Pursue peace. Man’s passionate subjectivitygives assent to the premises of natural philosophy—nay, takes them as itsprinciples of action—and philosophy finds that that assent accords with nature.Man remains somehow a part of nature, but in a different and much moreproblematic way than in, say, Aristotle’s philosophy, where soul is at thecenter and what is highest in man is akin to what is highest in nature, or wheresoul is nature. Man is really only a part and not the microcosm. Nature has norank order or hierarchy of being, nor does the self.Lockean natural man, who is really identical to his civil man, whose concernwith comfortable self-preservation makes him law-abiding and productive, is notall that natural. Rousseau quickly pointed out that Locke, in his eagerness tofind a simple or automatic solution to the political problem, made nature domuch more than he had a right to expect a mechanical, nonteleological nature todo. Natural man would be brutish, hardly distinguishable from any of the otheranimals, unsociable and neither industrious nor rational, but, instead, idle andnonrational, motivated exclusively by feelings or sentiments. Having cut off thehigher aspirations of man, those connected with the soul, Hobbes and Locke hopedto find a floor beneath him, which Rousseau removed. Man tumbled down into whatI have called the basement, which now appears bottomless. And there, down below,Rousseau discovered all the complexity in man that, in the days beforeMachiavelli, was up on high. Locke had illegitimately selected those parts ofman he needed for his social contract and suppressed all the rest, atheoretically unsatisfactory procedure and a practically costly one. Thebourgeois is the measure of the price paid, he who most of all cannot afford tolook to his real self, who denies the existence of the thinly boarded-overbasement in him, who is most made over for the purposes of a society that doesnot even promise him perfection or salvation but merely buys him off. Rousseauexplodes the simplistic harmoniousness between nature and society that seems tobe the American premise.Rousseau still hoped for a soft landing on nature’s true grounds, but one noteasily achieved, requiring both study and effort. The existence of such anatural ground has become doubtful, and it is here that the abyss opened up. Butit was Rousseau who founded the modern psychology of the self in its fullness,with its unending search for what is really underneath the surface ofrationality and civility, its new ways of reaching the unconscious, and itsunending task of constituting some kind of healthy harmony between above andbelow.Rousseau’s intransigence set the stage for a separation of man from nature. Hewas perfectly willing to go along with the modern scientific understanding thata brutish being is true man. But nature cannot satisfactorily account for hisdifference from the other brutes, for his movement from nature to society, forhis history. Descartes, playing his part in the dismantling of the soul, hadreduced nature to extension, leaving out of it only the ego that observesextension. Man is, in everything but his consciousness, part of extension. Yethow he is a man, a unity, what came to be called a self, is utterly mysterious.This experienced whole, a combination of extension and ego, seems inexplicableor groundless. Body, or atoms in motion, passions, and reason are some kind ofunity, but one that stands outside of the grasp of natural science. Lockeappears to have invented the self to provide unity in continuity for theceaseless temporal succession of sense impressions that would disappear intonothingness if there were no place to hold them. We can know everything innature except that which knows nature. To the extent that man is a piece ofnature, he disappears. The self gradually separates itself from nature, and itsphenomena must be treated separately. Descartes’ ego, in appearance invulnerableand godlike in its calm and isolation, turns out to be the tip of an icebergfloating in a fathomless and turbulent sea called the id, consciousness anepiphenomenon of the unconscious. Man is self, that now seems clear. But what isself?Our gaily embraced psychology leaves us with this question. It is important forus to know the unbearably complicated story behind it if we are to abandonourselves to it. One thing is certain: if this psychology is to be believed, itcame to us belatedly, in order to treat the parts of man which had been so longneglected in our liberal society, and it opens up a Pandora’s box, ourselves.Like Iago it tells us, “I never found a man who knew how to love himself.”Modern psychology has this in common with what was always a popular opinion,fathered by Machiavelli—that selfishness is somehow good. Man is self, and theself must be selfish. What is new is that we are told to look more deeply intothe self, that we assumed too easily that we know it and have access to it.The ambiguity of human life always requires that there be distinctions betweengood and bad, in one form or another. The great change is that a good man usedto be the one who cares for others, as opposed to the man who cares exclusivelyfor himself. Now the good man is the one who knows how to care for himself, asopposed to the man who does not. This is most obvious in the political realm.For Aristotle, good regimes have rulers dedicated to the common good, while badones have rulers who use their positions to further their private interest. ForLocke and Montesquieu there is no such distinction. A good regime has the properinstitutional structures for satisfying while containing the selfish men whomake it up, while a bad one does not succeed in doing this. Selfishness ispresupposed; men are not assumed to be as they ought to be, but as they are.Psychology has distinctions only between good and bad forms of selfishness, likeRousseau’s deliciously candid distinction between amour de soi and amour-propre,untranslatable into English because we would have to use self-love for bothterms.For us the most revealing and delightful distinction—because it is sounconscious of its wickedness—is between inner-directed and other-directed, withthe former taken to be unqualifiedly good. Of course, we are told, the healthyinner-directed person will really care for others. To which I can only respond:If you can believe that, you can believe anything. Rousseau knew much better.The psychology of the self has succeeded so well that it is now the instinct ofmost of us to turn for a cure for our ills back within ourselves rather than tothe nature of things. Socrates too thought that living according to the opinionsof others was an illness. But he did not urge men to look for a source forproducing their own unique opinions, or criticize them for being conformists.His measure of health was not sincerity, authenticity or any of the othernecessarily vague criteria for distinguishing a healthy self. The truth is theone thing most needful; and conforming to nature is quite different fromconforming to law, convention or opinion. Socrates spent his life discussingwith other men and with himself opinions about what virtue is, what justice is,what piety is, rejecting those opinions that cannot be supported or areself-contradictory, investigating further those that seem stronger. Access tothe nature of things is by way of thinking about what men say about them.Socrates was always among the Athenians but was not quite one of them,apparently never made uncomfortable by the fact that they did not trust him. Hewas neither solitary nor citizen. Rousseau, a figure of similar stature in thenew tradition, was distressed by the hatred of mankind, and was both, at leastin speech, the perfect citizen and the complete solitary. He was torn betweenthe extremes, and there was no middle ground. Although a very great reasoner,his preferred means of learning about himself were the reverie, the dream, theold memory, a stream of associations unhampered by rational control. In order toknow such an amorphous being as man, Rousseau himself and his particular historyare, in his view, more important than is Socrates’ quest for man in general orman in himself. The difference is made apparent by comparing the image ofSocrates talking to two young men about the best regime, with the image ofRousseau, lying on his back on a raft floating on a gently undulating lake,sensing his existence."},{"pageContent":"CREATIVITYThe very expression dignity of man, even when Pico della Mirandola coined it inthe fifteenth century, had a blasphemous ring to it. Man as man had not beenunderstood to be particularly dignified. God had dignity, and whatever dignityman had was because he was made in God’s image (as well as from dust) or becausehe was the rational animal whose reason could grasp the whole of nature andhence was akin to that whole. But now the dignity of man has neither of thosesupports; and the phrase means that man is the highest of the beings, anassertion emphatically denied by both Aristotle and the Bible. Man is elevatedand alone. If this is to be plausible, man must be free—not in the sense ofancient philosophy, according to which a free man is one who participates in aregime where he rules as well as is ruled; nor in the sense of Hobbes and Locke,according to whom a free man is one who can follow his reason without having toobey God or man—but free in a much grander sense, that of legislating to himselfand to nature, hence without guidance from nature.The complement to and explanation of this view of freedom is creativity. We havebecome so accustomed to this word that it has no more effect on us than the mostbanal Fourth of July oratory. As a matter of fact, it has become our Fourth ofJuly oratory. But when it was first used for man, it had the odor of blasphemyand paradox. God alone had been called a creator; and this was the miracle ofmiracles, beyond causality, a denial of the premise of all reason, ex nihilonihil fit. What defines man is no longer his reason, which is but a tool for hispreservation, but his art, for in art man can be said to be creative. There hebrings order to chaos. The greatest men are not the knowers but the artists, theHomers, Dantes, Raphaels and Beethovens. Art is not imitation of nature butliberation from nature. A man who can generate visions of a cosmos and ideals bywhich to live is a genius, a mysterious, demonic being. Such a man’s greatestwork of art is himself. He who can take his person, a chaos of impressions anddesires, a thing whose very unity is doubtful, and give it order and unity, is apersonality. All of this results from the free activity of his spirit and hiswill. He contains in himself the elements of the legislator and the prophet, andhas a deeper grasp of the true character of things than the contemplatives,philosophers, and scientists, who take the given order as permanent and fail tounderstand man. Such is the restoration of the ancient greatness of man againstscientific egalitarianism, but how different he now looks! All this new languageis a measure of the difference; and reflection on how the Greeks would translateand articulate the phenomena it describes is the task of a lifetime, which wouldpay rich rewards in self-understanding.The vocabulary of self, culture, and creativity pretty much sums up the effectsof what Rousseau began. It expresses the dissatisfactions with the scientificand political solutions of the Enlightenment. It turns around the understandingof what nature is. Somehow nature was always that by which men orientedthemselves. However, no influential thinker has tried to return to thepre-Enlightenment understanding of nature, the so-called teleolgical view, inwhich nature is the fullness in its own kind that each of the beings strives toattain. The reaction to nature viewed as matter in motion, which can beconquered for the sake of man’s needs, was twofold: a return to the notion thatnature is good, but only the brute nature of the fields, forests, mountains andstreams in which beasts live contentedly; or a transcendence of naturealtogether in the direction of creativity. The latter solution conquered theContinent, and came from Germany to England by way of men like Coleridge andCarlyle. Very few thinkers were consistent or took seriously the full meaning ofthis revolution in thought. Hegel is the greatest exception. But everyone wasaffected by it, and its influence ran across the entire political spectrum, fromRight to Left. Marxism as well as conservatism as we know them are unthinkablewithout what Rousseau did.A small but illuminating example of the pervasiveness of anti-Enlightenmentthought today is how scientists themselves have taken to styling themselves as“creative.” But nothing could be more contrary to the spirit of science than theopinion that the scientist fabricates rather than discovers his results.Scientists are to a man against creationism, recognizing rightly that, if thereis anything to it, their science is wrong and useless. But they fail to see thatcreativity has exactly the same consequences. Either nature has a lawful orderor it does not; either there can be miracles or there cannot. Scientists do notprove that there are no miracles, they assume it; without this assumption thereis no science. It is easy today to deny God’s creativity as a thing of thebenighted past, overcome by science, but man’s creativity, a thing much moreimprobable and nothing but an imitation of God’s, exercises a strangeattraction. In honoring it, the scientists’ opinions are not the results ofscience or of any serious reflection on science. They are merely conforming todemocratic public opinion, which has, unawares, been captured by Romanticnotions adapted to flatter it (every man a creator). The artist, not thescientist, has become the admired human type; and science senses that it mustassimilate itself to that type in order to retain its respectability intact.When every man was understood to be essentially a reasoner, the scientist couldbe understood to be a perfection of what all men wanted to be. That wasEnlightenment’s way of establishing the centrality of science and making itadmired. This change in self-description shows how the Zeitgeist has altered andhow science, instead of standing outside of it and liberating men from it, hasbeen incorporated into it. The theoretical life has lost its status. Now thescientist scrambles to recover his position as the perfection of what all menwant to be; but what all men want to be has changed, undermining the naturalharmony between science and society.Some may consider this labeling trivial, akin to C. P. Snow’s calling science a“culture.” Science may appear creative only because we forget what creativityreally means and take it to be cleverness at proposing hypotheses, findingproofs or inventing experiments. From this perspective, science is unaffected,and we have just another example of the pollution of language. But this form ofpollution, although less feared than the other kind, is really more deadly. Itis the intellectual disorder of our age. The use of insignificant speech entailsloss of clarity about what science and art are, weakening both in an impossiblesynthesis of opposites appealing to a society that wants to be told that itenjoys all good things. There is here a sinister loss of confidence in the ideaof science, if not its detailed practice, the idea which was at the foundationof democratic society and the absolute in a relativized world. These scientistsknow not what they do. Philosophy, despised and rejected by positive science,has its revenge when it is vulgarized into coarse public opinion and intimidatesthat science.So the effects of Rousseau and his followers are everywhere around us, in thebloodstream of public opinion. Of course the use of words like “creativity” and“personality” does not mean that those who use them understand the thought thatmade their use necessary, let alone agree with it. The language has beentrivialized. Words that were meant to describe and encourage Beethoven andGoethe are now applied to every schoolchild. It is in the nature of democracy todeny no one access to good things. If those things are really not accessible toall, then the tendency is to deny the fact—simply to proclaim, for example, thatwhat is not art is art. There is in American society a mad rush to distinguishoneself, and, as soon as something has been accepted as distinguishing, topackage it in such a way that everyone can feel included. Creativity andpersonality were intended to be terms of distinction. They were, as a matter offact, intended to be the distinctions appropriate to egalitarian society, inwhich all distinction is threatened. The leveling of these distinctions throughfamiliarity merely encourages self-satisfaction. Now that they belong toeveryone, they can be said to mean nothing, both in common parlance and in thesocial science disciplines that use them as “concepts.” They have no specificcontent, are a kind of opiate of the masses. They do, however, provide a focusfor all the dissatisfactions that any life anywhere and at any time provides,particularly those fostered in a democratic society. Creativity and personalitytake the place of older words like virtue, industry, rationality and character,affect our judgments, provide us with educational goals. They are the bourgeois’way of not being bourgeois. Hence they are sources of snobbishness andpretentiousness alien to our real virtues. We have a lot of good engineers butvery few good artists. All the honor, however, goes to the latter, or rather,one should say, those who stand in for the latter in the eyes of the many. Thereal artists don’t need this kind of support and are instead weakened by it. Themoneymaker is not the most appetizing personality, but he is far preferable tothe intellectual phony.Thus what was intended as an elevation of taste and morality has merely becomegrist for our mill while sapping the mill’s foundation. This was not the onlyresult in Europe, where creativity had at times an inspiring effect and wherethe notion had more to feed off of. Even there, as we shall soon see, thebalance sheet is arguably negative. But here I can see no benefits. And now themother-word itself—culture—has also become part of empty talk, its originalimprecision now carried to the point of pathology. Anthropologists can’t defineit although they are sure there is such a thing. Artists have no vision of thesublime, but they know culture (i.e., what they do) has a right to the honor andsupport of civil society. Sociologists and the disseminators of their views, thejournalists of all descriptions, call everything a culture—the drug culture, therock culture, the street-gang culture, and so on endlessly and withoutdiscrimination. Failure of culture is now culture. This is how the heroicresponse to the French Revolution fared when it immigrated to America. Ourcountry is still a melting pot."},{"pageContent":"CULTUREThe interesting response to the nature-society tension, much more fertile thanthe return to, or nostalgia for, nature, can be summed up by the word “culture.”It seems to mean something high, profound, respectable—a thing before which webow. It joins nature as a standard for the judgment of men and their deeds buthas even greater dignity. It is almost never used pejoratively, as are“society,” “state,” “nation” or even “civilization,” terms for which culture isgradually substituted, or whose legitimacy is underwritten by culture. Cultureis the unity of man’s brutish nature and all the arts and sciences he acquiredin his movement from the state of nature to civil society. Culture restores thelost wholeness of first man on a higher level, where his faculties can be fullydeveloped without contradiction between the desires of nature and the moralimperatives of his social life.“Culture” in the modern sense was first used by Immanuel Kant, who was thinkingof Rousseau when he employed it, particularly about what Rousseau said of thebourgeois. The bourgeois is selfish, but without the purity and simplicity ofnatural selfishness. He makes contracts hoping to get the better of those withwhom he contracts. His faithfulness to others and his obedience to law arefounded on expectation of gain: “Honesty is the best policy.” Thus he corruptsmorality, the essence of which is to exist for its own sake. The bourgeoissatisfies neither extreme, nature or morality. The moral demand is merely anabstract ideal if it asks for what nature cannot give. Brutish selfishness wouldbe preferable to sham morality.The progress of culture provides the link between inclination and duty. Kantuses the education of sexual desire as an example. Naturally man has the desireto have sexual intercourse and hence to procreate. But he has no desire to carefor his children or educate them, even though the growth of their facultiesrequires prolonged maintenance and training. So the family is necessary. Butnatural desire does not point to the family. Desire is promiscuous and inclinesman toward freedom. So desire is repressed. Man is commanded to abandon hisdesire. He is punished for it. Myths are created that haunt him, make him feelguilty and persuade him that he is sinful because of his natural desires.Marriage constrains both parties, and faithless deeds as well as desireshabitually accompany it. In spite of all of society’s machinery, untamed desireis always there. It is natural. It can be pushed down, but never completely, andit always has its revenge in one way or another.A man in this condition can never be happy. But a man who is deeply in love witha woman both desires and, for the moment at least, really cares for another. Ifthis latter condition can be made permanent, desire and morality practicallycoincide. The free choice of marriage and the capacity to stick to it, notmerely outwardly but also inwardly, is a proof of culture, of desire informed bycivility. It is also the proof of human freedom, of the overcoming of nature forthe sake of morality, without making man unhappy. The exclusive preference forone person whose attraction is founded on ideas of beauty and virtue unknown tonatural man makes sex sublime or sublimates it. This is love, and love seeksexpression in poetry and music. Thus sublimated, sexual desire culminates inart. The children who are love’s products make reflection about educationnecessary. And the family, its rights and its duties, its legal basis and itsprotection, finally connect what was once an isolated individual, concerned onlywith himself, to politics. Love, family and politics, which previously dividedman and trapped him, can now be ordered in such a way as to fulfill and enhancenatural desire and can therefore be unambiguously affirmed by the will. He ishis own master again, but social or related to other men without being alienatedby them. He is neither promiscuous nor repressed, because his sexual passion isfully expressed and satisfied. Both the world of nature and that of society arefulfilled. His intellectual acquisitions are not just extrinsic adornments butharmoniously serve and enrich his life. Such is the ideal of culture so far assexual matters are concerned. Something of the kind must occur in all theaspects of man’s life in order to produce a personality, the fully culturedhuman being.This Rousseauan-Kantian vision is in essential agreement with the Enlightenmentview of what is natural in man. But for the first time within philosophy,something other and higher than nature is found in man.It should be noted that sex is a theme hardly mentioned in the thoughtunderlying the American Founding. There it is all preservation, not procreation,because fear is more powerful than love, and men prefer their lives to theirpleasures. This subordination or taming of the sexual and everything connectedwith it made it easier for society to satisfy nature’s most powerful demands.The rehabilitation of sex made society’s task more difficult and placeddifferent demands on it. The primacy given to the sexual instinct in latermodern thought as opposed to the preservative instinct among the early modernsaccounts for much of the drama of our intellectual life, and for the varyingexpectations from social life. We are back to our economist and psychiatrist.But what is the relation between Kant’s use of the word culture and ours? Itseems there are two different current uses that, while distinct, are linked.First, culture is almost identical to people or nation, as in French culture,German culture, Iranian culture, etc. Second, culture refers to art, music,literature, educational television, certain kinds of movies—in short, everythingthat is uplifting and edifying, as opposed to commerce. The link is that cultureis what makes possible, on a high level, the rich social life that constitutes apeople, their customs, styles, tastes, festivals, rituals, gods—all that bindsindividuals into a group with roots, a community in which they think and willgenerally, with the people a moral unity, and the individual united withinhimself. A culture is a work of art, of which the fine arts are the sublimeexpression. From this point of view, liberal democracies look like disorderlymarkets to which individuals bring their produce in the morning and from whichthey return in the evening to enjoy privately what they have purchased with theproceeds of their sales. In culture, on the other hand, the individuals areformed by the collectivity as are the members of the chorus of a Greek drama. ACharles de Gaulle or, for that matter, an Alexander Solzhenitsyn sees the UnitedStates as a mere aggregate of individuals, a dumping ground for the refuse fromother places, devoted to consuming; in short, no culture.Culture as art is the peak expression of man’s creativity, his capacity to breakout of nature’s narrow bonds, and hence out of the degrading interpretation ofman in modern natural and political science. Culture founds the dignity of man.Culture as a form of community is the fabric of relations in which the selffinds its diverse and elaborate expression. It is the house of the self, butalso its product. It is profounder than the modern state, which deals only withman’s bodily needs and tends to degenerate into mere economy. Such a state isnot a forum in which man can act without deforming himself. This is why in thebetter circles it always seems in poor taste to speak of love of country, whiledevotion to Western, or even American, culture is perfectly respectable. Culturerestores “the unity in art and life” of the ancient polis.The only element of the polis absent from culture is politics. For the ancientsthe soul of the city was the regime, the arrangements of and participation inoffices, deliberation about the just and the common good, choices about war andpeace, the making of laws. Rational choice on the part of citizens who werestatesmen was understood to be the center of communal life and the cause ofeverything else. The polis was defined by its regime. Nothing of the kind is tobe found in culture, and just what defines a culture is extremely difficult todiscern. Today we are interested in Greek culture, not Athenian politics.Thucydides’ version of Pericles’ Funeral Oration is taken to be an archetypicalexpression of that culture, a splendid evocation—in the context of a religiousceremony—of Athenian love of beauty and wisdom. This interpretation makes somesense; but it is nonetheless a misreading; it is supposed to enrich us but itonly confirms us in our prejudices, typical of our utter dependence on Germaninterpretations of Greek things. Actually Pericles says nothing about the gods,or the poetry, history, sculpture or philosophy of which we think. He praisesAthens’ regime and finds beauty in its political achievement—its regime, andparticularly its tyrannically held empire. The Athenians are the politicalheroes who surpass those in Homer, and the arts are implicitly understood to beimitations and adornments of that heroism. But we find what we look for, and donot see any of this. A Pericles thus interpreted would be too superficial forus.The disappearance of politics is one of the most salient aspects of modernthought and has much to do with our political practice. Politics tends todisappear either into the subpolitical (economics) or what claims to be higherthan politics (culture)—both of which escape the architectonic art, thestatesman’s prudence. Politics in the older sense encompassed and held togetherthese two extremes. This opposition between economy and culture is but anotherformulation of the dualism in contemporary American intellectual life that keepsrecurring in these pages and is their unifying theme.The source can be found in one of the most remarkable passages in Rousseau’sworks, which marks the break with early modern statecraft and was decisive inthe development of the idea of culture. It is his chapter on the Legislator inThe Social Contract (II, 7). Rousseau directed men’s attention back to theancient polis as a corrective to the Enlightenment political teaching. Unlikemany of those who came after him, he was hardheadedly political and sawstatesmen’s deeds as central to the life of a people. And it is precisely thevery conditions for the existence of a people that Rousseau accuses hisimmediate predecessors of having misunderstood or ignored. Individualself-interest is not sufficient to establish a common good, he insists, butwithout it, political life is impossible, and men will be morally contemptible.The founder of a regime must first make a people to which the regime willbelong. A people will not automatically result from individual men’senlightenment about their self-interest. A political deed is necessary. Thelegislator must so to speak change human nature, transform each individual, who by himself is aperfect and solitary whole, into a part of a greater whole from which thatindividual as it were gets his life and his being; weaken man’s constitution tostrengthen it; substitute a partial and moral existence for the physical andindependent existence which we have all received from nature. He must, in aword, take man’s own forces away from him in order to give him forces which areforeign to him and which he cannot use without the help of others. The more thenatural forces are dead and annihilated, the greater and more lasting theacquired ones, thus the founding is solider and more perfect; such that if eachcitizen is nothing, can do nothing, except by all the others, and the forceacquired by the whole is equal or superior to the sum of the natural forces ofall the individuals, one can say that the legislation is at the highest point ofperfection it can attain. Rousseau with characteristic and refreshing frankness underlines the corporatecharacter of the community and what is required to achieve it as over againstthe abstract individualism popularized by the Enlightenment. In elaborating thescheme Rousseau even puts in the popular festivals and all that. This complexnervous system constructed by the legislator is exactly what we call culture. Orrather, culture is the effect of the legislation without the legislator, withoutthe political intention.Rousseau’s theoretical frankness, or harshness, about legislation put offsucceeding generations of thinkers, who nonetheless wanted the results of thatharshness, i.e., community. Or, more likely, Robespierre’s practical harshnessand the failure of his attempt at legislation scared off moderate observers.Changing human nature seems a brutal, nasty, tyrannical thing to do. So,instead, it began to be denied that there is such a thing as human nature.Rather, man grows and grows into culture; cultures are, as is obvious from theword, growths. Man is a culture being, not a natural being. What man has fromnature is nothing compared to what he has acquired from culture. A culture, likethe language that accompanies and expresses it, is a set of mere accidents thatadd up to a coherent meaning constitutive of man. Nature is gradually banishedfrom the study of man; and the state of nature is understood to have been amyth, even though the notion of culture is inconceivable without the priorelaboration of the state of nature. The primacy of the acquired over the naturalin man’s humanity is the ground of the idea of culture; and that idea is boundup with the idea of history, understood not as the investigation into man’sdeeds but as a dimension of reality, of man’s being. The very fact of movementfrom the state of nature to the civil state shows that there is history and thatit is more important than nature. In Rousseau the tension between nature and thepolitical order is maintained, and the legislator has to force the two into akind of harmony. History is a union of the two in which each disappears.Now, Rousseau, for all the adaptations made by the legislator, in order for hislegislation to suit particular times and places, was still pursuing the sameuniversal goal as were the thinkers of the Enlightenment: to secure the equalnatural rights of all men within civil society. He simply argued that Hobbes andLocke did not succeed in doing so, that self-interest is not enough to foundpolitical morality on. The political solution was more complicated anddemanding. Kant, who invented culture as part of a historical teaching, also hada similar universal goal. Although natural rights had become human rights in histeaching, those rights were the same ones, founded on a new basis; and thehistorical process he discerned in Rousseau’s teaching moved toward theeffective establishment of those rights in civil society. Universality andrationality were the hallmarks of all these teachings. But very quicklyculture—which was for Kant and, speaking anachronistically, for Rousseau,singular—became cultures. That there were Englishmen, Frenchmen, Germans andChinese was clear. That there is a cosmopolitan culture, either existing orcoming into being, is unclear. The various unions of nature with theacquisitions of civilization are rare and difficult enough; that they shouldtend to the same end is improbable; we should cherish these creations and behappy that there is any culture at all. A charm was discovered in thisdiversity. Rousseau introduced rootedness as a condition of attaining the simplerational human goal. His historicist and romantic successors argued that such agoal undermined rootedness; rootedness became the goal.Here again we live with two contradictory understandings of what counts for man.One tells us that what is important is what all men have in common; the otherthat what men have in common is low, while what they have from separate culturesgives them their depth and their interest. Both agree that life, liberty, andthe pursuit of property, i.e., the interests of health and preservation, arewhat men share. The difference between them is the weight they give to beingFrench or Chinese, Jewish or Catholic, or the rank order of these particularcultures in relation to the natural needs of the body. One is cosmopolitan, theother is particularistic. Human rights are connected with one school, respectfor cultures with the other. Sometimes the United States is attacked for failingto promote human rights; sometimes for wanting to impose “the American way oflife” on all people without respect for their cultures. To the extent that itdoes the latter, the United States does so in the name of self-evident truthsthat apply to the good of all men. But its critics argue that there are no suchtruths, that they are prejudices of American culture. On the other hand, theAyatollah was initially supported by some here because he represented trueIranian culture. Now he is attacked for violating human rights. What he does isin the name of Islam. His critics insist that there are universal principlesthat limit the rights of Islam. When the critics of the U.S. in the name ofculture, and of the Ayatollah in the name of human rights, are the same persons,which they often are, they are persons who want to eat their cake and have it,too.Why, it might be asked, can’t there be a respect for both human rights andculture? Simply because a culture itself generates its own way of life andprinciples, particularly its highest ones, with no authority above it. If therewere such an authority, the unique way of life born of its principle would beundermined. The idea of culture was adopted precisely because it offered analternative to what was understood to be the shallow and dehumanizinguniversality of rights based on our animal nature. The folk mind takes the placeof reason. There is a continuing war between the universality of theEnlightenment and the particularity that resulted from the teachings ofEnlightenment’s critics. Their criticism appealed to all the old attachments tofamily, country and God that were uprooted by Enlightenment, and gave them a newinterpretation and a new pathos. Such criticism provided a philosophic basis forresisting philosophy.The question is whether reasonings really take the place of instincts, whetherarguments about the value of tradition or roots can substitute for immediatepassions, whether this whole interpretation is not just a reaction unequal tothe task of stemming a tide of egalitarian, calculating individualism, which thecritics themselves share, and the privileges of which they would be loath torenounce. When one hears newly divorced persons extolling the extended family,unaware of all the sacred bonds and ancestral tyranny that it required in orderto exist, it is easy to see what they think is missing from their lives, buthard to believe they are aware of what they would have to sacrifice to achieveit. When one hears men and women proclaiming that they must preserve theirculture, one cannot help wondering whether this artificial notion can reallytake the place of the God and country for which they once would have beenwilling to die.The “new ethnicity” or “roots” is just another manifestation of the concern withparticularity, evidence not only of the real problems of community in modernmass societies but also of the superficiality of the response to it, as well asthe lack of awareness of the fundamental conflict between liberal society andculture. This attempt to preserve old cultures in the New World is superficialbecause it ignores the fact that real differences among men are based on realdifferences in fundamental beliefs about good and evil, about what is highest,about God. Differences of dress or food are either of no interest or aresecondary expressions of deeper beliefs. The “ethnic” differences we see in theUnited States are but decaying reminiscences of old differences that caused ourancestors to kill one another. The animating principle, their soul, hasdisappeared from them. The ethnic festivals are just superficial displays ofclothes, dances and foods from the old country. One has to be quite ignorant ofthe splendid “cultural” past in order to be impressed or charmed by theseinsipid folkloric manifestations (which, by the way, unite the meanings ofculture—people and art). And the blessing given the whole notion of culturaldiversity in the United States by the culture movement has contributed to theintensification and legitimization of group politics, along with a correspondingdecay of belief that the individual rights enunciated in the Declaration ofIndependence are anything more than dated rhetoric.The idea of culture was established in an attempt to find the dignity of manwithin the context of modern science. That science was materialistic, hencereductionist, and deterministic. Man can have no dignity if his status is notspecial, if he is not essentially different from the brutes. There must besomething else in man to account for the fullness of his being and preventpolitical and economic arrangements that presuppose his brutishness fromreducing him to it. Those who attempted to establish the dignity of man did nothope or try to transform the new natural science. It was a question ofcoexistence. They invented dualisms with which we still live—nature-freedom,nature-art, science-creativity, natural science-humanities—in which the latterterm of the pair is supposed to be of higher dignity, but the groundedness ofwhich has always turned out to be problematic. Freedom is a postulate, apossibility in Kant, not a demonstration; and that remains the difficulty.Culture, although it claims to be comprehensive, to include all of man’s higheractivities, does not really include natural science, which did not need thenotion, which was doing just fine in the older democratic arrangement it hadhelped to found, and by which it was encouraged. Psychology today includes animportant school for which man is nothing other than a brute, e.g., B. F.Skinner’s behavioralism; another in which the fact that man is an animalpractically disappears, e.g., Jacques Lacan’s existential analysis; and variousincoherent mixtures, e.g., Freud’s psychoanalytic theory, which wants to founditself on biology and at the same time to account for spiritual phenomena, tothe detriment of both. In general, everyone wants to be scientific and at thesame time to respect the dignity of man."},{"pageContent":"VALUESWe have come back to the point where we began, where values take the place ofgood and evil. But now we have made at least a hasty tour of the intellectualexperiences connected with modern politics that made such a response compelling.How it looked to thoughtful Germans is most revealingly expressed in a famouspassage by Max Weber, about God, science and the irrational: Finally, although a naive optimism may have celebrated science—that is, thetechnique of the mastery of life founded on science—as the path which would leadto happiness, I believe I can leave this entire question aside in light of theannihilating critique which Nietzsche has made of “the last men” who “havediscovered happiness.” Who, then, still believes in this, with the exception ofa few big babies in university chairs or in editorial offices? (Science as aVocation) So penetrating and well informed an observer as Weber could say in 1919 that thescientific spirit at the heart of Western democracy was dead for all serious menand that Nietzsche had killed it, or had at least given it the coup de grâce.The presentation of “the last man” in Thus Spake Zarathustra was so decisivethat the old-style Enlightenment rationalism need not even be discussed anymore;and, Weber implies, all future discussion or study must proceed with thecertainty that the perspective was a “naive” failure. Reason cannot establishvalues, and its belief that it can is the stupidest and most perniciousillusion.This means, simply, that almost all Americans at that time, thinking Americansin particular, were “big babies” and remained so, long after the Continent hadgrown up. One need only think of John Dewey to recognize that he fits Weber’sdescription to a T, and then remember what his influence here once was. And notonly Dewey, but everyone from the beginning of our regime, especially those whosaid, “We hold these truths to be self-evident,” shared the rationalist dream.Weber’s statement is so important because he as much as or more than anyonebrought us into contact with the most advanced Continental criticisms of liberaldemocracy, and was the intermediary between Nietzsche and us Americans who werethe most recalcitrant to his insight, perhaps because according to it werepresent the worst or most hopeless and are therefore loath to see ourselves inthat mirror. A very dark view of the future has been superimposed on ourincorrigible optimism. We are children playing with adult toys. They have provedtoo much for us to handle. But, in our defense, we are probably not the onlyones for whom they are too much.Weber points us toward Nietzsche as the common source for serious thinkers ofthe twentieth century. He also tells us what the single fundamental issue is:the relation between reason, or science, and the human good. When he speaks ofhappiness and the last man, he does not mean that the last man is unhappy, butthat his happiness is nauseating. An experience of profound contempt isnecessary in order to grasp our situation, and our capacity for contempt isvanishing. Weber’s science presupposes this experience, which we would callsubjective. After having encountered it in Nietzsche, he spent the greater partof his scholarly life studying religion in order to understand thenoncontemptible, those who esteem or revere and are therefore notself-satisfied, those who have values or, to say the same thing, have gods, inparticular those who create gods or found religions. From Nietzsche he learnedthat religion, or the sacred, is the most important human phenomenon, and hisfurther study of it was made from Nietzsche’s unorthodox perspective.“God is dead,” Nietzsche proclaimed. But he did not say this on a note oftriumph, in the style of earlier atheism—the tyrant has been overthrown and manis now free. Rather he said it in the anguished tones of the most powerful anddelicate piety deprived of its proper object. Man, who loved and needed God, haslost his Father and Savior without possibility of resurrection. The joy ofliberation one finds in Marx has turned into terror at man’s unprotectedness.Honesty compels serious men, on examination of their consciences, to admit thatthe old faith is no longer compelling. It is the very peak of Christian virtuethat demands the sacrifice of Christianity, the greatest sacrifice a Christiancan make. Enlightenment killed God; but like Macbeth, the men of theEnlightenment did not know that the cosmos would rebel at the deed, and theworld become “a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifyingnothing.” Nietzsche replaces easygoing or self-satisfied atheism with agonizedatheism, suffering its human consequences. Longing to believe, along withintransigent refusal to satisfy that longing, is, according to him, the profoundresponse to our entire spiritual condition. Marx denied the existence of God butturned over all His functions to History, which is inevitably directed to a goalfulfilling of man and which takes the place of Providence. One might as well bea Christian if one is so naive. Prior to Nietzsche, all those who taught thatman is a historical being presented his history as in one way or anotherprogressive. After Nietzsche, a characteristic formula for describing ourhistory is “the decline of the West.”Nietzsche surveyed and summed up the contradictory strands of modern thought andconcluded that victorious rationalism is unable to rule in culture or soul, thatit cannot defend itself theoretically and that its human consequences areintolerable. This constitutes a crisis of the West, for everywhere in the West,for the first time ever, all regimes are founded on reason. Human founders,looking only to universal principles of natural justice recognizable by all menthrough their unaided reason, established governments on the basis of theconsent of the governed, without appeal to revelation or tradition. But reasonhas also discerned that all previous cultures were founded by and on gods orbelief in gods. Only if the new regimes are enormous successes, able to rivalthe creative genius and splendor of other cultures, could reason’s rationalfoundings be equal or superior to the kinds of foundings that reason knows weremade elsewhere. But such equality or superiority is highly questionable;therefore reason recognizes its own inadequacy. There must be religion, andreason cannot found religions.This was already implicit in the first wave of criticism of Enlightenment.Rousseau said a civil religion is necessary to society, and the legislator hasto appear draped in the colors of religion. Tocqueville concentrated on thecentrality of religion to America. With the failure of Robespierre’s kind ofcivil religion, there was a continuing effort to promote a revised or liberalChristianity, inspired by Rousseau’s Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar.The very idea of culture was a way of preserving something like religion withouttalking about it. Culture is a synthesis of reason and religion, attempting tohide the sharp distinction between the two poles.Nietzsche examines the patient, observes that the treatment was not successful,and pronounces God dead. Now there cannot be religion; but inasmuch as man needsculture, the religious impulse remains. No religion but religiosity. Thissuffuses Nietzsche’s analysis of modernity, and, unnoticed, it underlies thecontemporary categories of psychology and sociology. He brought the religiousquestion back to the center of philosophy. The critical standpoint from which toview modern culture is its essential atheism; and that more repulsive successorof the bourgeois, the last man, is the product of egalitarian, rationalist,socialist atheism.Thus the novel aspect of the crisis of the West is that it is identical with acrisis of philosophy. Reading Thucydides shows us that the decline of Greece waspurely political, that what we call intellectual history is of little importancefor understanding it. Old regimes had traditional roots; but philosophy andscience took over as rulers in modernity, and purely theoretical problems havedecisive political effects. One cannot imagine modern political history withouta discussion of Locke, Rousseau and Marx. Theoretical implausibility anddecrepitude are, as everyone knows, at the heart of the Soviet Union’s malaise.And the Free World is not far behind. Nietzsche is the profoundest, clearest,most powerful diagnostician of the disease. He argues that there is an innernecessity for us to abandon reason on rational grounds—that therefore our regimeis doomed.The disenchantment of God and nature necessitated a new description of good andevil. To adapt a formula of Plato about the gods, we do not love a thing becauseit is good, it is good because we love it. It is our decision to esteem thatmakes something estimable. Man is the esteeming being, the one capable ofreverence and self-contempt, “the beast with red cheeks.” Nietzsche claimed tohave seen that the objects of men’s reverence in no sense compel that reverence;frequently the objects do not even exist. Their qualities are projections ofwhat is most powerful in man and serve to satisfy his strongest needs ordesires. Good and evil are what make it possible for men to live and act. Thecharacter of their judgments of good and evil shows what they are.To put it simply, Nietzsche says that modern man is losing, or has lost, thecapacity to value, and therewith his humanity. Self-satisfaction, the desire tobe adjusted, the comfortable solution to his problems, the whole program of thewelfare state, are the signs of the incapacity to look up toward the heaven ofman’s possible perfection or self-overcoming. But the surest sign is the way weuse the word “value,” and in this Nietzsche not only diagnosed the disease butexacerbated it. He intended to point out to men the danger they are in, theawesome task they face of protecting and enhancing their humanity. As heunderstood it, men in our current decrepitude could take it easy if theybelieved God, nature or history provides values. Such belief was salutary aslong as the objectified creations of man were still noble and vital. But in thepresent exhaustion of the old values, men must be brought to the abyss,terrified by their danger and nauseated by what could become of them, in orderto make them aware of their responsibility for their fate. They must turn withinthemselves and reconstitute the conditions of their creativity in order togenerate values. The self must be a tense bow. It must struggle with oppositesrather than harmonize them, rather than turn the tension over to the greatinstruments of last manhood—the skilled bow unbenders and Jesuits of our days,the psychiatrists, who, in the same spirit and as part of the same conspiracy ofmodernity as the peace virtuosos, reduce conflict. Chaos, the war of opposites,is, as we know from the Bible, the condition of creativity, which must bemastered by the creator. The self must also bring forth arrows out of itslonging. Bow and arrow, both belonging to man, can shoot a star into the heavensto guide man. Stripping away the illusions about values was required, soNietzsche thought, by our situation, to disenchant all misleading hopes ofcomfort or consolation, thereby to fill the few creators with awe and theawareness that everything depends on them. Nihilism is a dangerous but anecessary and a possibly salutary stage in human history. In it man faces histrue situation. It can break him, reduce him to despair and spiritual or bodilysuicide. But it can hearten him to a reconstruction of a world of meaning.Nietzsche’s works are a glorious exhibition of the soul of a man who might, ifanybody can, be called creative. They constitute the profoundest statement aboutcreativity, by a man who had a burning need to understand it.Nietzsche was ineluctably led to meditation on the coming to be of God—onGod-creation—for God is the highest value, on which the others depend. God isnot creative, for God is not. But God as made by man reflects what man is,unbeknownst to himself. God is said to have made the world of concern to us outof nothing; so man makes something, God, out of nothing. The faith in God andthe belief in miracles are closer to the truth than any scientific explanation,which has to overlook or explain away the creative in man. Moses, overpowered bythe obscure drives within him, went to the peak of Sinai and brought back tablesof values; these values had a necessity, a substantiality more compelling thanhealth or wealth. They were the core of life. There are other possible tables ofvalues—one thousand and one, according to Zarathustra—but these were the onesthat made this people what it was and gave it a life-style, a unity of innerexperience and outer expression or form. There is no prescription for creatingthe myths that constitute a people, no standardized test that can predict theman who will create them or determine which myths will work or are appropriate.There is the matter and the maker, like stone and sculptor; but in this case thesculptor is not only the efficient cause but the formal and final cause as well.There is nothing that underlies the myth, no substance, no cause. No search forthe cause of values, either in the rational quest for knowledge of good and evilor in, for example, their economic determinants, can result in an accurateaccount of them. Only an openness to the psychological phenomena of creativitycan bring any clarity.This psychology cannot be like Freud’s, which, beginning from Nietzsche’sunderstanding of the unconscious, finds causes of creativity that blur thedifference between a Raphael and a finger painter. Everything is in thatdifference, which necessarily escapes our science. The unconscious is a greatmystery; it is the truth of God, and it—the id—is as unfathomable as was God.Freud accepted the unconscious, and then tried to give it perfect clarity bymeans of science. But the id produces science. It can produce many sciences.Freud’s procedure is like trying to determine God’s essence or nature from whathe created. God could have created an infinity of worlds. If he had been limitedto this one, he would not have been creative or free.Understanding all of this is necessary if one is to understand creativity. Theid is the source; it is elusive and unfathomable and produces worldinterpretations. Yet natural scientists, among whom Freud wished to be counted,do not take any of this seriously. Biologists cannot even account forconsciousness within their science, let alone the unconscious. So psychologistslike Freud are in an impossible halfway house between science, which does notadmit the existence of the phenomena he wishes to explain, and the unconscious,which is outside the jurisdiction of science. It is a choice, so Nietzschecompellingly insists, between science and psychology. Psychology is by that veryfact the winner, since science is the product of the psyche. Scientiststhemselves are gradually being affected by this choice. Perhaps science is onlya product of our culture, which we know is no better than any other. Is sciencetrue? One sees a bit of decay around the edges of its good conscience, formerlyso robust. Books like Thomas Kuhn’s The Structure of Scientific Revolutions arepopular symptoms of this condition.This is where what I called the bottomless or fathomless self, the last versionof the self, makes its appearance. Id, Nietzsche named it. The id mocks the egowhen a man says, “It occurred to me.” The sovereign consciousness waits onsomething down below, which sends up its food for thought. The differencebetween this version and the others is that they began from a common experience,more or less immediately accessible, that all men share, which establishes, ifonly intersubjectively, a common humanity that can be called human nature. Fearof violent death and desire for comfortable self-preservation were the firststop on the way down. Everybody knows them, and we can recognize one another inthem. The next stop was the sweet sentiment of existence, no longer immediatelyaccessible to civilized man but recoverable by him. When under its spell, we canwith certainty say to ourselves, “This is what I really am, what I live for,”with the further conviction that the same must be so for all other men. This,allied with a vague, generalized compassion, makes us a species and can give usguidance. At the next stop there turns out to be no stop, and the descent isbreathtaking. If one finds anything at all, it is strictly one’s own, whatNietzsche calls one’s fatum, a stubborn, strong ass that has nothing to say foritself other than that it is. One finds, at best, oneself; and it isincommunicable and isolates each from all others, rather than uniting them. Onlythe rarest individuals find their own stopping point from which they can movethe world. They are, literally, profound.Though the values, the horizons, the tables of good and evil that originate inthe self cannot be said to be true or false, cannot be derived from the commonfeeling of mankind or justified by the universal standards of reason, they arenot equal, contrary to what vulgar teachers of value theory believe. Nietzsche,and all those serious persons who in one way or another accepted his insight,held that inequality among men is proved by the fact that there is no commonexperience accessible in principle to all. Such distinctions asauthentic-inauthentic, profound-superficial, creator-created replace true andfalse. The individual value of one man becomes the polestar for many otherswhose own experience provides them with no guidance. The rarest of men is thecreator, and all other men need and follow him.Authentic values are those by which a life can be lived, which can form a peoplethat produces great deeds and thoughts. Moses, Jesus, Homer, Buddha: these arethe creators, the men who formed horizons, the founders of Jewish, Christian,Greek, Chinese, and Japanese culture. It is not the truth of their thought thatdistinguished them, but its capacity to generate culture. A value is only avalue if it is life-preserving and life-enhancing. The quasi-totality of men’svalues consists of more or less pale carbon copies of the originator’s values.Egalitarianism means conformism, because it gives power to the sterile who canonly make use of old values, other men’s ready-made values, which are not aliveand to which their promoters are not committed. Egalitarianism is founded onreason, which denies creativity. Everything in Nietzsche is an attack onrational egalitarianism, and shows what twaddle the habitual talk about valuesis these days—and how astonishing is Nietzsche’s respectability on the Left.Since values are not rational and not grounded in the natures of those subjectto them, they must be imposed. They must defeat opposing values. Rationalpersuasion cannot make them believed, so struggle is necessary. Producing valuesand believing in them are acts of the will. Lack of will, not lack ofunderstanding, becomes the crucial defect. Commitment is the moral virtuebecause it indicates the seriousness of the agent. Commitment is the equivalentof faith when the living God has been supplanted by self-provided values. It isPascal’s wager, no longer on God’s existence but on one’s capacity to believe inoneself and the goals one has set for oneself. Commitment values the values andmakes them valuable. Not love of truth but intellectual honesty characterizesthe proper state of mind. Since there is no truth in the values, and what truththere is about life is not lovable, the hallmark of the authentic self isconsulting one’s oracle while facing up to what one is and what one experiences.Decisions, not deliberations, are the movers of deeds. One cannot know or planthe future. One must will it. There is no program. The great revolutionary mustdestroy the past and open up the future for the free play of creativity.Politics are revolutionary; but unlike the Glorious Revolution, the AmericanRevolution, the French Revolution or the Russian Revolution, the new revolutionsshould be unprogrammatic. They are to be made by intellectually honest,committed, strong-willed, creative men. Nietzsche was not a fascist; but thisproject inspired fascist rhetoric, which looked to the revitalization of oldcultures or the foundation of new ones, as opposed to the rational, rootlesscosmopolitanism of the revolutions of the Left.Nietzsche was a cultural relativist, and he saw what that means—war, greatcruelty rather than great compassion. War is the fundamental phenomenon on whichpeace can sometimes be forced, but always in the most precarious way. Liberaldemocracies do not fight wars with one another because they see the same humannature and the same rights applicable everywhere and to everyone. Cultures fightwars with one another. They must do so because values can only be asserted orposited by overcoming others, not by reasoning with them. Cultures havedifferent perceptions, which determine what the world is. They cannot come toterms. There is no communication about the highest things. (Communication is thesubstitute for understanding when there is no common world men share, to whichthey can refer when they misunderstand one another. From the isolation of theclosed systems of self and culture, there are attempts to “get in contact,” and“failures of communication.” How individuals and cultures can “relate” to oneanother is altogether a mysterious business.) Culture means a war against chaosand a war against other cultures. The very idea of culture carries with it avalue: man needs culture and must do what is necessary to create and maintaincultures. There is no place for a theoretical man to stand. To live, to have anyinner substance, a man must have values, must be committed, or engagé. Thereforea cultural relativist must care for culture more than truth, and fight forculture while knowing it is not true.This is somehow impossible, and Nietzsche struggled with the problem throughouthis career, perhaps without a satisfactory resolution. But he knew that thescientific view is deadly to culture, and that the political or moral culturalrelativist of the ordinary sort is doomed to have no culture. Culturalrelativism, as opposed to relativism simply, teaches the need to believe whileundermining belief.Nietzsche appears to have taken over the idea of culture from his philosophicalpredecessors without much hesitation. Culture is, from his point of view, theonly framework within which to account for what is specifically human in man.Man is pure becoming, unlike any other being in nature; and it is in culturethat he becomes something that transcends nature and has no other mode ofexistence and no other support than a particular culture. The actuality ofplants and the other animals is contained in their potentialities; but this isnot true of man, as is indicated by the many cultural flowers, essentiallyunlike, produced from the same seed, man. Nietzsche’s contribution was to drawwith perfect intransigence the consequences of that idea and try to live withthem. If there are many cultures, unsolicited by one perfect or complete culturein which man is man, simply—without prefix such as Greek, Chinese, Christian,Buddhist (i.e., if Plato’s Republic, outlining the one best regime, is simply amyth, a work of Plato’s imagination), then the very word “man” is a paradox.There are as many kinds of man as there are cultures, without any perspectivefrom which man can be spoken of in the singular. This is true not only of hishabits, customs, rituals, fashions, but above all of his mind. There must be asmany different kinds of mind as there are cultures. If the mind itself is notincluded among the things that are relative to cultures, the observations ofcultural relativism are trivial and have always been accepted. Yet everyonelikes cultural relativism but wants to exempt what concerns him. The physicistwants to save his atoms; the historian, his events; the moralist, his values.But they are all equally relative. If there is an escape for one truth from theflux, then there is in principle no reason why many truths are not beyond it;and then the flux, becoming, change, history or what have you is not what isfundamental, but rather, being, the immutable principle of science andphilosophy.It is Nietzsche’s merit that he was aware that to philosophize is radicallyproblematic in the cultural, historicist dispensation. He recognized theterrible intellectual and moral risks involved. At the center of his everythought was the question “How is it possible to do what I am doing?” He tried toapply to his own thought the teachings of cultural relativism. This practicallynobody else does. For example, Freud says that men are motivated by desire forsex and power, but he did not apply those motives to explain his own science orhis own scientific activity. But if he can be a true scientist, i.e., motivatedby love of the truth, so can other men, and his description of their motives isthus mortally flawed. Or if he is motivated by sex or power, he is not ascientist, and his science is only one means among many possible to attain thoseends. This contradiction runs throughout the natural and social sciences. Theygive an account of things that cannot possibly explain the conduct of theirpractitioners. The highly ethical economist who speaks only about gain, thepublic-spirited political scientist who sees only group interest, the physicistwho signs petitions in favor of freedom while recognizing onlyunfreedom—mathematical law governing moved matter—in the universe aresymptomatic of the difficulty of providing a self-explanation for science and aground for the theoretical life, which has dogged the life of the mind sinceearly modernity but has become particularly acute with cultural relativism.Nietzsche, in response to this difficulty, self-consciously made dangerousexperiments with his own philosophy, treating its source as the will to powerinstead of the will to truth.Nietzsche’s new beginning in philosophy starts from the observation that ashared sense of the sacred is the surest way to recognize a culture, and the keyto understanding it and all of its facets. Hegel made this clear in hisphilosophy of history, and he had found the same awareness in Herodotus’ studiesof various peoples, Greek and barbarian. What a people bows before tells us whatit is. But Hegel made a mistake; he believed there could be a thoroughlyrational God, one who conciliated the demands of culture and those of science.Yet somehow he also saw that this was not so when he said that the owl ofMinerva flies at dusk, meaning that only when a culture is over can it beunderstood. Hegel’s moment of understanding of the West coincided with its end.The West had been demythologized and had lost its power to inspire and its viewof the future. Therefore, it is evident that its myths are what animates aculture, and the makers of myths are the makers of cultures and of man. They aresuperior to philosophers, who only study and analyze what the poets make. Hegeladmits that poetry has lost its prophetic power but consoles himself with thebelief that philosophy will suffice.The artists whom Nietzsche saw around him, those whose gifts were the greatest,attested to this loss. They were what he called decadents, not because theylacked talent or their art was not impressive, but because their works werelaments of artistic impotence, characterizations of an ugly world that the poetsbelieve they cannot influence. Immediately after the French Revolution there hadbeen a stupendous artistic effervescence, and poets thought they could again bethe legislators of mankind. The vocation provided for the artists in the newphilosophy of culture heartened them, and a new classic age was born. Idealismand romanticism appeared to have carved out a place for the sublime in the orderof things. But within a generation or two the mood had noticeably soured, andartists began to represent the romantic visions as a groundless hoax. Men likeBaudelaire and Flaubert turned away from the public and made the moralism andromantic enthusiasm of their immediate predecessors look foolish. Adulterieswithout love, sins without punishment or redemption became the more authenticthemes of art. The world had been disenchanted. Baudelaire presented sinning manas in the Christian vision, but without hope of God’s salvation, piercing piousfraudulence, hypocrite lecteur. And Flaubert drowned in a venomous hatred of thebourgeoisie, which had conquered. Culture was just fodder for its vanity. Thegreat dualisms had collapsed; and art, creativity and freedom had been swallowedup by determinism and petty self-interest. In his greatest creation, M. Homais,the pharmacist, Flaubert encapsulated everything that modernity was and is tobe. Homais represents the spirit of science, progress, liberalism,anticlericalism. He lives carefully with an eye to health. His educationcontains the best that has been thought and said. He knows everything that everhappened. He knows that Christianity helped to free the slaves, but that it hasoutlived its historical usefulness. History existed to produce him, the manwithout prejudices. He is at home with everything, and nothing is beyond hisgrasp. He is a journalist, disseminating knowledge for the enlightenment of themasses. Compassion is his moral theme. And all this is nothing but pettyamour-propre. Society exists to give him honor and self-esteem. Culture is his.There are no proper heroes to depict nor audiences to inspire. They are all oneway or another in business. Emma Bovary is Homais’ foil. She can only dream of aworld and men who do not and cannot exist. In this sober world she is nothingbut a fool. She, like the modern artist, is pure longing with no possible goal.Her only triumph and her only free act is suicide.Nietzsche finds these decadents, pessimists or protonihilists revelatory, as hedoes the fakers of great deeds and passions who are the reverse side of thecoin, in particular Wagner. He has contempt for the former, not because theylack honesty or because their characterization of the world around them isinaccurate, but because they know that once there were gods and heroes and thatthey were the products of poetic imagination—which means that poetic imaginationcan make them again—yet do not have the courage or the resolve themselves tocreate. Therefore they are hopeless. They alone can still long; but they aresecret believers in the Christian God or, at least, in the Christian worldviewand cannot believe in the really new. They are afraid to set sail on stormy,uncharted seas. Only Dostoyevski has a vitality of soul, proof againstdecadence. His unconscious, filtered through a Christian conscience, expressesitself in forbidden desires, crimes, acts of self-abasement, sentimentality andbrutality; but he is alive and struggling and proves the continuing health ofthe animal and all that is in ferment down under.The artist is the most interesting of all phenomena, for he representscreativity, the definition of man. His unconscious is full of monsters anddreams. It provides the pictures to consciousness, which takes them as given andas “world,” and rationalizes them. Rationality is only the activity of providinggood reasons for what has no reason or is unreasonable. We do what we do out ofa fate that is our individuality, but we have to explain and communicate. Thislatter is the function of consciousness; and when it has been provided with arich store by the unconscious, its activity is fruitful, and the illusion of itssufficiency is even salutary. But when it has chopped up and chewed over itsinheritance, as mathematical physics has now done, there are not enoughnourishing plants left whole. Consciousness now requires replenishment.Thus Nietzsche opened up the great terrain explored by modern artists,psychologists and anthropologists, searching for refreshment for our exhaustedculture in the depths of the darkest unconscious or darkest Africa. Not all thatNietzsche asserted is plausible, but its charm is undeniable. He went to the endof the road with Rousseau, and beyond. The side of modernity that is lessinteresting to Americans, which seeks less for political solutions than forunderstanding and satisfaction of man in his fullness or completeness, finds itsprofoundest statement in Nietzsche, who represents the culmination of thatsecond state of nature. Above all he was a friend of artists, who were the firstto recognize him when he was disreputable among academics; and among them hisinfluence was clearly most fertile. One need only think of Rilke, Yeats, Proustand Joyce. The greatest philosophic tribute to him is Heidegger’s bookNietzsche, the most important part of which is entitled “The Will to Power asArt.”Nietzsche restored something like the soul to our understanding of man byproviding a supplement to the flat, dry screen of consciousness, which with pureintellect looks at the rest of man as something alien, a bundle of affects ofmatter, like any other object of physics, chemistry and biology. The unconsciousreplaces all the irrational things—above all divine madness and eros—which werepart of the old soul and had lost significance in modernity. It provides a linkbetween consciousness and nature as a whole, restoring therewith the unity ofman. Nietzsche made psychology, as the most important study, possible again; andeverything of interest in psychology during the last century—not onlypsychoanalysis but also Gestalt, phenomenology, and existentialism—took placewithin the confines of the spiritual continent he discovered. But the differencebetween the self and the soul remains great because of the change in the statusof reason. The reconstitution of man in Nietzsche required the sacrifice ofreason, which Enlightenment, whatever its failings, kept at the center. For allthe charms of Nietzsche and all that he says to hearten a lover of the soul, heis further away from Plato in this crucial respect than was Descartes or Locke.Nietzsche’s psychology concerns the impulse toward God, for in that impulse theself arrays and displays all its powers; and his influence brought a new burstof religious interest, if not religion, to the intellectual world. God is myth,Nietzsche taught. Myths are made by poets. This is just what Plato says in theRepublic, and for him it is equivalent to a declaration of war betweenphilosophy and poetry. The aim of philosophy is to substitute truth for myth(which by its very definition is falsehood, a fact too often forgotten in ourpost-Nietzschean fascination with myth). Since myths are there first and givemen their first opinions, philosophy means a critical destruction of myth infavor of truth for the sake of freedom and living naturally. Socrates, asdepicted in the Platonic dialogues, questioning and confuting the receivedopinions, is the model of the philosophic life; and his death at the hands ofhis countrymen for not believing in their myths epitomizes the risks ofphilosophy. Nietzsche drew precisely the opposite conclusion from the same factsabout myth. There is no nature and no such freedom. The philosopher must do thecontrary of what Socrates did. So Nietzsche is the first philosopher ever tohave attacked Socrates, because Socrates’ life is not the model life, but acorrupt and monstrous one lacking in all nobility. The tragic life, whichSocrates defused and purged, is the serious life. The new philosopher is theally of the poets and their savior, or philosophy is itself the highest kind ofpoetry. Philosophy in the old mode demythologizes and demystifies. It has nosense of the sacred; and by disenchanting the world and uprooting man, it leadsinto a void. The revelation that philosophy finds nothingness at the end of itsquest informs the new philosopher that mythmaking must be his central concern inorder to make a world.The transfusion of this religious mythmaking or value-positing interpretation ofsocial and political experience into the American bloodstream was in largemeasure effected by Max Weber’s language. His success here is, I am tempted tosay, miraculous. A good example is his invention, the Protestant Ethic. I readhis book of that name in my first social-science course at the University ofChicago when I was being initiated into the modern mysteries. This course was asurvey of social-science “classics,” among which was also Marx—not only theCommunist Manifesto but also goodly chunks of Capital. Of course, neither Lockenor Smith, the official spokesmen for “capitalism,” who might very well even beconsidered its founders, was on the list, because we were dealing with thinkerswhom a contemporary social scientist could take seriously. Marx explained theemergence of capitalism as a historical necessity, in no one’s control, theresult of class conflict over material property relations. For him Protestantismwas just an ideology reflecting capitalist control of the means of production. Idid not see, and I am not sure that my teachers saw, that, if Weber was right,Marx—his economics and his revolution, in short, Marxism and the kinds of moralsympathies it inevitably engenders—was finished. Weber purported to demonstratethat there was no such material necessity, that men’s “worldviews” or “values”determine their history, spirit compelling matter rather than the other wayaround. This has the effect of restoring the older view that individual mencount for something, that there is human freedom and the need for leadership.Weber said it was Calvin’s charisma and the vision allied to it, routinized byhis followers, that was decisive for the development of capitalism. But howdifferent Weber’s charismatic leader is from the rational statesmen looked to byLocke, Montesquieu, Smith and the Federalist. They strive for ends grasped byreason and self-evidently grounded in nature. No values, no creative visions arerequired for them to see what all reasonable men should see—that hard work isrequired to have sober, secure and prosperous freedom. Marx is arguably closerto the core of their belief in that respect; although men, according to him, arein the grip of the historical process, that process itself is rational and hasas its end the rational freedom of man. Man remains, somehow, the rationalanimal.Weber, on the other hand, denies the rationality of the “values” posited by theCalvinists; they are “decisions,” not “deliberations,” imposed on a chaoticworld by powerful personalities, “worldviews” or “world-interpretations” with nofoundation other than the selves of the Protestants. Those “values” made theworld what it was for the Protestants. They are acts that are primarily of thewill, and constitute the self and the world at the same time. Such acts must beunreasonable; they are based on nothing. In a chaotic universe, reason isunreasonable because self-contradiction is inevitable. The prophet becomes thepure model of the statesman—with very radical consequences. This was somethingnew in American social science and should have, but did not, make it clear thata new kind of causality—entirely different from that known to naturalscience—had entered the scene.In spite of this, the Weberian language and the interpretation of the world itbrings with it have caught on like wildfire. I have read about the JapaneseProtestant ethic, the Jewish Protestant ethic. The manifest absurdity of suchlocutions appears to have struck some, so now “work ethic” is graduallyreplacing “Protestant ethic,” but this is merely an adjustment and barelydisguises the point of view that still remains underneath it. Those interestedin the free market do not seem to recognize, when they use this language, thatthey are admitting that their “rational” system needs a moral supplement inorder to work, and that this morality is not itself rational—or at least thechoice of it is not rational, as they understand reason. Delay of gratificationmay make sense for the system as a whole, but is it unarguably good for theindividual? Is increase of wealth self-evidently superior to poverty for aChristian? If the work ethic is just one choice among many equally validchoices, then the free-market system itself is also just one choice among many.So proponents of the free market should not be surprised when they see that whatwas once generally agreed upon no longer compels belief. One has to go back toLocke and Adam Smith in a serious way, not just for a set of quotes, to findarguments for the rational moral basis of liberal society. This they no longerdo; and because they have lost the habit of reading serious philosophic books orof considering them really essential, they probably could not do so. When theliberal, or what came to be called the utilitarian, teaching became dominant, asis the case with most victorious causes, good arguments became less necessary;and the original good arguments, which were difficult, were replaced byplausible simplifications—or by nothing. The history of liberal thought sinceLocke and Smith has been one of almost unbroken decline in philosophicsubstance. When the liberal economic thought or way of life was manifestlythreatened, its proponents, in order to defend it, took whatever came to hand. Areligion must, it seems, be invented for the sole purpose of defendingcapitalism, whereas the earliest philosophers associated with it thought thatreligion must, at least, be weakened in order to establish it. And religion,contrary to containing capitalism’s propensities, as Tocqueville thought itshould do, is now intended to encourage them.It goes without saying that Weber never for a moment considered whether Calvinmight actually have had a revelation from God—which would certainly change thelooks of things. Weber’s atheism was dogmatic, but he was not interested inproving that Calvin was a charlatan or a madman. He rather preferred to believein the authenticity of Calvin and other such founding figures as representingpeak psychological types who can live and act in the world, who know how to takeresponsibility, who have an inner sureness or commitment. The religiousexperience is the thing, not God. The old quarrel between reason and revelationis a matter of indifference, because both sides were wrong, had faultyself-understandings. However, revelation teaches us what man is and needs. Menlike Calvin are the value producers and hence the models for action in history.We cannot believe in the ground (God) of their experience, but that experienceis critical. We are not interested in finding out how they understood themselvesbut rather in searching in the self for the mysterious substitute for theirground. We cannot have, and do not want to have, their peculiar illusions; butwe do want values and commitments. The result of this atheistic religiosity isthe mysterious musings and language of Weber and many others (think of Sartre)about belief and action, which culminate in something very different from whateither religious leaders or rational statesmen ever said or did. It fuses thetwo kinds of men, but with greater weight given to the former, to the necessityof faith and all that goes with it. The intellectual apparatus accompanying thisanalysis tends to obscure the alternatives to it, particularly the rationalalternatives.As a result there is a continuous skewing of the historical perspective towardreligious explanations. Secularization is the wonderful mechanism by whichreligion becomes nonreligion. Marxism is secularized Christianity; so isdemocracy; so is utopianism; so are human rights. Everything connected withvaluing must come from religion. One need not investigate anything else, becauseChristianity is the necessary and sufficient condition of our history. Thismakes it impossible to take Hobbes or Locke seriously as causes of that history,because we know that superficial reason cannot found values and that thesethinkers were unconsciously transmitting the values of the Protestant ethic.Reason transmits, routinizes, normalizes; it does not create. Therefore Webergives short shrift to the rational side of our tradition. Philosophy’s claimsare ignored; religious claims are revered. Dogmatic atheism culminates in theparadoxical conclusion that religion is the only thing that counts.Out of this “worldview” issues the gaudy religious word “charisma,” which hashad such fateful political consequences while becoming one of the most tiresomebuzzwords in America. In Chicago there is a Charisma Cleaners, and every streetgang leader is called “charismatic.” In America charisma is not just adescription but something good that has to do with leadership. It even seems toconfer an extralegal title to leadership by virtue of “something special”inhering in the leader. Although Weber was thinking of Moses and Buddha, or ofNapoleon, the gang leader formally suits his definition of charisma. Webersought to make a place in politics for things that political legalism excludesand that claim to have a title to attention although they are not founded onreason or consent—the only titles to rule in liberal democracy. It is not to bewondered at, then, that all the demagogic appetites frustrated by ourconstitutional system should latch on to a word that appears to legitimize andto flatter them. Moreover, democratic individualism does not officially providemuch of a place for leaders in a regime where everyone is supposed to be his ownmaster. Charisma both justifies leaders and excuses followers. The very wordgives a positive twist to rabble-rousing qualities and activities treated asnegative in our constitutional tradition. And its vagueness makes it a tool forfrauds and advertising men adept at manipulating images.Charisma, as Weber knew perfectly well, is God-given grace, which confersleadership through God’s sanction. In keeping with his analysis in theProtestant Ethic, he treats the self’s value-positing as the human truth ofGod-given grace. His account of it appears to be merely descriptive, but itbecomes prescriptive. In passages deeply influenced by Nietzsche, he analyzesthe state as a relation of domination of man by man, founded on legitimateviolence—that is, violence that is considered to be legitimate. Men inwardlyaccept being dominated if they have certain beliefs. There is no more foundationto legitimacy than the inner justification the dominated make to themselves inorder to accept the violence of those who dominate them. These justificationsare, according to Weber, of three kinds: traditional, rational, and charismatic.Some men submit because that is the way it has always been; others consent toobey competent civil servants who follow rationally established rules; andothers are enchanted by the extraordinary grace of an individual. Of the three,charismatic legitimacy is the most important. No matter what conservatives maythink, traditions had a beginning that was not traditional. They had a founderwho was not a conservative or a traditionalist. The fundamental values informingthat tradition were his creation. The tradition is the continuing half-life ofthe charmed moment when a happy few could live on the heights of inspirationwith the creator. Tradition adjusts that inspiration to the ordinary, universalmotives of man, such as greed and vanity; it routinizes the charisma. It is whatit is because of that original impulse. So charisma is the condition of both thecharismatic and the traditional legitimacies. It is also the splendid form oflegitimacy. The rational is not informed by charisma, and the civilservants—bureaucrats—are therefore unable to make real decisions or takeresponsibility. They cannot, as we would say, determine the broad outlines ofpolicy or, put more classically, establish ends. Mere competence can only servealready established goals and decide according to the established rules. It mustbe at least supplemented by charismatic leadership in order to be pointed in theright, or any, direction. So again charisma comes out on top. Value creation,the activity that writes the table of laws by which a people is constituted andlives, is, as Nietzsche tells, the nut in the shell of existence.Whatever the merit of Weber’s analysis and categories, they became holy writ forhosts of intellectuals. They were, as Weber recognized, not only an academicexercise. They expressed his vision of the crisis of the twentieth century. Thisis a case where the alleged facts also spoke the values. The tradition-basedregimes had exhausted their impulse and were on their way to extinction. Theones based on rationality were simply becoming the administration for “the lastman,” the intolerable negative pole. Imperative, then, was a stab at some formof charismatic leadership in order to revitalize the politics of the West. Thewhole undertaking rested on the assurance that Nietzsche was right that the lastman is also the worst possible man, or more generally that his critique ofreason was correct.The problem with charismatic politics is that it is almost impossible to define.There may be examples of it in the past, but they are inimitable. If politics islike art styles (a thought picked up in Weber’s invention of the term“life-style”), nothing can be prescribed to it beforehand. There are no fixedprinciples and no program of action. All that one can say is “Be yourself!”; “Beoriginal!”; “Let go!” or something of the kind. Charisma is a formula forextremism and immoderation. Moreover, the leader must have followers, so thereis every temptation for him to act out his role as they define it. And, finally,genuine charisma is so difficult to judge. Persuasive tests for the genuinenessof the charismatic leader, whose grace comes from God, were notoriously hard tocome by. The leader whose grace emanates from the much more enigmatic selfproves practically impossible to test. The modern situation as diagnosed byWeber requires radical remedies, and the charismatic leader is such aprescription.Just over the horizon, when Weber wrote, lay Hitler. He was a leader, Führer,who was certainly neither traditional nor rational-bureaucratic. He was the mad,horrible parody of the charismatic leader—the demagogue—hoped for by Weber.Hitler proved to the satisfaction of most, if not all, that the last man is notthe worst of all; and his example should have, although it has not, turned thepolitical imagination away from experiments in that direction. Weber was a goodman of decent political instincts who would never have had anything but disgustat and contempt for Hitler. What he wanted was a moderate corrective to the illsof German politics—about the same as De Gaulle brought to French politics. Butwhen one ventures out into the vast spaces opened up by Nietzsche, it is hard toset limits. Measure and moderation are the real aliens there. Weber was just oneof many serious persons who were affected by Nietzsche and popularized himwithout believing in the extremism that Nietzsche himself asserted is the resultof positioning oneself beyond good and evil. The open-ended future contains manysurprises, and all these followers of Nietzsche prepared the way by helping tojettison good and evil along with reason, without assurance of what thealternatives might be. Weber is of particular interest to us because he was thechosen apostle for the American promised land. It is not only the popularity ofthe heavily freighted language he bequeathed us that is surprising, but also thepersistence among supposedly serious persons of his articulation of thepolitical phenomena. Hitler did not cause a rethinking of politics here or inEurope. All to the contrary—it was while we were fighting him that the thoughtthat had preceded him in Europe conquered here. That thought, which gave him atleast some encouragement and did nothing to prepare us to understand him,remains dominant.During the thirties some German Social Democrats became aware that Hitler, aswell as Stalin, just would not fit Weber’s terms of analysis, which they hadpreviously used; and they began to employ “totalitarian” to describe them.Whether this is a sufficient corrective to Weber’s narrowly conceived politicalscience is questionable. But “charismatic” did indeed fit Hitler, unlesscharismatic necessarily means something good—a favorable value judgment. Isuspect that those who abandoned Weber in this way did so because they could notface how wrong he had been, or the possibility that the thought they hadembraced and propagated might have helped to support fascism. Hannah Arendt gaveperhaps unconscious witness to my suggestion, in her book Eichmann in Jerusalem,where she used the now celebrated phrase “the banality of evil,” to describeEichmann. It is not difficult to discern the “routinization of charisma” underthis thin disguise. Hitler, then, must have been charismatic. After Hitler,everybody scurried back under the protective cover of morality, but practicallyno one turned to serious thought about good and evil. Otherwise our President,or the pope, for that matter, would not be talking about values.This entire language, as I have tried to show, implies that the religious is thesource of everything political, social and personal; and it still conveyssomething like that. But it has done nothing to reestablish religion—which putsus in a pretty pickle. We reject by the fact of our categories the rationalismthat is the basis of our way of life, without having anything to substitute forit. As the religious essence has gradually become a thin, putrid gas spread outthrough our whole atmosphere, it has gradually become respectable to speak of itunder the marvelously portentous name the sacred. At the beginning of the Germaninvasion of the United States, there was a kind of scientific contempt inuniversities for the uncleanness of religion. It might be studied in a scholarlyway, as part of the past that we had succeeded in overcoming, but a believer wassomehow benighted or ill. The new social science was supposed to take the placeof morally and religiously polluted teachings just as Galileo, Copernicus,Newton, et al., had, according to the popular mythology, founded a naturalscience that crushed the superstitions of the Dark Ages. The Enlightenment, orMarxist, spirit still pervaded the land; and religion vs. science was equal toprejudice vs. truth. Social scientists simply did not see that their new toolswere based on thought that did not accept the orthodox dichotomies, that notonly were the European thinkers looking for something akin to religious actorson the political scene but that the new mind itself, or the self, had at leastas much in common with Pascal’s outlook as it did with that of Descartes orLocke. The sacred—as the central phenomenon of the self, unrecognizable toscientific consciousness and trampled underfoot by ignorant passers-by who hadlost the religious instinct—was, from the outset of the value teaching, takenseriously by thinkers in Germany. That was because they understood what “value”really means. It has taken the softening of all convictions and the blurring ofall distinctions for the sacred to be thought to be undangerous and to come intoits own here.Of course, as we use it, it has no more in common with God than does value withthe Ten Commandments, commitment with faith, charisma with Moses, or life-stylewith Jerusalem or Athens. The sacred turns out to be a need, like food or sex;and in a well-ordered community, it must get its satisfactions like the otherneeds. In our earlier free-thinking enthusiasm, we tended to neglect it. A bitof ritual is a good thing; sacred space5 along with some tradition must beprovided for, as a generation ago culture was thought to be a useful supplement.The disproportion between what all these words really mean and what they mean tous is repulsive. We are made to believe that we have everything. Our old atheismhad a better grasp of religion than does this new respect for the sacred.Atheists took religion seriously and recognized that it is a real force, costssomething and requires difficult choices. These sociologists who talk sofacilely about the sacred are like a man who keeps a toothless old circus lionaround the house in order to experience the thrills of the jungle.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------5 [017.html#f5p2ch6_5] Note how space—used to mean one’s apartment, workshop,office or whatever—has become a trendy word."},{"pageContent":"THE NIETZSCHEANIZATION OFTHE LEFT OR VICE VERSAI have spoken little of Marx and referred to few of his terms so far, althoughthe whole world is divided into two parts, one of which traces its intellectuallineage back to Locke and the other to Marx, and the latter is much readier toacknowledge its parent than is the former. But this relative neglect isinevitable when one begins with the souls of young Americans, for Marx does notspeak to them, and the so-called Marxist teachers who attempt to influence themdo not use Marxist language. To put it crudely, Marx has become boring—and notonly to American youngsters. In some backwaters, grim autodidacts may stillthrill to the rhetoric of “Workers of the world …” while Third World presidentsof one-party states focus their resentments by invoking the authority of Marx.But in the centers where people keep up-to-date and ideologies are made, Marxhas been dead for a long time. The Manifesto seems naive. Capital just does notpersuade its readers that it is the truth about economics or about theinevitable future of man, and therefore worth the hard work it demands to bedigested. A few brilliant essays still charm but are not enough on which tofound a worldview. The intellectual death of their eponymous hero has notstopped much of the Left from continuing to call itself Marxist, for herepresents the poor in their perennial struggle against the rich, and theirdemand for more equality than liberal societies provide. But beyond that, theLeft’s nourishment comes from elsewhere. Nothing in Marx resonates in soulsfurnished by Sartre, Camus, Kafka, Dostoyevski, Nietzsche and Heidegger.Rousseau can still overpower where Marx falls flat.As an illustration of what has happened to Marx’s influence, consider ideology,one of the few terms of his that has anything like the popular currency ofWeber’s terms. (I will discuss the American use of dialectic later.)In Marx, ideology meant the false system of thought elaborated by the rulingclass to justify its rule in the eyes of the ruled, while hiding its realselfish motives. Ideology was sharply distinguished in Marx from science, whichis what Marx’s system is—i.e., the truth based on disinterested awareness ofhistorical necessity. In Communist society there will be no ideology. “The puremind,” to use Nietzsche’s formulation, still exists in Marx’s thought, as it hadin all philosophy—the possibility of knowing the ways things are, anintellectual capacity irreducible to anything else. Ideology is a term ofcontempt; it must be seen through in order to be seen for what it is. Itsmeaning is not in itself but requires translation back into the underlyingreality of which it is a misleading representation. The man without ideology,the one possessing science, can look to the economic infrastructure and see thatPlato’s political philosophy, which teaches that the wise should rule, is only arationalization for the aristocrats’ position in a slave economy; or thatHobbes’s political philosophy, which teaches man’s freedom in the state ofnature and the resulting war of all against all, is only the cover for thepolitical arrangements suitable for the rising bourgeoisie. This point of viewprovides the foundation for intellectual history, which tells the story behindthe story. Instead of looking at Plato and Hobbes for information about whatcourage is—a subject important to us—we should see how their definitions ofcourage suited those who controlled the means of production.But what applies to Plato and Hobbes cannot apply to Marx; otherwise the veryassertion that these thinkers were economically determined would be itself adeception, simply the ideology for the new exploiters Marx happens to serve. Theinterpretation would self-destruct. He would not know what to look for in thethinkers who were inevitably and unconsciously in the grip of the historicalprocess, for he would be in the same condition as they were. There are certainlyhistorical preconditions of Marx’s science; but they do not detract from thetruth of his insight, which is therefore a kind of absolute moment in historythat no further history can alter. This truth is the warrant for revolution, andthe moral equivalent of the natural rights that warranted the AmericanRevolution. Without it all the killing is unjust and frivolous.However, by 1905, Lenin was speaking of Marxism as an ideology, which means thatit too can make no claim to truth. In less than half a century Marx’s absolutehad been relativized. The implausibility—on which Nietzsche insisted in hisradical historicism—of the absolute moment and of a standpoint outside historyhad become commonly acknowledged and made Marx a fossil. This was the beginningof the inner rot that has finally made Marxism unbelievable to anyone whothinks. Marxism itself became ideology. The historicization of Marx’s thought,the turning of his method against him, now looked like the resolute taking of astand within the universal flux, the sign of the creative man, a defiance of themeaninglessness of things—that is, it looked this way to those who had fallenunder Nietzsche’s spell. A parody of this new look is to be found in the personof Sartre, who had all those wonderful experiences of nothingness, the abyss,nausea, commitment without ground—the result of which was, almost without fail,support of the Party line.Ideology today, in popular speech, is, in the first place, generally understoodto be a good and necessary thing—unless it is bourgeois ideology. The evolutionof the term was made possible by the abandonment, encouraged by Nietzsche, ofthe distinction between true and false in political and moral matters. Men andsocieties need myths, not science, by which to live. In short, ideology becameidentical to values, and that is why it belongs on the honor roll of terms bywhich we live. If we examine Weber’s three forms of legitimacy—tradition, reasonand charisma—which cause men to accept a domination by other men founded onviolence, we see immediately that we would call them ideologies, as well asvalues. Weber, of course, meant that all societies or communities of humanbeings require such violent domination—as the only way order emerges from chaosin a world with no ordering force in it other than man’s creativespirituality—while Marxists still vaguely hope for a world where there arevalues without domination. This is all that remains of their Marxism, and theycan and do fellow-travel with the Nietzscheans a goodly bout de chemin. One seestheir plight in the fact that ideology no longer has its old partner, science,in their thought, but stands in lonely grandeur.Moreover, ideology is no longer very distinctly tied to economics, nor is itsimply determined. It has been cut loose from necessity’s apron strings increativity’s realm. Rational causality just does not, since Nietzsche, seemsufficient to explain the historically unique event or thought. Capitalistideology is now instinctively taken to be something more like the Protestantethic than what is described in Capital. When one talks to Marxists these daysand asks them to explain philosophers or artists in terms of objective economicconditions, they smile contemptuously and respond, “That is vulgar Marxism,” asif to ask, “Where have you been for the last seventy-five years?” No one likesto be considered vulgar, so people tend to fall back into embarrassed silence.Vulgar Marxism is, of course, Marxism. Nonvulgar Marxism is Nietzsche, Weber,Freud, Heidegger, as well as the host of later Leftists who drank at theirtrough—such as Lukacs, Kojève, Benjamin, Merleau-Ponty and Sartre—and hoped toenroll them in the class struggle. To do this, they had to jettison thatembarrassing economic determinism. The game is surely up when Marxists starttalking about “the sacred.”Very early in this century the effects of the encounter with Nietzsche began tobe felt within Marxism. An example is the significance of revolution. Revolutionand the violence that accompanies it are, as we have seen, justified in modernpolitical philosophy and provide the most arresting spectacles of modernpolitical history. Revolution took the place of rebellion, faction, or civilwar, all of which are obviously bad things, while revolution is the best andgreatest event—officially and in the popular imagination of Englishmen,Americans, Frenchmen and Russians. Germany was the only one of the great powersnot to have had one, and Marxism was partly invented to provide a bigger andbetter revolution for Germany, the natural fulfillment of German philosophy, asFrench philosophy culminated in the French Revolution. Of course, the spillingof blood is involved in revolution, proof of men’s preferring liberty to life.But great amounts of blood were not required, and the violence was not thoughtto be good in itself. The old regime was tottering and needed a push; behind itwere the developed conditions for the new order, an order fully justified bynature, reason and history.More recently, however, this has changed. The violence has a certain charm ofits own, the joy of the knife. It proves decision or commitment. The new orderis not waiting, but has to be imposed by the will of man; it is supported bynothing but the will. Will has become the key word, both Right and Left. In thepast it was, to be sure, thought that will is necessary but secondary—that thecause came first. Nietzsche formulated the new way most provocatively when hesaid, “A good war makes sacred every cause.” The causes have no status; they arevalues. It is the positing that is essential. The transformation of violencefrom a means to at least a kind of end helps to show the difference, and thelink, between Marxism and Fascism. Georges Sorel, the author of Reflections onViolence, was a man of the Left who influenced Mussolini. The crucial thoughtgoes back to Nietzsche by way of Bergson: If creativity presupposes chaos—hencestrife and overcoming—and man is now creating an order of peace in which thereis no strife, is successfully rationalizing the world, the conditions forcreativity, i.e., humanity, will be destroyed. Therefore chaos must be willed,as against the peace and order of socialism. Marx himself recognized that man’shistorical greatness and progress came from contradictions he had to struggle toovercome. If, as Marx promises, there are to be no more contradictions after therevolution, will there be man? Older revolutionaries were willing peace,prosperity, harmony and reason, i.e., the last man. The newer breed wills chaos.Hardly anyone swallowed what Nietzsche prescribed whole, but the argument wasinfectious. It surely was impressive to Italian and German intellectuals inwhose eyes the Fascist and Nazi “movements” found favor. Self-assertion, notjustice or a clear view of the future, was the crucial element.Thus determination, will, commitment, caring (here is where this now sillyexpression got its force), concern or what have you become the new virtues. Thenew revolutionary charm became evident in the U.S. in the sixties, much to thedistaste of old Marxists. There is also something of this in the currentsympathy for terrorists, because “they care.” I have seen young people, andolder people too, who are good democratic liberals, lovers of peace andgentleness, struck dumb with admiration for individuals threatening or using themost terrible violence for the slightest and tawdriest reasons. They have asneaking suspicion that they are face to face with men of real commitment, whichthey themselves lack. And commitment, not truth, is believed to be what counts.Trotsky’s and Mao’s correction of Marx in calling for “permanent revolution”takes account of this thirst for the act of revolution, and its appeal liestherein. The radical students of the sixties called themselves “the movement,”unaware that this was also the language used by young Nazis in the thirties andwas the name of a Nazi journal, Die Bewegung. Movement takes the place ofprogress, which has a definite direction, a good direction, and is a force thatcontrols men. Progress was what the old revolutions were evidence of. Movementhas none of this naive, moralistic nonsense in it. Motion rather than fixity isour condition—but motion without any content or goal not imposed on it by man’swill. Revolution in our times is a mixture of what it was earlier thought to beand what André Gide called a gratuitous act, represented in one of his novels bythe unprovoked and unmotivated murder of a stranger on a train.The continuing effort of the mutant breed of Marxists has been to derationalizeMarx and turn Nietzsche into a leftist. Nietzsche’s colossal political failureis attested to by the facts that the Right, which was his only hope that histeaching would have its proper effect, has utterly disappeared, and he himselfwas tainted in its ugly last gasp, while today virtually every Nietzschean, aswell as Heideggerian, is a leftist. Georg Lukacs, the most prominent Marxistintellectual of this century, set the ball rolling. As a young man in Germany,he frequented the circle of Stefan George as well as that of Max Weber and wasaware of the power of the things being discussed there about history andculture. This affected his later work and made him take a look back toward themuch richer Hegel, who, for older Marxists, had been simply superseded by Marx.6The mature Marx had almost nothing to say about art, music, literature oreducation, or about what the life of man would be when the yoke of oppressionwas lifted. His early “humanistic” writings were looked to by some for theinspiration lacking in the later ones, but they turned out to be thin andderivative stuff. Since the Nietzscheans spoke so marvelously well about allthese things, why not just appropriate what they said? So they took over “thelast man,” whom they identified with Marx’s bourgeois, and “the superman,” whomthey identified with the victorious proletarian after the revolution. Thediminution of man and the impoverishment of his spiritual life as inimitablydescribed by Nietzsche strengthened Marx’s position, if one just believed thatsomehow or other capitalism was the cause of “the last man” and that, withcapitalism removed, new energies would be released. Radical egalitarism is thecure for the evils of egalitarianism so marvelously portrayed by Nietzsche.To take another example: Freud talked about interesting things not foundanywhere in Marx. The whole psychology of the unconscious was completely aliento Marx, as was its inner motor, eros. None of this could be incorporateddirectly into Marx. But if Freud’s interpretation of the cause of neuroses andhis treatment of the maladjusted could itself be interpreted as bourgeois errorsthat serve enslavement to the capitalist control of the means of production,then Marx would move in on the Freudian scene. What Freud said were permanentcontradictions between human nature and society could be set in motiondialectically, and in a socialist society there would be no need for therepression that causes neuroses. So Freud was neatly enrolled in the Marxistlegions, adding to the charm of economics that of eros, and thereby providing asolution to the problem of what men are going to do after the revolution—aproblem left unsolved by Marx. This is what we find in Marcuse and many others,who simply do not talk about the difficulty posed by the contradiction betweenMarx’s fundamental principles and those of Freud. Two powerful systems areserved up in a single package. Freud is the really meaty part of the concoction.Marx provides a generalized assurance that capitalism is indeed at fault andthat the problems can be solved by more equality and more freedom, that theliberated people will possess all the virtues.“The last man” interpretation of the bourgeois is reinforced by a certainambiguity in the meaning of the word “bourgeois.” Bourgeois is associated in thepopular consciousness, especially in America, with Marx. But there is also thebourgeois as the enemy of the artists. The capitalist and the philistinebourgeois are supposed to be the same, but Marx presents only the economic side,assuming, without adequate warrant, that it can account for both the moral andesthetic deformities of the bourgeois described by the artists, and for theartists themselves. Doubt that this treatment of the bourgeois and the artistreally works is one of the prime motives of those attracted to Nietzsche, whosecentral theme is the artist. As I have said many times and in many ways, most ofthe great European novelists and poets of the last two hundred years were men ofthe Right; and Nietzsche is in that respect merely their complement. For themthe problem was in one way or another equality, which has no place for genius.Thus they are the exact opposite of Marx. But somehow he who says he hates thebourgeoisie can be seen to be a friend of the Left. Therefore when the Left gotthe idea of embracing Nietzsche, it got, along with him, all the authority ofthe nineteenth- and twentieth-century literary tradition. Goethe and Flaubertand Yeats hated the bourgeosie—so Marx was right: these writers simply had notrecognized that the bourgeosie could be overcome by the proletariat. AndNietzsche, taken from the correct angle, can be said to be a proponent of theRevolution. When one reads the early Partisan Review, edited entirely byleftists, one sees its unlimited enthusiasm for Joyce and Proust, whom they wereintroducing to this country, apparently in the opinion that they represented theart of the socialist future, although these artists thought the future of artlay in the opposite direction.The later Marxists in Germany were haunted by the idea of culture, repelled bythe vulgarity of the bourgeoisie, and perhaps wondering whether they could stillwrite out a blank check to culture in the socialist future. They wanted topreserve past greatness, of which they were much more conscious than theirpredecessors. Their Marxism had really shrunk back within the confines of thetraditional hatred of the bourgeois, plus a vague hope that the proletariatwould bring about cultural renewal or refreshment. One can easily see this inAdorno. But it is also easy to see that in Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, too, thebourgeois is the real concern. The working-class Marxists still thought aboutsurplus value and other such authentic Marxist concerns. The intellectuals wereobsessed by culture and, as Leszek Kolakowski has so aptly pointed out, foundthemselves without a proletariat. This is why the students of the sixties wereso welcome to many of them. But so were they to Heidegger. They reminded him ofsomething.It is well to point out, in addition, that as prosperity increased, the poorbegan to become embourgeoisé. Instead of an increase in class consciousness andstrife, there was a decrease. One could foresee a time, at least in thedeveloped countries, when everybody would be a bourgeois. So another prop wasknocked out from under Marxism. The issue is not really rich and poor butvulgarity. Marxists were coming perilously close to the notion that egalitarianman as such is bourgeois, and that they must join him or become culture snobs.Only an absolutely unsubstantiated dogma that the bourgeois worker is just anillness of our economic system and a product of false consciousness keeps themfrom saying, as did Tocqueville, that this is the nature of democracy and thatyou must accept it or rebel against it. Any such rebellion would not be Marx’srevolution. One might be tempted to assert that these advanced Marxists are justtoo cultured for egalitarian society. They only avoid that recognition bycalling it bourgeois.In general, sophisticated Marxism became cultural criticism of life in theWestern democracies. For obvious reasons it generally stayed away from seriousdiscussion of the Soviet Union. Some of that criticism was profound, some of itsuperficial and petulant. But none of it came from Marx or a Marxistperspective. It was, and is, Nietzschean, variations on our way of life as thatof “the last man.” If we look again at that psychology so influential in Americaof which I spoke in the beginning of this chapter, we are now in a position tosee that tradition-directed, other-directed and inner-directed are just slightmodifications of Weber’s three kinds of legitimacy, with other-directed (readbourgeois) derived from economic or bureaucratic rationality guided by thedemands of the market or public opinion, and inner-directed identical tocharismatic, to the value-giving self. Weber’s prophet is replaced by thesocialist, egalitarian individual. There is not a single element of Marx in anyof this, other than the absolutely unsubstantiated assertion that the socialistis the self-legislator. Discussion of the inner-directed man is empty. There areno examples that can be pointed to. Weber at least provided some examples, eventhough his definition may have been problematic. One wonders whether Weber’scontention that the value giver is an aristocrat of the spirit is less plausiblethan that of those who say that just anyone is, if he has the right therapist,or if a socialist society is constructed for him. This egalitariantransformation of Weber permitted anyone who is not to the left to be diagnosedas mentally ill. Left critics of psychoanalysis called it a tool of bourgeoisconformism; one wonders, however, whether the critics are not manipulators ofpsychological therapy in the service of Left conformism. Adorno’s meretriciousfabrication of the authoritarian and democratic personality types has exactlythe same sources as the inner-directed-other-directed typology, and the samesinister implications.So Nietzsche came to America. His conversion to the Left was easily acceptedhere as genuine, because Americans cannot believe that any really intelligentand good person does not at bottom share the Will Rogers Weltanschauung, “Inever met a man I didn’t like.” Nietzsche’s naturalization was accomplished inmany waves: some of us went to Europe to find him; he came with the emigrès; andmost recently professors of comparative literature have gotten heavily into theimport business, getting their goods from Paris, where deconstructing Nietzscheand Heidegger and reconstructing them on the Left has been the principalphilosophical métier since the Liberation. From this last source Heidegger andNeitzsche now come under their own names, treading on the red carpet rolled outfor them by their earlier envoys. Academic psychology, sociology, comparativeliterature and anthropology have been dominated by them for a long time. Buttheir passage from the academy to the marketplace is the real story. A languagedeveloped to explain to knowers how bad we are has been adopted by us to declareto the world how interesting we are. Somehow the goods got damaged in transit.Marcuse began in Germany in the twenties by being something of a serious Hegelscholar. He ended up here writing trashy culture criticism with a heavy sexinterest in One Dimensional Man and other well-known books. In the Soviet Union,instead of the philosopher-king they got the ideologist tyrant; in the UnitedStates the culture critic became the voice of Woodstock.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------6 [018.html#f6p2ch7_6] Anyone wishing to see this now popular mixture of Marxwith Hegel and Nietzsche-Heidegger in a philosophically serious expression mustturn to the works of Alexandre Kojève, the most intelligent Marxist of thetwentieth century. He was forced to treat Marx as a mere intellectual whodisseminated with a few changes the thought of the real philosopher, Hegel.Moreover, Kojève faced “the last man” question squarely: Marxists, i.e.,rationalists, must live with “the last man.” He is the result of rationalhistory, Kojève agrees with Nietzsche. Only mystifiers of one kind or another,promoting wild, irrational negativity, could, he thought, avoid this conclusion.Merleau-Ponty and Sartre were strongly influenced by him and took his hint."},{"pageContent":"OUR IGNORANCEIn reflecting on the language about which I have just written, the thoughtbehind it and the way it has been received in America, I am reminded of one ofmy teachers, who wrote a Ten Commandments for Americans that began, “I am theLord thy God who brought thee out of the house of the European tyrants into myown land, America: Relax!” As we have seen, these words we have half digestedare the distillations of great questions that must be faced if one is to live aserious life: reason-revelation, freedom-necessity, democracy-aristocracy,good-evil, body-soul, self-other, city-man, eternity-time, being-nothing. Ourcondition of doubt makes us aware of alternatives but has not until recentlygiven us the means to resolve our doubt about the primacy of any of thealternatives. A serious life means being fully aware of the alternatives,thinking about them with all the intensity one brings to bear on life-and-deathquestions, in full recognition that every choice is a great risk with necessaryconsequences that are hard to bear. That is what tragic literature is about. Itarticulates all the noble things men want and perhaps need and shows howunbearable it is when it appears that they cannot coexist harmoniously. One needonly remember what the choice between believing in God or rejecting Him used toentail for those who faced it. Or, to use a lesser but equally relevant example,think of Tocqueville, one of the rarest flowers of the old French aristocracy,choosing equality over the splendor of aristocracy because he believed it to bejuster, even though it would never be salubrious for a Pascal, a man whoconsumed himself in the contemplation of God’s existence, and even though theabsence of such intransigent confrontation with the grounds of all things wouldimpoverish the life of man and diminish his seriousness. These are real choices,possible only for one who faces real questions.We, on the other hand, have taken these words, which point toward a rich lode ofserious questions, and treated them as though they were answers, in order toavoid confronting them ourselves. They are not Sphinxlike riddles to which wemust play the daring Oedipus, but facts behind which we need not go and whichstructure the world of concern to us. What has existentialism done tobeing-nothing for us? Or value to good-evil; history to eternity-time;creativity to freedom-necessity; the sacred to reason-revelation? The old tragicconflicts reappear newly labeled as assurances: “I’m OK, you’re OK.” Choice isall the rage these days, but it does not mean what it used to mean. In a freesociety where people are free—responsible—who can consistently not be“pro-choice”? However, when the word still had some shape and consistency, adifficult choice meant to accept difficult consequences in the form ofsuffering, disapproval of others, ostracism, punishment and guilt. Without this,choice was believed to have no significance. Accepting the consequences foraffirming what really counts is what gives Antigone her nobility; unwillingnessto do so is what makes her sister Ismene less admirable. Now, when we speak ofthe right to choice, we mean that there are no necessary consequences, thatdisapproval is only prejudice and guilt only a neurosis. Political activism andpsychiatry can handle it. In this optic Hester Prynne and Anna Karenina are notennobling exemplars of the intractability of human problems and the significanceof choice, but victims whose sufferings are no longer necessary in ourenlightened age of heightened consciousness. America has no-fault automobileaccidents, no-fault divorces, and it is moving with the aid of modern philosophytoward no-fault choices.Conflict is the evil we most want to avoid, among nations, among individuals andwithin ourselves. Nietzsche sought with his value philosophy to restore theharsh conflicts for which men were willing to die, to restore the tragic senseof life, at a moment when nature had been domesticated and men become tame. Thatvalue philosophy was used in America for exactly the opposite purpose—to promoteconflict-resolution, bargaining, harmony. If it is only a difference of values,then conciliation is possible. We must respect values, but they must not get inthe way of peace.7 Thus Nietzsche contributed to what he was trying to cure.Conflict, the condition of creativity for Nietzsche, is for us a cry fortherapy. I keep thinking of my Atlanta taxi driver and his Gestalt therapy. Kantargued that men are equal in dignity because of their capacity for moral choice.It is the business of society to provide the conditions for such choice andesteem for those who achieve it. With the intermediary of value relativism, wehave been able to simplify the formula to: Men are equal in dignity. Ourbusiness is to distribute esteem equally. Rawls’s A Theory of Justice is theinstruction manual for such distribution. Kant’s theory of justice makes itpossible to understand Anna Karenina as a significant expression of oursituation; Rawls’s does the same for Fear of Flying.Our desire for conflict reduction accounts for the great popularity of the word“dialectic”—in our sense, the Marxist sense—for, beginning in opposites it endsin synthesis, all charms and temptations united in harmony. In philosophy andmorals the hardest and most essential rule is “You can’t eat your cake and haveit too,” but dialectic overcomes this rule. Socratic dialectic takes place inspeech and, although drawn forward by the search for synthesis, alwaysculminates in doubt. Socrates’ last word was that he knew that he knew nothing.Marx’s dialectic takes place in deed and culminates in the classless society,which also puts an end to theoretical conflicts, now known as ideologies.Historical dialectic provides an absolute ground and happy resolution for ourrelative life-styles. Marx’s formula that “Mankind never sets problems foritself which it cannot solve” suits one side of our national temper. Rooseveltsaid much the same thing when he announced, “We have nothing to fear but fearitself.” This optimism is a national strength and is connected with our originalproject of mastering of nature. But that project itself is not unproblematic andmakes sense only when kept within limits. One of these is the sanctity of humannature. It must not be mastered. Roosevelt’s dictum is nonsense when blown upinto cosmic proportions. Human nature must not be altered in order to have aproblem-free world. Man is not just a problem-solving being, as behavioristswould wish us to believe, but a problem-recognizing and -accepting being.Marx’s appeal does, nonetheless, touch us close to home as the fulfillment ofwhat we set out to do—solve problems that God and nature had previously seemedto make insoluble, and earlier men had made a virtue of living with. Man hasalways had to come to terms with God, love and death. They made it impossible tobe perfectly at home on earth. But America is coming to terms with them in newways. God was slowly executed here; it took two hundred years, but localtheologians tell us He is now dead. His place has been taken by the sacred. Lovewas put to death by psychologists. Its place has been taken by sex andmeaningful relationships. That has taken only about seventy-five years. Itshould not be surprising that a new science, thanatology, or death with dignity,is on the way to putting death to death. Coming to terms with the terror ofdeath, Socrates’ long and arduous education, learning how to die, will no longerbe necessary. For death isn’t what it used to be. What will take its place isnot yet clear. Engels had a divination of what is needed when he said that theclassless society would last, if not forever, a very long time. This reminds usof Dottore Dulcamare in The Elixir of Love, who says that he is known throughoutthe whole universe—and elsewhere. All one has to do is forget about eternity orblur the distinction between it and temporality; then the most intractable ofman’s problems will have been resolved. On Sunday mornings educated men used tobe harangued about death and eternity, made to give them a bit of attention.This is not a danger to be run in doing battle with the Sunday New York Times.Forgetting, in a variety of subtle forms, is one of our primary modes ofproblem-solving. We are learning to “feel comfortable” with God, love and evendeath.The way we digest the European things is well illustrated by the influence ofThomas Mann’s Death in Venice on American consciousness. The story wasenormously popular with generations of university students, for it seemed toexpress the mysteries and sufferings of sophisticated Europeans. It fit in withour preoccupation of Freud and with the artist; its homosexual theme attractedcuriosity, and much more than curiosity in some, at a time when imagination hadlittle to feed on so far as forbidden themes were concerned. It was a littlelike a compendium of the best that was being said around the turn of thecentury. In Death in Venice, with what I believe to be a rather heavy Freudianhand, Mann analyzes the favorite subject and hero of poets and novelists sincethe invention of culture—the artist, that is, himself. The setting and theaction of the story suggest the decline of the West; and the decay and demise ofits hero, Aschenbach, teach the failure of sublimation, the shakiness andhollowness of his cultural superstructure. Underlying it all are hidden drives,primal, untamed, which are the real motives of his higher endeavor. Awareness ofthis undermines his life work without providing any acceptable alternatives.Much of this is a gloss on Mann’s famous statement in Tonio Kröger that “theartist is a bourgeois with a guilty conscience,” which I take to mean that hewas experiencing all the post-romantic doubts about the artist’s ground or hisaccess to the sublime, that he thought the reality is the bourgeois, but thatthe artist’s troubled conscience leads him somewhere out above, from the pointof view of morals, and somewhere down below, from the point of view of motives.Aschenbach is a writer, an heir to the German tradition, but clearly not thespiritual aristocrat Goethe was. His self-possession is based on lack ofself-knowledge. In Venice he touches the roots, finds out what he really wants;but there is nothing noble or even tolerable he can do with his awareness. Hewithers away horribly, finally dying of the plague afflicting that beautiful butdecadent city. The Freudian view of sublimation, as opposed to the Nietzschean,is that there is a fixed goal of sexuality, a natural reality toward which it ispointed. Accordingly, civilized behavior rests on that foundation, is asecondary satisfaction and, hence, really not choiceworthy if the primarysatisfaction were available. Freud’s account of sexuality cannot help making thecareful observer regret civilization and long for direct sexual satisfaction.Nietzsche, on the other hand, thought that writing a poem could be as primary anerotic act as sexual intercourse. There is no fixed nature, just differentlevels of spirituality. From this point of view, Aschenbach represents bothromanticism in its longing for lost nature and scientism in its bleakcharacterization of nature, with the addition of post-Nietzschean pathos. ButDeath in Venice does deal with the theme common to Freud and Nietzsche—therelation of sexual sublimation to culture. The coming to awareness of theinfrastructure of culture is deadly to culture, and Mann is depicting the crisisof a civilization. Sublimation has lost its creative or molding power, and nowthere is desiccated culture and besmirched nature.But I do not think this was how it was received by Americans. They weretitillated and really took it as an early manifesto of the sexual-liberationmovement. Even the most distinguished talents, or especially the mostdistinguished talents, suffer from these obscure longings repressed by society.There is nothing so bad about them; and people should not be intimidated bypublic opinion, should learn to accept themselves. They have nothing to fear butfear itself. In short, Aschenbach is a man aching to “come out of the closet.”There may have been a bit of this in Mann, the need to be open about represseddesires, which, because of the climate of his time, had to come out in tragicgarb, lacerating themselves, weeping and wailing. Surely Gide’s Nietzscheanismwas motivated largely by this. In order to be sexually liberated, so Gide seemsto think, we must be supermen, beyond good and evil. He latches on toNietzsche’s immoralism for the sake of leveling bourgeois sexual morals, using acannon to kill a gnat. Nietzsche would have had nothing but contempt for this.The man who said all greatness requires “semen in the blood” would not havesympathized with men obsessed by sexual repression, who could not make somethingsublime out of their eroticism, who longed for “natural” satisfaction and publicapproval to boot. To Nietzsche, Gide would have appeared to be a bourgeois innihilistic drag. To the extent that such self-expression might have been Mann’sintention, it would have been the sign of his own decadence, his creativeimpotence and desire to escape responsibility in aimless creature, as opposed tocreator, pleasures.The sexual interpretations of art and religion so powerfully made by Nietzsche,and less powerfully but more popularly made by Freud, had a corrupting effect onAmericans. They noticed the sublime less than the sex in sexual sublimation.What in Nietzsche was intended to lead to the heights was used here to debunkthe heights in favor of present desire. Any explanation of the higher in termsof the lower has that tendency, especially in a democracy, where there is envyof what makes special claims, and the good is supposed to be accessible to all.And this is one of the deep reasons why Freud found such an immediate audiencein America. For all of the Continental sturm und drang, he believed in nature,and nature as Locke taught it, animal nature. He just added sex to work tocompose his formula for healthy living—“love and work”—for he really could notexplain love. This is what we were raised to believe. It accords with sciencerather than relying, as does Nietzsche, on poetic vapors. There is a solidground, one that appeals to our native empiricism, in his interpretation of whateros really wants. Moreover, science rather than poetry is our preferred meansof talking about the obscene. All this, plus the promise of some kind ofsatisfaction of our desires and relief from our miseries, made Freud a winnerfrom the outset, the most accessible of all the great Continentals. He providedthe license for the centrality of sex in public life, which is so characteristicof our day. He ultimately seemed too moralistic, not open enough. But all onehad to do was imagine new social structures that demanded less repression fortheir functioning. This was where Marx was useful. Or one could simply forgetabout the problems concerning the relation between eros and culture, or elseposit a natural harmony between the two. Freud, riding the crest of a wave ofGerman philosophy, enabled Americans to think the satisfaction of their sexualdesires was the most important element of happiness. He provided rationalizationfor instinct, although this was surely not his intention.Sex immigrated to the United States with the special status given those who makescientific and literary contributions to our culture. But when it got here, itbehaved just like everything else American. Gone was the plaintive tone, thepoetry, the justification based on civilization’s dependence on sublimation.Just as we had cut away the camouflage disguising economic needs—such as theParthenon and Chartres—in order to concentrate efficiently on those needsthemselves, so we demystified sexual desires, seeing them for what they reallyare, in order to satisfy them more efficiently. This brought into the Lockeanworld the second focus of human nature, the one concentrated on by Rousseau andthose he influenced. The basic rights are “life, liberty, and the pursuit ofproperty and sex.” “Give us your poor, your sexually starved….” Freud made itpossible to consider sexual repression a medical complaint, and thereforeendowed it with the prestige automatically enjoyed by anything having to do withhealth in a nation devoted to self-preservation. There is a tendency to neglectRousseau’s reminder that one does not die from not satisfying this hunger, andthat even great seducers’ lusts can be calmed by the certainty of the deathpenalty. Thus we demystify economy and sexuality, satisfying their primarydemands, taking away what our philosophy tells us is their creative impulse, andthen we complain we have no culture. We can always go to the opera betweenoffice and bed. In the Soviet Union they are dependent on operas from the badold days, because tyranny prevents artistic expression; we are dependent on thesame operas, because the thirsts that produced artistic need have been slaked. Icannot forget the Amherst freshman who asked in naive and good-naturedbewilderment, “Should we go back to sublimation?” To the sugar-free dietsubstitute, as it were. This is what happened in America to the sublime, in allof the subtle meanings given to it from Rousseau and Kant to Nietzsche andFreud. I was charmed by the lad’s candor but could not regard him as a seriouscandidate for culture. Because we have come to take the unnecessary to benecessary, we have lost all sense of necessity, either natural or cultural.The crucial step was taken, however, when sex as life-style came on the scene.Up until then there was a certain rough-and-ready natural set of guidelines forsex. In the old America it was taken for granted that sex had ateleology—reproduction—and was treated as a means to this end. Everything notconducive to this is useless and even dangerous, to be forgotten or controlledby law, disapproval, conscience and, yes, reason. Freud had the effect ofshaking sex loose from this definite connection. It is a force without an end,capable of serving many functions; and its wild, diffuse energies must be givensome form if a person is to be happy. But Freud’s real naturalism, underlyingthe explosive indeterminateness that he borrowed from Nietzsche, and theimperatives of health and the integrated personality provided limitations and astructure for legitimate sexual expression. There is no place in Freud for thesatisfaction of the kinds of desire to which Mann gives voice in Death inVenice. They are explained and cured by Freud but not accepted on their ownterms. In Mann they are somehow premonitory and like cries of the damnedplunging into nothingness. Such desires search for significance—perhaps this isthe case with everything erotic—but nothing in the world can give it to them.These desires are certainly not satisfied with the transfer of their cases fromthe tribunal of the judge and the priest to that of the doctor, or with beingexplained away. People can readily accept reductionism in everything except whatmost concerns them. Neither bourgeois society nor natural science has a placefor the nonreproductive aspect of sex. With the slackening of bourgeoisausterity and the concomitant emancipation of the harmless pleasures, a certaintolerance of harmless sex came into fashion. But this was not enough, becausenobody really wants his dearest desires to be put in the same category asitching and scratching.In America, especially, there is always a need for moral justification.Life-style—an expression that came out of the same school of thought assublimation and was actually understood to be the product of sublimation, buthad never been associated with it in America because of the division of laborthat had Freud specializing in sublimation and Weber in life-style—turned out tobe a godsend. “Life-style” justifies any way of life, as does “value” anyopinion. It does away with the natural structure of the world, which is only rawmaterial for the stylist’s artistic hand. The very expression makes allmoralisms and naturalisms stop short at the limit of the sacred ground, aware oftheir limits and respectful of creativity. Moreover, with our curious mixture oftraditions, life-styles are accorded rights, so defense of them is a moralcause, justifying the sweet passions of indignation at the violators of humanrights, against whom these tastes, before they became life-styles, were sopolitically and psychologically defenseless. Now they can call upon all thelovers of human rights throughout the world to join in their defense, for thethreat to any group’s rights is a threat to them all. Sadomasochists andSolidarity are bound together in the common cause of human rights, their fatesdepending on the success of the crusade in their favor. Sex is no longer anactivity but a cause. In the past there was a respectable place for marginality,bohemia. But it had to justify its unorthodox practices by its intellectual andartistic achievement. Life-style is so much freer, easier, more authentic anddemocratic. No attention has to be paid to content.Life-style was first popularized here to describe and make acceptable the livesof people who do attractive things that are frowned upon by society. It wasidentical to counterculture. Two great expressions in the American usage, drapedin the authority lent by their philosophic genealogy, provided moral warrant forpeople to live exactly as they please. Counterculture, of course, enjoyed thedignity attaching to culture, and was intended as a reproach to the bourgeoisexcuse for a culture we see around us. What actually goes on in a countercultureor a life-style—whether it is ennobling or debasing—makes no difference. No oneis forced to think through his practices. It is impossible to do so. Whateveryou are, whoever you are, is the good. All this is testimony to the amazingpower, about which Tocqueville speaks, of abstractions in a democratic society.The mere words change everything. It is also a commentary on our moralism. Whatbegins in a search if not precisely for selfish pleasure—historians of thefuture will not look back on us as a race of hedonists who knew how to “enjoy,”in spite of all of our talk about it—then at least for avoidance of and releasefrom suffering or distress, transmogrified into a life-style and a right,becomes the ground of moral superiority. The comfortable, unconstrained life ismorality.One can see this in so many domains across the whole political spectrum.Self-serving is expressed as, and really believed to be, disinterestedprinciple. When one looks at the earnest, middle-class proponents of birthcontrol, abortion and easy divorce—with their social concern, their humorlessself-confidence and masses of statistics—one cannot help thinking that all thisserves them very well. This is not to deny the reality of the problems presentedby too many children for the poor, the terrible consequences of rapes andbattered wives. However, none of those problems really belongs to the middleclasses, who are not reproducing themselves, are rarely raped or battered, butwho are the best-rewarded beneficiaries of what they themselves propose. If oneof their proposals entailed a sacrifice of freedom or pleasure for them or theirclass, they would be more morally plausible. As it is, all their proposalscontribute to their own capacity to choose, in the contemporary sense of choice.Motives that could easily be so flawed should not be, but are, the basis formoral smugness. In this case, as in so many others, making sexual relations easybecomes identical to morality. I fear that the most self-righteous of Americansnowadays are precisely those who have most to gain from what they preach. Thisis made all the more distasteful when their weapons are constructed out ofphilosophic teachings the intentions of which are the opposite of theirs.But what strikes me most about Mann’s story, and makes me reflect on what hashappened in America since such literature first attracted our attention, is hisuse of Plato. As Aschenbach becomes more and more obsessed by the boy on thebeach, quotations from the Phaedrus, one of Plato’s dialogues on love, keepcoming into his head, expressing what he gradually and with honor recognizes isthe character of his attraction. Plato had been incorporated into the Germantradition, and the Phaedrus was probably one of the things Aschenbach wassupposed to have read as a schoolboy while learning Greek. But its content,discourses on the love of a man for a boy, was not supposed to affect him. Thedialogue, like so much that was in the German education, was another scrap of“culture,” of historical information, which had not become a part of a vital,coherent whole. This is symptomatic of the deadness of Aschenbach’s own culturalactivity. Suddenly this scrap erupts into meaning, pointing the way down intothe abyss of repressed desire. It is as a dream; and if you are a Freudian, youhave keys for unlocking the meanings of dreams. Raw, physically unacceptablefacts, inhabitants of the unconscious, express themselves in hidden ways,gaining covert satisfaction that way. They fasten themselves on consciouslyacceptable material, which then no longer really means what it seems to mean. Itnow does and does not express the true meaning. Plato’s respectable dialogue isthe intermediary between Aschenbach’s good conscience and his carnality. Platofound a way of expressing and beautifying, of sublimating, perverse sexuality.So the story presents it. There is no indication that Mann thought one couldlearn much directly from Plato about eros. One could learn something by applyingFreud’s insights to Plato and seeing how desire finds rationalizations foritself. Plato was vile body for scientific dissection. Mann was too caught up bythe novelty of the Freudian teaching to doubt whether sublimation can reallyaccount for the psychic phenomena it claims to explain. He was doctrinaire, orhe was sure we know better than did older thinkers. They are mythologists.Freud and Plato agree about the pervasiveness of eroticism in everything human.But there the similarity ends. Anyone who wished to lay aside his assuranceabout the superiority of modern psychology might find in Plato a richerexplanation of the diversity of erotic expression, which so baffles us and hasdriven us to our present nonsense. He would see there a rewarding articulationof the possibilities and impossibilities of the fulfillment of erotic desires.Plato both enchants and disenchants eros, and we need both. At least in Mann thetradition in which we could refresh ourselves is present, if not exactly alive.With what he gives us we might embark on our own journey and find moreinteresting prey than is an Aschenbach. But in America that slender thread,which was already almost stretched to its limit in Mann, has broken. We have nomore contact with the tradition. Eros is an obsession, but there is no thoughtabout it, and no possibility of thought about it, because we now take what wereonly interpretations of our souls to be facts about them. Eros gradually becomesmeaningless and low; and there is nothing good for man which is not informed bythought and affirmed by real choice, which means choice instructed bydeliberation. Saul Bellow has described his own intention as “the rediscovery ofthe magic of the world under the debris of modern ideas.” That gray net ofabstraction, used to cover the world in order to simplify and explain it in away that is pleasing to us, has become the world in our eyes. The only way tosee the phenomena, rather than sterile distillations of them, to experience themin their ambiguity again, would be to have available alternate visions, adiversity of profound opinions. But our ideas have made it difficult to havesuch experiences in practice, and impossible in theory. How does a youngster whosees sublimation where Plato saw divination learn from Plato, let alone thinkPlato can speak to him? Souls artificially constituted by a new kind ofeducation live in a world transformed by man’s artifice and believe that allvalues are relative and determined by the private economic or sexual drives ofthose who hold them. How are they to recover the primary natural experience?I suspect that if we were to make a law forbidding the use of any of the wordson the imposing list in this section, a large part of the population would besilenced. Technical discourse would continue; but all that concerns right andwrong, happiness, the way we ought to live, would become quite difficult toexpress. These words are there where thoughts should be, and their disappearancewould reveal the void. The exercise would be an excellent one, for it mightstart people thinking about what they really believe, about what lies behind theformulas. Would “living exactly as I please” be speakable as a substitute for“life-style”? Would “my opinion” do for “values”? “My prejudices” for my“ideology”? Could “rabble-rousing” or “simply divine” stand in for “charisma”?Each of the standard words seems substantial and respectable. They appear tojustify one’s tastes and deeds, and human beings need to have suchjustification, no matter what they may say. We have to have reasons for what wedo. It is the sign of our humanity and our possibility of community. I havenever met a person who says, “I believe what I believe; these are just myvalues.” There are always arguments. Nazis had them; Communists have them.Thieves and pimps have them. There may be some people who don’t feel they haveto make a case for themselves, but they must be either tramps or philosophers.However, these words are not reasons, nor were they intended to be reasons. Allto the contrary, they were meant to show that our deep human need to know whatwe are doing and to be good cannot be satisfied. By some miracle these veryterms became our justification: nihilism as moralism. It is not the immoralityof relativism that I find appalling. What is astounding and degrading is thedogmatism with which we accept such relativism, and our easygoing lack ofconcern about what that means for our lives. The one writer who does not appealat all to Americans—who offers nothing for our Marxist, Freudian, feminist,deconstructionist, or structuralist critics to mangle, who provides no poses,sentimentalities or bromides that appeal to our young—is Louis-Ferdinand Céline,who best expresses how life looks to a man facing up to what we believe or don’tbelieve. He is a far more talented artist and penetrating observer than the muchmore popular Mann or Camus. Robinson, the hero he admires in Journey to the Endof the Night, is an utterly selfish liar, cheat, murderer for pay. Why doesFerdinand admire him? Partly for his honesty, but mostly because he allowshimself to be shot and killed by his girlfriend rather than tell her he lovesher. He believes in something, which Ferdinand is unable to do. Americanstudents are repelled, horrified by this novel, and turn away from it indisgust. If it could be force-fed to them, it might motivate them to reconsider,to regard it as urgent to think through their premises, to make their implicitnihilism explicit and examine it seriously. As an image of our currentintellectual condition, I keep being reminded of the newsreel pictures ofFrenchmen splashing happily in the water at the seashore, enjoying the paidannual vacations legislated by Léon Blum’s Popular Front government. It was1936, the same year Hitler was permitted to occupy the Rhineland. All our bigcauses amount to that kind of vacation.What is so paradoxical is that our language is the product of the extraordinarythought and philosophical greatness at which this cursory and superficial surveyhas done nothing more than hint. There is a lifetime and more of study here,which would turn our impoverishing certitudes into humanizing doubts. To returnto the reasons behind our language and weigh them against the reasons for otherlanguage would in itself liberate us. I have tried to provide the outline of anarcheology of our souls as they are. We are like ignorant shepherds living on asite where great civilizations once flourished. The shepherds play with thefragments that pop up to the surface, having no notion of the beautifulstructures of which they were once a part. All that is necessary is a carefulexcavation to provide them with life-enhancing models. We need history, not totell us what happened, or to explain the past, but to make the past alive sothat it can explain us and make a future possible. This is our educationalcrisis and opportunity. Western rationalism has culminated in a rejection ofreason. Is this result necessary?Many will say that my reports of the decisive influence of Continental,particularly German, philosophy on us are false or exaggerated and that, even ifit were true that all this language comes from the source to which I attributeit, language does not have such effects. But the language is all around us. Itssources are also undeniable, as is the thought that produced the language. Weknow how the language was popularized. I need only think of my Amherst studentor my Atlanta taxi driver to be persuaded that the categories of the minddetermine the perceptions. If we can believe that Calvinist “worldviews” madecapitalism, we can also credit the possibility that the overpowering visions ofGerman philosophers are preparing the tyranny of the future.I must reiterate that Rousseau, Kant, Hegel and Nietzsche are thinkers of thevery highest order. This is, in fact, precisely my point. We must relearn whatthis means and also that there are others who belong in the same rank.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------7 [019.html#f7p2ch8_7] Nietzsche said that distrusting one’s neighbor would beregarded as madness by last men, and they would go voluntarily to the madhouseif they suffered from it. Think of the use of the word “paranoid” today!"},{"pageContent":"PART THREEImage [../images/img01_045.jpg]THE UNIVERSITY"},{"pageContent":"FROM SOCRATES’ APOLOGY TO HEIDEGGER’S REKTORATSREDEWhen I was fifteen years old I saw the University of Chicago for the first timeand somehow sensed that I had discovered my life. I had never before seen, or atleast had not noticed, buildings that were evidently dedicated to a higherpurpose, not to necessity or utility, not merely to shelter or manufacture ortrade, but to something that might be an end in itself. The Middle West was notknown for the splendor of its houses of worship or its monuments to politicalglory. There was little visible reminiscence of the spiritual heights with whichto solicit the imagination or the admiration of young people. The longing for Iknew not what suddenly found a response in the world outside.It was, surely, the fake Gothic buildings. In the course of my education I havelearned that they were fake, and that Gothic is not really my taste. But theypointed toward a road of learning that leads to the meeting place of the greats.There one finds examples of a sort not likely to be seen around one, withoutwhich one could neither recognize one’s own capacities nor know how wonderful itis to belong to the species. This imitation of styles of faraway lands and agesshowed an awareness of lack of, and a respect for, the substance expressed bythose styles. These buildings were a bow to the contemplative life by a nationaddicted more than any other to the active life. The pseudo-Gothic was muchridiculed, and nobody builds like that anymore. It is not authentic, not anexpression of what we are, so it was said. To me it was and remains anexpression of what we are. One wonders whether the culture critics had as goodan instinct about our spiritual needs as the vulgar rich who paid for thebuildings. This nation’s impulse is toward the future, and tradition seems moreof a shackle to it than an inspiration. Reminiscences and warnings from the pastare our only monitor as we careen along our path. Those despised millionaireswho set up a university in the midst of a city that seems devoted only to theAmerican goals paid tribute to what they had neglected, whether it was out of asense of what they themselves had missed, or out of bad conscience about whattheir lives were exclusively devoted to, or to satisfy the vanity of havingtheir names attached to the enterprise. (What feeds a man’s vanity teaches asmuch about him as anything.) Education was an American thing, and not onlytechnical education.For me the promise of these buildings was fully kept. From the moment I became astudent there, it seemed plausible to spend all my time thinking about what Iam, a theme that was interesting to me but had never appeared a proper orpossible subject of study. In high school I had seen many of the older boys andgirls go off to the state university to become doctors, lawyers, social workers,teachers, the whole variety of professions respectable in the little world inwhich I lived. The university was part of growing up, but it was not lookedforward to as a transforming experience—nor was it so in fact. No one believedthat there were serious ends of which we had not heard, or that there was a wayof studying our ends and determining their rank order. In short, philosophy wasonly a word, and literature a form of entertainment. Our high schools and theatmosphere around them put us in this frame of mind. But a great universitypresented another kind of atmosphere, announcing that there are questions thatought to be addressed by everyone but are not asked in ordinary life or expectedto be answered there. It provided an atmosphere of free inquiry, and thereforeexcluded what is not conducive to or is inimical to such inquiry. It made adistinction between what is important and not important. It protected thetradition, not because tradition is tradition but because tradition providesmodels of discussion on a uniquely high level. It contained marvels and madepossible friendships consisting in shared experiences of those marvels. Most ofall there was the presence of some authentically great thinkers who gave livingproof of the existence of the theoretical life and whose motives could noteasily be reduced to any of the baser ones people delight in thinking universal.They had authority, not based on power, money or family, but on natural giftsthat properly compel respect. The relations among them and between them andstudents were the revelation of a community in which there is a true commongood. In a nation founded on reason, the university was the temple of theregime, dedicated to the purest use of reason and evoking the kind of reverenceappropriate to an association of free and equal human beings.The years have taught me that much of this existed only in my youthful andenthusiastic imagination, but not so much as one might suppose. The institutionswere much more ambiguous than I could have suspected, and they have proved muchfrailer when caught in contrary winds than it seemed they would be. But I didsee real thinkers who opened up new worlds for me. The substance of my being hasbeen informed by the books I learned to care for. They accompany me every minuteof every day of my life, making me see much more and be much more than I couldhave seen or been if fortune had not put me into a great university at one ofits greatest moments. I have had teachers and students such as dreams are madeon. And most of all I have friends with whom I can share thinking about whatfriendship is, with whom there is a touching of souls and in whom works thatcommon good of which I have just spoken. All of this is, of course, mixed withthe weaknesses and uglinesses that life necessarily contains. None of it cancelsthe low in man. But it informs even that low. None of my disappointments withthe university—which is after all only a vehicle for contents in principleseparable from it—has ever made me doubt that the life it gave me was anythingother than the best one available to me. Never did I think that the universitywas properly ministerial to the society around it. Rather I thought and thinkthat society is ministerial to the university, and I bless a society thattolerates and supports an eternal childhood for some, a childhood whoseplayfulness can in turn be a blessing to society. Falling in love with the ideaof the university is not a folly, for only by means of it is one able to seewhat can be. Without it, all these wonderful results of the theoretical lifecollapse back into the primal slime from which they cannot re-emerge. The facileeconomic and psychological debunking of the theoretical life cannot do away withits irreducible beauties. But such debunking can obscure them, and has.TOCQUEVILLE ON DEMOCRATIC INTELLECTUAL LIFETocqueville taught me the importance of the university to democratic society.His noble book, Democracy in America, gave voice to my inchoate sentiments. Hisportrait of the “Intellectual Life of the Americans” is the mirror in which wecan see ourselves. But, because the broader perspective he brings is alien, wedo not immediately recognize ourselves. In my experience, students at first arebored by Tocqueville’s account of the American mind, but, if they are reallymade to pay attention, they are finally riveted and alarmed by it. No one likesto believe that what he can see is limited by circumstances, no matter howeasily he recognizes this fact in others. Tocqueville shows how a democraticregime causes a particular intellectual bent which, if not actively corrected,distorts the mind’s vision.The great democratic danger, according to Tocqueville, is enslavement to publicopinion. The claim of democracy is that every man decides for himself. The useof one’s natural faculties to determine for oneself what is true and false andgood and bad is the American philosophic method. Democracy liberates fromtradition, which in other kinds of regimes determines the judgment. Prejudicesof religion, class and family are leveled, not only in principle but also infact, because none of their representatives has an intellectual authority. Equalpolitical right makes it impossible for church or aristocracy to establish thebastions from which they can affect men’s opinions. Churchmen, for whom divinerevelation is the standard, aristocrats in whom the reverences for antiquity arepowerful, fathers who always tend to prefer the rights of the ancestral to thoseof reason, are all displaced in favor of the equal individual. Even if men seekauthority, they cannot find it where they used to find it in other regimes. Thusthe external impediments to the free exercise of reason have been removed indemocracy. Men are actually on their own in comparison to what they were inother regimes and with respect to the usual sources of opinion. This promotes ameasure of reason. However, since very few people school themselves in the useof reason beyond the calculation of self-interest encouraged by the regime, theyneed help on a vast number of issues—in fact, all issues, inasmuch as everythingis opened up to fresh and independent judgment—for the consideration of whichthey have neither time nor capacity. Even the self-interest about which theycalculate—the ends—may become doubtful. Some kind of authority is oftennecessary for most men and is necessary, at least sometimes, for all men. In theabsence of anything else to which to turn, the common beliefs of most men arealmost always what will determine judgment. This is just where tradition used tobe most valuable. Without being seduced by its undemocratic and antirationalmystique, tradition does provide a counterpoise to and a repair from the merelycurrent, and contains the petrified remains of old wisdom (along with much thatis not wisdom). The active presence of a tradition in a man’s soul gives him aresource against the ephemeral, the kind of resource that only the wise can findsimply within themselves. The paradoxical result of the liberation of reason isgreater reliance on public opinion for guidance, a weakening of independence.Altogether, reason is exposed at the center of the stage. Although every man indemocracy thinks himself individually the equal of every other man, this makesit difficult to resist the collectivity of equal men. If all opinions are equal,then the majority of opinions, on the psychological analogy of politics, shouldhold sway. It is very well to say that each should follow his own opinion, butsince consensus is required for social and political life, accommodation isnecessary. So, unless there is some strong ground for opposition to majorityopinion, it inevitably prevails. This is the really dangerous form of thetyranny of the majority, not the kind that actively persecutes minorities butthe kind that breaks the inner will to resist because there is no qualifiedsource of nonconforming principles and no sense of superior right. The majorityis all there is. What the majority decides is the only tribunal. It is not somuch its power that intimidates but its semblance of justice. Tocqueville foundthat Americans talked very much about individual right but that there was a realmonotony of thought and that vigorous independence of mind was rare. Even thosewho appear to be free-thinkers really look to a constituency and expect one dayto be part of a majority. They are creatures of public opinion as much as areconformists—actors of nonconformism in the theater of the conformists who admireand applaud nonconformity of certain kinds, the kinds that radicalize thealready dominant opinions.Reason’s exposedness in the rational regime is exacerbated by the absence ofclass in the old sense, based on principles or convictions of right. There is ageneral agreement about the most fundamental political principles, and thereforedoubts about them have no status. In aristocracies there was also the party ofthe people, but in democracy there is no aristocratic party. This means thatthere is no protection for the opponents of the governing principles as well asno respectability for them. There were in the past also parties representingecclesiastical interests against those of monarchs or aristocrats. These tooprovided a place for dissenting opinions to flourish. In the heat of ourpolitical squabbles we tend to lose sight of the fact that our differences ofprinciple are very small, compared to those over which men used to fight. Theonly quarrel in our history that really involved fundamental differences aboutfundamental principles was over slavery. But even the proponents of slaveryhardly dared assert that some human beings are made by nature to serve otherhuman beings, as did Aristotle; they had to deny the humanity of the blacks.Besides, that question was really already settled with the Declaration ofIndependence. Black slavery was an aberration that had to be extinguished, not apermanent feature of our national life. Not only slavery, but aristocracy,monarchy and theocracy were laid to rest by the Declaration and theConstitution. This was very good for our domestic tranquility, but not veryencouraging for theoretical doubts about triumphant equality. Not only were theold questions of political theorizing held to have been definitively answered,but the resources that nourished diversity concerning them were removed.Democratic conscience and the simple need to survive combine to suppress doubt.The kinds of questions that Tocqueville put to America—the answers to whichallowed him to affirm the justice of equality more reasonably and morepositively than most of us can do—came out of an experience that we cannot have:his direct experience of an alternative regime and temper of soul—aristocracy.If we cannot in any way have access to something like that experience, ourunderstanding of the range of human possibilities is impoverished, and ourcapacity to assess our strengths and weaknesses is diminished.To make that range of possibilities accessible, to overcome the regime’stendency to discourage appreciation of important alternatives, the universitymust come to the aid of unprotected and timid reason. The university is theplace where inquiry and philosophic openness come into their own. It is intendedto encourage the noninstrumental use of reason for its own sake, to provide theatmosphere where the moral and physical superiority of the dominant will notintimidate philosophic doubt. And it preserves the treasury of great deeds,great men and great thoughts required to nourish that doubt.Freedom of the mind requires not only, or not even especially, the absence oflegal constraints but the presence of alternative thoughts. The most successfultyranny is not the one that uses force to assure uniformity but the one thatremoves the awareness of other possibilities, that makes it seem inconceivablethat other ways are viable, that removes the sense that there is an outside. Itis not feelings or commitments that will render a man free, but thoughts,reasoned thoughts. Feelings are largely formed and informed by convention. Realdifferences come from difference in thought and fundamental principle. Much indemocracy conduces to the assault on awareness of difference.In the first place, as with all regimes, there is what might be called anofficial interpretation of the past that makes it appear defective or just astep on the way to the present regime. An example of this is the interpretationof Rome and the Roman empire in Augustine’s City of God. Rome is not forgotten,but it is remembered only through the lens of victorious Christianity andtherefore poses no challenge to it.Second, sycophancy toward those who hold power is a fact in every regime, andespecially in a democracy, where, unlike tyranny, there is an accepted principleof legitimacy that breaks the inner will to resist, and where, as I have said,there is no legitimate power other than the people to which a man can turn.Repugnance at the power of the people, at the fact that the popular taste shouldrule in all arenas of life, is very rare in a modern democracy. One of theintellectual charms of Marxism is that it explains the injustice or philistinismof the people in such a way as to exculpate the people, who are said to bemanipulated by corrupt elites. Thus a Marxist is able to criticize the presentwithout isolating himself from present and future. Almost no one wants to facethe possibility that “bourgeois vulgarity” might really be the nature of thepeople, always and everywhere. Flattery of the people and incapacity to resistpublic opinion are the democratic vices, particularly among writers, artists,journalists and anyone else who is dependent on an audience. Hostility andexcessive contempt for the people is the vice of aristocracies, and is hardlyour problem. Aristocracies hate and fear demagogues most of all, whiledemocracies in their pure form hate and fear “elitists” most of all, becausethey are unjust, i.e., they do not accept the leading principle of justice inthose regimes. Hence each regime discounts those who are most likely torecognize and compensate for its political and intellectual propensities, whileit admires those who encourage them. But, to repeat, this tendency is more acutein democracy because of the absence of a nondemocratic class. In every regimethere is a people; there is not necessarily any other class.Third, the democratic concentration on the useful, on the solution of what arebelieved by the populace at large to be the most pressing problems, makestheoretical distance seem not only useless but immoral. When there is poverty,disease and war, who can claim the right to idle in Epicurean gardens, askingquestions that have already been answered and keeping a distance wherecommitment is demanded? The for-its-own-sake is alien to the modern democraticspirit, particularly in matters intellectual. Whenever there is a crunch,democratic men devoted to thought have a crisis of conscience, have to find away to interpret their endeavors by the standard of utility, or otherwise tendto abandon or deform them. This tendency is enhanced by the fact that inegalitarian society practically nobody has a really grand opinion of himself, orhas been nurtured in a sense of special right and a proud contempt for themerely necessary. Aristotle’s great-souled man, who loves beautiful and uselessthings, is not a democratic type. Such a man loves honor but despises it becausehe knows he deserves better, whereas democratic vanity defines itself by thehonors it seeks and can get. The lover of beautiful and useless things is farfrom being a philosopher—at least as far as is the lover of the useful, who islikely to be more reasonable—but he has the advantage of despising many of thesame things the philosopher does and is likely to admire the philosopher for hisvery uselessness, as an adornment. Great and unusual undertakings are morenatural to him than to the lover of the useful, and he believes in and reveresmotives that are denied existence by utilitarian psychology. He can take forgranted the things that are the ends of most men’s strivings—money and status.He is free, and must look for other fulfillments, unless he spends, as in thedemocratic view he should do, his life helping others to get what he alreadyhas. Knowing as fulfillment in itself rather than as task required for otherfulfillments is immediately intelligible to him. Finality as opposed toinstrumentality, and happiness as opposed to the pursuit of happiness, appeal tothe aristocratic temperament. All of this is salutary for the intellectual life,and none of it is endemic to democracy.Thus the mere announcement of the rule of reason does not create the conditionsfor the full exercise of rationality, and in removing the impediments to it someof its supports are also dismantled. Reason is only one part of the soul’seconomy and requires a balance of the other parts in order to function properly.The issue is whether the passions are its servitors, or whether it is thehandmaiden of the passions. The latter interpretation, which is Hobbes’s, playsan important role in the development of modern democracy and is a depreciationas well as an appreciation of reason. Older, more traditional orders that do notencourage the free play of reason contain elements reminiscent of the nobler,philosophic interpretation of reason and help to prevent its degradation. Thoseelements are connected with the piety that prevails in such orders. They conveya certain reverence for the higher, a respect for the contemplative life,understood as contemplation of God and the peak of devotion, and a cleaving toeternal beings that mitigates absorption in the merely pressing or current.These are images of philosophic magnificence—which, it must be stressed, aredistortions of the original, and can be its bitterest enemies, but whichpreserve the order of the cosmos and of the soul from which philosophy begins.Tocqueville describes this marvelously well in his moving account of Pascal,whom he evidently regards as the most perfect of men. The possibility of such ahuman type, the theoretical type, is, according to Tocqueville, most threatenedin democracy, and it must be vigorously defended if humanity is not to begrievously impoverished. Much of the theoretical reflection that flourishes inmodern democracy could be interpreted as egalitarian resentment against thehigher type represented by Pascal, denigrating it, deforming it and interpretingit out of existence. Marxism and Freudianism reduce his motives to those all menhave. Historicism denies him access to eternity. Value theory makes hisreasoning irrelevant. If he were to appear, our eyes would be blind to hissuperiority, and we would be spared the discomfort it would cause us.It is to prevent or cure this peculiar democratic blindness that the universitymay be said to exist in a democracy, not for the sake of establishing anaristocracy but for the sake of democracy and for the sake of preserving thefreedom of the mind—certainly one of the most important freedoms—for someindividuals within it. The successful university is the proof that a society canbe devoted to the well-being of all, without stunting human potential orimprisoning the mind to the goals of the regime. The deepest intellectualweakness of democracy is its lack of taste or gift for the theoretical life. Allour Nobel prizes and the like do nothing to gainsay Tocqueville’s appraisal inthis regard. The issue is not whether we possess intelligence but whether we areadept at reflection of the broadest and deepest kind. We need constant remindersof our deficiency, now more than in the past. The great European universitiesused to act as our intellectual conscience, but with their decline, we are onour own. Nothing prevents us from thinking too well of ourselves. It isnecessary that there be an unpopular institution in our midst that sets clarityabove well-being or compassion, that resists our powerful urges and temptations,that is free of all snobbism but has standards. Those standards are in the firstplace accessible to us from the best of the past, although they must be such asto admit of the new, if it actually meets those standards. If nothing new doesmeet them, it is not a disaster. The ages of great spiritual fertility are rareand provide nourishment for other less fertile ones. What would be a disasterwould be to lose the inspiration of those ages and have nothing to replace itwith. This would make it even more unlikely that the rarest talents could findexpression among us. The Bible and Homer exercised their influence for thousandsof years, preserved in the mainstream or in backwaters, hardly ever beingsurpassed in power, without becoming irrelevant because they did not suit thetemper of the times or the spirit of a regime. They provided the way out as wellas the model for reform.The university’s task is thus well defined, if not easy to carry out or evenkeep in mind. It is, in the first place, always to maintain the permanentquestions front and center. This it does primarily by preserving—by keepingalive—the works of those who best addressed these questions. In the Middle Ages,Aristotle was very much present in the minds of the leading elements of society.He was used as an authority almost on a level with the Church Fathers and wasassimilated to them. This was, of course, an abuse of Aristotle, who thoughtthat authority is the contrary of philosophy. His own teaching ought always tobe approached with questions and doubts, not faith. The essence of philosophy isthe abandonment of all authority in favor of individual human reason.Nevertheless, Aristotle was there, his moderate and sensible views had an effecton the world, and he could be a guide to those who came to have philosophicdoubt. In our time, freedom from authority and the independence of reason arecommonplaces. Aristotle, however, instead of being properly used—now that wehave the proper disposition—has to all intents and purposes disappeared. Wewould hardly be able to use Aristotle, as did Hegel, to grasp the character ofmodernity. Instead we are more and more restricted to the narrow experience ofthe here and now, with a consequent loss of perspective. The disappearance ofAristotle has much less to do with his intrinsic qualities than with a politicaldistaste for him, joined with the lack of intellectual discipline that resultsfrom a sense of self-sufficiency. Reason has become a prejudice for us. Rousseaunoted that in his time many men were liberals who a century earlier would havebeen religious fanatics. He concluded that they were not really reasonable, but,rather, conformists. Reason transformed into prejudice is the worst form ofprejudice, because reason is the only instrument for liberation from prejudice.The most important function of the university in an age of reason is to protectreason from itself, by being the model of true openness.Hence, without having the answers, the university knows what openness is andknows the questions. It also knows the regime within which it lives, and thekinds of threats this regime poses to its activity. In a democracy it risks lessby opposing the emergent, the changing and the ephemeral than by embracing them,because the society is already open to them, without monitoring what it acceptsor sufficiently respecting the old. There the university risks less by havingintransigently high standards than by trying to be too inclusive, because thesociety tends to blur standards in the name of equality. It also risks less byconcentrating on the heroic than by looking to the commonplace, because thesociety levels. In an aristocracy the university would probably have to go in adirection opposite to the one taken in a democracy in order to liberate reason.But in an aristocracy the university is a less important institution than in ademocratic society, because there are other centers for the life of the mind,whereas in a democracy there is practically no other center, practically no wayof life, calling or profession, that requires or encourages or even permitscultivation. This is increasingly the case in the late twentieth century. Theuniversity as an institution must compensate for what individuals lack in ademocracy and must encourage its members to participate in its spirit. As therepository of the regime’s own highest faculty and principle, it must have astrong sense of its importance outside the system of equal individuality. Itmust be contemptuous of public opinion because it has within it the source ofautonomy—the quest for and even discovery of the truth according to nature. Itmust concentrate on philosophy, theology, the literary classics, and on thosescientists like Newton, Descartes, and Leibniz who have the most comprehensivescientific vision and a sense of the relation of what they do to the order ofthe whole of things. These must help preserve what is most likely to beneglected in a democracy. They are not dogmatisms but precisely the opposite:what is necessary to fight dogmatism. The university must resist the temptationto try to do everything for society. The university is only one interest amongmany and must always keep its eye on that interest for fear of compromising itin the desire to be more useful, more relevant, more popular.The university’s task is illustrated by two tendencies of the democratic mind towhich Tocqueville points. One is abstractness. Because there is no tradition andmen need guidance, general theories that are produced in a day and not properlygrounded in experience, but seem to explain things and are useful crutches forfinding one’s way in a complicated world, have currency. Marxism, Freudianism,economism, behavioralism, etc., are examples of this tendency, and there aregreat rewards for those who purvey them. The very universality of democracy andthe sameness of man presupposed by it encourage this tendency and make themind’s eye less sensitive to differences. All the terms discussed in Part Twoare evidences of this abstractness, simulacra of thought and experience, hardlybetter than slogans, which take the place of reflection. In aristocracies mentake the experiences of their nations as unique and superior and tend not togeneralize, but rather to forget the natural community of men and theuniversality of thought. But they do really pay attention to their experiences,to the diversity of phenomena that is homogenized by abstract “mind-sets.” Thisis another thing the democratic university must learn from aristocracies. Ourtemptation is to prefer the shiny new theory to the fully cognized experience.Even our famous empiricism is more of a theory than an openness to experience.Producing theories is not theorizing, or a sign of the theoretical life.Concreteness, not abstractness, is the hallmark of philosophy. All interestinggeneralization must proceed from the richest awareness of what is to beexplained, but the tendency to abstractness leads to simplifying the phenomenain order more easily to deal with them.If, for example, one sees only gain as a motive in men’s actions, then it iseasy to explain them. One simply abstracts from what is really there. After awhile one notices nothing other than the postulated motives. To the extent thatmen begin to believe in the theory, they no longer believe that there are othermotives in themselves. And when social policy is based on such a theory, finallyone succeeds in producing men who fit the theory. When this is occurring or hasoccurred, what is most needed is the capacity to recover the original nature ofman and his motives, to see what does not fit the theory. Hobbes’s mercenaryaccount of the virtues, which won out in psychology, needs to be contrasted withAristotle’s account, which preserves the independent nobility of the virtues.Hobbes was thinking of Aristotle, which we never do, when he developed histeaching. In order to restore what was really a debate, and thereby restore thephenomenon man, one must read Aristotle and Hobbes together and look at whateach saw in man. Then one has the material on which to reflect. For modern menwho live in a world transformed by abstractions and who have themselves beentransformed by abstractions, the only way to experience man again is by thinkingthese abstractions through with the help of thinkers who did not share them andwho can lead us to experiences that are difficult or impossible to have withouttheir help.A related problem is a tendency in the social sciences to prefer deterministicexplanations of events to those that see them as results of human deliberationand choice. Tocqueville explains this tendency as a consequence of the impotenceof the individual in egalitarian society. Curiously, in democracy, the freest ofsocieties, men turn out to be more willing to accept doctrines that tell themthat they are determined, that is, not free. No one by himself seems to be able,or have the right, to control events, which appear to be moved by impersonalforces. In aristocracies, on the other hand, individuals born to high positionhave too great a sense of their control over what they appear to command, aresure of their freedom and despise everything that might seem to determine them.Neither the aristocratic nor democratic sentiment about the causes of events issimply adequate. In a democracy where men already think they are weak, they aretoo open to theories that teach that they are weak, which, by making individualsthink that controlling action is impossible, have the effect of weakening themfurther. The antidote is again the classic, the heroic—Homer, Plutarch. At theoutset they appear hopelessly naive to us. But it is our sophisticated naivetéthat makes us think that. Churchill was inspired by his ancestor Marlborough,and his confidence in his own action is inconceivable without the encouragementprovided by that model. Marlborough said that Shakespeare was essential to hiseducation. And Shakespeare learned a large part of what he knew aboutstatesmanship from Plutarch. This is the intellectual genealogy of modernheroes. The democratic revolution of the mind extinguishes such old family linesand replaces them with decision-making theory, in which there is no category forstatesmanship, let alone heroes.To sum up, there is one simple rule for the university’s activity: it need notconcern itself with providing its students with experiences that are availablein democratic society. They will have them in any event. It must provide themwith experiences they cannot have there. Tocqueville did not believe that theold writers were perfect, but he believed that they could best make us aware ofour imperfections, which is what counts for us.The universities never performed this function very well. Now they havepractically ceased trying.THE RELATION BETWEEN THOUGHT AND CIVIL SOCIETYAlthough universities go back very far, the university as we know it, in itscontent and its aim, is the product of the Enlightenment. To enlighten is tobring light where there had previously been darkness, to replace opinion, i.e.,superstition, by scientific knowledge of nature, beginning from phenomenaavailable to all men and ending in rational demonstration possible for all men.All things must be investigated and understood by reason, i.e., science orphilosophy (the distinction between the two is of recent origin, coming tocurrency only in the nineteenth century). Knowledge of the nature of all thingsis Enlightenment’s goal. The past was characterized not by ignorance but byfalse opinions. Men always had opinions about everything, but those opinionswere without ground and indemonstrable. Yet they governed the nations of men andwere authoritative. Thus the problem of Enlightenment is not merely discovery ofthe truth but the conflict between the truth and the beliefs of men, which areincorporated into the law. Enlightenment begins from the tension between whatmen are compelled to believe by city and religion, on the one hand, and thequest for scientific truth on the other. To think and speak doubts about, letalone to propose substitutes for, the fundamental opinions was forbidden byevery regime previously known to man. Doing so was thought to be, and in factwas, disloyal and impious.Of course, the men of the Enlightenment were not the first to recognize thistension. It had existed and been known to exist since science emerged in Greecesometime between the eighth and sixth centuries B.C. Enlightenment thinkers wereaware that there had been surpassingly great philosophers, mathematicians,astronomers and political scientists from that time on, who had sufferedpersecutions and been compelled to live on the fringes of society. Theinnovation of the Enlightenment was the attempt to reduce that tension and toalter the philosopher’s relation to civil society. The learned society and theuniversity, the publicly respected and supported communities ofscientists—setting their own rules, pursuing knowledge according to the innerdictates of science, as opposed to civil or ecclesiastical authority,communicating freely among themselves—are the visible signs of that innovation.The earlier thinkers accepted the tension and lived accordingly. Their knowledgewas essentially for themselves, and they had a private life very different fromtheir public life. They were themselves concerned with getting from the darknessto the light. Enlightenment was a daring attempt to shine that light on all men,partly for the sake of all men, partly for the sake of the progress of science.The success of this attempt depended on scientists’ freedom to associate withand speak to one another. And freedom could be won only if the rulers believedthat the scientists were not a threat to them. Enlightenment was not only, orperhaps not even primarily, a scientific project but a political one. It beganfrom the premise that the rulers could be educated, a premise not held by theEnlightenment’s ancient brethren.This project was a conspiracy, as d’Alembert said in the Preliminary Discourseof l’Encyclopédie, the premier document of the Enlightenment. It had to be, for,in order to have rulers who are reasonable, many of the old rulers had to bereplaced, in particular all those whose authority rested upon revelation. Thepriests were the enemies, for they rejected the claim of reason and basedpolitics and morals on sacred text and ecclesiastical authorities. Thephilosophers appeared to deny the very existence of God, or at least of theChristian God. The old order was founded on Christianity, and free use of reasonsimply could not be permitted within it, since reason accepts no authority aboveitself and is necessarily subversive. There was a public struggle for the rightto rule; for, in spite of the modest demeanor of the philosophers, they at thevery least require rulers who are favorable to them, who have chosen reason. Theright to freedom of thought is a political right, and for it to exist, theremust be a political order that accepts that right.In other words, an argument had to be made that the free pursuit of science isgood for society, in order to persuade the most powerful element of society andthus guarantee the protection of that pursuit. In a simple formula, it had to beshown that the progress of knowledge was parallel to political progress. This isby no means a self-evident proposition, as anyone who has read Rousseau’sDiscourse on the Arts and Sciences, a powerful attack on it, knows. But it isthe leading principle of Enlightenment and the ultimate ground of the prejudicethat most people have in favor of freedom of thought and inquiry. I sayprejudice because the reasons have almost been forgotten, and other kinds ofthought hostile to freedom of thought are current. The old order offered rootsand salvation, and the very latest thought is marked by nostalgia for that oldorder. The Enlightenment thinkers proposed a political science that could beused by founders, such as in America, in establishing principles andarrangements for a sounder and more efficient politics, and a natural sciencethat could master nature in order to satisfy men’s needs. These promises arewhat make reason not only acceptable within civil society but even central toit. A society based on reason needs those who reason best. The scientists wereto be the most respected of men, taking the place of kings and prelates, becausethey are the evident sources of the good things for life, liberty and thepursuit of property. It was not precisely replacing one faith by another,because the new science, if it cannot be practiced by just anyone, can beunderstood by anyone, if he is trained in its method, and knowledge of therights and duties of man requires the use of his reason.The Enlightenment was a daring enterprise. Its goal was to reconstitutepolitical and intellectual life totally under the supervision of philosophy andscience. No conqueror, prophet or founder ever had a broader vision, and nonehad more stunning success. There is practically no contemporary regime that isnot somehow a result of Enlightenment, and the best of the modernregimes—liberal democracy—is entirely its product. And throughout the world allmen and all regimes are dependent on and recognize the science popularized bythe Enlightenment. The Enlightenment inexorably defeated all opponents ittargeted at the outset, particularly the priests and all that depends on them,by a long process of education that taught men, as Machiavelli put it, about“the things of this world.” One need only read Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations,Book V, on education, to see how the reform of universities, particularly theovercoming of the theological influence, was essential to the emergence ofmodern political economy and the regime founded on it. Thus the academies anduniversities are the core of liberal democracy, its foundation, the repositoryof its animating principles and the continuing source of the knowledge andeducation keeping the machinery of the regime in motion.The regime of equality and liberty, of the rights of man, is the regime ofreason. The free university exists only in liberal democracy, and liberaldemocracies exist only where there are free universities. Marxists are right tosay that the “bourgeois university” is essentially related to “bourgeoissociety,” but not in the sense they intend. The university does not defend thatsociety because the university merely reflects its interests, but because thebalance of forces within this kind of society is such as most to need, respectand, hence, protect, freedom of thought. Earlier associations of thinkers wereunder theological-political supervision by unquestioned right. Fascism rejectedreason and controlled the universities. When Hitler came to power, Karl Schmittsaid, “Today Hegel died in Germany.” Hegel was arguably the greatest universityman there ever was. And communism asserts that the people, under the guise ofthe vanguard party, has become rational, so that the university no longer needsa special status—i.e., it can be controlled by the Party. Only in liberaldemocracy is the primacy of reason accepted, even though its citizenry is notunderstood to be simply and always reasonable. It assures a special status forthe university, an exemption from the ordinary moral and political limitationson what can be thought and said in civil society. The university is not thebeneficiary of the freedom of thought accorded to all the members of society.All to the contrary, in the original project of modern society, the generalfreedom of thought was believed to be desirable in order to support the kind ofthought proper to philosophers and scientists, which alone strictly deserves thename of “thought.” At the outset the primary freedom was freedom of thought,both because reason is the highest faculty and because it is most necessary tothe good society. Hobbes, Descartes, Spinoza, Bacon, Locke and Newton had to befree to think and propagate what they learned if there was to be a new kind ofsociety, a new dispensation for mankind.The very special status of what came to be called academic freedom has graduallybeen eroded, and there hardly remains an awareness of what it means. There isbarely a difference recognized in popular and even university consciousnessbetween academic freedom and job security guaranteed by government, business orunions. It has become assimilated to the economic system and looks likeself-interest of a kind that is sometimes approved of and sometimes disapprovedof. The rights of science are now not distinguishable from the rights of thoughtin general, of any description whatsoever. Freedom of speech has given way tofreedom of expression, in which the obscene gesture enjoys the same protectedstatus as demonstrative discourse. It is all very wonderful; everything hasbecome free, and no invidious distinctions need to be made. But it is too goodto be true. All that has really happened is that reason has been knocked off itsperch, is less influential and more vulnerable as it joins the crowd of lessworthy claims to the attention and support of civil society. The semitheoreticalattacks of Right and Left on the university and its knowledge, the increaseddemands made on it by society, the enormous expansion of higher education, havecombined to obscure what is most important about the university.The original intention of the reformed academies and universities was to providea publicly respectable place—and a means of support—for theoretical men, of whomat best there are only a few in any nation, to meet, exchange their thoughts andtrain young persons in the ways of science. The academies and universities wereto be engines in the progress of science. The right that reformers attempted toestablish was for scientists to be unhindered in the use of their reason, in theareas in which they are competent, to solve the problems posed by nature. Reasonand competence are to be underlined here. “Intellectual honesty,” “commitment”and that kind of thing have nothing to do with the university, belong in thearenas of religious and political struggle, only get in the way of theuniversity’s activity, and open it to suspicion and criticism of which it has noneed. Freedom of thought and freedom of speech were proposed in theory, and inthe practice of serious political reformers, in order to encourage the stillvoice of reason in a world that had always been dominated by fanaticisms andinterests. How freedom of thought and speech came to mean the specialencouragement and protection of fanaticism and interests is another of thosemiracles connected with the decay of the ideal of the rational political order.The authors of The Federalist hoped their scheme of government would result inthe preponderance of reason and rational men in the United States. They were notparticularly concerned with protecting eccentric or mad opinions or life-styles.Such protection, which we now often regard as the Founders’ central intention,is only an incidental result of the protection of reason, and it losesplausibility if reason is rejected. These authors did not respect the manyreligious sects or desire diversity for its own sake. The existence of manysects was permitted only to prevent the emergence of a single dominant one.The moment of the Enlightenment’s success seems also to have been the beginningof its decay. The obscuring of its intention as a result of its democratizationis symptomatic of the inner difficulties of its project. That project entailedfreedom for the rare theoretical men to engage in rational inquiry in the smallnumber of disciplines that treat the first principles of all things. Thisrequires an atmosphere where the voice of reason is not drowned by the loudvoices of the various “commitments” prevailing in political life. Knowledge isthe goal; competence and reason are required of those who pursue it. Thedisciplines are philosophy, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and thescience of man, meaning a political science that discerns the nature of man andthe ends of government. This is the academy. Dependent on it are a number ofapplied sciences—particularly engineering, medicine and law—that are lower indignity and derivative in knowledge, but produce the fruits of science thatbenefit the unscientific and make them respectful of science. Thus the advantageof the knowers, who want to pursue knowledge, and that of those who do not know,those who want to pursue their well-being, are served simultaneously,establishing a harmony between them. And thus the age-old gulf separating thewise from those who hold power is bridged, and the problem of the wise in civilsociety is solved. The project was a unity reflecting the unity of theintelligible order of nature, its parts organized according to the order of theparts of the whole, joined together finally in a survey of the articulated wholemade by the culminating science—philosophy.This project has lost its unity and is in crisis. Reason is unable to establishits unity, to decide what should be in it, to divide up the intellectual labor.It floats without compass or rudder.If the university is indeed the product of the Enlightenment and is its visiblepresence in modern democracy, and if Enlightenment was a political project thatundertook to alter the age-old character of the relation between wisdom andpower, knowledge and society, it might be suspected that the crisis of knowledgethat has become politically useful—i.e., the crisis of the university—and thecrisis of liberal democracy, the political order dependent on knowledge, havesomething to do with the new relationship between the two promoted byEnlightenment.I have included among the Enlightenment philosophers men like Machiavelli,Bacon, Montaigne, Hobbes, Descartes, Spinoza and Locke, along with theeighteenth-century thinkers like Montesquieu, Diderot and Voltaire, whoseteachings are usually held to constitute the Enlightenment, because these latterwere quite explicit about their debt to the originators of what theEnlightenment was in large measure only popularizing. The men of theEnlightenment proper were the first whose teachings were addressed not only, orprimarily, to other philosophers or potential philosophers of the same rank, andwho were concerned not only with those who understand but also with changing theopinions of mankind at large. Enlightenment was the first philosophicallyinspired “movement,” a theoretical school that is a political force at the sametime. The very word Enlightenment conveys this mixture of elements, as doesMarxism, whereas Platonism and Epicureanism refer strictly to theories—which mayhave had this or that effect but whose essence is only theoretical. AlthoughPlato and Aristotle had political philosophies, there is no regime to which onecan point as a Platonic or an Aristotelian regime, in the sense that eitherthinker had founded the movement or party that actually established the regime.But Enlightenment is certainly responsible for liberal democracy, as is Marxismfor communism. Intellectual historians have frequently been too impressed bythese recent events in philosophy and politics to recognize how recent they are,that they constitute a new phenomenon in both domains, and that what is mostprofound and interesting about Enlightenment is its radical and self-consciousbreak with the philosophical tradition in the mode and degree of its politicalactivity.The Enlightenment thinkers understood themselves to be making a most daringinnovation: according to Machiavelli, modern philosophy was to be politicallyeffective, while Plato and Aristotle, and all the ancients who followed themsince Socrates founded political philosophy were politically ineffective.Machiavelli claimed that he taught the effective truth, and he and practicallyall those who followed him endeavored to be politically effective. Machiavellifollows Callicles in Plato’s Gorgias, who ridicules Socrates for being unable todefend himself, to avert insults or slaps in the face. The vulnerability of thephilosopher would seem to be the starting place for the new reflection and therenewal of philosophy. This may seem trivial to many today, but the entirephilosophic tradition, ancient and modern, took the relation of mind to societyas the most fruitful beginning point for understanding the human situation.Certainly the first philosophy of which we have a full account begins with thetrial and execution of the philosopher. And Machiavelli, the inspirer of thegreat philosophical systems of modernity, starts from this vulnerability ofreason within the political order and makes it his business to correct it.Some might say it was not concern with the fate of philosophers but the wish, inBacon’s phrase, to ease man’s estate that motivated the modern thinkers. This,however, comes down to the same thing—a criticism of the ancient philosophersfor their impotence, and a reflection on the relation of knowledge to civilsociety. The ancients were always praising virtue, but men were not made morevirtuous as a result. Everywhere there were rotten regimes, tyrants persecutingpeoples, rich exploiting poor, nobles keeping down commoners, men insufficientlyprotected by laws or arms, etc. Wise men saw clearly what was wrong in all this,but their wisdom did not generate power to do anything about it. The newphilosophy claimed to have discovered the means to reform society and to securethe theoretical life. If the two purposes were not identical, they were intendedto be complementary.It must be remembered that this was a dispute within philosophy and that therewas an agreement among the parties to it about what philosophy is. The modernslooked to and disagreed with the Greek philosophers and their heirs, the Romanphilosophers. But they shared the view that philosophy, and with it what we callscience, came to be in Greece and had never, so far as is known, come to beelsewhere. Philosophy is the rational account of the whole, or of nature. Natureis a notion that itself is of Greek origin and requisite to science. Theprinciple of contradiction guided the discourse of all, and the modernspresented reasoned arguments against those of their predecessors with whom theydisagreed. The moderns simply took over a large part of ancient astronomy andmathematics. And they, above all, agreed that the philosophic life is thehighest life. Their quarrel is not like the differences between Moses andSocrates, or Jesus and Lucretius, where there is no common universe ofdiscourse, but more like the differences between Newton and Einstein. It is astruggle for the possession of rationalism by rationalists. This fact is lostsight of, partly because scholasticism, the use of Aristotle by the RomanCatholic Church, was the phantom of philosophy within the old order that wasviolently attacked by the modern philosophers, more out of antitheological irethan by dislike of ancient philosophy. Another reason why the essentialagreement between ancients and moderns is no longer clear is the modern scienceof intellectual history, which tends to see all differences of opinion asdifferences of “worldview,” which blurs the distinction between disagreementsfounded on reason and those founded on faith.The very term Enlightenment is connected with Plato’s most powerful image aboutthe relation between thinker and society, the cave. In the Republic, Socratespresents men as prisoners in a dark cave, bound and forced to look at a wallagainst which are projected images that they take to be the beings and that arefor them the only reality. Freedom for man means escaping the bonds, civilsociety’s conventions, leaving the cave and going up to where the sunilluminates the beings and seeing them as they really are. Contemplating them isat once freedom, truth and the greatest pleasure. Socrates’ presentation ismeant to show that we begin from deceptions, or myths, but that it is possibleto aspire to a nonconventional world, to nature, by the use of reason. The falseopinions can be corrected, and their inner contradictions impel thoughtful mento seek the truth. Education is the movement from darkness to light. Reasonprojected on to the beings about which at first we only darkly opine producesenlightenment.The moderns accepted that reason can comprehend the beings, that there is alight to which science aspires. The entire difference between ancients andmoderns concerns the cave, or nonmetaphorically, the relation between knowledgeand civil society. Socrates never suggests that, even in the unlikely event thatphilosophers should be kings and possess absolute wisdom, the nature of the cavecould be altered or that a civil society, a people, a dēmos, could do withoutfalse opinions. The philosophers who returned to the cave would recognize thatwhat others take to be reality is only image, but they could not make any butthe happy few able to see the beings as they really are. They would guide thecity reasonably, but in their absence the city would revert to unreason. Or toput it in another way, the unwise could not recognize the wise. Men like Baconand Descartes, by contrast, thought that it was possible to make all menreasonable, to change what had always and everywhere been the case.Enlightenment meant to shine the light of being in the cave and forever to dimthe images on the wall. Then there would be unity between the people and thephilosopher. The whole issue turns on whether the cave is intractable, as Platothought, or can be changed by a new kind of education, as the greatestphilosophic figures of the seventeenth and eighteenth century taught.As Plato tells us, Socrates was charged with impiety, of not holding the samegods the city held, and he was found guilty. Plato always presents Socrates asthe archetypical philosopher. The events of Socrates’ life, the problems hefaced, represent what the philosopher as such must face. The Apology tells usthat the political problem for the philosopher is the gods. It makes clear thatthe images on the wall of the cave about which men will not brook contradictionrepresent the gods. Socrates’ reaction to the accusation is not to assert theright of academic freedom to pursue investigations into the things in theheavens and under the earth. He accepts the city’s right to demand his belief.His defense, not very convincing, is that he is not a subversive. He asserts thegreat dignity of philosophy and tries as much as possible to reduce the gapbetween it and good citizenship. In other words, he temporizes or is insincere.His defense cannot be characterized as “intellectually honest” and is not quiteto contemporary taste. He only wants to be left alone as much as possible, butis fully aware that a man who doubts what every good citizen is supposed to knowand spends his life sitting around talking about virtue, rather than doingvirtuous deeds, comes into conflict with the city. Characteristically, Socrateslives with the essential conflicts and illustrates them, rather than trying toabolish them. In the Republic he attempts to unite citizenship with philosophy.The only possible solution is for philosophers to rule, so there would be noopposition between the city’s commands and what philosophy requires, or betweenpower and wisdom. But this outline of a solution is ironic and impossible. Itonly serves to show what one must live with. The regime of philosopher-kings isusually ridiculed and regarded as totalitarian, but it contains much of what wereally want. Practically everyone wants reason to rule, and no one thinks a manlike Socrates should be ruled by inferiors or have to adjust what he thinks tothem. What the Republic actually teaches is that none of this is possible andthat our situation requires both much compromise and much intransigence, greatrisks and few hopes. The important thing is not speaking one’s own mind, butfinding a way to have one’s own mind.Contrary to common opinion, it is Enlightenment that was intent on philosophers’ruling, taking Socrates’ ironies seriously. If they did not have the title ofking, their political schemes were, all the same, designed to be put intopractice. And they were put into practice, not by begging princes to listen tothem but by philosophy’s generating sufficient power to force princes to giveway. The rule of philosophy is recognized in the insistence that regimes beconstructed to protect the rights of man. The anger we experience on readingSocrates’ censorship of the poets is unself-conscious, if we agree, as wewilly-nilly do, that children must be taught the scientific method prior to anyclaims of the imagination on their belief or conduct. Enlightenment educationreally does what Socrates only tentatively proposes. Socrates, at least, triesto preserve poetry, whereas Enlightenment is almost indifferent to its fate. Thefact that we think there should be poetry classes as well as education inreasoning helps us to miss the point: What happens to poetic imagination whenthe soul has been subjected to a rigorous discipline that resists poetry’sgreatest charms? The Enlightenment thinkers were very clear on this point. Thereis no discontinuity in the tradition about it. They were simply solving theproblem to the advantage of reason, as Socrates wished it could be solved butthought it could not. Enlightenment is Socrates respected and free to study whathe wants, and thereby it is civil society reconstituted. In the Apology,Socrates, who lives in thousandfold poverty because he neither works nor hasinherited, proposes with ultimate insolence that he be fed at public expense atcity hall. But what is the modern university, with its pay and tenure, otherthan a free lunch for philosophy and scientists?Moreover, the Enlightenment’s explicit effort to remove the religious passionfrom politics, resulting in distinctions like that between church and state, ismotivated by the wish to prevent the highest principle in political life frombeing hostile to reason. This is the intention in the Republic of Socrates’reform of the stories about the gods told by the poets. Nothing that denies theprinciple of contradiction is allowed to be authoritative, for that is the reefagainst which Socrates foundered. But Socrates did not think that church andstate could be separated. He would have treated both terms as artificial. Thegods are believed to be the founders of every city and are its most importantbeings. He would not have dared to banish them in defense of himself.The Enlightenment thinkers took on his case and carried on a war against thecontinuing threat to science posed by first causes that are irrational or beyondreason. The gradual but never perfect success of that war turns the desire to bereasonable into the right to be reasonable, into academic freedom. In theprocess, political life was rebuilt in ways that have proved intolerable to manystatesmen and thinkers, and have gradually led to the reintroduction of religionand the irrational in new and often terrifying guises. This is what Socrateswould have feared.But here I am only indicating the unity of the tradition, that Enlightenment isan attempt to give political status to what Socrates represents. The academy andthe university are the institutions that incorporate the Socratic spirit more orless well. Yet the existence of these institutions underlines at the same timehow they differ from Socrates, who founded no institutions and had only friends.And the attacks on these institutions made first by Rousseau and then byNietzsche are attacks on Socratic rationalism made in a Socratic spirit. Thehistory of Western thought and learning can be encapsulated in the fate ofSocrates, beginning with Plato defending him, passing through the Enlightenmentinstitutionalizing him, and ending with Nietzsche accusing on him. Thecherishing, for two and a half millennia, of the memory of this man, who was putto death by the city for philosophizing, ends with his spiritual execution inthe name of culture at the hands of the latest of the great philosophers. Bothcity and culture are authorized by the sacred.The meditation on Socrates is the inspiring theme of philosophy from Plato andAristotle, through Farabi and Maimonides, Machiavelli, Bacon, Descartes,Spinoza, Locke, Rousseau and Hegel, to Nietzsche and Heidegger. Socrates is thecomplementary man whose enigmatic being leads to reflection on the nature of theknowers.THE PHILOSOPHIC EXPERIENCEThe character of the experience Socrates represents is important because it isthe soul of the university. That experience and the relation to civil society ofthose who have it—which is the general formula for the problem of theuniversity—is the continuous theme of Plato’s and Xenophon’s writings, whichgive us a flesh-and-blood Socrates, presenting the ambiguous material forjudging him ourselves, showing us how such a man lives, the questions he raises,the different kinds of friends he has, his relations to the rulers, the laws andthe gods, and the effects he has on the world around him. This forces us to ask,for example, what influence Socrates’ humiliation of the political men had onthe young Alcibiades, who was destined to become prominent among them. Socrateswas not the first philosopher to have collided with the city, but he is thefirst to have benefited from a dramatic, poetic representation of his way oflife, which placed him among the heroes and permitted, or rather necessitated,reflection not only about what he taught but also about the man himself and howhe fitted into the city. This rich drama of the early philosopher who came tothe attention of the city because he was a philosopher, presents all thequestions of freedom of thought from all the angles, without any kind ofdoctrinairism, and hence provides us with a fresh view of the importance andalso of the difficulties of such freedom. From the Republic, which really takesseriously only the demands of knowledge, to the Laws, which gives full attentionto the competing demands of political life, Socrates as perfecter and asdissolver of the community reveals all the facets of his activity. Thedifficulty he and the other philosophers contend with from the law is not to beconfounded with society’s prejudice against outsiders, dissenters ornonconformists but is, at least apparently, a result of an essential oppositionbetween the two highest claims on a man’s loyalty—his community and his reason.That opposition can only be overcome if the state is rational, as in Hegel, orif reason is abandoned, as in Nietzsche. However that may be, we have a record,unparalleled in its detail and depth, of this first appearance of philosophy,and we can apprehend the natural, or at least primitive, responses to it, priorto philosophy’s effect on the world. This provides a view of the beginning at atime when we may be witnessing the end, partly because we no longer know thatbeginning.The poetry written about Socrates by Plato and Xenophon is already in thedefensive mode, a rehabilitation of the condemned man. The first statement ofthe city’s reaction to Socrates is made by Aristophanes. What luck Socrates had!Not only did he command the pens of Plato and Xenophon; he also was the centralfigure of the greatest work of the consummate genius of comedy. The Clouds oftenarouses indignation in those who care little for Socrates but think seriousmatters are not laughing matters. Socrates’ fate and Aristophanes’ possiblecontribution to it trouble them. But Socrates was probably not of theirpersuasion. He laughed and joked on the day of his death. He and Aristophanesshare a certain levity. Aristophanes does present a ridiculous Socrates andtakes the point of view of the vulgar, to whom Socrates does look ridiculous.But Aristophanes also ridicules the vulgar. Reading him we, indeed, laugh at thewise as do the ignorant, but we also laugh at the ignorant as do the wise. Aboveall we laugh at the anger of the ignorant against the wise.The Socrates of The Clouds is a man who despises what other people care aboutand cares about what they despise. He spends his life investigating nature,worrying about gnats and stars, denying the existence of the gods because theyare not to be found in nature. His maps have only a tiny dot where Athens loomslarge to its citizens. Law and convention (nomos) mean nothing to him, becausethey are not natural but manmade. His companions are pale-faced young mentotally devoid of common sense. In this academy, which has established itself inthe free atmosphere of Athens, these eccentrics carry on their activitieswithout appearing to be other than harmless cranks. They are poor, without anyfixed means of support. Socrates receives gifts and apparently countenancesminor thefts, literally to keep body and soul together. There is no morality,but they are not vicious people, because their only concern is their studies.Socrates is utterly indifferent to honor or luxury.Aristophanes recaptures for us the absurdity of a grown man who spends his timethinking about gnats’ anuses. We have been too persuaded of the utility ofscience to perceive how far the scientist’s perspective is from that of agentleman, how shocking and petty the scientist’s interests appear to a man whois concerned with war and peace, justice, freedom and glory. If science is justfor curiosity’s sake, which is what theoretical men believe, it is nonsense, andimmoral nonsense, from the viewpoint of practical men. The world loses itsproportions. Only Swift has rivalled Aristophanes in picturing the comedy ofscience. His description of a woman’s breast seen through a microscope showswhat science means, not in order to denigrate science but to make clear theharsh disproportion between the world most men cling to and the one inhabited bytheoretical men.What Aristophanes satirizes is the exterior of science, how the scientistappears to the nonscientist. He can only hint at the dignity of what thescientist does. His Socrates is not individualized; he is not the Socrates weknow. He is a member of the species philosopher, student of nature, particularlyof astronomy. The first known member of this species was Thales. He was thefirst man to have seen the cause of, and to predict, an eclipse of the sun. Thismeans he figured out that the heavens move in regular ways that accord withmathematical reasoning. He was able to reason from visible effects to invisiblecauses and speculate about the intelligible order of nature as a whole. He atthat moment became aware that his mind was in accord with the principles ofnature, that he was the microcosm.This moment contains many elements: satisfaction at having solved a problem;pleasure in using his faculties; fullness of pride, more complete than that ofany conqueror, for he surveys and possesses all; certitude drawn from withinhimself, requiring no authorities; self-sufficiency, not depending, for thefulfillment of what is highest in himself, on other men or opinions or onaccidents such as birth or election to power, on anything that can be taken fromhim; a happiness that has no admixture of illusion or hope but is full ofactuality. But perhaps most important for Thales was seeing that the poetic ormythical accounts of eclipses are false. They are not, as men believed prior tothe advent of science, a sign from the gods. Eclipses are beyond the power ofthe gods. They belong to nature. One need not fear the gods. The theoreticalexperience is one of liberation, not only negatively—freeing the thinker fromfear of the gods—but also positively, simultaneously a discovery of the best wayof life. Maimonides describes the experience of the philosophic use of reason asfollows: “This then will be a key permitting one to enter places the gates towhich were locked. And when these gates are opened and these places are enteredinto, the soul will find rest therein, the eyes will be delighted, and thebodies will be eased of their toil and of their labor.” What had previously beenchecked in man’s soul comes into full play. Freedom from the myths and theirinsistence that piety is best permits man to see that knowing is best, the endfor which everything else is done, the only end that without self-contradictioncan be said to be final. The important theoretical experience leads necessarilytoward the first principles of all things and includes an awareness of the good.Man as man, regardless of nation, birth or wealth, is capable of thisexperience. And it is the only thing men surely have spiritually in common: thedemonstrations of science come from within man, and they are the same for allmen. When I think the Pythagorean theorem, I know that what is in me at thatmoment is precisely the same as what is within anyone else who is thinking thattheorem. Every other supposedly common experience is at best ambiguous.Some of this experience still remains within the contemporary natural sciences,and it has a fugitive existence within the humanities. The unity of it all ishardly anywhere to be found or appreciated because philosophy hardly existstoday. But it was always understood by philosophers, because they share theexperience and are able to recognize it in others. This sense of community ismore important for them than any disagreements about the final things.Philosophy is not a doctrine but a way of life, so the philosophers, for all thedifferences in their teachings, have more in common with one another than withanyone else, even their own followers. Plato saw this in Parmenides, Aristotlein Plato, Bacon in Aristotle, Descartes in Bacon, Locke in Descartes and Newton,and so on.The tiny band of men who participate fully in this way of life are the soul ofthe university. This is true in historical fact as well as in principle.Universities came to be where men were inspired by the philosophers’ teachingsand examples. Philosophy and its demonstration of the rational contemplativelife, made possible and, more or less consciously, animated scholarship and theindividual sciences. When those examples lost their vitality or were overwhelmedby men who had no experience of them, the universities decayed or weredestroyed. This, strictly, is barbarism and darkness. I do not mean thatphilosophers were ordinarily present in universities any more than prophets orsaints are ordinarily present in houses of worship. But because those houses ofworship are dedicated to the spirit of the prophets and saints, they aredifferent from other houses. They can undertake many functions not central tothat spirit, but they remain what they are because of what they look up to, andeverything they do is informed by that reverence. But if the faith disappears,if the experiences reported by the prophets and saints become unbelievable ormatters of indifference, the temple is no longer a temple, no matter how muchactivity of various kinds goes on in it. It gradually withers and at bestremains a monument, the inner life of which is alien to the tourists who passidly through it. Although the comparison is not entirely appropriate, theuniversity is also informed by the spirit, which very few men can fully share,of men who are absent, but it must preserve respect for them. It can admitalmost anyone, but only if he or she looks up to and can have an inkling of thedignity of what is going on in it. It is itself always in danger of losingcontact with its animating principle, of representing something it no longerpossesses. Although it may seem wildly implausible that this group of rareindividuals should be the center of what really counts for the university, thiswas recognized in the universities until only yesterday. It was, for example,well known in the nineteenth-century German university, which was the last greatmodel for the American university. However bad universities may have been,however extraneous accretions may have weighed them down, there was always adivination that an Aristotle or a Newton was what they were all about.The philosophic life is not the university. Until the nineteenth century mostphilosophers had nothing to do with universities, and perhaps the greatestabhorred them. One cannot imagine Socrates as a professor, for reasons that areworthy of our attention. But Socrates is of the essence of the university. Itexists to preserve and further what he represents. In effect, it hardly does soanymore. But more important is the fact that as a result of Enlightenment,philosophers and philosophy came to inhabit the universities exclusively,abandoning their old habits and haunts. There they have become vulnerable in newways and thus risk extinction. The classical philosophers would not, for verygood reasons, have taken this risk. Understanding these reasons is invaluablefor our peculiar predicament.Although the philosophic experience is understood by the philosophers to be whatis uniquely human, the very definition of man, the dignity and charm ofphilosophy have not always or generally been popularly recognized. This is notthe case with the other claimants to the throne, the prophet or the saint, thehero or the statesman, the poet or the artist, whose claims, if not alwaysaccepted, are generally recognized to be serious. They were always present,apparently coeval with civil society, whereas philosophers appeared late on thescene and had to make their way. And this has something to do with the problem,but it may be symptom rather than cause. I doubt that the people have muchgreater access to the typical experiences of prophets, kings and poets than tothose of the philosophers. Great imagination, inspiration, intrepidity in thepursuit of glory are further from the ordinary lives of ordinary men than is theexperience of reasoning found in the practical arts in daily use, like farming,building, shoemaking, and which is despised by the higher men. Socrates alwayshas to remind his aristocratic interlocutors of these crafts and uses them asmodels of the knowledge aristocrats lack. But this may indicate part of thedifficulty: the people want something higher, something exalted, to admire. Andcertainly Socrates’ person, at first sight anyway, does not provide such anobject of admiration, as Aristophanes’ comedy makes abundantly clear. Moreover,and more important, the prophets, kings and poets are clearly benefactors ofmankind at large, providing men with salvation, protection, prosperity, mythsand entertainment. They are the noble bulwarks of civil society, and men tend toregard as good what does good to them. Philosophy does no such good. All to thecontrary, it is austere and somewhat sad because it takes away many of men’sfondest hopes. It certainly does nothing to console men in their sorrows andtheir unending vulnerability. Instead it points to their unprotectedness andnature’s indifference to their individual fates. Socrates is old, ugly, poor, ofno family, without prestige or power in the city, and babbles about Ether’staking Zeus’s place.The kings praised by poetry and illustrated in sculpture are ambiguous. On theone hand they seem to exist for their own sake, beauty in which we do notparticipate and to which we look up. On the other hand, they are in ourservice—ruling us, curing us, perhaps punishing us, but for our sakes, teachingus, pleasing us. Achilles is perfection, what most men can only dream aboutbeing, and is therefore their superior and properly their master. But he is alsotheir warrior protector, who in order to save Greece overcomes the fear of deaththat other men cannot overcome. All the heroes are in the business of takingcare of and flattering men, the dēmos, receiving admiration and glory as theirpay. In some sense they are fictions of civil society, whose ends they serve.Not that they do not do the deeds for which they are praised, but the goodnessof those deeds is measured, alas, by utility, by the greatest good of thegreatest number. The statesman possesses virtues that are supposed to be good inthemselves; but he is measured by his success in preserving the people. Thosevirtues are means to the end of preservation, i.e., the good life is subordinateto and in the service of mere life. If the theoretical life is a good way oflife, it cannot, at least in its most authentic expression, be, or seriously beunderstood to be, in the city’s service. It therefore has an almost impossiblepublic relations problem. Socrates hints at this in his Apology when,ridiculously—since he was never angry and since he distinguished himself as asoldier exclusively in retreats—he likens himself to Achilles.The defenselessness of philosophy in the city is what Aristophanes points outand ridicules. He, the poet, has much sympathy with the philosopher’s wisdom butprides himself on not being so foolish. He can take care of himself, win prizesfrom and be paid by the people. His stance is that of the wise guy in the faceof the wise man; he is city smart. He warns the philosophers and provesprophetic in comically portraying the city’s vengeance. The generation of greatmen who followed Socrates, including Plato, Xenophon and Isocrates, took thewarning very much to heart. Philosophy, they recognized, is weak, preciselybecause it is new, not necessary, not a participant in the city’s power. It isthreatened and is a threat to all the beliefs that tie the city together andunite the other high types—priests, poets and statesmen—against philosophy. SoSocrates’ successors gathered all their strength and made a heroic effort tosave and protect philosophy.Socrates in Aristophanes’ story minded his own business, was the subject ofrumor and ridicule, until a father who was in debt because of his son’sprodigality wanted to free himself of his obligations. Socrates’ atheism was theright prescription for him, insofar as it meant that he need not fear Zeus’sthunderbolt if he broke the law, if he perjured himself. The law is revealed tobe merely manmade, and hence there is no witness to his misdeeds if he canescape the attention of other men. Philosophy liberates this foolish old man.His son, too, is liberated, but with the unexpected consequence that he losesreverence for his father and his mother, who are no longer under divineprotection. This the father cannot stand and returns to his belief in the gods,who it turns out protect the family as well as the city. In a rage he burns downSocrates’ school.Aristophanes was prescient. The actual charges against Socrates were corruptingthe youth and impiety, with the implication that the latter is the deepest causeof the former. And whatever scholars may say about the injustice ofAristophanes’ or Athens’ charges, the evidence supports those charges. In theRepublic, for example, marriages are short-term affairs arranged only forreproduction, the family is dissolved, wise sons rule over and can disciplineunwise fathers, and the prohibitions against incest are, to say the least,relaxed. The reverence for antiquity is replaced by reason, and the rule offathers and the ancestral are disputed. This follows immediately from Socrates’procedures, and it entered into the bloodstream of the West, one of theinnumerable effects of philosophy that, for better or worse, are to be foundonly there. Angry fathers are one of the constituencies mortally hostile toSocrates, who was not trying to achieve this result, or to reform the family.His example and the standards of judgment he invoked simply led to it.Socrates collided not with culture, society or economy but with the law—whichmeans with a political fact. The law is coercive. The human things impinge onthe philosophers in the form of political demands. What philosophers need tosurvive is not anthropology, sociology or economics, but political science. Thuswithout any need for sophisticated reasons, political science was the firsthuman science or science of human things that had to be founded, and remainedthe only one until sometime in the eighteenth century. The stark recognitionthat he depended on the city, that as he looked up to the heavens he lost hisfooting on the ground, compelled the philosopher to pay attention to politics,to develop a philosophic politics, a party, as it were, to go along with theother parties, democratic, oligarchic, aristocratic and monarchic, that arealways present. He founded the truth party. Ancient political philosophy wasalmost entirely in the service of philosophy, of making the world safer forphilosophy.Moreover, the law against which Socrates collided was the one concerning thegods. In its most interesting expression the law is the divine law. The city issacred, it is a theological-political entity. (This is, by the way, why theTheological-Political Treatise is for Spinoza the book about politics.) Theproblem for the philosophers is primarily religion. The philosophers must cometo terms with its authoritative presence in the city. Socrates in the Apologymakes some suggestions as to how the philosopher must behave. He must deny thathe is an atheist, although he remains ambiguous as to the character of hisbelief. Any careful reading of the Apology makes clear that Socrates never sayshe believes in the gods of the city. But he does try to make himself appear tobe a sign sent from the gods, commanded to do what he does by the Delphic god.Nonetheless he is condemned.He states his problem succinctly in explaining his way of life to his jurors: If I tell you that I would be disobeying the god and on that account it isimpossible for me to keep quiet, you won’t be persuaded by me, taking it that Iam ironizing. And if I tell you that it is the greatest good for a human beingto have discussions everyday about virtue and the other things you hear metalking about, examining myself and others, and that the unexamined life is notlivable for a human being, you will be even less persuaded. The people recognize Socrates’ irony, his talking down to them, and see howimplausible his religious claims are. His irony appears as irony and istherefore not successful. But the truth, unadorned by the Delphic cover, isincomprehensible, corresponding to no experience his audience has. He would becloser to success in sticking to his first story. One can from this verydescription analyze the political situation. There are three groups of men: mostdo not understand him, are hostile to him, and vote for his condemnation; asmaller but not inconsiderable group also do not understand Socrates but glimpsesomething noble in him, are sympathetic to him and vote for his acquittal;finally, a very small group knows what he means when he says the greatest goodfor a human being is talking about—not practicing—virtue (unless talking aboutvirtue is practicing it). The last group is politically inconsiderable.Therefore the whole hope for the political salvation of philosophy rests withthe friendliness of the second group, good citizens and ordinarily pious, butsomehow open.And it was to such men, the gentlemen, that philosophy made its rhetoricalappeal for almost two thousand years. When they ruled, the climate forphilosophy was more or less salubrious. When the people, the dēmos, ruled,religious fanaticism or vulgar utility made things much less receptive tophilosophy. Tyrants might be attracted to philosophers, either out of genuinecuriosity or the desire to adorn themselves, but they are the most unreliable ofallies. All of this rests on a psychological analysis that was forced on thephilosophers, who had previously not paid much attention to men or their souls.They observed that the most powerful passion of most men is fear of death. Veryfew men are capable of coming to terms with their own extinction. It is not somuch stupidity that closes men to philosophy but love of their own, particularlylove of their own lives, but also love of their own children and their owncities. It is the hardest task of all to face the lack of cosmic support forwhat we care about. Socrates, therefore, defines the task of philosophy as“learning how to die.” Various kinds of self-forgetting, usually accompanied byillusions and myths, make it possible to live without the intransigent facing ofdeath—in the sense of always thinking about it and what it means for life andthe things dear in life—which is characteristic of a serious life. Individualsdemand significance for this individual life, which is so subject to accident.Most human beings and all cities require the unscientific mixture of general andparticular, necessity and chance, nature and convention. It is just this mixturethat the philosopher cannot accept and which he separates into its constituentparts. He applies what he sees in nature to his own life. “As are thegenerations of leaves, so are the generations of men,”—a somber lesson that isonly compensated for by the intense pleasure accompanying insight. Without thatpleasure, which so few have, it would be intolerable. The philosopher, to theextent that he really only enjoys thinking and loves the truth, cannot bedisabused. He cherishes no illusion that can crumble. If he is comic, at leasthe is absolutely immune to tragedy. Nonphilosophic men love the truth only aslong as it does not conflict with what they cherish—self, family, country, fame,love. When it does conflict, they hate the truth and regard as a monster the manwho does not care for these noble things, who proves they are ephemeral andtreats them as such. The gods are the guarantors of the unity of nature andconvention dear to most men, which philosophy can only dissolve. The enmitybetween science and mankind at large is, therefore, not an accident.This hostile relationship between the prevailing passions of the philosopher andthose of the dēmos was taken by the philosophers to be permanent, for humannature is unchanging. As long as there are men, they will be motivated by fearof death. This passion is primarily what constitutes the cave, a horizon withinwhich hope seems justified. Serving the community that lives in the cave,risking one’s life for what preserves life, is honored. Vulgar morality is thecode of this selfish collectivity, and whatever steps outside its circle is theobject of moral indignation. And moral indignation, not ordinary selfishness orsensuality, is the greatest danger to the thinker. The fear that the gods whoprotect the city will be angered and withdraw their protection induces ecstasiesof terror in men and makes them wildly vindictive against those who transgressthe divine law. In the Apology, Socrates explains why he, such a good citizen,stayed out of Athens’ political life. When he presided in the Council he refusedto put to the vote—and was overridden—a motion to put to death the commanders ofAthens’ greatest naval victory because they had prudently refused to try to pickup the bodies of their dead from the water due to a storm that endangered theliving. But divine law required the recovery of the bodies, and moral rageinsisted on capital punishment for the commanders. Mere prudence cannot overridethe sacred. Socrates’ philosophy has more in common with that prudence than itdoes with the popular moral fervor, which also caused his death, essentially forputting the prudent above the sacred. This fervor Socrates took to be thesubstrate of civil society, which would always in the end overpower and deformreason in civil society. Thus there are two possibilities: the philosopher mustrule absolutely, or he, “like a man in a storm when dust and rain are blownabout by the wind, stands aside under a little wall.” There is no third way, orit belongs only to the intellectual, who attempts to influence and ends up inthe power of the would-be influenced. He enhances their power and adapts histhought to their ends.The philosopher wants to know things as they are. He loves the truth. That is anintellectual virtue. He does not love to tell the truth. That is a moral virtue.Presumably he would prefer not to practice deception; but if it is a conditionof his survival, he has no objection to it. The hopes of changing mankind almostalways end up in changing not mankind but one’s thought. Reformers may often beintransigent or extreme in deed, but they are rarely intransigent in thought,for they have to be relevant. But the man who fits most easily into theconventions and is least constrained by struggle with them has more freedom forthought. The real radicalism of ancient thought is covered over by itsmoderation in political deed, and this misleads many modern scholars. Theancients had no tenure to protect them and wanted to avoid the prostitution towhich those who have to live off their wits are prone. There is no moral orderprotecting philosophers or ensuring that truth will win out in the long, or theshort, run.So philosophers engaged in a gentle art of deception. There is no leaving civilsociety, no matter what Thoreau may have thought. But they cannot avoid beingnoticed. They are different. Therefore philosophers allied themselves with thegentlemen, making themselves useful to them, never quite revealing themselves tothem, strengthening their gentleness and openness by reforming their education.Why are the gentlemen more open than the people? Because they have money andhence leisure and can appreciate the beautiful and useless. And because theydespise necessity. Nietzsche said with some good reason that ancient gentlemendespised eating and sexual intercourse because these acts are forced on them bytheir animal nature, and they had the pride of the free. And although they tendto be reverent, they can be irreverent, and certainly are less prone toreligious fanaticism than the many, because they are less in the grip of fear.Aristotle in his Ethics shows how the philosopher appears as the ally of thegentlemen, speaking to them about the noble deeds that are their specialty (nothis). All he apparently does is clarify for them what they already practice. Buthe makes slight changes that point toward philosophy. Piety is not even includedin the list of the individual virtues. And shame, a quality of the noble and agreat enemy of reason, is mentioned only in order to be banished from the canon.The virtuous man has nothing to be ashamed of, says Aristotle—an observationthat fits Socrates’ view of himself but is not typical of gentlemen. Andgradually Aristotle turns his readers’ attention to the theoretical life, not byseriously theorizing with them but by pointing to the direction in which itlies. He makes it godlike and the completion of their own incompleteness, whichthey used to achieve by admiring Achilles and revering the Olympian gods. Nowthey admire the theoretical men who contemplate a thinking god. It is an openquestion whether the gentleman grasped the essence of philosophy less accuratelyin this way than does the modern man who respects the scientist because heprovides him with useful things.Similarly in his Poetics, Aristotle explains to gentlemanly lovers of thetheater what tragedy is and what they get from it. But here too he changesthings a bit. The poet is not, as Homer presents himself, inspired by the Musesbut is an imitator of nature, i.e., of the same thing the philosophers study,and hence does not depict a world alien to the one studied by philosophy, or onethat results from causes in conflict with those admitted by science. Aristotleexplicitly connects poetry with philosophy. And the end, the final cause, oftragedy is said to be the purgation of pity and fear, the two passions thatcombined lead to enthusiasm, religious possession or fanaticism. Socrates hadattacked the poets for appealing to those passions that make men ecstatic fromterror at what they can suffer and their unprotectedness in their suffering. Itis just here, according to Socrates, that reason should be invoked, to face thenecessary, to remind men of the order in things that exists in spite of theaccidents that happen to them individually. Pity and fear cry out forsatisfaction, for attention, for being taken seriously. Above all, the world menincline to see is full of benevolent and malevolent deities who take their casesseriously. Poetry to succeed must speak to these passions, which are morepowerful than reason in almost all men. Because poetry needs an audience it is,in Socrates’ view, too friendly to the enemies of reason. The philosopher hasless need to enter into the wishes of the many or, as the wise of our time wouldput it, into the drama of history, or to be engagé. This is why Socratesheightens the enmity between philosophy and poetry.Aristotle, actually following Socrates’ lead, suggests that the poet can be thedoctor of mortals who are so mad as to insist they should be immortal. The poet,not the philosopher, can treat the passions that are dangerous to philosophy,which Socrates had to his great cost ignored. He can arouse these passions inorder to flush them out of the soul, leaving the patients more relaxed andcalmer, more willing to listen to reason. Aristotle tells the poets they shouldpresent heroes who deserve their fates, whose sad ends are plausiblyattributable to a flaw in their characters. Their suffering, while pitiable, isnot promiscuous, a reproach to the moral order, or the lack of one, in theworld. The effect of such drama would be to make men gentle and believers in thecoherence of the world, in the rational relation of cause and effect. They arenot made reasonable by this but are saved from hatred of reason and moredisposed to accept it. Aristotle does not attempt to make scientists out ofgentlemen, but he tempers their prevailing passions in such a way as to makethem friends of philosophy. Socrates does much the same thing in the Apologywhen he addresses those who voted for his acquittal and tells them myths thattend to make death seem less terrible. The tales are not true, but theyreinforce the gentleness that kept them from fearing and hence condemningSocrates. Socrates criticizes poetry in order to encourage it to be an ally ofthe philosophers instead of the priests.Thus philosophy’s response to the hostility of civil society is an educationalendeavor, rather more poetic or rhetorical than philosophic, the purpose ofwhich is to temper the passions of gentlemen’s souls, softening the hardpassions such as anger, and hardening the soft ones such as pity. The model forall such efforts is the dialogues of Plato, which together rival the Iliad andthe Odyssey, or even the Gospels, introducing a new hero who excites admirationand imitation. To introduce a new hero, a new taste has to be established, andthe taste for Socrates is unique, counter to all previous tastes. Plato turnsthe personage of The Clouds into one of those civilization-constituting figureslike Moses, Jesus or Achilles, who have a greater reality in men’s souls than dotheir own flesh-and-blood contemporaries. As Achilles is said to have formedAlexander the Great; Alexander, Caesar; and Caesar, Napoleon—reaching out to oneanother from the peaks across the valleys—so Socrates is the teacher ofphilosophers in an unbroken chain for two and a half millennia, extending fromgeneration to generation through all the epochal changes. Plato insured thisinfluence, not by reproducing Socrates’ philosophy, in the manner of Aristotleor Kant, but by representing his action, more in the manner of Sophocles,Aristophanes, Dante and Shakespeare. Socrates is made to touch the prevailingpassion of each of the different kinds of soul in such a way as appear to bedivinatory of their longings and necessary to their self-understanding. Thereare dialogues that touch the pious; some move the ambitious and the idealistic;others excite the erotic and still others the warriors and the politicians; somespeak to-the poets, others to the mathematicians; lovers of money are no moreforgotten than are lovers of honor. There is hardly anyone who is not madeindignant by one aspect or another of Socrates’ discourse, but there is alsohardly anyone who is not moved and heartened by other aspects. Socrates statedthe case for all human types better than they could have stated it forthemselves. (He, of course, also stated the problem with each of those types andtheir aspirations.) Plato demonstrates the need for Socrates and in so doingmakes the need felt in his readers. It is not only Alcibiades who feltincomplete without Socrates.In almost no case was there a total conversion of a man. Certainly none is everdepicted in the dialogues. Plato himself, and a few others, were converted tophilosophy, and their self-discovery was possible because Socrates was more orless tolerated in Athens. The toleration of philosophy requires its beingthought to serve powerful elements in society without actually becoming theirservant. The philosopher must come to terms with the deepest prejudices of menalways, and of the men of his time. The one thing he cannot change and will nottry to change is their fear of death and the whole superstructure of beliefs andinstitutions that make death bearable, ward it off or deny it. The essentialdifference between the philosopher and all other men is his facing of death orhis relation to eternity. He obviously does not deny that many men dieresolutely or calmly. It is relatively easy to die well. The question is how onelives, and only the philosopher does not need opinions that falsify thesignificance of things in order to endure them. He alone mixes the reality ofdeath—its inevitability and our dependence on fortune for what little life wehave—into every thought and deed and is thus able to live while honestly seekingperfect clarity. He is, therefore, necessarily in the most fundamental tensionwith everyone except his own kind. He relates to all the others ironically,i.e., with sympathy and a playful distance. Changing the character of hisrelationship to them is impossible because the disproportion between him andthem is firmly rooted in nature. Thus, he has no expectation of essentialprogress. Toleration, not right, is the best he can hope for, and he is keptvigilant by the awareness of the basic fragility of his situation and that ofphilosophy.Socrates allies himself with those who are powerful in the city and at the sametime fascinated or charmed by him. But the charm only endures so long as he doesnot confront their most important concerns. Crito, the family man, thinks ofSocrates as a good family man. Laches, the soldier, thinks of Socrates as a goodsoldier. Those who get angry at Socrates and accuse him always see something themore gently disposed miss. Thrasymachus sees that Socrates does not respect thecity. He sees the truth about Socrates, but he cannot, at least in thebeginning, appreciate him. The others appreciate him, but partly because theyare blind to what is most important to him. This provides the model for thepolitical tactics followed by the philosophers from Plato up to Machiavelli.None was primarily political, for there was a definite limit on what one couldexpect from politics, and it was essential not to make the pursuit of the truthdependent on what is politically relevant. Politics was a serious study to theextent that one learned about the soul from it. But the practical politics ofall the philosophers, no matter how great their theoretical differences, werethe same. They practiced an art of writing that appealed to the prevailing moraltaste of the regime in which they found themselves, but which could lead someastute readers outside of it to the Elysian Fields where the philosophers meetto talk. They frequently became the interpreters of the traditions of theirnations, subtly altering them to make them open to philosophy and philosophers.They were always suspect, but they also always had their well-placed friends.For this reason the form and content of the writings of men like Plato, Cicero,Farabi and Maimonides appear very different, while their inner teachings may beto all intents and purposes the same. Each had a different beginning point, adifferent cave, from which he had to ascend to the light and to which he had toreturn. Thus they appeared to be “relevant” without forming their minds to theprejudices of the day. This protected them from the necessity or the temptationto conform to what is most powerful. Classical philosophy was amazingly robustand survived changes as great as are imaginable, such as that from paganism tothe revealed Biblical religions. Marsilius of Padua was as Aristotelian as wasAristotle, proving that the problems are permanent but their expressions arechanging. We moderns think that a comparatively minor change, like that wroughtby the French Revolution, necessitates new thought. The ancients held that a manmust never let himself be overcome by events unless those events taughtsomething essentially new. They were more intent than were any men before orsince on preserving the freedom of the mind. This was their legacy to theuniversity. They, however, never let the principle become a dogma and nevercounted on its having any other ground than their wits. They were ever mindfulof the responsibilities and the risks of their enterprise.In sum, the ancient philosophers were to a man proponents of aristocraticpolitics, but not for the reasons intellectual historians are wont to ascribe tothem. They were aristocratic in the higher sense of the word, because theythought reason should rule, and only philosophers are fully devoted to reason.But this is just a theoretical argument, since philosophers never really dorule. They were aristocratic in the vulgar sense, favoring the power of thosepossessing old wealth, because such men are more likely to grasp the nobility ofphilosophy as an end itself, if not to understand it. Most simply, they have themoney for an education and time to take it seriously. Only technology, with itsattendant problems, makes universal education possible, and therefore opens theprospect of a different kind of relationship of philosophy to politics.THE ENLIGHTENMENT TRANSFORMATIONThe thinkers of the Enlightenment, as I have said, reproached all earlierphilosophers for their powerlessness to help men and themselves. The Republic’sformula, that power and wisdom must coincide if evils are ever to cease in thecities, is the perfect expression of what the Enlighteners meant. The necessaryunity of power and wisdom is only a coincidence for the ancients, i.e.,dependent on chance completely out of the philosopher’s control. Knowledge isnot in itself power, and though it is not in itself vulnerable to power, thosewho seek it and possess it most certainly are. Therefore the great virtue forthe philosophers in their political deeds was moderation. They were utterlydependent on the prejudices of the powerful and had to treat them mostdelicately. They subjected themselves to a fierce discipline of detachment frompublic opinion. Although they inevitably had to try to influence political lifein their favor, they never seriously thought of themselves as founders orlawgivers. The mixture of unwise power and powerless wisdom, in the ancients’view, would always end up with power strengthened and wisdom compromised. He whoflirts with power, Socrates said, will be compelled to lie with it.The uncompromisable difference that separates the philosophers from all othersconcerns death and dying. No way of life other than the philosophic can digestthe truth about death. Whatever the illusion that supports ways of life andregimes other than the philosophic one, the philosopher is its enemy. There cannever be a meeting of minds on this question, as both ancients and modernsagreed. It seemed only natural to the ancients to find their allies among thevulgarly courageous, i.e., those willing to face death with endurance and evenintrepidity, although they required unfounded beliefs about the noble, whichmade them forget about the good. They share the common ground with thephilosophers on which something higher than mere life rests. But they have nogood reason for their sacrifice. Achilles’ laments and complaints about why hemust die for the Greeks and for his friend are very different from Socrates’arguments and the reasoning that underlies them for accepting death—because heis old, because it is inevitable, and because it costs him almost nothing andmight be useful to philosophy. Anger characterizes Achilles; calculation,Socrates. Whatever sympathy there might be between the two kinds of men isfounded, to speak anachronistically, on Achilles’ misunderstanding Socrates.The extraordinary device contrived by the new philosophy that produces harmonybetween philosophy and politics was to exchange one misunderstanding foranother. All men fear death and passionately wish to avoid it. Even the heroeswho despised it do so against a background of fear, which is primary. Onlyreligious fanatics who believe certainly in a better life after death marchgaily to death. If, instead of depending on the rare natures who have a nobleattitude toward death, which goes against nature’s grain, philosophy couldwithout destroying itself play the demagogue’s role—i.e., appeal to the passionthat all men have and that is most powerful—it could share in and make use ofthe power. Rather than fighting what appears to be human nature, by cooperatingwith it philosophy could control it. In short, if philosophy should be revealedto man not as his moral preceptor but as his collaborator in his fondest dreams,the philosopher could supplant priest, politician and poet in the affection ofthe multitude. This is what Machiavelli meant when he blamed the old writers forbuilding imaginary principalities and republics that neglect how men actuallylive in favor of how they ought to live. He counsels writers to accommodatethemselves to the dominant passions instead of exhorting men to practice virtuesthat they rarely perfect, whose goodness for the individuals who practice themis questionable, and the preachings of which are boring to everyone concerned.In a word, turn philosophy into a benefactor, and it will be thought to be goodand will enjoy the power accruing to benefactors.Philosophy can be used to conquer fortune, so Machiavelli announced. It was, ofcourse, fortune—chance—that made it impossible for philosophers to rule,according to Plato. Fortune governs the relations between power and wisdom,which means that men cannot be counted on to consent to the rule of the wise,and the wise are not strong enough to force them to do so. The conquest offortune meant for Machiavelli that thought and thinkers could compel andguarantee the consent of men. If this is possible, then the ancientphilosophers’ moderation looks like timidity. Daring in the political arenabecomes the new disposition of the philosophers. Danton’s “de l’audace, encorede l’audace, toujours de l’audace,” is but a pale, merely political, duplicateof Machiavelli’s original call to battle. Bacon’s assertion that the goal ofscience is to “ease man’s estate,” Descartes’ assertion that science will makeman “master and possessor of nature,” and the commonplace that science is theconquest of nature are offsprings of Machiavelli’s revolution and constitute thepolitical face adopted by modern philosophy.The strategy adopted for the assault on the old regime had two parts—onebelonging to natural science and the other to political science. First,Descartes proposed that the humble doctor, one of Socrates’ ordinary examples ofa reasonable artisan, lacking in the political or religious splendor that bringsmen to the center of the human stage, could, if science were to increase hispower to heal a thousandfold, promise enough—if not eternity, at least anever-increasing longevity—to gain men’s attachment and disenchant the priest.Then, Hobbes proposed that if another humble type, the policeman, who protectsmen against those who administer violent death, could be made effective in a newpolitical order based on fear of violent death, founded by a new kind ofpolitical scientist who addresses the passions in a new way, he could ward offthe real dangers for men who had been made to look those dangers in the face andthereby away from fear of invisible powers and their ministers. Doctor andpoliceman, enhanced by the application of science to their endeavors, were to bethe foundations of a wholly new political undertaking. If the pursuit of healthand safety were to absorb men and they were led to recognize the connectionbetween their preservation and science, the harmony between theory and practicewould be established. The actual rulers, after a couple of centuries of astutepropaganda directing popular passions against throne and altar, would in thelong run be constrained by their subjects and would have to enact thescientists’ project. The scientists would, to use Harvey Mansfield’s formula, bethe hidden rulers. The ends pursued by politicians and the means they use wouldbe determined by philosophers. Scientists would be free and get support, andscientific progress would be identical to political progress so conceived.The scientists in this system belong to a world order of scientists, fornational loyalties and customs are irrelevant to them as scientists. They arecosmopolitan. Gradually the political orders would have to be transformed, sothat no particularity remains in the way of reason’s operations or producesconflict between the scientist’s loyalty to country and his loyalty to truth.There is only one science. It is the same everywhere and produces the sameresults everywhere. Similarly, there can, in principle, be only one legitimatepolitical order, founded by, on, and for science. There may well remainindividual nations with old but decaying traditions stemming from specialexperiences in the past, and attachment to them may tug at the scientists’cosmopolitanism. But the nations must all gradually become similar. They mustrespect the rights of man.This doctrine of rights is the clear and certain rational teaching about justicethat was intended to take the place of the ancient teachings, which were “likecastles built on sand.” In fact, rights are nothing other than the fundamentalpassions, experienced by all men, to which the new science appeals and which itemancipates from the constraints imposed on them by specious reasoning and fearof divine punishment. These passions are what science can serve. If thesepassions, given by nature, are what men have permission—a “right”—to seeksatisfaction for, the partnership of science and society is formed. Civilsociety then sets as its sole goal that satisfaction—life, liberty and thepursuit of property—and men consent to obey the civil authority because itreflects their wants. Government becomes more solid and surer, now based onpassions rather than virtues, rights rather than duties. These life-preservingpassions act as the premises of moral and political reasoning, the form of whichis as follows: “If I desire to preserve myself, then I must seek peace. If Iseek peace, then … etc.” On the basis of such evident and deeply felt premises,men’s allegiance to government can be a matter of reason rather than passionatefaith. Such imperatives are the very opposite extreme from those enunciated inthe Ten Commandments, which provide no reasons for obeying their injunctions anddo not affirm fundamental passions but inhibit them. Men now owe their clarityabout their ends to reasoners. They obey on rational grounds the law thatprotects them. And they respect, and demand that the government respect, thescientists who most of all can, by the higher use of reason, understand and tamehostile nature, including human nature. Government becomes the intermediarybetween the scientists and the people.The rights teachings established the framework and the atmosphere for the modernuniversity. A regime founded on the inclinations of its members is one wherefreedom, rightly understood, is primary. And the right to know immediatelyfollows from the right to pursue one’s own preservation, and to be the judge ofthe means to that preservation. And the right to know, of those who desire toknow and can know, has a special status. The universities flourished becausethey were perceived to serve society as it wants to be served, not as Socratesserved it or Thales failed to serve it. Thus it is indeed true that there is aspecial kinship between the liberal university and liberal democracy, notbecause the professors are the running dogs of the “system,” but because this isthe only regime where the powerful are persuaded that letting the professors dowhat they want is good. Without this “liberal” framework, the rights thatprofessors claim for themselves are meaningless. The very notion of rights wasfirst enunciated by the founders of liberalism, and its only home is in liberalsociety, in both theory and practice.All of this meant that the philosophers switched parties from the aristocraticto the democratic. The people, who were by definition uneducated and the seat ofprejudice, could be educated, if the meaning of education were changed fromexperience of things beautiful to enlightened self-interest. The aristocrats,with their pride, their love of glory, their sense that they are born with theright to rule, now appear to be impediments to the rule of reason. The newphilosophers dedicated themselves to reducing the aristocrats back into thecommons, removing their psychological underpinnings and denigrating theirtastes. This turn to the people can be understood as an appreciation of theirdecent desire for equality and willingness to contract not to do injustice inreturn for not suffering injustice, as opposed to the nobles’ rejection ofequality and willingness to risk suffering injustice in order to be first. Or itcan be understood as a hardheaded strategy adopted in order to make use of thepeople’s power. In this the modern philosophers imitated the ancient tyrants whofound it easier to satisfy the people than the nobles who dared to rival them.No one has a naturally privileged position other than the knowers.This turn should not be interpreted as a movement in philosophy from Right toLeft. The emergence of a Right and a Left was a consequence of this turn topolitical activism, away from political accommodationism. The Left is thevehicle of modern philosophy and the Right is the opposition, largely religious,to it. Center is only the old liberalism, when a schism occurs in thephilosophical party at the end of the eighteenth century, and a more radicalegalitarianism threatens the project of science from within. Left means thetransformation of society by Enlightenment, a possibility either not envisaged,or rejected, by all older thinkers. In modernity it is possible for there to bea right-wing philosopher, i.e., one who opposes the philosophic attempt torationalize society; but in antiquity all philosophers had the same practicalpolitics, inasmuch as none believed it feasible or salutary to change therelations between rich and poor in a fundamental or permanently progressive way.Democratic politics with a moral and intellectual foundation which commands thesuffrage of the wise is strictly a modern invention, part and parcel ofEnlightenment broadly conceived.The philosophers, however, had no illusions about democracy. As I mentioned,they knew they were substituting one kind of misunderstanding for another. Thegentleman thought that philosophic equanimity in the face of death comes fromgentlemanly or heroic courage exercised for the sake of the noble. The man ofthe people, on the other hand, takes the philosopher’s reasonableness aboutavoiding death to be a product of the passionate fear of death that motivateshim. But the philosopher knows that the rational, calculating, economic manseeks immortality just as irrationally as, or even more so than, the man whohopes for eternal fame or for another life, of which the only sign or guaranteeis lodged in his hopes but for which he organizes his life. The utilitarianbehaves sensibly in all that is required for preservation but never takesaccount of the fact that he must die. He does everything reasonable to put offthe day of his death—providing for defense, peace, order, health and wealth—butactively suppresses the fact that the day must come. His whole life is absorbedin avoiding death, which is inevitable, and therefore he might be thought to bethe most irrational of men, if rationality has anything to do with understandingends or comprehending the human situation as such. He gives way without reserveto his most powerful passion and the wishes it engenders. The hero and the piousman are at least taking account of eternity. Although their wishes may make themmythologize about it, the posture they assume is somehow more reasonable. Thephilosopher always thinks and acts as though he were immortal, while alwaysbeing fully aware that he is mortal. He tries to stay alive as long as possiblein order to philosophize, but will not change his way of life or his thought inorder to do so. He is sensible in a way that heroes can never be; he looks atthings under the guise of eternity, as the bourgeois can never do. Therefore heis at one with neither. Only the life devoted to knowing can unite theseopposites. Socrates is the tragic hero whose mind is full of the things artisansthink about.The great modern philosophers were as much philosophers as were the ancients.They were perfectly conscious of what separates them from all other men, andthey knew that the gulf is unbridgeable. They knew that their connection withother men would always be mediated by unreason. They took a dare on the peculiarform of reasoning that comes from the natural inclinations. They seem to havebeen confident that they could benefit from the rational aspect and keep theirrational one from overwhelming them. The theoretical life remained as distinctfrom the practical life in their view as in the ancient one—theory looking tothe universal and unchangeable while understanding its relation to theparticular and changing; practice, totally absorbed by the latter, seeing thewhole only in terms of it, as a theodicy or an anthropodicy, presented as God orHistory. Philosophy and philosophers always see through such hopes forindividual salvation and are hence isolated. The modern philosophers knew thattheory is pursued for its own sake but took an interest in promoting the opinionthat, to paraphrase Clausewitz, theory is just practice pursued by other means.The philosophers in their closets or their academies have entirely differentends than the rest of mankind. The vision of the harmony of theory and practiceis only apparent. The moderns did not think, as did the ancients, that theywould lose sight of the distinction between the two in identifying them. This isthe most precise definition of their daring. What the ancients almostreligiously kept apart, the moderns thought they could join without risk. Theissue is: Does a society based on reason necessarily make unreasonable demandson reason, or does it approach more closely to reason and submit to theministrations of the reasonable? The difficulty is illuminated by the popularcontemporary misuse of a Greek word, praxis. It now means that there is notheory and no practice, that politics has been theoreticized and philosophypoliticized. It expresses the overcoming of the distinction between the eternaland the temporal. This is surely a result of Enlightenment, although it goescounter to the intentions of the Enlighteners. The question is whether it is anecessary or only an accidental result.It has long been fashionable in some quarters to treat the thinkers of theEnlightenment as optimistic and superficial. This was a view promoted in thewake of the French Revolution by reactionaries and romantics, the counter-coupof the religious and the poetic, which has had considerable and enduringsuccess. The modern philosophers are alleged to have believed in a new dawn inwhich men would become reasonable and everything would be for the best. They didnot, according to this popular view, understand the ineradicable character ofevil, nor did they know, or at least take sufficient account of, the power ofthe irrational of which our later, profounder age is so fully aware. In thesepages, I have tried to show that this is a skewed and self-servinginterpretation. No one who looks carefully at the project these philosophersoutlined can accuse them of being optimistic in the sense of expecting a simpletriumph of reason or of underestimating the power of evil. It is notsufficiently taken into account how Machiavellian they were, in all senses ofthat word, and that they were actually Machiavelli’s disciples. It was not byforgetting about the evil in man that they hoped to better his lot but by givingway to it rather than opposing it, by lowering standards. The very qualifiedrationality that they expected from most men was founded self-consciously onencouraging the greatest of all irrationalities. Selfishness was to be the meansto the common good, and they never thought that the moral or artistic splendorof past nations was going to be reproduced in the world they were planning. Thecombination of hardness and playfulness found in their writings should dispelall suspicion of unfounded hopefulness. What they plotted was “realistic,” ifanything ever was.And as to superficiality, everything turns on what the deepest human experienceis. The philosophers, ancient and modern, agreed that the fulfillment ofhumanity is in the use of reason. Man is the particular being that can know theuniversal, the temporal being that is aware of eternity, the part that cansurvey the whole, the effect that seeks the cause. Whether it is wonder at theapprehension of being or just figuring things out, reason is the end for whichthe irrational things exist, and all that seems to be merely brutish in man isinformed by his rational vocation—so thought the philosophers. ChristopherMarlowe understood both philosophy and Machiavelli very well when he put in thelatter’s mouth the phrase, “I hold there is no sin but ignorance.” There areother experiences, always the religious, and in modern times the poetic, whichmake competing claims. But it is not immediately evident that their claims aresuperior to those of philosophy. The issue comes back again to the relativedignity of reason vs. revelation. The fact that popularized rationalism is,indeed, superficial is no argument against the philosophers. They knew it wouldbe that way. (And, even in this, the democratic citizen, knowing and exercisinghis rights, is not the most contemptible of beings.) They were trying to makethe central human good central to society, and Enlightenment was and remains theonly plausible scheme for doing so.On the face of this, it seems absurd to me to say that Bacon, Descartes, Hobbes,Leibniz, Locke, Montesquieu and even Voltaire (who might be considered a merepopularizer of these others) were less deep than Jacques Maritain or T. S.Eliot—to mention two famous contemporaries from whose mouths I learned as ayoung man that the Enlightenment was shallow. Rousseau, who initiated theprofound school of criticism of Enlightenment’s effects, nevertheless says thatBacon, Descartes and Newton were very great men, and he speaks of the “wiseLocke.” He knew that these were his theoretical kin, although he disagreed withthem in crucial respects. The vulgarity of modern society, the object of so manycomplaints by intellectuals, is something the philosophers were willing to livewith. After all, as Socrates points out, all societies look pretty much the samefrom the heights, be they Periclean Athens or Des Moines, Iowa. A peaceful,wealthy society where the people look up to science and have enough money tosupport it is worth more than splendid imperia where there are slaves and nophilosophy. Locke appears superficial because he was not a snob. There is no wayhe could make a parade of the magnificence of what he saw.There is no doubt that these were serious men and that their contrivances havehad a public effect unlike that of any philosophers or scientists before orsince. The only comparable political events are the founding of what Machiavellicalled new modes and orders by prophets—by Moses, Cyrus, Theseus, Romulus and(he implies) Jesus—which he called on the philosophers to imitate. Modernity islargely of these philosophers’ making, and our self-awareness depends onunderstanding what they wanted to do and what they did do, grasping thus why oursituation is different from all other situations. However contrary it may be tocontemporary historical wisdom, the leading thread that runs through all theaccidents of modern history is the philosophical doctrine of Enlightenment.Modern regimes were conceived by reason and depend on the reasonableness oftheir members. And those regimes required the reason of natural science in everyaspect of their activity, and the requirements of scientific advance largelydetermine their policy. Whether it is called liberal democracy or bourgeoissociety, whether the regime of the rights of man or that of acquisitiveness,whether technology is used in a positive or a negative sense, everyone knowsthat these terms describe the central aspects of our world. They aredemonstrably the results of the thought of a small group of men with deepinsight into the nature of things, who collaborated in an enterprise the successof which is almost beyond belief. It penetrated and informed every detail oflife. These are not men to be dismissed—but they can be questioned.SWIFT’S DOUBTSOne of the earliest questioners was Jonathan Swift, who saw what was intendedand spoke up against it in the name of the ancients and of poetry. Gulliver’sTravels is to early modern philosophy what Aristophanes’ The Clouds was to earlyancient philosophy. Gulliver’s Travels is nothing but a comic statement ofSwift’s preference for antiquity, casting his ancients as giants and noblehorses, his moderns as midgets and Yahoos. He addresses the aspect that mostconcerns us, the establishment of the academies and universities—the Republic ofLetters, to use Pierre Bayle’s expression—in the chapter entitled “A Voyage toLaputa.” Gulliver, after observing modern politics in Lilliput, goes to Laputato see modern science and its effects on life. Laputa is a flying island ruledby natural scientists. It is, of course, a parody of the British Royal Society,in Swift’s time a relatively recent association of the philosophers andscientists who had been tempted more into public and public life by modernthought. In this strange new land Gulliver finds a theoretical preoccupationabstracted from primary human concerns, one whose beginning point was not thehuman dimension, but which ends up altering it. On the Flying Island the menhave one eye turned inward, the other toward the zenith. They are perfectCartesians—one egotistical eye contemplating the self, one cosmological eyesurveying the most distant things. The intermediate range, which previously wasthe center of concentration and defined both the ego and the pattern for thestudy of the stars, is not within the Laputian purview. The only studies areastronomy and music, and the world is reduced to these two sciences. The menhave no contact with ordinary sense experiences. This is what permits them toremain content with their science. Communication with others outside theircircle is unnecessary. Rather than making their mathematics follow the naturalshapes of things, they change things so as to fit their mathematics. Their foodis cut into all sorts of geometrical figures. Their admiration for women, suchas it is, is due to the resemblance of women’s various parts to specificfigures. Jealousy is unknown to them. Their wives can commit adultery beforetheir eyes without its being noticed. This absence of eroticism is connectedwith an absence of poetic sensibility. These scientists cannot understandpoetry, and hence, in Gulliver’s view, their science cannot be a science of man.Another peculiarity of these men is described by Gulliver as follows. “What Ichiefly admired, and thought altogether unaccountable, was the strongdisposition I observed in them towards news and politics, perpetually inquiringinto public affairs, giving their judgments in matters of state and passionatelydisputing every inch of a party opinion. I have indeed observed the samedisposition among most of the mathematicians I have known in Europe, although Icould never discover the least analogy between the two sciences.” Gulliverrecognizes the political concern of theoretical science and doubts that it cancomprehend the actual practice of politics. He also thinks the scientists have asense of special right to manipulate politics. The Laputians’ political powerrests on the new science. The Flying Island is built on the principles ofphysics founded by Gilbert and Newton. Applied science can open new roads topolitical power. This island allows the king and the nobles to live free fromconspiracies by the people—in fact, free from contact with them—while stillmaking use of them and receiving the tribute that is necessary to themaintenance and leisure of the rulers. They can crush the terrestrial cities.Their power is almost unlimited and their responsibilities nil. Power isconcentrated in the hands of the rulers; hence they are not forced even by fearto develop a truly political intelligence. They require no virtue. Everythingruns itself, so there is no danger that their incompetence, indifference or vicewill harm them. Their island allows their characteristic deformity to grow tothe point of monstrosity. Science, in freeing men, destroys the naturalconditions that make them human. Hence, for the first time in history, there isthe possibility of tyranny grounded not on ignorance, but on science.Swift objects to Enlightenment because it encourages a hypertrophic developmentof mathematics, physics and astronomy, thus returning to the pre-Socraticphilosophy that Aristophanes had criticized for being unselfconscious or unableto understand man. Enlightenment rejected that moderate Socratic compromisebetween society and philosophy, poetry and science, which had governedintellectual life for so long and had made possible the foundation of politicalscience. But, unlike pre-Socratic philosophy, which had no interest in politicsat all, this science wished to rule and could rule. The new science had indeedgenerated sufficient power to rule, but in order to do so had had to lose thehuman perspective. In other words, Swift denied that modern science had actuallyestablished a human or political science. All to the contrary, it had destroyedit. Such a political science would, in the first place, have to understand manas man, and not as a geometric figure with flesh on it. In the second place, itwould have to ensure the harmony between the good of science or scientists andthat of a decent political community. On the Flying Island, neither condition ismet. In particular, the scientists exploit the nonscientists so as to live theirversion of the contemplative life in safety and comfort.More simply put, Swift says that the scientists in power and with power don’tgive a damn about mankind at large. The whole conspiracy is like any other. Thepotential tyrant speaks in the name of the common good but is seeking a privategood. Bacon’s House of Solomon in the New Atlantis is just propaganda for theFlying Island. The scientists want to live as they please—delighting in numbers,figures, and stars—and are no longer obliged to hide their desires. The peoplestill have means of making themselves felt, but they are essentially enslaved towhat scientists provide for them. The scientists can cut off the sun’s light tothe world below.There were elements of uncanny prescience in Swift’s misanthropic and crankysatire on science. Natural science very quickly withdrew from the Enlightenmentproject as a whole, leaving the human parts of it to fend for themselves. Thelaws of nature were scientific, but natural science no longer claimed to be ableto legislate human laws, leaving political science out in the cold, without arational or scientific basis. Instead of being real partners in the business ofoverthrowing the antiscientific regimes of the past, the scientists becamefellow travelers. Once theological supervision was defeated and everyoneaccepted the need for scientists instead of priests, science was free and, inprinciple, indifferent to the political regimes that need and use them. EarlyEnlightenment thinkers appear to have believed that there was a perfectcoincidence between rational consent of the governed and the freedom of science.But science could not rationalize all men, and turned out not to have to,inasmuch as it became able to force whatever rulers there are to support it andleave it alone. When there were still rulers who would in principle persecute aGalileo if they found out what he was up to—because his investigationsundermined their legitimacy, founded on sacred texts—scientists were naturalallies of all opponents of these rulers. The fascination of early modern thoughtwith the ecclesiastical authority as the one great danger to freedom of thoughtcaused the philosophers to believe that the alliance formed to overthrow it waspermanent. In the event, it turned out that once there were secular rulers whohad no absolute commitment to a nonrational or unscientific view of nature, thenonhuman part of the Enlightenment was immune. Self-interest, the great modernmotivating principle, no longer dictated concern for the other thinkers, andscience or reason, which appeared now to belong utterly to the naturalphilosopher, no longer gave the political and moral thinkers any warrant. Inshort, the common front presented by human and natural science in the name ofdemocracy became an ideology.The condition of natural science in the Soviet Union is the dreadful culminationof Swift’s prediction. It is a tyranny founded on science. And natural science,alone among the learned disciplines, and natural scientists, alone among humanbeings, have been able to force the tyrants to leave them alone. A Sovietmathematician is as much a mathematician as an American mathematician, whereas ahistorian or a political scientist must be a sham, a party hack. Natural sciencecan now flourish in the Soviet Union, because the Soviet tyrants have finallyrecognized their unconditional need of the scientists. They cannot endure thehistorians or political scientists, and they do not have to. These latter arenot of the same species as the natural scientists, either in the eyes of thenatural scientists or those of the tyrants.Most unpleasant of all is that this dreadful regime gets its power to maintainits rule from the natural sciences. As sciences they are neutral, except withrespect to what concerns their interests, and cannot judge Roosevelt to besuperior to Stalin. This would have probably been true of pre-Socratics too, butthey did not generate political power. They were indifferent to politicalregimes and provided aid and comfort to none. The new scientists are the causeof all. The pre-Socratics lived in splendid isolation as models of thetheoretical life. Natural scientists now project an ambiguous image. Althoughthey may be truly theoretical, they do not appear that way to untheoretical men.Their involvement in human things gives them a public role as curers of diseasesand inventors of nuclear weapons, as bastions of democracy and bastions oftotalitarianism. Andrei Sakharov is humanly most impressive, but his stand forhuman rights does not follow from his science and, to say the least, does notguarantee him the fellowship of other Soviet scientists. The new dispensationhas protected science; it has done nothing to give scientists control over theuses of the results of science, or the wherewithal to know how to use thoseresults, if they were indeed able to gain control over them. Natural science inthe long run won out over the Party when its results clashed with Marxistorthodoxy, but it could not control the Party’s political action. And no futuretyrant is likely to imitate Hitler’s mad doctrinairism, which caused him to sendJewish scientists to his enemies to insure his defeat. Science in that sensemoderates potential Hitlers—but only in that sense. In general it increasesman’s power without increasing his virtue, hence increasing his power to do bothgood and evil.The total picture is one of great danger resulting from the politicalinvolvement of science. Some people assert that we have to reinvent politics inorder to meet the danger. Swift tells us that politics was already reinvented bythe founders of Enlightenment, and that is the problem. It turned out thatnatural science had nothing to say about human things, about the uses of sciencefor life or about the scientist. When a poet writes about a poet, he does so asa poet. When a scientist talks about scientists, he does not do so as ascientist. If he does so, he uses none of the tools he uses in his scientificactivity, and his conclusions have none of the demonstrative character hedemands in his science. Science has broken off from the self-consciousness aboutscience that was the core of ancient science. This loss of self-consciousness issomehow connected with the banishment of poetry.ROUSEAU’S RADICALIZATION AND THE GERMANUNIVERSITYHere Rousseau bursts on the scene, just at the moment of Enlightenment’s victoryand the establishment of the institutions of learning as the crown of society.An inverse Socrates, he reasserted the permanent tension between science andsociety, arguing that scientific progress corrupts morals and hence society, andhe took the side of society. Virtue, “the science of simple souls,” is what ismost necessary, and science undermines virtue. It teaches a slack and selfishrelation to other men and to civil society, it calls into question theprinciples of virtue, and it requires a luxurious and loose society in which toflourish.The knowers who inhabit the academies lose sight of this, become easygoing andself-satisfied. The Ciceros and Bacons would not have been what they were ifthey had been professors. It was in living life as it really is, rather than inthe artificially structured and protected universities, that they were able tograsp the human situation as a whole, recognize its inner tensions and takeresponsibility, without the protective cover of a faith in progress and withoutthe vanity of society’s ignorantly bestowed honors. Professors had made reasoninto a public prejudice and were now among the prejudiced. They represented anunsatisfactory halfway house between the two harsh disciplines that make a manserious—community and solitude.Rousseau insisted on making explicit the ambiguity about the relative dignity oftheory and practice implicit in Enlightenment. Enlightenment presented thethinker not as the best man but as the most useful one. Happiness is the mostimportant thing; if thinking is not happiness, it must be judged by itsrelationship to happiness. It is, Rousseau argues, more than doubtful thatscience produces happiness. Moreover, although Hobbes and Locke teach that manis rational, his rationality is in the service of passions or sentiments, whichare more fundamental than reason. Thinking through their position that man isnaturally a solitary being results in the recognition that speech, the conditionof reason, is not natural to man. Man’s specific difference from the otheranimals cannot, therefore, be reason. Enlightenment misunderstands both reasonand feeling.Rousseau’s reasoning and rhetoric were so potent that hardly anyone who thought,as well as many who did not, could avoid his influence. After him, community,virtue, compassion, feeling, enthusiasm, the beautiful and the sublime, and evenimagination, the banished faculty, had their innings against modern philosophyand science. The fringe bohemian, the sentimentalist, the artist became at leastas much the teacher and the model as the scientist. Inspired by Rousseau, Kantundertook a systematic overhauling of Enlightenment’s project in such a way asto make coherent the relationship between theory and practice, reason andmorality, science and poetry, all of which had been made so problematic byRousseau. Kant’s survey of the whole of knowledge can also be read as a projectfor the fruitful coexistence of the disciplines in the universities. Rousseauhad pointed out that the ancient tension between the thinker and society,supposedly resolved by Enlightenment, had resurfaced in new and very dangerousways. Kant tried again to resolve it.He, too, agreed that natural science had read free, moral, artistic man out ofnature. He did not try to reform natural science, to translate man back intonature after the fashion of the ancients. What he did was to demonstrate thatnature, as understood by natural science, does not comprehend the whole ofthings. There are other realms, not grasped or graspable by natural science,which are real and leave a place for the reality of the experience of humanity.Reason does not have to be abandoned to defend humanity, for reason candemonstrate that science has limits that it did not know, and reason candemonstrate the possibility of a freedom illegitimately denied by naturalscience. Possibility and ground become the themes in Kant, for much that ishuman had begun to appear to be impossible and groundless.Kant accepted Rousseau’s reasoning that freedom must be what distinguishes man,that it is denied by the kind of causation accepted in natural science, and thattherefore the practical life, the exercise of moral freedom, is higher than thetheoretical life, the use of scientific reason. In one of the most arduous andpowerful theoretical efforts undertaken by man, he tried to demonstrate thatnature is not all, that reason and spontaneity are not contraries. All this isestablished by reason, not by passion against reason. That effort lives in thethree Critiques, the last great statement of liberal Enlightenment, the otherstrand of rationalism that coexists in the universities withBaconian-Cartesian-Lockean rationalism. The primary effort is to set limits topure reason, to say to “proud reason, ‘this far and no further,’” in such a waythat reason will submit rationally. Kant’s critical philosophy does not dictateto science what it must discover; it establishes the limits within which purereason operates. It does the same for practical reason, thus turning DavidHumer’s distinction between the is and the ought from a humiliation for moralreasoning into the basis for its triumph and its dignity. It further establishesthe faculty of judgment, which can again allow man to speak about ends and thebeautiful.In this system not only does natural science have a secure place in the order ofthe university, but so also do morals and esthetics. However, the unity of theuniversity is now Kant. These three kinds of knowledge (the true, the good, thebeautiful in new guises) are given their domains by the three Critiques, but arenot unified by being knowledge of aspects of a single reality. Aristotle’s humansciences are part of the science of nature, and his knowledge of man isconnected to and in harmony with his knowledge of the stars, bodies in motionand animals other than man. This is not the case with the human sciences afterRousseau, which depend on the existence of a realm entirely different fromnature. Their study is not part of the study of nature, and the two kinds ofstudy have little to do with one another.This new condition of the learned disciplines, which found its earliestexpression in the German universities at the beginning of the nineteenth centuryand gradually spread throughout the Western universities, at first proved veryfertile. The progress of the natural sciences, now unimpeded by theological orpolitical supervision and emancipated from philosophy, continued and became evenmore rapid. And the human sciences, given a fresh vocation, came to a newflowering, especially in historical and philological studies. Man understood asa free, moral individual—as creative, as producer of cultures, as maker andproduct of history—provided a field for humane research taking man seriously asman, not reduced to the moved bodies that now constituted the realm of naturalscience. The serious goal that is necessary to make scholarship vital wasprovided by the sense that man could be understood by his historical origins;that moral and political standards could be derived from the historicaltraditions of the various nations, to replace the failed standards of naturalright and law; that the study of high culture, particularly that of Greece,would provide the models for modern achievement; that a proper understanding ofreligion might provide a faith proof against critical reason. Scholars, for thatmoment, more than at any time since the Renaissance, seemed to be in the serviceof life, to be as useful as soldiers, doctors and workers. The great movementsof careful historical research and textual criticism initiated in this heyday ofthe nineteenth century gave us nourishment which we have yet entirely to digest.The humanities took over the whole burden of instructing us about man,especially in morals and esthetics (the new science of the beautiful and thesublime).However, the very condition of this exhilaration in the human sciences—thedualism nature-freedom—created problems from the outset and in the long runundermined the confidence of their practitioners or turned them back into mereerudites again. There was a haunting doubt as to the reality of the realm offreedom, which seemed to restore the richness of the phenomenon man. What arethe relations between the two realms? At what point does the natural in man stopand the free begin? Is it really possible to limit the claims of naturalscience? Within Kant’s system, if scientists can, as they claim, in the long runpredict the behavior of all phenomena, can one plausibly postulate a noumenalfreedom, the expressions of which are predictable in the phenomenal field? Doesnot natural science presuppose mechanical causation, determinism and thereduction of all higher phenomena to lower ones, the complex to the simple, anddo not the successes of that science in astronomy, physics, chemistry andbiology attest to the truth of its presuppositions? New discoveries orspeculations such as evolution called into question the independent ornonderivative character of mind. The very faculty that made it possible to setthe limits of science and reason in the Critique of Pure Reason proved to bejust another accidental effect of evolving matter. The ground of morals andesthetics disappeared. Natural science continued to seem substantial, whileromanticism and idealism inhabited imaginary cities, sublime hopes but littlemore. Pessimism as a philosophical school came onto the scene. Joined to thehealth and expansiveness of natural science was the recognition that humanelearning had itself failed to generate moral and political standards. All thestudy of the facts of national history and the invention of “folk-minds” couldnot provide guidance for the future, or imperatives for conduct. The learningwas impressive, but it looked more and more to be the product of idle curiosityrather than the quest for knowledge of what is most needful. Philosophy, nolonger a part of, or required by, natural science, was nudged over toward thehumanities and even became just another historical subject. Its claim to be theruler in the university no longer earned respect. There was a condominium withno higher unity. The humane learning could argue for equal rights and was tosome extent formally accorded them, but that began to be “academic” and havelittle to do with the way things looked in the real world. The natural scientistwas both the image of the knower and the public benefactor; the humanist, aprofessor.The problem of the knower in the perspective of the modern understanding wasformulated over and over again from the beginning of the modern universitydispensation by the man, not a member of the German university, who, along withKant, most influenced it—Goethe. A classic summation of his views is to be foundin Faust, the only modern book that can be said to have made a national heroicmodel to rival those of Homer, Virgil, Dante and Shakespeare. The scholar Faust,meditating in his cell, translates the first line of the Gospel According toJohn, “In the beginning was the word (logos)”; then, dissatisfied with thedescription he says “the feeling,” which also does not quite do; finally anddefinitively he chooses to reinterpret it as “the deed.” Action has primacy overcontemplation, deed over speech. He who understands must imitate the beginnings.The act of the creator, not preceded and controlled by thought, is the firstthing. The scholar with his reason misunderstands the origin because he lacksthe vital force that lies behind the order of things. He trifles, piling upfacts from which the informing principle has been extracted. Faust’s relation tothe perpetual studier Wagner, who says he already knows much but wants to knoweverything, is paradigmatic. Only knowledge that serves life is good, and lifeis in the first place constituted by dark action, by fatal impulse. Knowledgecomes afterward and lightens the world made by the deed. As painted by Goethe,Wagner looks slight and feeble. His idle love of knowledge is superficialcompared to Faust’s inchoate impulses. Although the opposition between the vitaactiva and the vita contemplativa is as old as philosophy, if not older,Goethe’s moment is the first where the side of action is taken by theory itself,thus announcing the end of the ancient opposition. The theoretical life isgroundless because the first thing is not the intelligible order but the chaosopen to creativity. There can be no contemplation where there is nothing to see.Goethe took full account of the modern situation of knower and poet and put aquestion mark after learning that is not subordinate to the ends of lifeenhancement. In antiquity there had also been mere scholars, studying Homer andPlato without knowing quite why, and without being interested in the questionsthe writers raised, fascinated by meters or the reliability of texts. But theobjection to these scholars was that they lacked the urgent desire to know themost important things, whereas the modern objection to scholarship is that itlacks the urgency of commitment to action. Most simply, the historian—the verymodel of the modern scholar—chronicles deeds. But if deeds are the mostimportant thing, then the scholar is by definition inferior to the doer.Moreover, such a reasoner is incapable of the leap into darkness that the deeddemands. Finally, if the doer is not a thinker, then it is doubtful whether thethinker can understand the doer. Does one not have to be akin to Caesar tounderstand him? To say that one does not have to be Caesar to understand him isequivalent to saying that one does not have to be anything to understandeverything. The hidden premise of the realm of freedom is that action hasprimacy over thought. As Goethe saw, the modern scholarly giant has feet ofclay. It is also blind because it is lacking objects of cognition—as do allsciences—where there is only darkness.The problem of scholarship is best illustrated in classical scholarship. Thestudy of ancient Greece and Rome used to be the scholarly discipline parexcellence, at times igniting brilliantly and illuminating the world, at othersflickering and almost being extinguished. The study of the ancients has followedthe ebb and flow of philosophic innovation in the West. Moments of greattransformation have started with refreshment at the Greek source, itsinspiration slaking a burning thirst. An overwhelming sense that something ismissing is the serious motive for authentic, therefore careful and exhaustive,recovery of what has been lost. Greece provides the assurance that there wassomething better than what is. When the old treasures have been digested and theinnovators are satisfied that they can walk on their own, the ancient seems lessnecessary and degenerates into habitual learning, a monument rather than aguiding light. The intoxicating atmosphere of the Renaissance, the rebirth ofGreece, always possible because of its universality and the permanence of humannature, culminated in a specifically modern thought—beginning from Machiavelli’scareful study and criticism of both Greeks and Romans—which could proudly assertits superiority to its ancient inspirers, winning the quarrel between theancient and the modern.Rousseau initiated a second Renaissance when he expressed his dissatisfactionwith modernity, made possible by his knowledge of the Greek and Roman examples.“Ancient statesmen spoke endlessly of morals and virtue; ours speak only ofcommerce and money.” Rousseau’s use of his knowledge of antiquity—which was,although not scholarly, very profound—is a perfect model of the reason forhaving ancient thought available to those great individuals who, as Nietzscheput it, are untimely and need a vantage point from which to get their bearingsand become the most timely of all. It is the old Greeks who make men bothuntimely and timely in crises. Nothing fancy, no infinite searching outside; thebook in itself always intelligible, as long as human nature remains the same.This is the role played by the Greek authors throughout the wildly varying agessince they wrote, always Phoenix-like when they appear to have been consumed andare only ashes conserved by the scholars.Rousseau’s fervent appeal for modern man to look back to the ancient city,because it was whole and a true community, was the source of the romanticlonging to breathe the fresh air of Greece again. Its moral and esthetic healthwas what Rousseau conveyed so convincingly. He gave the impulse to all kinds ofattempts at new communitarian beginnings, from Robespierre to Owen to Tolstoyand the kibbutz, an impulse still alive in contemporary thought. But most ofall, as I have discussed earlier, his observations on the tension betweenEnlightenment and decent politics gave birth to the idea of culture. It was tothe study of Greece or Sparta or Athens as models of cultures that Rousseau’sreflection led. The motive for this study—which flourished particularly inGermany, where Rousseau’s influence was most strongly felt, precisely because ofKant’s and Goethe’s predominance there—was to understand culture, with a view tothe founding of a German culture. It was primarily Greek and Roman poetry andsecondarily history to which the German thinkers turned for inspiration, and thescholars followed. It was distinctly not Greek philosophy. This was evident inRousseau himself. The philosophers whose theoretical reflection was necessary tohim were Bacon, Descartes and Newton, not Plato and Aristotle. The latter twojust did not know the truth about nature. Whatever interest later scholarshiphad in them was as parts of Greek culture, as typical expressions of it and lessinteresting than poets, who are culture founders. The Greek philosophers werenot valid interlocutors. Rousseau admired Plato and thought he had deep insightinto human things, but rather more as a poet than a philosopher or scientist.Plato was indeed the philosopher for lovers, but Rousseau, without consultingPlato, taught that eros is the child of sex and imagination. Its activity ispoetry, the source of what Rousseau understood to be the life-creating and-enhancing illusions and thereby the source of the ultimate grounds of thefolk-minds that make peoples possible. In Plato, eros led to philosophy, whichin turn led to the rational quest for the best regime, the one good politicalorder vs. the plurality of cultures. So the discovery of Greek “culture” wascontrary to Greek philosophy. And this particular difference, concerning thebest regime as opposed to culture, proved fatal to reason. We can recognize thisin a preliminary way in Weber’s assumption that it is values rather than reasonsthat found and sustain communities.Thus from the outset of this second Renaissance, scholars treated Greekphilosophers more as natural scientists treat atoms than as they treat othernatural scientists. They were not invited to join the serious discussion of thescholars. All things Greek were subjected to our analysis based on the views ofmodern philosophy. This procedure alters radically what one expects to learnfrom them. Men of the Enlightenment looked down on Greek thinkers because theythought them wrong. Romantics respected them because their truth or falsitybecame a matter of indifference.Schiller’s distinction between naive and sentimental poetry is an example of thekind of categorization that became common. Homer’s charm is a result of his nothaving seen what we see, his unawareness of the abyss. He still walked onenchanted ground, and his poetry lacked that reflectiveness imposed on us whoknow that the gods can depart. He was unaware of the death of gods and culturesas children are unaware of the death of men. He lived in the youth of the world.If we are to be whole and happy we must recover that direct relation to thingsmen once had. But we must do it in the company of our awareness of thevulnerability of things. The artist has a greater responsibility than Homer knewbecause he does not merely imitate nature but creates it. A successful modernartist would be deeper, more fully self-conscious than was Homer.The naive Homer belonged to a culture different from that of the sentimentalSchiller, and has to be understood in his own cultural context. Naiveté consistsin large measure in the lack of “historical consciousness,” the belief that thegreats are individuals to be understood individually and in the same way at alltimes. Plutarch believed he was showing forth images of greatness itself, whilein fact his heroes are just Greeks and Romans, high expressions of theirculture, from which they are inseparable. The awareness of this is thepeculiarly modern superiority or insight.Schiller was, of course, an unusually profound and sensitive reader. It isdoubtful whether his reading of Homer teaches us very much about Homer, becauseit is too encumbered by what we now believe to be Romantic prejudices. ButHomer, interpreted and misinterpreted by Schiller, contributed to his ownartistic creation, which was founding a German literature and a German culture.It is an example of what some would call “creative misinterpretation.” The faithin one’s own vision, perhaps fed by the inspiration of others’ visions, is whatis important. An act uninformed by learning is the important thing. Implicit inwhat I am saying is that while Schiller’s views are not true but are productive,there are true views, known presumably to scholars, which are not productive.This is what Goethe implies. The scholar is an objective reasoner, the poet asubjective creator.Here is where Nietzsche enters, arguing with unparalleled clarity and vigor thatif we take “historical consciousness” seriously, there cannot be objectivity,that scholarship as we know it is simply a delusion, and a dangerous one, forobjectivity undermines subjectivity. All of classical scholarship in Germany,with its exquisite sense of the historical determination of the mind, proceededas though the mind of the German scholar were not so determined. The discoveryof culture and the folk-mind means that there cannot be universal principles ofunderstanding. Reason is a myth that makes mythmaking impossible to comprehend.Creativity and a science of human things cannot coexist, and since the scienceof human things admits that man is creative, the creative man wins the day. Butscholars cannot behave creatively.The discovery of culture as the element in which man becomes himself produces animperative: Build and sustain culture. This the scholar cannot do. Culture isnot only the condition of life, it is the condition of knowing. Without a Germanculture, the scholar in Germany cannot confront other cultures.After the great moment in German thought—of Kant, Goethe, Schiller and Hegel, inwhich the rediscovery of Greece played so important a role—Greek scholarshipretired to the universities, where it was again a dead piece of learning, unableitself to inspire or produce a compelling vision that could transform men. Itbecame studied by bourgeois professors who educated bourgeois men for whom, aswith Aschenbach, the Greeks were just “culture.” The Greek splendor, which hadformed such heroic figures just a half-century earlier, became a mystery.Nietzsche, acutely aware of this splendor and its disappearance from the scene,blamed the scholars, or rather blamed something that informed scholarship. Aclassical scholar who certainly would have been among the greatest who everlived if he had not been called to philosophy, Nietzsche attempted the lastgreat return to the Greeks. Like his German predecessors, he returned to Greekpoetry in particular. But he coupled his taste for the tragedies with somethingvery new—a radical attack on Socrates, the founder of the tradition ofrationalism, which is the essence of the university. This is probably the firstattack made by a philosopher on Socrates, and it is a violent one, continuingthroughout Nietzsche’s whole career. What is fascinating for us in this is thatNietzsche, and Heidegger following him, are the first modern thinkers since thedays of Hobbes, Spinoza and Descartes to take Socrates—or any classicalphilosopher’s teaching—really seriously as an opponent, as a living opponent8rather than as a cultural artifact. Socrates is alive and must be overcome. Itis essential to recognize that this is the issue in Nietzsche. It is not ahistorical or cultural question. It is simply a classic philosophic disputation:Was Socrates right or wrong? Nietzsche’s indictment of Socrates is that hisrationalism, his utilitarianism, subverted and explained away that greatstupidity which is noble instinct. He destroyed the tragic sense of life, whichintuited man’s true situation amidst things and allowed for creative forming oflife against the terror of existence, unendowed with and unguided by anypre-existing forms or patterns. Instinct or fatality, prior to reason andvulnerable to reason, establishes the table of laws or valuations within whichhealthy reason works. A darkness on top of a void is the condition of life andcreation, and it is dispelled in the light of rational analysis. The poet, inhis act of creation, knows this. The scientist and the scholar never do. The actof creation is what forms cultures and folk-minds. There cannot be, as Socratesbelieved, the pure mind, which is trans-historical. This belief is thefundamental premise and error of science, an error that becomes manifestly fatalin dealing with human things. The method of the sciences is designed to see onlywhat is everywhere and always, whereas what is particular and emergent is allthat counts historically and culturally. Homer is not merely one example of anepic, or the Bible of a revealed text, but that is what science sees them as,and the only reason it is interested in them. The scholar turns away from themto comparative religion or comparative literature, i.e., either to indifferenceor to a flabby ecumenism compounded out of the lowest common denominator of avariety of old and incompatible creations. The scholar cannot understand thetexts that he purports to interpret and explain. Schiller might be able to graspthe essence of the Iliad because as a creator he is akin to Homer. He could notunderstand Homer as Homer understood himself, because his mind was of adifferent historical epoch. But he could understand what it means to be a poet.A scholar can do neither. From the point of view of life, and from the point ofview of truth, modern scholarship is a failure. Hegel ridicules the typicalGerman gymnasium teacher who explains that Alexander the Great had apathological love of power. The teacher proves the assertion by the fact thatAlexander conquered the world. The teacher’s freedom from this illness isattested to by the fact that he has not conquered the world. This storyencapsulates Nietzsche’s criticism of the German university and its classicalscholarship. The scholar cannot understand the will to power, not a causerecognized by science, which made Alexander different from others, because thescholar neither has it nor does his method permit him to have it or see it. Thescholar could never conquer the mind of man.Nietzsche’s return to the example of the ancients, and his rigorous drawing ofthe consequences of what German humane scholarship really believed, had astunning effect on German university life and on the German respect for reasonaltogether. Artists received a new license, and even philosophy began toreinterpret itself as a form of art. The poets won the old war betweenphilosophy and poetry, in which Socrates had been philosophy’s champion.Nietzsche’s war on the university led in two directions—either to an abandonmentof the university by serious men, or to its reform to make it play a role in thecreation of culture. The university ruled by Hegel, the modern Aristotle, had tobe reconstituted, as the discredited medieval university had been made over bythe now discredited Enlightenment university.Nietzsche’s effect was immediately felt by artists in all Western countries. Hewas the rage from 1890 on, and hardly any important painter, poet or novelistwas immune to his charm. But his Hellenism had relatively little effect on thatart. They took his characterization of modern culture and the conclusions of hisarguments about the causes of its decadence and set about either popularizingthem or attempting to found new cultures in various schools. They explored thefreshly opened terrain of the id, seeking new forms. In the universitiesNietzsche’s first influences were to be found in relatively marginal or newdisciplines like sociology or psychology, none of which was deeply influenced byGreek or Roman models. Within the study of classics a new generation of scholarsturned more to the study of religion and poetry, concentrating on Greece priorto Socrates and on the irrational in its writers. In philosophy Nietzsche wasthe source of various schools of phenomenology and existentialism, and hefinally became academically respectable.But it was Heidegger, practically alone, for whom the study of Greek philosophybecame truly central, a pressing concern for his meditation on being. Heidegger,following Nietzsche, had cast the most radical doubt on the whole enterprise ofmodern philosophy and science. A new beginning was imperative, and he turnedwith open mind to the ancients. But he did not focus on Plato orAristotle—although he reflected on them and was a most ingenious interpreter ofthem—because Nietzsche had dealt with them by way of Socrates. Heidegger wasdrawn instead to the pre-Socratic philosophers, from whom he hoped to discoveranother understanding of being to help him replace the exhausted one inheritedfrom Plato and Aristotle, which he and Nietzsche thought to be at the root ofboth Christianity and modern science.Strangely, the Hellenism of Heidegger did not give a strong impulse to the studyof Greek philosophy. This may have something to do with the effects of the warand Heidegger’s disgrace. He, too, had to reenter respectability by literarybackdoors and on the wings of the very respectable academic Left. Neithercarrier was much interested in the profound reflection on the ancients, whichgave him his perspective on the contemporary scene. This popularizing made hayout of his description of our situation. The intellectuals who admired Heideggertook for granted, as neither he nor Nietzsche did, that Plato and Aristotle arenot worthy of our serious concern. But that is where the issue lies. AreNietzsche and Heidegger right about Plato and Aristotle? They rightly saw thatthe question is here, and both returned obsessively to Socrates. Our rationalismis his rationalism. Perhaps they did not take seriously enough the changeswrought by the modern rationalists and hence the possibility that the Socraticway might have avoided the modern impasse. But certainly all the philosophers,the proponents of reason, have something in common, and more or less directlyreach back to Aristotle, Socrates’ spiritual grandchild. A serious argumentabout what is most profoundly modern leads inevitably to the conclusion thatstudy of the problem of Socrates is the one thing most needful.9 It was Socrateswho made Nietzsche and Heidegger look to the pre-Socratics. For the first timein four hundred years, it seems possible and imperative to begin all over again,to try to figure out what Plato was talking about, because it might be the bestthing available.The history of classics since the Renaissance has consisted in momentaryglimpses of the importance of Greece for man as man, everywhere and always,followed by long periods of merely scholarly study without any sufficient reasonfor it, living off the gradually dying energy provided by the originalphilosophic dynamos. Up to Nietzsche, the neglect of and contempt for Plato andAristotle was the result of a belief that what they tried to do could be donemuch better. That is why Socrates was always in good repute. He was theskeptical seeker after the way to knowledge by means of unaided reason. He wasnot tied to any solution or system and thus could be seen as the originator andthe inspirer who did not constrain the freedom of posterity. The currentcontempt for Plato and Aristotle is of an entirely different kind, for it isallied to contempt for Socrates. He corrupted them; they did not pervert him. Wedid not progress from Socrates, but he marked the beginning of the decline.Reason itself is rejected by philosophy itself. Thus the common thread of thewhole tradition has been broken, and with it the raison d’être of the universityas we know it.Thus it was no accident that Heidegger came forward just after Hitler’saccession to power to address the university community in Freiburg as the newrector, and urged commitment to National Socialism. His argument was not withoutsubtlety and its own special kind of irony, but in sum the decision to devotewholeheartedly the life of the mind to an emerging revelation of being,incarnated in a mass movement, was what Heidegger encouraged. That he did so wasnot a result of his political innocence but a corollary of his critique ofrationalism. That is why I have entitled this section “From Socrates’ Apology toHeidegger’s Rektoratsrede.” The university began in spirit from Socrates’contemptuous and insolent distancing of himself from the Athenian people, hisrefusal to accept any command from them to cease asking, “What is justice? Whatis knowledge? What is a god?” and hence doubting the common opinions about suchquestions, and in his serious game (in the Republic) of trying to impose therule of philosophers on an unwilling people without respect for their “culture.”The university may have come near to its death when Heidegger joined the Germanpeople—especially the youngest part of that people, which he said had alreadymade an irreversible commitment to the future—and put philosophy at the serviceof German culture. If I am right in believing that Heidegger’s teachings are themost powerful intellectual force in our times, then the crisis of the Germanuniversity, which everyone saw, is the crisis of the university everywhere.It may be thought that I have devoted too much space to this idiosyncratichistory of the university. But the university, of all institutions, is mostdependent on the deepest beliefs of those who participate in its peculiar life.Our present educational problems cannot seriously be attributed to badadministrators, weakness of will, lack of discipline, lack of money,insufficient attention to the three R’s, or any of the other common explanationsthat indicate things will be set aright if we professors would just pull up oursocks. All these things are the result of a deeper lack of belief in theuniversity’s vocation. One cannot say that we must defend academic freedom whenthere are grave doubts about the principles underlying academic freedom. Tomarch out to battle on behalf of the university may be noble, but it is only apatriotic gesture. Such gestures are necessary and useful for nations, but theydo little for universities. Thought is all in all for universities. Today thereis precious little thought about universities, and what there is does notunequivocally support the university’s traditional role. In order to find outwhy we have fallen on such hard times, we must recognize that the foundations ofthe university have become extremely doubtful to the highest intelligences. Ourpetty tribulations have great causes. What happened to the universities inGermany in the thirties is what has happened and is happening everywhere. Theessence of it all is not social, political, psychological or economic, butphilosophic. And, for those who wish to see, contemplation of Socrates is ourmost urgent task. This is properly an academic task.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------8 [021.html#f8p3ch1s6_8] Hegel, of course, studied ancient philosophy very well,but to incorporate it into modernity. It was not for him an enemy, and as afriend it was incomplete or imperfect.9 [021.html#f9p3ch1s6_9] Cf. Werner J. Dannhauser, Nietzsche’s View of Socrates,Cornell, 1974."},{"pageContent":"THE SIXTIES“You don’t have to intimidate us,” said the famous professor of philosophy inApril 1969, to ten thousand triumphant students supporting a group of blackstudents who had just persuaded “us,” the faculty of Cornell University, to dotheir will by threatening the use of firearms as well as threatening the livesof individual professors. A member of the ample press corps newly specialized inreporting the hottest item of the day, the university, muttered, “You said it,brother.” The reporter had learned a proper contempt for the moral andintellectual qualities of professors. Servility, vanity and lack of convictionare not difficult to discern.The professors, the repositories of our best traditions and highest intellectualaspirations, were fawning over what was nothing better than a rabble; publiclyconfessing their guilt and apologizing for not having understood the mostimportant moral issues, the proper response to which they were learning from themob; expressing their willingness to change the university’s goals and thecontent of what they taught. As I surveyed this spectacle, Marx’s overuseddictum kept coming to my mind against my will: History always repeats itself,the first time as tragedy, the second as farce. The American university in thesixties was experiencing the same dismantling of the structure of rationalinquiry as had the German university in the thirties. No longer believing intheir higher vocation, both gave way to a highly ideologized student populace.And the content of the ideology was the same—value commitment. The universityhad abandoned all claim to study or inform about value—undermining the sense ofthe value of what it taught, while turning over the decision about values to thefolk, the Zeitgeist, the relevant. Whether it be Nuremberg or Woodstock, theprinciple is the same. As Hegel was said to have died in Germany in 1933,Enlightenment in America came close to breathing its last during the sixties.The fact that the universities are no longer in convulsions does not mean thatthey have regained their health. As in Germany, the value crisis in philosophymade the university prey to whatever intense passion moved the masses. It wentcomfortably along until there was a popular fit of moralism, and then becameaware that it had nothing to contribute and was persuaded by a guilty sense thatits distance from the world made it immoral. Hardly any element in theuniversity believed seriously that its distance was based on something true andnecessary, the self-confident possession of the kinds of standpoint outside ofpublic opinion that made it easy for Socrates to resist the pious fanaticism ofthe Athenian people who put their victorious generals to death after Arginusae,or to refuse to collaborate with the Athenian tyrants. Socrates thought it moreimportant to discuss justice, to try to know what it is, than to engage himselfin implementing whatever partial perspective on it happened to be exciting thepassions of the day, causing the contemplative to be called unjust and impious.Of course anyone who is a professional contemplative holding down a prestigiousand well-paying job, and who also believes there is nothing to contemplate,finds himself in a difficult position with respect to himself and to thecommunity. The imperative to promote equality, stamp out racism, sexism andelitism (the peculiar crimes of our democratic society), as well as war, isoverriding for a man who can define no other interest worthy of defending. Thefact that in Germany the politics were of the Right and in the United States ofthe Left should not mislead us. In both places the universities gave way underthe pressure of mass movements, and did so in large measure because they thoughtthose movements possessed a moral truth superior to any the university couldprovide. Commitment was understood to be profounder than science, passion thanreason, history than nature, the young than the old. In fact, as I have argued,the thought was really the same. The New Left in America was aNietzscheanized-Heideggerianized Left. The unthinking hatred of “bourgeoissociety” was exactly the same in both places. A distinguished professor ofpolitical science proved this when he read to his radical students some speechesabout what was to be done. They were enthusiastic until he informed them thatthe speeches were by Mussolini. Heidegger himself, late in his life, madeovertures to the New Left. The most sinister formula in his Rectoral Address of1933 was, with only the slightest of alterations, the slogan of the Americanprofessors who collaborated with the student movements of the sixties: “The timefor decision is past. The decision has already been made by the youngest part ofthe German nation.”At Cornell and elsewhere in the United States, it was farce because—whatever thelong-range future of our polity—the mass of the country (there really was nomass but a citizenry) was at that moment unusually respectful of theuniversities, regarded them as resources for the improvement of Americans, andaccepted the notion that scholarship should be left undisturbed and was likelyto produce a great range of views that should be treated seriously and withtolerance. The nation was not ready for great changes and believed aboutuniversities the things professors professed to believe about them. A fewstudents discovered that pompous teachers who catechized them about academicfreedom could, with a little shove, be made into dancing bears. Children tend tobe rather better observers of adults’ characters than adults are of children’s,because children are so dependent on adults that it is very much in theirinterest to discover the weaknesses of their elders. These students discernedthat their teachers did not really believe that freedom of thought wasnecessarily a good and useful thing, that they suspected all this was ideologyprotecting the injustices of our “system,” and that they could be pressured intobenevolence toward violent attempts to change the ideology. Heidegger was fullyaware that the theoretical foundations of academic freedom had been weakenedand, as I have said, treated the mass movement he faced with a certain irony.The American professors were not aware of what they no longer believed, and theytook ever so seriously the movements they were entangled with.I became fully aware of this when I went to see Cornell’s then provost (wholater became president when the unfavorable national publicity continued and theusually passive trustees asked for the resignation of the incumbent because thenational publicity about the guns appeared to be damaging the university’sreputation), concerning a black student whose life had been threatened by ablack faculty member when the student refused to participate in a demonstration.The provost was a former natural scientist, and he greeted me with a mournfulcountenance. He, of course, fully sympathized with the young man’s plight.However, things were bad, and there was nothing he could do to stop suchbehavior in the black student association. He, personally, hoped there wouldsoon be better communication with the radical black students (this was a fewweeks before the guns emerged and permitted much clearer communication). But forthe time being the administration had to wait to hear what the blacks wanted,10in the expectation that tensions could be reduced. He added that no universityin the country could expel radical black students, or dismiss the facultymembers who incited them, presumably because the students at large would notpermit it.I saw that this had been a useless undertaking on my part. The provost had amixture of cowardice and moralism not uncommon at the time. He did not wanttrouble. His president had frequently cited Clark Kerr’s dismissal at theUniversity of California as the great danger. Kerr had not known how toconciliate the students. At the same time the provost thought he was engaged ina great moral work, righting the historic injustice done to blacks. He couldjustify to himself the humiliation he was undergoing as a necessary sacrifice.The case of this particular black student clearly bothered him.11 But he wasboth more frightened of the violence-threatening extremists and also moreadmiring of them. Obvious questions were no longer obvious: Why could not ablack student be expelled as a white student would be if he failed his coursesor disobeyed the rules that make university community possible? Why could thepresident not call the police if order was threatened? Any man of weight wouldhave fired the professor who threatened the life of the student. The issue wasnot complicated. Only the casuistry of weakness and ideology made it so.Ordinary decency dictated the proper response. No one who knew or cared aboutwhat a university is would have acquiesced in this travesty. It was no surprisethat a few weeks later—immediately after the faculty had voted overwhelminglyunder the gun to capitulate to outrageous demands that it had a few days earlierrejected—the leading members of the administration and many well-known facultymembers rushed over to congratulate the gathered students and tried to win theirapproval. I saw exposed before all the world what had long been known, and itwas at last possible without impropriety to tell these pseudo-universitariansprecisely what one thought of them.It was also no surprise that many of those professors who had been most eloquentin their sermons about the sanctity of the university, and who had presentedthemselves as its consciences, were among those who reacted, if not favorably,at least weakly to what was happening. They had made careers out of saying howbadly the German professors had reacted to violations of academic freedom. Thiswas all light talk and mock heroics, because they had not measured the potentialthreats to the university nor assessed the doubtful grounds of academic freedom.Above all, they did not think that it could be assaulted from the Left or fromwithin the university, although serious examination of the events in Germanywould have taught them that it was indeed the university youth, as Heideggerpointed out, who had become disenchanted on theoretical grounds with the oldeducation, and that much of the same thing had been going on here. The societyat large had gradually been persuaded of the justice of liberal notions ofintellectual freedom just as the first waves of doubt about them from Europewere smacking against our shores. A conviction of the self-evidence ofEnlightenment principles to all thinking people, combined with simplisticeconomic and psychological explanations, permitted American professors tomisinterpret the German experience and to avoid the fact that the theoreticalcritique of morality in all its forms had been the precondition of theacceptability of certain kinds of public speech in Germany during the twenties.These American professors were utterly disarmed, as were many German professors,when the constituency that they took for granted, of which they honestlybelieved they were independent, deserted or turned against them. Students andcolleagues wanted to radicalize and politicize the university. To fulminateagainst Bible Belt preachers was one thing. In the world that counted for theseprofessors, this could only bring approval. But to be isolated in theuniversity, to be called foul names by their students or their colleagues, allfor the sake of an abstract idea, was too much for them. They were not ingeneral strong men, although their easy rhetoric had persuaded them that theywere—that they alone manned the walls protecting civilization. Their collapsewas merely pitiful, although their feeble attempts at self-justificationfrequently turned vicious. In Germany the professors who kept quiet had the verygood excuse that they could not do otherwise. Speaking up would have meantimprisonment or death. The law not only did not protect them but was theirdeadly enemy. At Cornell there was no such danger. A couple of professors mighthave been hurt (inasmuch as those who had been dubbed racists,12 a qualificationequivalent to heretic in earlier times, were utterly abandoned by all but a fewpersons of decent instincts, and the president was in no way disposed to protectanyone other than himself), but one shot fired would have brought the civilauthorities in. Those authorities were only restrained by respect for thespecial autonomous status of the university, which was being exploited toprotect and encourage violators of academic freedom as well as of the law thatgoverns ordinary mortals. There was essentially no risk in defending theintegrity of the university, because the danger was entirely within it. All thatwas lacking was a professorial corps aware of the university’s purpose, anddedicated to it. That is what made the surrender so contemptible. The officialideology became that there had been no danger to the threatened professors (thusno need for solidarity with them) and also that there was severe danger ofviolence and death (thus a need for capitulation).One of the pious sermonizers who failed to speak out and who fancied himself apolitical philosopher wrote an article for The New York Times Magazineexplaining to the world why capitulation had been necessary at Cornell. The“social contract,” he averred, was about to be broken, and we would havereturned to “the state of nature,” the war of all against all, the worst evil,so that anything to keep that from happening was justified. He proved therewiththat he had never understood what he had been teaching, for the contracttheorists (from whose teachings the American form of government was derived) alltaught that the law must never be broken, that the strength of the law is theonly thing that keeps us away from the state of nature, therefore that risks anddangers must be accepted for the sake of the law. Once the law is broken withimpunity, each man regains the right to any means he deems proper or necessaryin order to defend himself against the new tyrant, the one who can break thelaw. Such frivolous use, as was made by this professor, of the teachings thatmust be understood if there is to be a reasonable political order is emblematicof the real problem that lay behind all of this disruption of university life.Serious discussion of political problems and thought had almost been forgotten;and those to whom it was entrusted had no abiding concern for such discussion.The tradition was only a set of slogans or quotations from Bartlett’s.Reflection about civil society and the university’s role within it had witheredaway.There were two results of the campus disruptions. The university wasincorporated much more firmly into the system of democratic public opinion, andthe condition of cavelike darkness amidst prosperity feared by Tocqueville wasbrought painfully near. When the dust settled it could be seen that the verydistinction between educated and uneducated in America had been leveled, thateven the pitiful remnant of it expressed in the opposition between highbrow andlowbrow had been annihilated. The real product was the homogenized personsdescribed in Part One. The very ideas of truly different goals and motives ofaction that we can really take seriously, incarnated not only in systems ofthought but in real and poetic models, began to disappear.Freedom had been restricted in the most effective way—by the impoverishment ofalternatives. Nothing that was not known to or experienced by those whoconstitute the enormous majority—which is ultimately the only authority inAmerica—had any reality. Catering to democracy’s most dangerous and vulgartemptations was the function of the famous “critical philosophy.” Thus thisfatal progress was accompanied by all the abstract substitutes for thought Idiscussed in Part Two. They provided an artificial substitute for intellectualstimulation and confirmed that the way we are is the only way to be. They werejust what the doctor ordered, as their enormous popularity suggests. All theradicalism of the sixties was intended to hasten our movement in the directionsin which we were already going, and never really to question these directions.It was an exercise in egalitarian self-satisfaction that wiped out the elementsof the university curriculum that did not flatter our peculiar passions ortastes of the moment. In short, the window to Europe, which was always theresource of free and oppressed spirits in America, was slammed shut, moredefinitively because Europeans were helping us do it while promising that theywere opening it. What at the time appeared to be “elite” opinion current onlyamong university intellectuals was in reality the next day’s popular magazinefeature. The longing for Europe has been all but extinguished in the young.About the sixties it is now fashionable to say that although there were indeedexcesses, many good things resulted. But, so far as universities are concerned,I know of nothing positive coming from that period; it was an unmitigateddisaster for them. I hear that the good things were “greater openness,” “lessrigidity,” “freedom from authority,” etc.—but these have no content and expressno view of what is wanted from a university education. During the sixties I saton various committees at Cornell and continuously and futilely voted againstdropping one requirement after the next. The old core curriculum—according towhich every student in the college had to take a smattering of courses in themajor divisions of knowledge—was abandoned. One professor of comparativeliterature—an assiduous importer of the latest Paris fashions—explained thatthese requirements taught little, really did not introduce students to thevarious disciplines, and bored them. I admitted this to be true. He thenexpressed surprise at my unwillingness to give them up. It was because theywere, I said, a threadbare reminiscence of the unity of knowledge and providedan obstinate little hint that there are some things one must know about if oneis to be educated. You don’t replace something with nothing. Of course, that wasexactly what the educational reform of the sixties was doing. The consequencesare most visible now in the declining study of languages, but they are just asprofound, or more so, in all of humane learning. The criticism of the old is ofno value if there is no prospect of the new. It is a way of removing theimpediments to vice presented by decaying virtue. In the sixties the professorswere just hastening to fold up their tents so as to be off the grounds beforethe stampede trampled them. The openness was to “doing your own thing.” It was,and I suppose still is, a sure sign of an authoritarian personality to believethat the university should try to have a vision of what an educated person is.“Growth” or “individual development” was all that was to be permitted, which inAmerica meant only that the vulgarities present in society at large wouldoverwhelm the delicate little plants kept in the university greenhouse for thosewho need other kinds of nourishment.The reforms were without content, made for the “inner-directed” person. Theywere an acquiescence in a leveling off of the peaks, and were the source of thecollapse of the entire American educational structure, recognized by all partieswhen they talk about the need to go “back to basics.” This collapse is directlytraceable to both the teachings and the deeds of the universities in thesixties. More important than the bad teachers and the self-indulgent doctrineswas the disappearance of the reasons for and the models of—for example—“theking’s English.” The awareness of the highest is what points the lower upward.Now, it may be possible, with a lot of effort and political struggle, to returnto earlier standards of accomplishment in the three R’s, but it will not be soeasy to recover the knowledge of philosophy, history and literature that wastrashed. That was never a native plant. We were dependent on Europe for it. Allof our peaks were derivative, with full self-awareness and without being ashamedof it. In the meantime, Europe itself, on which we could count if we faltered,has undergone an evolution similar to our own, and we cannot go there to trainourselves as once we could. Short of great new theoretical and artistic impulsesrising up on their own here to replace the West’s legacy to us, there is no waybut tradition to have kept us in contact with such things. And one cannot jumpon and off the tradition like a train. Once broken, our link with it is hard torenew. The instinctive awareness of meanings, as well as the stores of authenticlearning in the heads of scholars, are lost. Neither aristocrats nor priests,the natural bearers of high intellectual tradition, exist in any meaningfulsense in America. The greatest of thoughts were in our political principles butwere never embodied, hence not living, in a class of men. Their home in Americawas the university, and the violation of that home was the crime of the sixties.Calming the universities down, stopping grade inflation, making students study,all of that may be salutary, but it does not go to the heart of the matter.There is much less in the university to study now.Around the campus disruptions and the student movement there has grown up amythology, an expression of the tastes of those for whom the atmosphere depictedin Ten Days that Shook the World is more stimulating than that in Hegel’s Berlinlecture room would have been. One of the myths is that the fifties were a periodof intellectual conformism and superficiality, whereas there was real excitementand questioning in the sixties. McCarthyism—invoked when Stalinism is mentionedin order to even the balance of injustice between the two superpowers—symbolizesthose gray, grim years, while the blazing sixties were the days of “themovement” and, to hear its survivors tell it, their single-handed liberation ofthe blacks, the women and the South Vietnamese. Without entering into thestrictly political issues, the intellectual picture projected is precisely theopposite of the truth. The sixties were the period of dogmatic answers andtrivial tracts. Not a single book of lasting importance was produced in oraround the movement. It was all Norman O. Brown and Charles Reich. This was whenthe real conformism hit the universities, when opinions about everything fromGod to the movies became absolutely predictable. The evidence brought from popculture to bolster the case for the sixties—that in the fifties Lana Turnerplayed torchy, insincere adulteresses while in the sixties we got Jane Fonda asan authentic whore; that before the sixties we had Paul Anka and after we hadthe Rolling Stones—is of no importance. Even if this characterization were true,it would only go to prove that there is no relation between popular culture andhigh culture, and that the former is all that is now influential on our scene.The fact is that the fifties were one of the great periods of the Americanuniversity, taking into account, of course, the eternal disproportion betweenthe ideal and the real. Even the figures most seminal for “the movement,” likeMarcuse, Arendt and Mills, did what serious work they did prior to 1960. From1933 on the American universities profited from the arrival of many of Europe’sgreatest scholars and scientists as well as a number of clever intellectuals ofa sophistication beyond that known to their American counterparts. They were,for the most part, heirs of the German university tradition, which, as I havediscussed, was the greatest expression of the publicly supported and approvedversion of the theoretical life. All were steeped in the general vision ofhumane education inspired by Kant and Goethe, whose thought and talents were ofworld historical significance and who intransigently and without compromiselooked to the highest moral and artistic fulfillments within the new democraticorder of things. They initiated us into a tradition that was living, and thatpenetrated the tastes and standards of society at large. Those who received thistradition had experience of the vast scholarship accumulated since itsinception, as well as the advanced ideas that clustered around its inspiration.For better or worse, German ideas were where it was at—and where it stillis—whether it be the ideas of Marx, Freud, Weber or Heidegger. In the chairs ofphilosophy in the German university there was an amazing correspondence betweenreal talent and conventional respectability. Hegel, Husserl and Heidegger werethe respected figures of their day, whose significance did not consist in theirmerely holding the chairs. An awareness of all this, and in many cases much morethan an awareness, was brought by the refugees to the United States, which,speaking relatively, had been a backwater and a consumer. Much of what Americanspreviously had gone to seek elsewhere was now here. Although this was a mixedblessing in many respects, the fact that so many of the best physicists,mathematicians, historians, sociologists, classicists and teachers of philosophywere in the United States meant that we could learn here what one had to learn;or, rather, however defective what we had here, our quest for learning could nolonger be better satisfied by the physical voyage to the Old World. In a word,before the dam burst, the American university had become largely independent ofthe contemporary European university. The refugees’ students here were graduallytaking the places of their teachers.Of course, part of this independence was due to the decline of the Continentaluniversities, especially the destruction of the German universities, the breakin their intellectual tradition and the loss of inner confidence and the senseof high vocation they once possessed. But, no matter what the cause, in 1955 nouniversities were better than the best American universities in the things thathave to do with a liberal education and arousing in students the awareness oftheir intellectual needs. And this was an extremely important fact for thecivilization of the West. If in 1930 American universities had simplydisappeared, the general store of learning of general significance would nothave been seriously damaged, although it would surely not have been a good thingfor us. But in 1960, inasmuch as most of intellectual life had long ago settledin universities and the American ones were the best, their decay or collapse wasa catastrophe. Much of the great tradition was here, an alien and weaktransplant, perched precariously in enclaves, vulnerable to native populism andvulgarity. In the mid-sixties the natives, in the guise of students, attacked.Another aspect of the mythology is that McCarthyism had an extremely negativeimpact on the universities. Actually the McCarthy period was the last time theuniversity had any sense of community, defined by a common enemy. McCarthy,those like him, and those who followed them, were clearly nonacademic andantiacademic, the barbarians at the gates. In major universities they had noeffect whatsoever on curriculum or appointments. The range of thought and speechthat took place within them was unaffected. Academic freedom had for that lastmoment more than an abstract meaning, a content with respect to research andpublication about which there was general agreement. The rhetoric about theprotection of unpopular ideas meant something, partly because the publiclyunpopular ideas were not so unpopular in universities. Today there are many morethings unthinkable and unspeakable in universities than there were then, andlittle disposition to protect those who have earned the ire of the radicalmovements. The old liberalism—belief in progress and the free market ofideas—had its last moment of vigor at that time. In the sixties, when thingsseemed to be going in the right direction, the old liberalism was understoodmore and more to be a part of bourgeois ideology, favoring and protecting thevoices of reaction as opposed to those of progress. In the fifties the campuseswere calm, most professors were against McCarthy (although, as one would expectin a democracy, some were for him; and, as one would also expect, human natureand professors being what they are, some who were against him were too timid tospeak out). Professors were not fired, and they taught what they pleased intheir classrooms. For that moment at least, there was a heightened awareness ofthe university’s special status as a preserve against public opinion. That was avery healthy thing. In the sixties many professors, some of whom were notablysilent during the McCarthy years, lost that awareness when the opinions theywere attached to became more popular. The screen of academic freedom was nolonger necessary now that the going was good. The American Association ofUniversity Professors’ Cornell chapter applauded the black activists whoinfringed the rights of professors, and the national organization did nothing toprotect academic freedom. Such groups abandoned merely formal freedom to supportsubstantive causes. In short, in the fifties a goodly portion of the professorsstill held the views about freedom of thought put forward by Bacon, Milton,Locke and John Stuart Mill (this was just prior to the success in America of theContinental critique of these); another portion were of the Left, and they had apersonal interest in the protection afforded them by those views. When theformer lost their confidence, and the latter gained theirs, the strength ofacademic freedom declined drastically.A final part of the mythology of the sixties is the alleged superior moral“concern” of the students. Morality became all the rage in the late sixties,succeeding the hard-nosed realism of the preceding years. But what was meant bymorality has to be made clear. There is a perennial and unobtrusive view thatmorality consists in such things as telling the truth, paying one’s debts,respecting one’s parents and doing no voluntary harm to anyone. Those are allthings easy to say and hard to do; they do not attract much attention, and winlittle honor in the world. The good will, as described by Kant, is a humblenotion, accessible to every child, but its fulfillment is the activity of alifetime of performing the simple duties prescribed by it. This morality alwaysrequires sacrifice. It sometimes entails danger and confrontation, but they arenot of its essence and occur incidentally. Such morality, in order to be itself,must be for itself and not for some result beyond it. It requires resistance tothe charms of feeling good about it and acclaim for it. This was not themorality that came into vogue in the sixties, which was an altogether morehistrionic version of moral conduct, the kind that characterizes heroes inextreme situations. Thomas More’s resistance to a tyrant’s commands was thedaily fare of students’ imagination. Such challenges—which arise rarely, arealways ambiguous in terms of both duty and motive, and require the subtlestreasoning as well as all the other virtues in the highest degree in order to beaddressed justly—were the moral stuff on which these cubs teethed. It was not,of course, the complexity of such cases that was attractive but theirbrilliance, the noble pose. Somehow it was never the everyday business ofobeying the law that was interesting; more so was breaking it in the name of thehigher law. It was always Achilles and Agamemnon. Conscience, a facultythoroughly discredited in modern political and moral thought and particularlydespised by Marx, made a great comeback, as the all-purpose ungrounded ground ofmoral determination, sufficient at its slightest rumbling to discredit all otherobligations or loyalties. Hitler became the regulative principle of theconscience: “You wouldn’t obey Hitler, would you?” So refined had the capacityfor moral discrimination become, it followed that the elected American officialsand the duly approved federal, state and local laws had no more authority thandid Hitler. At Cornell, students were graced by the preachings of Father DanielBerrigan, who explained that old ladies who work as secretaries for draft boardsare the equivalent of the Beast of Belsen and deserve no more respectfultreatment than she did. This was the temper of the moral revival. The modelswere a mixture of the makers of revolutions who hawk new moralities and liberatefrom prevailing constraint, and the heroes of popular existentialist literaturewhose morality consists in self-affirmation. One began to suspect that the newmoralism was just a new dress for the antimorality of the preceding generation,which thought morality repression.The content of this morality was derived simply from the leading notions ofmodern democratic thought, absolutized and radicalized. Equality, freedom,peace, cosmopolitanism were the goods, the only goods, without conflict amongone another, available to us here and now. Not to be considered were naturaldifferences in gifts or in habitual practice of the virtues, the restraintsliberty must impose on itself, wars for the defense of democracy (other thanwars of liberation). Devotion to family or country as a form of morality was thelast refuge of reaction. There were two poles, supposed to be in perfectharmony, the self-development of the absolute individual and the brotherhood ofall mankind. These goods or, rather, values, came on the winds. They were notthe product of students’ reasoning or study. They were inherent in our regime,they constituted its horizon. There was nothing new in it. The newness was inthe thoughtlessness, the utter lack of need to argue or prove. Alternative viewshad no existence except as scarecrows.This was an almost inevitable result of generations of teaching that the mostinstinctive of all questions—What is good?—has no place in the university, andthat supersophisticated doctrines that dismiss and ridicule this question andthe instinct animating it are the only things worthy of study. If theuniversity’s teachers cannot teach about the good, why should the students notteach it? The fact-value distinction admits that values are essential to lifeand shape the way facts are seen and used. Therefore values are primary. And ifthey do not come from reason, then they come from passionate commitment, theessence of morality. Of course, since commitment did not really produce values,the values adopted were the remnants of old reasoning, values with fallenarches, reaffirmed by claims of passionate commitment. The teachers were atfirst appalled by this return to old, bad ways of thought. But since they toowere moral persons, and the values asserted were the ones they privatelybelieved, finally they gave gay assent. David Easton’s disgraceful presidentialaddress to the American Political Science Association in 1966 said all this.Behavioralism (i.e., the social science founded on the fact-value distinction,devoted to the study of facts and contemptuous of philosophy) had not, headmitted, been sufficiently sensitive to moral issues. Now he promised apost-behavioralism in which the great achievements of social science would beput in the service of the right values. The piper would henceforward play thetune called by the students, and they were not even paying.Indignation or rage was the vivid passion characterizing those in the grip ofthe new moral experience. Indignation may be a most noble passion and necessaryfor fighting wars and righting wrongs. But of all the experiences of the soul itis the most inimical to reason and hence to the university. Anger, to sustainitself, requires an unshakable conviction that one is right. Whether the studentwrath against the professorial Agamemnons was authentically Achillean is open toquestion. But there is no doubt that it was the banner under which they fought,the proof of belonging.Now, it has always been thought that moral conduct did not need precisely to bepainful in order to be moral, but that it could not be itself if it were fun.However interpreted, it is connected with a self-overcoming that being wise orbeautiful—or any other of the qualities for which human beings are thought to beenviable—do not require. That is why it commands special respect and also whythere is so great a temptation to simulate it. The man who sacrifices his lifefor justice evidently has motives superior to those of most men, or adisinterestedness incomprehensible to them. They cannot help being impressed. Inan admirable phrase Montesquieu encapsulated the moral taste that the studentleaders represented and on which they played: “Men, although they areindividually rascals, are collectively a most decent lot: they love morality.”This is the formula for Tartuffe. The student moralism was a species of theTartuffe phenomenon, but a wholly new mutant of it. Unlike other revolutionarymovements, which tended to be austere and chaste—beginning with the firstrevolution, 1688, in England, which was really puritan—this one wasantipuritanical. The slogan was “Make love, not war.” Although the similarity oflanguage was exploited, this is very different from “Love thy neighbor,” whichis an injunction very difficult to fulfill. “To make love” is a bodily act, veryeasy to perform and thought to be pleasant. The word “obscene” was transferredout of sex into politics. Somehow the students had touched on a whole set ofdesires previously thought to be questionable, which had hardly dared to namethemselves but which were ripe for emancipation and legitimation. The ideologyfor the revolution was already in place. Moderation of the infinite bodilydesires had become “repression” of nature, one of the forms of domination, thebuzzword of the advanced thinkers and consciousness raisers. All that was neededwere the heroes willing to act out the fantasies the public was now ready toaccept as reality: the hero, as hedonist, who dares to do in public what thepublic wants to see. It was épater les bourgeois as a bourgeois calling. Thepractices of the late Roman empire were promoted with the moral fervor of earlyChristianity and the political idealism of Robespierre. Such a combination is,of course, impossible. It is playacting, a role, and the students knew it. Butthat haunting sentiment was assuaged by the fact that this was the firstrevolution made for TV. They were real because they could see themselves ontelevision. All the world had become a stage, and they were playing leads. Thecure proposed for the bourgeois disease really was its most advanced symptom.A partial list of the sacrifices made by the students to their morality willsuffice to show its character: they were able to live as they pleased in theuniversity, as in loco parentis responsibilities were abandoned; drugs became aregular part of life, with almost no interference from university authorities,while the civil authority was kept at bay by the university’s alleged right topolice its own precincts; all sexual restrictions imposed by rule or disapprovalwere overturned; academic requirements were relaxed in every imaginable way, andgrade inflation made it difficult to flunk; avoidance of military service was away of life and a principle. All of these privileges were disguised withedifying labels such as individual responsibility, experience, growth,development, self-expression, liberation, concern. Never in history had therebeen such a marvelous correspondence between the good and the pleasant. RichardNixon, with his unerring instinct for the high moral ground and the noble motivefor consensus, assessed his student antagonists and ended the draft.Miraculously the student movement came to an end, although the war continued foralmost three years thereafter.A final note about an aspect of the students’ motivation that has not receivedsufficient attention: In addition to the desire to live as they pleased, acovert elitism was at work among them. A permanent feature of democracy, alwaysand everywhere, is a tendency to suppress the claims of any kind of superiority,conventional or natural, essentially by denying that there is superiority,particularly with respect to ruling. The Platonic dialogues are full of youngmen who passionately desire political glory and believe they have the talent torule. Plato admits that he himself was once such a young man. And they lived ina city where their peculiar right to rule was denied them, where they would findit difficult to get ruling office, and where to do so they would have to makethemselves into what the people wanted. They burned with that specialindignation a man reserves for wrongs done to himself, and believed that theirpotential could not be fulfilled in democratic Athens. They constituted asubversive group in the city, unfriendly to the maintenance of its regime. Suchwere many of the companions of Socrates, and taming this instinct for rule wasan essential part of the education he gave them. But he began by accepting, atleast partially, the legitimacy of their longing and denying the unadulteratedright of the many to rule over the few. He gave intellectual satisfaction totheir complaint. And, more important, he took very seriously the element intheir souls that made them ambitious. The aspiration to be number one and gaingreat fame is both natural in man and, properly trained, one of the soul’s greatstrengths. Democracy in itself is hostile to such spiritedness and prevents itsfulfillment. This was a problem for all ancient democracies. Coriolanusrepresents an extreme example of the man who refuses to ground his right to ruleon any admixture of consent of the people, in this case a people ready to accepthis right to rule. But he is not an entirely unadmirable man. The strength ofhis soul is a result of the part of it that makes him proud and ambitious, thatseeks an autonomy not dependent on others’ opinions or wills.The problem of ambition in democracy is much aggravated by modern democracy.Ancient democracies were factually powerful, but they did not persuade the proudand the ambitious that the rule of the many is just. Inner confidence was notweakened by the sense that the master has right on his side, for there wasneither a religion nor a philosophy of equality. The talented young could hope,and sometimes act, without guilt, to gain first place. This has been changedpartially, but only partially, by Christianity. It asserted equality before Godand condemned pride, but it left the inequalities of this world in place. Moreimportant was the work of modern philosophy, which established a rationalteaching, making political equality the only just system of society. There is nointellectual ground remaining for any regime other than democracy. The soulcannot find encouragement for its longing anywhere. Moreover, the modernthinkers developed a scheme of things in which individual ambition would havelittle hope of success. The outline of this scheme is presented in Federalist X.The sheer size of this country, as well as its organization and its stability,has a disheartening effect on the potential ruler. Even more important have beenthe efforts of modern philosophers to root pride and great ambition out of thesoul. At the outset, Hobbes’s psychology treated what he called vainglory as apathological condition based on ignorance of man’s vulnerability, on unjustifiedconfidence. This condition can, according to him, be cured by liberal doses offear. One need only hear what is said today about competition among educatorsand in the press, and read Rousseau and Freud on related issues, to recognizehow much of modernity is devoted to unmanning this disposition. Elitism is thecatch-all epithet expressing our disapproval of the proud and the desire to befirst.But, unsupported and excoriated, this part of the soul lives on, dwellingunderground, receiving no sublimating education. As with all repressed impulses,it has its daily effects on personality and also occasionally bursts forth invarious disguises and monstrous shapes. Much of modern history can be explainedby the search of what Plato called spiritedness for legitimate self-expression.Certainly compassion and the idea of the vanguard were essentially democraticcovers for elitist self-assertion. Rousseau, who first made compassion thefoundation of democratic sentiment, was fully aware that a sense of superiorityto the sufferer is a component of the human experience of compassion. Heactually was attempting to channel the inegalitarian impulse into egalitarianchannels. Similarly the avant-garde (usually used in relation to art) and thevanguard (usually used in relation to politics) are democratic modes ofdistinguishing oneself, of being ahead, of leading, without denying thedemocratic principle. The members of the vanguard have just a small evanescentadvantage. They now know what everyone will soon know. This posture conciliatesinstinct with principle. And it was the one adopted by the students who fearedassimilation to the democratic man. There they were in those few eliteuniversities, which were being rapidly democratized. And their political futureswere bleak, their educations not advantaging them for elective office, providingonly the prospect of having to work their way up in the dreary fashion of suchcontemptible persons as Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon. But these universitieswere respected, looked to by the democratic press and were the alma maters ofmuch of the powerful elite. These little places could easily be seized, just asa polis could have been seized. Using them as a stage, students instantlyachieved notoriety. Young black students I knew at Cornell appeared on thecovers of the national news magazines. How irresistible it all was, an eliteshortcut to political influence. In the ordinary world, outside theuniversities, such youngsters would have had no way of gaining attention. Theytook as their models Mao, Castro and Che Guevara, promoters of equality, if youplease, but surely not themselves equal to anyone. They themselves wanted to bethe leaders of a revolution of compassion. The great objects of their contemptand fury were the members of the American middle class, professionals, workers,white collar and blue, farmers—all of those vulgarians who made up the Americanmajority and who did not need or want either the compassion or the leadership ofthe students. They dared to think themselves equal to the students and to resisthaving their consciousness raised by them. It is very difficult to distinguishoneself in America, and in order to do so the students substituted conspicuouscompassion for their parents’ conspicuous consumption. They specialized in beingthe advocates of all those in America and the Third World who did not challengetheir sense of superiority and who, they imagined, would accept theirleadership. None of the exquisite thrills of egalitarian vanity were alien tothem.One could appreciate and even sympathize with the frustrated inclinations, thelove of glory that could not be avowed, the quest for the recognition ofexcellence that were revealed in the sixties campus politics. However, thehypocrisy of it all, and the ignorance of what a man has to know and to risk inorder to be political, made the spectacle more repulsive than touching.Tyrannical impulses masqueraded as democratic compassion, and quest fordistinction as love of equality. Self-knowledge was utterly lacking, and theirconquest was so easy. The elite should really be elite, but these elitists weregiven the distinction they craved without having earned it. The universityprovided a kind of affirmative-action elitism. There had for a long time been aconspiracy in the universities to deny that there is a problem for the superiorindividual, particularly the one with the gift and the passion for ruling, indemocratic society. Suddenly they found themselves confronted by potentialrulers who accused them of complicity in the crime of ruling. It served themright.It was with respect to precisely this problem that I had one of my greatestsatisfactions as a teacher. The little Greek Civilization Program a group ofprofessors set up against the currents had just gotten under way the year of thecrisis. It consisted of about a dozen enthusiastic freshmen, and we had beenreading Plato’s Republic during the entire year. We had not finished it when theuniversity became a chaos. Almost all classes ceased, as students and professorsalike turned to the serious business of making the revolution, hanging about thecampus and going from one crazy meeting to another. I had joined with a group ofprofessors who announced they would not teach until the guns were off campus andsome kind of legitimate order had been restored. But these students had becomedeeply involved with the story of the ambitious Glaucon, who was founding a citywith the help of Socrates. So we continued to meet informally. They were reallymore interested in the book than the revolution, which in itself proved whatkind of a counter-charm the university ought to provide to the siren calls ofthe contemporary scene. These students were rather contemptuous of what wasgoing on, because it got in the way of what they thought it important to do.They wanted to find out what happened to Glaucon during his wonderful night withSocrates. They really looked down from the classroom on the frantic activityoutside, thinking they were privileged, hardly a one tempted to join the crowd.I later found out that some of these students had indeed gone down from thelibrary seminar room into the agora, where the action was. They had made copiesof the following lines from the Republic and handed them out, competing with thehawkers of other kinds of tracts: “Do you too believe, as do the many, that certain young men are corrupted bysophists, and that there are certain sophists who in a private capacity corruptto an extent worth mentioning? Isn’t it rather the very men who say this who arethe biggest sophists, who educate most perfectly and who turn out young and old,men and women, just the way they want them to be?” “But when do they do that?”he said. “When,” I said, “many gathered together sit down in assemblies, courts,theaters, army camps, or any other common meeting of a multitude, and, with agreat deal of uproar, blame some of the things said or done, and praise others,both in excess, shouting and clapping; and, besides, the rocks and the veryplace surrounding them echo and redouble the uproar of blame and praise. Now insuch circumstances, as the saying goes, what do you suppose is the state of theyoung man’s heart? Or what kind of private education will hold out for him andnot be swept away by such blame and praise and go, borne by the flood, whereverit tends so that he’ll say the same things are noble and base as they do,practice what they practice, and be such as they are?” (Republic 491e-492b) They had learned from this old book what was going on and had gained realdistance on it, had had an experience of liberation. Socrates’ magic stillworked. He had diagnosed the complaint of the ambitious young and showed how totreat it.The sixties have now faded from the current student imagination. What remains isa certain self-promotion by people who took part in it all, now in theirforties, having come to terms with the “establishment” but dispersing anostalgic essence in the media, where, of course, many of them are flourishing,admitting that it was unreal but asserting that it was the moment ofsignificance. They stood for the good things. They seem to think they wereresponsible for great progress in relations between whites and blacks, that theyplayed the key role in the civil rights movement. Without attempting to discusswhat was decisive in the historic changes that took place in those relations inthe years between 1950 and 1970—whether it was the doings of the courts, or ofelected officials, or inspiration of the kind represented by Martin Luther Kingfrom within the black community that was most important—it is undeniable thatthe enthusiastic support of these changes by university students in the Northplayed some role in creating the atmosphere that promoted the righting of oldwrongs. But I believe the students’ role was marginal and partook not a littleof the histrionic morality of which I have been speaking. It consisted mostly ingoing off to marches and demonstrations that were vacationlike, usually duringschool term, with the confident expectation that they would not be penalized bytheir professors for missing assignments while they were off doing importantdeeds, in places where they had never been and to which they would never return,and where, therefore, they did not have to pay any price for their stand, as didthose who had to stay and live there. Nor did they partake in the hard andlow-profile labors of those who studied constitutional law and prepared legalbriefs, those who spent lonely and frustrating years, whose lives were trulydedicated to a cause. I do not wish to denigrate the students’ efforts, andpeople should not be blamed for inclinations that are truly good, although thereshould not be too much self-congratulation for what was easy and cost little. Mypoint is, rather, that the student participation in the civil rights movementantedated the campus activism, and that the students’ opinions were formed inthe old, bad universities that they returned to destroy. The last significantstudent participation in the civil rights movement was in the march onWashington in 1964. After that, Black Power came to the fore, the system ofsegregation in the South was dismantled, and white students had nothing more tocontribute other than to egg on Black Power excesses, the instigators of whichdid not want their help. The students were unaware that the teachings ofequality, the promise of the Declaration of Independence, the study of theConstitution, the knowledge of our history and many more things were thepainstakingly earned and stored-up capital that supported them. Racial justiceis an imperative of our theory and historical practice, without which therewould have been no problem and no solution. From what were claimed to beabsolutely corrupt institutions serving “the system,” students gained theawareness and learning that made their action possible and good. The mostoutrageous pretension of the students was that their commitments were theirautonomous creations. Everything, but everything, was borrowed from the seriousthought and beliefs about what America is and about good and bad in theuniversity treasury. They could waste the capital because they did not know theywere living off of it. They returned to the university, declared it bankrupt andthereby bankrupted it. They abandoned the grand American liberal traditions oflearning. Under pressure from students the Founding was understood to be racist,and the very instrument that condemned slavery and racism was broken. The racesin the Northern universities have grown more separate since the sixties. Afterthe theory of the rights of man was no longer studied or really believed, itspractice also suffered. The American university provided the intellectualinspiration for decent political deeds. It is very doubtful whether there is ateaching about justice within it now that could again generate anything like themovement toward racial equality. The very thing the sixties students pridedthemselves on was one of their premier victims.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------10 [022.html#f10p3ch2_10] Up to that time there had only been hints of thefollowing kind: the chairman of the Economics Department had been held hostagefor several hours, along with his secretary, in furtherance of a demand that anassistant professor deemed racist be dismissed; the building housing a part ofthe Sociology Department had been forcibly seized, and its inhabitants as wellas furnishings had been ejected; the president had been physically assaulted. Inresponse to these communications, proofs of the bona fides of the following kindhad been given to the students: the assistant professor disappeared from campus;and for good measure the black assistant dean, who had the misfortune of beingan integrationist at a time when black power had come into vogue, was fired; thefaculty of the College of Arts and Sciences received a memorandum from its deaninforming the members that, although none were demonstrably overt racists, allwere indeed institutional racists; classes for blacks only were established; thehouse that was being held by right of conquest was accorded to its newinhabitants by consent; a lavishly funded black studies center was establishedin the faculty appointments to which the black students were to have a voice.Such signs had not yet succeeded in establishing the kind of “dialogue” hopedfor.11 [022.html#f11p3ch2_11] The president himself appeared to be interested onlyin protecting himself and avoiding having to confront the black studentassociation or any other radical group. He was of the moral stamp of those whowere angry with Poland for resisting Hitler because this precipitated the war.12 [022.html#f12p3ch2_12] Among those threatened over the university radio wasthe professor who had probably done more and risked more in the civil rightsmovement than anyone else at Cornell."},{"pageContent":"THE STUDENT AND THE UNIVERSITYLIBERAL EDUCATIONWhat image does a first-rank college or university present today to a teen-agerleaving home for the first time, off to the adventure of a liberal education? Hehas four years of freedom to discover himself—a space between the intellectualwasteland he has left behind and the inevitable dreary professional trainingthat awaits him after the baccalaureate. In this short time he must learn thatthere is a great world beyond the little one he knows, experience theexhilaration of it and digest enough of it to sustain himself in theintellectual deserts he is destined to traverse. He must do this, that is, if heis to have any hope of a higher life. These are the charmed years when he can,if he so chooses, become anything he wishes and when he has the opportunity tosurvey his alternatives, not merely those current in his time or provided bycareers, but those available to him as a human being. The importance of theseyears for an American cannot be overestimated. They are civilization’s onlychance to get to him.In looking at him we are forced to reflect on what he should learn if he is tobe called educated; we must speculate on what the human potential to befulfilled is. In the specialties we can avoid such speculation, and theavoidance of them is one of specialization’s charms. But here it is a simpleduty. What are we to teach this person? The answer may not be evident, but toattempt to answer the question is already to philosophize and to begin toeducate. Such a concern in itself poses the question of the unity of man and theunity of the sciences. It is childishness to say, as some do, that everyone mustbe allowed to develop freely, that it is authoritarian to impose a point of viewon the student. In that case, why have a university? If the response is “toprovide an atmosphere for learning,” we come back to our original questions atthe second remove. Which atmosphere? Choices and reflection on the reasons forthose choices are unavoidable. The university has to stand for something. Thepractical effects of unwillingness to think positively about the contents of aliberal education are, on the one hand, to ensure that all the vulgarities ofthe world outside the university will flourish within it, and, on the other, toimpose a much harsher and more illiberal necessity on the student—the one givenby the imperial and imperious demands of the specialized disciplines unfilteredby unifying thought.The university now offers no distinctive visage to the young person. He finds ademocracy of the disciplines—which are there either because they areautochthonous or because they wandered in recently to perform some job that wasdemanded of the university. This democracy is really an anarchy, because thereare no recognized rules for citizenship and no legitimate titles to rule. Inshort there is no vision, nor is there a set of competing visions, of what aneducated human being is. The question has disappeared, for to pose it would be athreat to the peace. There is no organization of the sciences, no tree ofknowledge. Out of chaos emerges dispiritedness, because it is impossible to makea reasonable choice. Better to give up on liberal education and get on with aspecialty in which there is at least a prescribed curriculum and a prospectivecareer. On the way the student can pick up in elective courses a little ofwhatever is thought to make one cultured. The student gets no intimation thatgreat mysteries might be revealed to him, that new and higher motives of actionmight be discovered within him, that a different and more human way of life canbe harmoniously constructed by what he is going to learn.Simply, the university is not distinctive. Equality for us seems to culminate inthe unwillingness and incapacity to make claims of superiority, particularly inthe domains in which such claims have always been made—art, religion andphilosophy. When Weber found that he could not choose between certain highopposites—reason vs. revelation, Buddha vs. Jesus—he did not conclude that allthings are equally good, that the distinction between high and low disappears.As a matter of fact he intended to revitalize the consideration of these greatalternatives in showing the gravity and danger involved in choosing among them;they were to be heightened in contrast to the trivial considerations of modernlife that threatened to overgrow and render indistinguishable the profoundproblems the confrontation with which makes the bow of the soul taut. Theserious intellectual life was for him the battleground of the great decisions,all of which are spiritual or “value” choices. One can no longer present this orthat particular view of the educated or civilized man as authoritative;therefore one must say that education consists in knowing, really knowing, thesmall number of such views in their integrity. This distinction between profoundand superficial—which takes the place of good and bad, true and false—provided afocus for serious study, but it hardly held out against the naturally relaxeddemocratic tendency to say, “Oh, what’s the use?” The first universitydisruptions at Berkeley were explicitly directed against the multiversitysmorgasbord and, I must confess, momentarily and partially engaged mysympathies. It may have even been the case that there was some small element oflonging for an education in the motivation of those students. But nothing wasdone to guide or inform their energy, and the result was merely to addmultilife-styles to multidisciplines, the diversity of perversity to thediversity of specialization. What we see so often happening in general happenedhere too; the insistent demand for greater community ended in greater isolation.Old agreements, old habits, old traditions were not so easily replaced.Thus, when a student arrives at the university, he finds a bewildering varietyof departments and a bewildering variety of courses. And there is no officialguidance, no university-wide agreement, about what he should study. Nor does heusually find readily available examples, either among students or professors, ofa unified use of the university’s resources. It is easiest simply to make acareer choice and go about getting prepared for that career. The programsdesigned for those having made such a choice render their students immune tocharms that might lead them out of the conventionally respectable. The sirenssing sotto voce these days, and the young already have enough wax in their earsto pass them by without danger. These specialties can provide enough courses totake up most of their time for four years in preparation for the inevitablegraduate study. With the few remaining courses they can do what they please,taking a bit of this and a bit of that. No public career these days—not doctornor lawyer nor politician nor journalist nor businessman nor entertainer—hasmuch to do with humane learning. An education, other than purely professional ortechnical, can even seem to be an impediment. That is why a countervailingatmosphere in the university would be necessary for the students to gain a tastefor intellectual pleasures and learn that they are viable.The real problem is those students who come hoping to find out what career theywant to have, or are simply looking for an adventure with themselves. There areplenty of things for them to do—courses and disciplines enough to spend many alifetime on. Each department or great division of the university makes a pitchfor itself, and each offers a course of study that will make the student aninitiate. But how to choose among them? How do they relate to one another? Thefact is they do not address one another. They are competing and contradictory,without being aware of it. The problem of the whole is urgently indicated by thevery existence of the specialties, but it is never systematically posed. The neteffect of the student’s encounter with the college catalogue is bewilderment andvery often demoralization. It is just a matter of chance whether he finds one ortwo professors who can give him an insight into one of the great visions ofeducation that have been the distinguishing part of every civilized nation. Mostprofessors are specialists, concerned only with their own fields, interested inthe advancement of those fields in their own terms, or in their own personaladvancement in a world where all the rewards are on the side of professionaldistinction. They have been entirely emancipated from the old structure of theuniversity, which at least helped to indicate that they are incomplete, onlyparts of an unexamined and undiscovered whole. So the student must navigateamong a collection of carnival barkers, each trying to lure him into aparticular sideshow. This undecided student is an embarrassment to mostuniversities, because he seems to be saying, “I am a whole human being. Help meto form myself in my wholeness and let me develop my real potential,” and he isthe one to whom they have nothing to say.Cornell was, as in so many other things, in advance of its time on this issue.The six-year Ph.D. program, richly supported by the Ford Foundation, wasdirected specifically to high school students who had already made “a firmcareer choice” and was intended to rush them through to the start of thosecareers. A sop was given to desolate humanists in the form of money to fundseminars that these young careerists could take on their way through the Collegeof Arts and Sciences. For the rest, the educators could devote their energies toarranging and packaging the program without having to provide it with anysubstance. That kept them busy enough to avoid thinking about the nothingness oftheir endeavor. This has been the preferred mode of not looking the Beast in theJungle in the face—structure, not content. The Cornell plan for dealing with theproblem of liberal education was to suppress the students’ longing for liberaleducation by encouraging their professionalism and their avarice, providingmoney and all the prestige the university had available to make careerism thecenterpiece of the university.The Cornell plan dared not state the radical truth, a well-kept secret: thecolleges do not have enough to teach their students, not enough to justifykeeping them four years, probably not even three years. If the focus is careers,there is hardly one specialty, outside the hardest of the hard natural sciences,which requires more than two years of preparatory training prior to graduatestudies. The rest is just wasted time, or a period of ripening until thestudents are old enough for graduate studies. For many graduate careers, evenless is really necessary. It is amazing how many undergraduates are pokingaround for courses to take, without any plan or question to ask, just filling uptheir college years. In fact, with rare exceptions, the courses are parts ofspecialties and not designed for general cultivation, or to investigatequestions important for human beings as such. The so-called knowledge explosionand increasing specialization have not filled up the college years but emptiedthem. Those years are impediments; one wants to get beyond them. And in generalthe persons one finds in the professions need not have gone to college, if oneis to judge by their tastes, their fund of learning or their interests. Theymight as well have spent their college years in the Peace Corps or the like.These great universities—which can split the atom, find cures for the mostterrible diseases, conduct surveys of whole populations and produce massivedictionaries of lost languages—cannot generate a modest program of generaleducation for undergraduate students. This is a parable for our times.There are attempts to fill the vacuum painlessly with various kinds of fancypackaging of what is already there—study abroad options, individualized majors,etc. Then there are Black Studies and Women’s or Gender Studies, along withLearn Another Culture. Peace Studies are on their way to a similar prevalence.All this is designed to show that the university is with it and has something inaddition to its traditional specialties. The latest item is computer literacy,the full cheapness of which is evident only to those who think a bit about whatliteracy might mean. It would make some sense to promote literacy literacy,inasmuch as most high school graduates nowadays have difficulty reading andwriting. And some institutions are quietly undertaking this worthwhile task. Butthey do not trumpet the fact, because this is merely a high school function thatour current sad state of educational affairs has thrust upon them, about whichthey are not inclined to boast.Now that the distractions of the sixties are over, and undergraduate educationhas become more important again (because the graduate departments, aside fromthe professional schools, are in trouble due to the shortage of academic jobs),university officials have had somehow to deal with the undeniable fact that thestudents who enter are uncivilized, and that the universities have someresponsibility for civilizing them. If one were to give a base interpretation ofthe schools’ motives, one could allege that their concern stems from shame andself-interest. It is becoming all too evident that liberal education—which iswhat the small band of prestigious institutions are supposed to provide, incontrast to the big state schools, which are thought simply to preparespecialists to meet the practical demands of a complex society—has no content,that a certain kind of fraud is being perpetrated. For a time the great moralconsciousness alleged to have been fostered in students by the greatuniversities, especially their vocation as gladiators who fight war and racism,seemed to fulfill the demands of the collective university conscience. They weredoing something other than offering preliminary training for doctors andlawyers. Concern and compassion were thought to be the indefinable X thatpervaded all the parts of the Arts and Sciences campus. But when that evanescentmist dissipated during the seventies, and the faculties found themselves face toface with ill-educated young people with no intellectual tastes—unaware thatthere even are such things, obsessed with getting on with their careers beforehaving looked at life—and the universities offered no counterpoise, noalternative goals, a reaction set in.Liberal education—since it has for so long been ill-defined, has none of thecrisp clarity or institutionalized prestige of the professions, but neverthelessperseveres and has money and respectability connected with it—has always been abattleground for those who are somewhat eccentric in relation to thespecialties. It is in something like the condition of churches as opposed to,say, hospitals. Nobody is quite certain of what the religious institutions aresupposed to do anymore, but they do have some kind of role either responding toa real human need or as the vestige of what was once a need, and they invite theexploitation of quacks, adventurers, cranks and fanatics. But they also solicitthe warmest and most valiant efforts of persons of peculiar gravity and depth.In liberal education, too, the worst and the best fight it out, fakers vs.authentics, sophists vs. philosophers, for the favor of public opinion and forcontrol over the study of man in our times. The most conspicuous participants inthe struggle are administrators who are formally responsible for presenting somekind of public image of the education their colleges offer, persons with apolitical agenda or vulgarizers of what the specialties know, and real teachersof the humane disciplines who actually see their relation to the whole andurgently wish to preserve the awareness of it in their students’ consciousness.So, just as in the sixties universities were devoted to removing requirements,in the eighties they are busy with attempts to put them back in, a much moredifficult task. The word of the day is “core.” It is generally agreed that “wewent a bit far in the sixties,” and that a little fine-tuning has now becomeclearly necessary.There are two typical responses to the problem. The easiest and mostadministratively satisfying solution is to make use of what is already there inthe autonomous departments and simply force the students to cover the fields,i.e., take one or more courses in each of the general divisions of theuniversity: natural science, social science and the humanities. The reigningideology here is breadth, as was openness in the age of laxity. The courses arealmost always the already existing introductory courses, which are of leastinterest to the major professors and merely assume the worth and reality of thatwhich is to be studied. It is general education, in the sense in which ajack-of-all-trades is a generalist. He knows a bit of everything and is inferiorto the specialist in each area. Students may wish to sample a variety of fields,and it may be good to encourage them to look around and see if there issomething that attracts them in one of which they have no experience. But thisis not a liberal education and does not satisfy any longing they have for one.It just teaches that there is no high-level generalism, and that what they aredoing is preliminary to the real stuff and part of the childhood they areleaving behind. Thus they desire to get it over with and get on with what theirprofessors do seriously. Without recognition of important questions of commonconcern, there cannot be serious liberal education, and attempts to establish itwill be but failed gestures.It is a more or less precise awareness of the inadequacy of this approach tocore curricula that motivates the second approach, which consists of what onemight call composite courses. These are constructions developed especially forgeneral-education purposes and usually require collaboration of professors drawnfrom several departments. These courses have titles like “Man in Nature,” “Warand Moral Responsibility,” “The Arts and Creativity,” “Culture and theIndividual.” Everything, of course, depends upon who plans them and who teachesthem. They have the clear advantage of requiring some reflection on the generalneeds of students and force specialized professors to broaden theirperspectives, at least for a moment. The dangers are trendiness, merepopularization and lack of substantive rigor. In general, the natural scientistsdo not collaborate in such endeavors, and hence these courses tend to beunbalanced. In short, they do not point beyond themselves and do not provide thestudent with independent means to pursue permanent questions independently, as,for example, the study of Aristotle or Kant as wholes once did. They tend to bebits of this and that. Liberal education should give the student the sense thatlearning must and can be both synoptic and precise. For this, a very small,detailed problem can be the best way, if it is framed so as to open out on thewhole. Unless the course has the specific intention to lead to the permanentquestions, to make the student aware of them and give him some competence in theimportant works that treat of them, it tends to be a pleasant diversion and adead end—because it has nothing to do with any program of further study he canimagine. If such programs engage the best energies of the best people in theuniversity, they can be beneficial and provide some of the missing intellectualexcitement for both professors and students. But they rarely do, and they aretoo cut off from the top, from what the various faculties see as their realbusiness. Where the power is determines the life of the whole body. And theintellectual problems unresolved at the top cannot be resolved administrativelybelow. The problem is the lack of any unity of the sciences and the loss of thewill or the means even to discuss the issue. The illness above is the cause ofthe illness below, to which all the good-willed efforts of honest liberaleducationists can at best be palliatives.Of course, the only serious solution is the one that is almost universallyrejected: the good old Great Books approach, in which a liberal education meansreading certain generally recognized classic texts, just reading them, lettingthem dictate what the questions are and the method of approaching them—notforcing them into categories we make up, not treating them as historicalproducts, but trying to read them as their authors wished them to be read. I amperfectly well aware of, and actually agree with, the objections to the GreatBooks cult. It is amateurish; it encourages an autodidact’s self-assurancewithout competence; one cannot read all of the Great Books carefully; if oneonly reads Great Books, one can never know what a great, as opposed to anordinary, book is; there is no way of determining who is to decide what a GreatBook or what the canon is; books are made the ends and not the means; the wholemovement has a certain coarse evangelistic tone that is the opposite of goodtaste; it engenders a spurious intimacy with greatness; and so forth. But onething is certain: wherever the Great Books make up a central part of thecurriculum, the students are excited and satisfied, feel they are doingsomething that is independent and fulfilling, getting something from theuniversity they cannot get elsewhere. The very fact of this special experience,which leads nowhere beyond itself, provides them with a new alternative and arespect for study itself. The advantage they get is an awareness of theclassic—particularly important for our innocents; an acquaintance with what bigquestions were when there were still big questions; models, at the very least,of how to go about answering them; and, perhaps most important of all, a fund ofshared experiences and thoughts on which to ground their friendships with oneanother. Programs based upon judicious use of great texts provide the royal roadto students’ hearts. Their gratitude at learning of Achilles or the categoricalimperative is boundless. Alexandre Koyré, the late historian of science, told methat his appreciation for America was great when—in the first course he taughtat the University of Chicago, in 1940 at the beginning of his exile—a studentspoke in his paper of Mr. Aristotle, unaware that he was not a contemporary.Koyré said that only an American could have the naive profundity to takeAristotle as living thought, unthinkable for most scholars. A good program ofliberal education feeds the student’s love of truth and passion to live a goodlife. It is the easiest thing in the world to devise courses of study, adaptedto the particular conditions of each university, which thrill those who takethem. The difficulty is in getting them accepted by the faculty.None of the three great parts of the contemporary university is enthusiasticabout the Great Books approach to education. The natural scientists arebenevolent toward other fields and toward liberal education, if it does notsteal away their students and does not take too much time from their preparatorystudies. But they themselves are interested primarily in the solution of thequestions now important in their disciplines and are not particularly concernedwith discussions of their foundations, inasmuch as they are so evidentlysuccessful. They are indifferent to Newton’s conception of time or his disputeswith Leibniz about calculus; Aristotle’s teleology is an absurdity beneathconsideration. Scientific progress, they believe, no longer depends on the kindof comprehensive reflection given to the nature of science by men like Bacon,Descartes, Hume, Kant and Marx. This is merely historical study, and for a longtime now, even the greatest scientists have given up thinking about Galileo andNewton. Progress is undoubted. The difficulties about the truth of scienceraised by positivism, and those about the goodness of science raised by Rousseauand Nietzsche, have not really penetrated to the center of scientificconsciousness. Hence, no Great Books, but incremental progress, is the theme forthem.Social scientists are in general hostile, because the classic texts tend to dealwith the human things the social sciences deal with, and they are very proud ofhaving freed themselves from the shackles of such earlier thought to becometruly scientific. And, unlike the natural scientists, they are insecure enoughabout their achievement to feel threatened by the works of earlier thinkers,perhaps a bit afraid that students will be seduced and fall back into the badold ways. Moreover, with the possible exception of Weber and Freud, there are nosocial science books that can be said to be classic. This may be interpretedfavorably to the social sciences by comparing them to the natural sciences,which can be said to be a living organism developing by the addition of littlecells, a veritable body of knowledge proving itself to be such by the very factof this almost unconscious growth, with thousands of parts oblivious to thewhole, nevertheless contributing to it. This is in opposition to a work ofimagination or of philosophy, where a single creator makes and surveys anartificial whole. But whether one interprets the absence of the classic in thesocial sciences in ways flattering or unflattering to them, the fact causessocial scientists discomfort. I remember the professor who taught theintroductory graduate courses in social science methodology, a famous historian,responding scornfully and angrily to a question I naively put to him aboutThucydides with “Thucydides was a fool!”More difficult to explain is the tepid reaction of humanists to Great Bookseducation, inasmuch as these books now belong almost exclusively to what arecalled the humanities. One would think that high esteem for the classic wouldreinforce the spiritual power of the humanities, at a time when their temporalpower is at its lowest. And it is true that the most active proponents ofliberal education and the study of classic texts are indeed usually humanists.But there is division among them. Some humanities disciplines are just crustyspecialties that, although they depend on the status of classic books for theirexistence, are not really interested in them in their natural state—muchphilology, for example, is concerned with the languages but not what is said inthem—and will and can do nothing to support their own infrastructure. Somehumanities disciplines are eager to join the real sciences and transcend theirroots in the now overcome mythic past. Some humanists make the legitimatecomplaints about lack of competence in the teaching and learning of Great Books,although their criticism is frequently undermined by the fact that they are onlydefending recent scholarly interpretation of the classics rather than a vital,authentic understanding. In their reaction there is a strong element ofspecialist’s jealousy and narrowness. Finally, a large part of the story is justthe general debilitation of the humanities, which is both symptom and cause ofour present condition.To repeat, the crisis of liberal education is a reflection of a crisis at thepeaks of learning, an incoherence and incompatibility among the first principleswith which we interpret the world, an intellectual crisis of the greatestmagnitude, which constitutes the crisis of our civilization. But perhaps itwould be true to say that the crisis consists not so much in this incoherencebut in our incapacity to discuss or even recognize it. Liberal educationflourished when it prepared the way for the discussion of a unified view ofnature and man’s place in it, which the best minds debated on the highest level.It decayed when what lay beyond it were only specialties, the premises of whichdo not lead to any such vision. The highest is the partial intellect; there isno synopsis.THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE UNIVERSITYThis became all too clear in the aftermath of the guns at Cornell, and I had achance to learn something about the articulation of the university as itdecomposed. In general, no discipline—only individuals—reacted very well to theassault on academic freedom and integrity. But various disciplines reacted incharacteristic ways. The professional schools—engineering, home economics,industrial-labor relations and agriculture—simply went home and closed theshutters. (Some professors in the law school did indeed express indignation, anda group of them finally spoke out publicly for the dismissal of the president.)These faculties were supposed, in general, to be conservative, but they just didnot want trouble and did not feel it was their fight. The complaints of theblack students were not about them; and whatever changes in thought were to takeplace, they would be untouched. In spite of the common complaints about thegreat variety of disciplines unbalancing the university and causing it to loseits focus, everyone knows that the arts and sciences faculty is where the actionis, that the other schools are ancillary to it, that it is the center oflearning and prestige. This much of the old order has been preserved. Thechallenge at Cornell was issued to the College of Arts and Sciences, as was thecase everywhere throughout the sixties. The problem thus had to be faced by thenatural sciences, the social sciences and the humanities. They were asked tochange their content and their standards, to eliminate elitism, racism andsexism as “perceived” by students. But the community of scholars proved to be nocommunity. There was no solidarity in defense of the pursuit of truth.The natural scientists were above the battle, an island unto themselves, and didnot feel threatened. I believe that only one natural scientist at Cornell spokeout against the presence of guns or the bullying of professors. The university’smost famous professor, a Nobel prizewinning physicist, became a leadingspokesman in defense of the president without once consulting those professorswhose lives had been threatened or posing the question of what was at stake. Hedeplored the violence but took no action or uttered any word indicating where aline should be drawn. As far as I know, none of the natural scientists was incahoots with the thugs, as were some social scientists and humanists. It was theabsolute independence of their work from the rest of the university’s activity,and their trust that theirs is the important work, that made them indifferent.They did not share a common good with the rest of us. Walking to the meetingwhere the faculty capitulated to the students—a truly disgraceful event, amicrocosm of cowardly acquiescence to the establishment of tyranny—in thecompany of a friend who had had to suffer the humiliation of leaving his homeand hiding out with his family after receiving explicit threats, I heard aprofessor of biology loudly asking, perhaps for our benefit, “Do these socialscientists really believe there is any danger?” My friend looked at me sadly andsaid, “With colleagues like that, you don’t need enemies.”Because the student movements were so untheoretical, the natural sciences werenot a target, as they had once been in high-grade fascism and communism. Therewere no Lenins thundering against positivism, relativity or genetics, noGoebbels alert to the falseness of Jewish science. There had been the beginningsof an offensive against the scientists’ collaboration with themilitary-industrial complex, as well as their role in producing the technologythat abets capitalism and pollutes the environment. But none of this went to theheart of the serious scientists’ research. They were able to avoid the fury bydistancing themselves from certain unpopular applications of their knowledge, byinsulting the government which supported them, and by declaring themselves forpeace and social justice. Here too the great Cornell physicist has, predictably,distinguished himself by making a habit of apologizing for physics’ hand inproducing thermonuclear weapons. But these scientists were not asked to changeone thing in their studies, their classes or their laboratories. So they optedout.This behavior was not merely selfishness and self-protectiveness, every man forhimself, although there was a good deal of that, accompanied with the usualdistasteful moralizing rhetoric. The atmosphere of crisis caused a not entirelyconscious reassessment of natural science’s relation to the university. Crisesin the intellectual world as well as in the political one tend to bring to thesurface tensions and changes in interest that it is easier not to face as longas things are calm. To break old alliances and form new ones is always a painfulbusiness, as, for example, when liberals broke with Stalinists at the beginningof the Cold War. The scientists found themselves confronted with the fact thatthey had no real connection with the rest of the university, and that to casttheir lot with it was costly. One cannot imagine that biologists would have beenso callous if chemistry had somehow become a target for cultural revolution, andyoung Red Guards monitored its teachings and terrorized its practitioners.Chemists are biologists’ blood relations, and their knowledge is absolutelyindispensable for the progress of biology. But it is not now conceivable that aphysicist qua physicist could learn anything important, or anything at all, froma professor of comparative literature or of sociology. The natural scientist’sconnection with the rest of humane learning is not familial but abstract, alittle like our connection with humanity as a whole. There may be a formulaicinvocation of rights applicable to all, but nothing that moves with the burningimmediacy of shared convictions and interests. “I can live without you” is thesilent thought that steals into one’s mind when such relations become painful.The reality of separateness has existed since Kant, the last philosopher who wasa significant natural scientist, and Goethe, the last great literary figure whocould believe that his contributions to science might be greater than hiscontributions to literature. And, it should be remembered, it was not that theywere philosopher and poet who happened to dabble in science, but that theirwritings were mirrors of nature and that their science was guided and informedby meditation on being, freedom and beauty. They represented the last gasp ofthe old unity of the questions before natural science became the Switzerland oflearning, safely neutral to the battles taking place on the darkling plain.Henry Adams—whose life bridged the last epoch when gentlemen, such as Jefferson,thought science both attainable and useful for them, and the one wherescientists speak an incomprehensible language that teaches nothing about lifebut is necessary to life as information—takes note of this change in his quirkyway. When he was young he had studied natural science and had given it up; whenas an old man he looked again in that direction, he found that he was in a newworld. The old university traditions and ideals had concealed the fact that theancient bonds had decayed and the marriage was washed up. The great scientistsof the nineteenth century and twentieth century were in general cultivated menwho had some experience of, and real admiration for, the other parts oflearning. The increasing specialization of the natural sciences and the naturalscientists gradually caused the protective fog to lift. Since the sixties thescientists have had less and less to say to, and to do with, their colleagues inthe social sciences and humanities. The university has lost whatever polis-likecharacter it had and has become like the ship on which the passengers are justaccidental fellow travelers soon to disembark and go their separate ways. Therelations between natural science, social science and humanities are purelyadministrative and have no substantial intellectual content. They only meet onthe level of the first two years of undergraduate education, and there thenatural scientists are largely concerned with protecting their interest in theyoung who will be coming their way.A perfect illustration of this situation appeared a few years ago in a New YorkTimes account of the visit of a professor of music to Rockefeller University.The life scientists working there brought bag lunches to the musicologist’slecture. The project was inspired by C. P. Snow’s silly conceits about “the twocultures,” the rift between which he proposed to heal by getting humanists tolearn the second law of thermodynamics and physicists to read Shakespeare. Thisenterprise would, of course, be something other than an exercise in spiritualuplift only if the physicist learned something important for his physics fromShakespeare, and if the humanist similarly profited from the second law ofthermodynamics. In fact, nothing of the sort ensues. For the scientist thehumanities are recreation (often deeply respected by him, for he sees that moreis needed than what he offers, but is puzzled about where to find it), and forthe humanist the natural sciences are at best indifferent, at worst alien andhostile.The Times quoted Joshua Lederberg, the president of Rockefeller University, fromwhich philosophy had recently been banished, as saying after the lecture that C.P. Snow was on the right track but “counted wrong”—there are not two but manycultures, one example of which is that of the Beatles. This represents theultimate trivialization of a trivial idea that was just a rest station on adownward slope. Lederberg saw in the humanities not the human knowledge thatcomplements the study of nature but merely another expression of what was goingon in the world. In the end, it is all more or less sophisticated show business.With a kind of wink at his audience Lederberg lets us know that in this sea ofdemocratic relativism natural science stands out like Gibraltar. All the rest isa matter of taste.This disposition affected the natural scientists’ behavior at Cornell andeverywhere else. In the attempt to use the admission of students and appointmentof faculty as means for this or that social goal, which has lowered universitystandards and obscured the university’s purpose, they cooperated with the newagenda, in their own way. They adopted the rhetoric of anti-elitism, antisexismand antiracism, and quietly resisted doing anything about the issues in theirown domain. They passed the buck to the social scientists and the humanists, whoproved more accommodating and could be more easily bullied. Natural scientiststoo are Americans, in general favorably disposed to the mood of the times. Butthey are also pretty sure of what they are doing. They cannot deceive themselvesthat they are teaching science when they are not. They have powerful operationalmeasures of competence. And inwardly they believe, at least in my experience,that the only real knowledge is scientific knowledge. In the dilemma that facedthem—mathematicians wanted, for example, to see more blacks and women hired butcould not find nearly enough competent ones—they in effect said that thehumanists and social scientists should hire them. Believing that there are noreal standards outside of the natural sciences, they assumed that adjustmentscould easily be made. With the profoundest irresponsibility, scientists wentalong with various aspects of affirmative action, assuming, for example, thatany minority students admitted without proper qualifications would be taken careof by other departments if they did not do well in science. The scientists didnot anticipate large-scale failure of such students, with the really terribleconsequences that would entail. They took it for granted that these studentswould succeed somewhere else in the university. And they were right. Thehumanities and social sciences were debauched and grade inflation took off,while the natural sciences remain largely the preserve of white males. Thus thetrue elitists of the university have been able to stay on the good side of theforces of history without having to suffer any of the consequences.To find hysterical supporters of the revolution one had, not surprisingly, to goto the humanities. Passion and commitment, as opposed to coolness, reason andobjectivity, found their home there. The drama included a proclamation from agroup of humanities teachers threatening to take over a building if theuniversity did not capitulate forthwith. A student told me that one of hishumanities professors, himself a Jew, had said to him that Jews deserved to beput in concentration camps because of what they had done to blacks. Finallythese men and women were in action instead of idling away their time inlibraries and classrooms. But they worked to their own undoing, for it is thehumanities that have suffered most as a result of the sixties. The lack ofstudent interest, the near disappearance of language study, the vanishing ofjobs for Ph.D.s, the lack of public sympathy, came from the overturning of theold order, where their place was assured. They have gotten what they deserved,but we have unfortunately all lost.The reasons for this behavior on the part of many humanists are obvious andconstitute the theme of this book. Cornell was in the forefront of certaintrends in the humanities as well as in politics. It had for several years been alaundering operation for radical Left French ideas in comparative literature.From Sartre, through Goldmann, to Foucault and Derrida, each successive wavewashed over the Cornell shores. These ideas were intended to give new life toold books. A technique of reading, a framework for interpretation—Marx, Freud,structuralism, and on and on—could incorporate these tired old books and makethem a part of revolutionary consciousness. At last there was an active,progressive role for the humanists, who had been only antiquarians, eunuchsguarding a harem of aging and now unattractive courtesans. Moreover, the almostuniversal historicism prevailing in the humanities prepared the soul fordevotion to the emergent. Added to this was the expectation that in such changesculture would take primacy over science. The intellectual anti-universityideology of which I have spoken found its expression in these conditions, as theuniversity could be thought to be the stage of history. Lucien Goldmann told mea few months before his death that he was privileged to have lived to see hisnine-year-old son throw a rock through a store window in the Paris of ’68. Hisstudies of Racine and Pascal culminated in this. Humanitas redivivas! Studentstook to the action but not to the books. They could work on the future withoutthe assistance of the past or its teachers. The avant-garde’s fond expectationthat the revolution would introduce an age of creativity, that art rather thanantiquarianism would flower, that imagination would finally have its inningsagainst reason, did not find immediate fulfillment.The professors of humanities are in an impossible situation and do not believein themselves or what they do. Like it or not, they are essentially involvedwith interpreting and transmitting old books, preserving what we call tradition,in a democratic order where tradition is not privileged. They are partisans ofthe leisured and beautiful in a place where evident utility is the onlypassport. Their realm is the always and the contemplative, in a setting thatdemands only the here and now and the active. The justice in which they believeis egalitarian, and they are the agents of the rare, the refined and thesuperior. By definition they are out of it, and their democratic inclinationsand guilt push them to be with it. After all, what do Shakespeare and Miltonhave to do with solving our problems? Particularly when one looks into them andfinds that they are the repositories of the elitist, sexist, nationalistprejudice we are trying to overcome.Not only did the thing in itself require a conviction and dedication not oftenreally present in the professors, the clientele was disappearing. The studentsjust were not persuaded that what was being offered them was important. Theloneliness and sense of worthlessness were crushing, so these humanists jumpedon the fastest, most streamlined express to the future. This meant, of course,that all the tendencies hostile to the humanities were radicalized, and thehumanities, without reservations, were pitched off the train. Natural and socialscience found their seats by demonstrating a usefulness of one kind or another.This the humanities were unable to do.The apolitical character of the humanities, the habitual deformation orsuppression of the political content in the classic literature, which should bepart of a political education, left a void in the soul that could be filled withany politics, particularly the most vulgar, extreme and current. The humanities,unlike the natural sciences, had nothing to lose, or so it was thought, and,unlike the social sciences, they had no knowledge of the intractableness of thepolitical matter. Humanists ran like lemmings into the sea, thinking they wouldrefresh and revitalize themselves in it. They drowned.This left the social sciences as the battleground, both the point of attack andthe only place where any kind of stand was made. They were the newest part ofthe university, the part that could least boast of great past achievement orcontribution to the store of human wisdom, the part the very legitimacy of whichwas questionable and where genius had participated most modestly. But the socialsciences were principally concerned with the human things, were supposed to bein possession of the facts about social life and had a certain scientificconscience and integrity about reporting them. The social sciences were ofinterest to everyone who had a program, who might care about prosperity, peaceor war, equality, racial or sexual discrimination. This interest could be to getthe facts—or to make the facts fit their agenda and influence the public.The temptations to alter the facts in these disciplines are enormous. Reward,punishment, money, praise, blame, sense of guilt and desire to do good, allswirl around them, dizzying their practitioners. Everyone wants the story toldby social science to fit their wishes and their needs. Hobbes said that if thefact that two and two makes four were to become a matter of political relevance,there would be a faction to deny it. Social science has had more than its shareof ideologues and charlatans. But it has also produced scholars of great probitywhose works have made it harder for dishonest policy to triumph.Thus it was in social science that the radicals first struck. A group of blackactivists disrupted the class of an economics teacher, then proceeded to thechairman’s office and held him and his secretary (who suffered from heartdisease) hostage for thirteen hours. The charge, of course, was that the teacherwas racist in using a Western standard for judgment of the efficiency of Africaneconomic performance. The students were praised for calling the problem to theattention of the authorities, the chairman refused to proffer charges againstthem, and the teacher disappeared miraculously from campus, never to be seenagain.This kind of problem-solving was typical, but some professors in the socialsciences did not like it. Historians were being asked to rewrite the history ofthe world, and of the United States in particular, to show that nations werealways conspiratorial systems of domination and exploitation. Psychologists werebeing pestered to prove the psychological damage done by inequality and theexistence of nuclear weapons, and to show that American statesmen were paranoidabout the Soviet Union. Political scientists were urged to interpret the NorthVietnamese as nationalists and to remove the stigma of totalitarianism from theSoviet Union. Every conceivable radical view concerning domestic or foreignpolicy demanded support from the social sciences. In particular, the crimes ofelitism, sexism and racism were to be exorcised from social science, which wasto be used as a tool to fight them and a fourth cardinal sin, anticommunism.Nobody of course would dare to admit to any of these sins, and seriousdiscussion of the underlying issue, equality itself, had long been banished fromthe scene. As in the Middle Ages, when everyone except for a few intrepid andfoolish souls professed Christianity and the only discussion concerned whatconstituted orthodoxy, the major student activity in social science was toidentify heretics. These were scholars who seriously studied sexualdifferentiation or who raised questions about the educational value of busing orwho considered the possibility of limited nuclear war. It became almostimpossible to question the radical orthodoxy without risking vilification,classroom disruption, loss of the confidence and respect necessary for teaching,and the hostility of colleagues. Racist and sexist were, and are, very uglylabels—the equivalents of atheist or communist in other days with otherprevailing prejudices—which can be pinned on persons promiscuously and which,once attached, are almost impossible to cast off. Nothing could be said withimpunity. Such an atmosphere made detached, dispassionate study impossible.This suited many social scientists, but a new, tougher strain emerged out of thestruggle. Some saw that their objectivity was threatened, and without respectand protection for scholarly inquiry any one of them might be put at risk. Thepressure revived an old liberalism and awareness of the importance of academicfreedom. Pride and self-respect, unwillingness to give way before menace andinsult, asserted themselves. These social scientists knew that all parties in ademocracy are jeopardized when passion can sweep the facts before it. Most ofall, an instinctive disgust at loudspeakers blaring propaganda was roused inthem. Such social scientists were not necessarily all of the same personalpolitical persuasion. Their fellow feeling consisted in mutual respect for themotives of colleagues with whom they did not always agree but from whosedisagreement they might profit, and in attachment to the institutions thatprotected their research. At Cornell one found social scientists of left, rightand center—on the admittedly narrow spectrum that prevails in the Americanuniversity—joining together to protest the outrage against academic freedom andagainst their colleagues that took place there and continues in more or lesssubtle forms everywhere. It is not an accident that the challenge to theuniversity was mounted in its most political part, and that there it was bestunderstood. The political perspective is the one in which the moral unity oflearning naturally comes into focus and the goodness of science is tested.I unfortunately cannot assert that this crisis has caused social science tobroaden its concerns or has induced the other disciplines to reflect on theirown situations. But it was inspiring to be momentarily with a band of scholarswho were really willing to make a sacrifice for their love of truth and theirstudies, to discover that the pieties could be more than pieties, to sensecommunity founded on conviction. The other disciplines have, in general, not puttheir professed attachment to free inquiry to the test. Their immunity is alarge part of the story behind the fractured structure of our universities.THE DISCIPLINESHow are they today, the big three that rule the academic roost and determinewhat is knowledge? Natural science is doing just fine. Living alone, buthappily, running along like a well-wound clock, successful and useful as ever.There have been great things lately, physicists with their black holes andbiologists with their genetic code. Its objects and methods are agreed upon. Itoffers exciting lives to persons of very high intelligence and providesimmeasurable benefits to mankind at large. Our way of life is utterly dependenton the natural scientists, and they have more than fulfilled their everypromise. Only at the margins are there questions that might threaten theirtheoretical equanimity—doubts about whether America produces synoptic scientificgeniuses, doubts about the use of the results of science, such as nuclearweapons, doubts that lead to biology’s need for “ethicists” in its experimentsand its applications when, as scientists, they know that there are no suchknowers as ethicists. In general, however, all is well.But where natural science ends, trouble begins. It ends at man, the one beingoutside of its purview, or to be exact, it ends at that part or aspect of manthat is not body, whatever that may be. Scientists as scientists can be graspedonly under that aspect, as is the case with politicians, artists and prophets.All that is human, all that is of concern to us, lies outside of naturalscience. That should be a problem for natural science, but it is not. It iscertainly a problem for us that we do not know what this thing is, that wecannot even agree on a name for this irreducible bit of man that is not body.Somehow this fugitive thing or aspect is the cause of science and society andculture and politics and economics and poetry and music. We know what theselatter are. But can we really, if we do not know their cause, know what itsstatus is, whether it even exists?The difficulty is reflected in the fact that for the study of this one theme,man, or this je ne sais quoi pertaining to man, and his activities and products,there are two great divisions of the university—humanities and socialscience—while for bodies there is only natural science. This would all be verywell if the division of labor were founded on an agreement about the subjectmatter and reflected a natural articulation within it, as do the divisionsbetween physics, chemistry and biology, leading to mutual respect andcooperation. It could be believed and is sometimes actually said, mostly incommencement speeches, that social science treats man’s social life, andhumanities his creative life—the great works of art, etc. And, although there issomething to this kind of distinction, it really will not do. This fact comes tolight in a variety of ways. While both social science and humanities are more orless willingly awed by natural science, they have a mutual contempt for oneanother, the former looking down on the latter as unscientific, the latterregarding the former as philistine. They do not cooperate. And most important,they occupy much of the same ground. Many of the classic books now part of thehumanities talk about the same things as do social scientists but use differentmethods and draw different conclusions; and each of the social sciences in oneway or another attempts to explain the activities of the various kinds ofartists in ways that are contrary to the way they are treated in the humanities.The difference comes down to the fact that social science really wants to bepredictive, meaning that man is predictable, while the humanities say that he isnot. The divisions between the two camps resemble truce lines rather thanscientific distinctions. They disguise old and unresolved struggles about thebeing of man.The social sciences and the humanities represent the two responses to the crisiscaused by the definitive ejection of man—or of the residue of man extractedfrom, or superfluous to, body—from nature, and hence from the purview of naturalscience or natural philosophy, toward the end of the eighteenth century. Oneroute led toward valiant efforts to assimilate man to the new natural sciences,to make the science of man the next rung in the ladder down from biology. Theother took over the territory newly opened up by Kant, that of freedom asopposed to nature, separate but equal, not requiring the aping of the methods ofnatural science, taking spirituality at least as seriously as body. Neitherchallenged the champion, natural science, newly emancipated from philosophy:social science tried humbly to find a place at court, humanities proudly to setup shop next door. The result has been two continuous and ill-assorted strandsof thought about man, one tending to treat him essentially as another of thebrutes, without spirituality, soul, self, consciousness, or what have you; theother acting as though he is not an animal or does not have a body. There is nojunction of these two roads. One must choose between them, and they end up invery different places, e.g., Walden II, known as Brave New World by the otherside, and The Blessed Isles (a favorite retreat of Zarathustra), known as TheKingdom of Darkness by its opponents.Neither of these solutions has fully succeeded. Social science receives norecognition from natural science.13 It is an imitation, not a part. And thehumanities shop has turned out to be selling diverse and ill-assorted antiques,decaying and ever dustier, while business gets worse and worse. Social sciencehas proved more robust, more in harmony with the world dominated by naturalscience, and, while losing its inspiration and evangelical fervor, has proveduseful to different aspects of modern life, as the mere mention of economics andpsychology indicates. Humanities languish, but this proves only that they do notsuit the modern world. It may very well be the indication of what is wrong withmodernity. Moreover the language that in an unscholarly way influences life sopowerfully today emerged from investigations undertaken in the realm of freedom.Social science comes more out of the school founded by Locke; humanities out ofthat founded by Rousseau. But social science, while looking to natural science,has actually received a large part of its impulse in recent times from thenether world. One need only think of Weber, although Marx and Freud are similarcases. It cannot be avowed, but man, to be grasped, needs something the naturalsciences cannot provide. Man is the problem, and we live with various stratagemsfor not facing it. The strange relations between the three divisions ofknowledge in the present university tell us all about it.To look at social science first, it might seem that it at least has a generaloutline of its field and a possible systematic ordering of its parts, proceedingfrom psychology to economics to sociology to political science. Unfortunatelythere is nothing to this appearance. In the first place, it leaves outanthropology, although I suppose that if I were desperate to make a case I couldfind a way of squeezing it in; and it also leaves out history, about which thereis dispute as to whether it belongs to social science or humanities. Moreimportant, these various social sciences do not see themselves in any such orderof interdependence. Largely they work independently, and if they, to use thathopeless expression, “interface” at all, they frequently turn out to betwo-faced. Within most of the specialties, about half of the practitionersusually do not believe the other half even belong among them, and something ofthe same situation prevails throughout the discipline as a whole. Economics hasits own simple built-in psychology, and that provided by the science ofpsychology is either really part of biology, which does not help much, or flatlycontradicts the primacy of the motives alleged by economics. Similarly,economics tends to undermine the normal interpretation of political events thatpolitical science would make. It is possible to have an economics-guided or-controlled political science, but it is not necessary; and it is equallypossible to have a psychology-guided political science, which would not be thesame as the former. It is as though there were a dispute among the variousnatural sciences about which is primary. Actually each of the social sciencescan, and does, make a claim to be the beginning point in relation to which theothers can be understood—economics arguing for the economy or the market,psychology for the individual psyche, sociology for society, anthropology forculture, and political science for the political order (although this latter isthe least assertive about its claim). The issue is what is the social scienceatom, and each specialty can argue that the others are properly parts of thewhole that it represents. Moreover each can accuse the other of representing anabstraction, or a construct, or a figment of the imagination. Is there ever apure market, one not part of a society or a culture that forms it? What is aculture or society? Are they ever more than aspects of some kind of politicalorder? Here political science is in the strongest position, because the realityof states or nations is undeniable, although they can in turn be consideredsuperficial or compound phenomena. The social sciences actually represent aseries of different perspectives on the human world we see around us, a seriesthat is not harmonious, because there is not even agreement as to what belongsto that world, let alone as to what kinds of causes would account for itsphenomena.A further source of dispute within social science concerns what is meant byscience. All agree that it must be reasonable, have some standards ofverification and be based on systematic research. Moreover, there is a more orless explicit agreement that the kinds of causes admitted within natural scienceshould somehow apply within social science. This means no teleology and no“spiritual” causes. Pursuit of salvation would, for example, need to be reducedto another kind of cause, like repressed sexuality, whereas pursuit of moneywould not. Search for material causes and reduction of higher or more complexphenomena to lower or simpler ones are generally accepted procedures. But towhat extent the example of the most successful of the modern natural sciences,mathematical physics, can or should be followed within social science is amatter of endless discussion and quarreling. Prediction is the hallmark ofmodern natural science, and practically every social scientist would like to beable to make reliable predictions, although practically none have. Predictionappears to have been made possible in natural science by reducing phenomena insuch a way as to be amenable to expression in mathematical formulas, and mostsocial scientists want the same thing to happen in their discipline. The issueis whether various efforts in that direction cause distortion of the socialphenomena, or lead to the neglect of some that are not easily mathematized andthe preference for others that are; or whether they encourage the constructionof mathematical models that are figments of the imagination and have nothing todo with the real world. A kind of continuous guerrilla war goes on between thosewho are primarily enthusiasts of science and those who are primarily attached totheir particular subject matter.Economics, held to be the most successful of the social sciences, is the mostmathematized—both in the sense that its objects can be counted and that it canconstruct mathematical models for at least hypothetically predictive purposes.But some political scientists, for example, say that the Economic Man may bevery nice for playing games with but that he is an abstraction who does notexist, while Hitler and Stalin are real and not to be played with. Economicanalysis, they say, not only does not help us to understand such politicalactors but makes it more difficult to bring them within the purview of socialscience by systematically excluding or deforming their specific motives.Economists, seeking mathematical convenience, turn us away from theconsideration of the most important social phenomena, assert the objectors(including the small, vociferous band of Marxist economists who are rigorouslyexcluded from the core of the discipline, the only social science in which thishas happened). So it goes between the various disciplines and within several ofthem where the adherents of the different approaches have no common universe ofdiscourse.Publicity aside, what students actually see today when they first encountersocial science are two robust, self-sufficient, self-confident social sciences,economics and cultural anthropology, extremes forming the antipodes, havingalmost nothing to do with each other—while political science and sociology,quite heterogenous, not to say chaotic in their contents, are strung tenselybetween the two poles.14 It should not be surprising that these two disciplinesare more explicit than are the other social sciences about their founders: Lockeand Adam Smith, on the one hand, and Rousseau on the other. For these scienceshave as their clear presuppositions one or the other of the two states ofnature. Locke argued that man’s conquest of nature by his work is the onlyrational response to his original situation. Locke emancipated greed and showedthe illusory character of the countervailing motives. Life, liberty and thepursuit of property are the fundamental natural rights, and the social contractis made to protect these rights. These principles agreed upon, economics comesinto being as the science of man’s proper activity, and the free market as thenatural and rational order (a natural order unlike other recognized naturalorders in that it requires establishment by men, and they, as economists areconstantly telling us, almost always get it wrong). Economists have in generalstuck to this, are in general old liberals of one kind or another and supportersof liberal democracy, as the place where the market exists. Rousseau argued thatnature is good and man far away from it. So the quest for those faraway originsbecomes imperative, and anthropology is by that very fact founded. Lévi-Straussis unambiguous about this. Civilization, practically identical to the freemarket and its results, threatens happiness and dissolves community. From thisfollows immediately admiration for tight old cultures that channel and sublimatethe economic motive and do not permit the emergence of the free market. Whateconomists believe to be things of the irrational past—known only asunderdeveloped societies15—become the proper study of man, a diagnosis of ourills and a call to the future. Anthropologists have tended to be very open tomany aspects of the Continental reflection, from culture on down, to whicheconomists were completely closed (Nietzsche’s influence was already evidentmore than fifty years ago in Ruth Benedict’s distinction between Apollonian andDionysian cultures); they have tended to the Left (because the extreme Right,equally viable in their system, had no roots here) and to be susceptible toinfatuations with experiments tending to correct or replace liberal democracy.Economists teach that the market is the fundamental social phenomenon, and itsculmination is money. Anthropologists teach that culture is the fundamentalsocial phenomenon, and its culmination is the sacred.16 Such is theconfrontation—man the producer of consumption goods vs. man the producer ofculture, the maximizing animal vs. the reverent one—between old philosophicteachings present here but not addressed. The disciplines simply inhabitdifferent worlds. They can be of marginal use to one another, but not in aspirit of community. There are few economists who also think of themselves asanthropologists, and vice versa, although there are, for example, many politicalscientists and sociologists who cross one another’s borders, as well as those ofeconomics and anthropology. The economists are the ones most ready to jump thesocial science ship and go it on their own, and think themselves closer than theothers to having achieved a real science. They also have substantial influenceon public policy. The anthropologists have no such influence beyond the academicworld but have the charms of depth and comprehensiveness, as well as thepossession of the latest ideas.A few words about political science and its peculiarities might help to clarifythe problems of social science as a whole. To begin with, it is, along witheconomics, the only purely academic discipline that, like medicine, engages afundamental passion and the study of which could be understood as undertaken inorder to ensure its satisfaction. Political science involves the love ofjustice, the love of glory and the love of ruling. But unlike medicine andeconomics, which are quite frank about their relations to health and wealth, andeven trumpet them, political science turns modestly away from such avowals andwould even like to break off these unseemly relations. This has something to dowith the fact that she is a very old lady indeed, who would prefer not to showher age. Political science goes all the way back to Greek antiquity and has thedubious parentage of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, all with bad reputations inthe land of modern science. The other social sciences are of modern origin andpart of the modern project, while political science persists, trying tomodernize and get with it but unable entirely to control old instincts.Aristotle said that political science is the architectonic science, a rulingscience, concerned with the comprehensive good or the best regime. But realscience does not talk about good and bad, so that had to be abandoned. However,both medicine and economics really do talk about good and bad, so theabandonment of the old political goods had the effect only of leaving the moralfield to health and wealth in the absence of the common good and justice. Thisaccords with Locke’s intention, which was not at all “value-free,” but was tosubstitute lower but more solid, more easily attained goods for those that hadbeen classically proposed. Political science’s transformation into a modernsocial science did not further social science but did further the politicalintentions of modernity’s founders. It has tried to reduce the specificallypolitical motives into subpolitical ones, like those proposed in economics.Honor is not a real motive; gain is.Of course Locke himself was still much more a political scientist than aneconomist, for the market (the peaceful competition for the acquisition ofgoods) requires the prior existence of the social contract (the agreement toabide by contracts and the establishment of a judge to arbitrate and enforcecontracts) without which men are in a state of war. The market presupposes theexistence of law and the absence of war. War was the condition of man prior tothe existence of civil society, and the return to it is always possible. Theforce and fraud required to end war have nothing to do with the market and areillegitimate within it. The rational behavior of men at peace, in whicheconomics specializes, is not the same as the rational behavior of men at war,as was so tellingly pointed out by Machiavelli. Political science is morecomprehensive than economics because it studies both peace and war and theirrelations. The market cannot be the sole concern of the polity, for the marketdepends on the polity, and the establishment and preservation of the politycontinuously requires reasonings and deeds which are “uneconomic” or“inefficient.” Political action must have primacy over economic action, nomatter what the effect on the market. This is why economists have had so littlereliable to say about foreign policy, for nations are in the primitive state ofwar with each other that individuals were in prior to the social contract—thatis, they have no commonly recognized judge to whom they can turn to settle theirdisputes. The policy advice of some economists during the Vietnam war attemptedto set up a kind of market between the United States and North Vietnam, with theUnited States making the cost of South Vietnam prohibitive to North Vietnam; butthe North Vietnamese refused to play. Political science, as opposed toeconomics, must always contemplate war with its altogether different risks,horrors, thrills, and gravity. Churchill formulated the difference between apolitical perspective and a market perspective in commenting on Coolidge’srefusal to forgive the British war debts in the twenties. Coolidge said, “Theyhired the money, didn’t they?” To which Churchill responded, “This is true, butnot exhaustive.” Political science must be exhaustive and this makes it a stickysubject for those who want to reform it so as to accord with the abstractprojects of science. Consciously or unconsciously, economics deals only with thebourgeois, the man motivated by fear of violent death. The warlike man is notwithin its ken. Political science remains the only social science disciplinewhich looks war in the face.Political science has always been the least attractive and the least impressiveof the social sciences, spanning as it does old and new views of man and thehuman sciences. It has a polyglot character. Part of it has joined joyfully inthe effort to dismantle the political order seen as a comprehensive order and tounderstand it as a result of subpolitical causes. Economics, psychology andsociology as well as all kinds of methodological diagnosticians have beenwelcome guests. But there are irrepressible, putatively unscientific parts ofpolitical science. The practitioners of these parts of the discipline are unableto overcome their unexplained and unexplainable political instincts—theirawareness that politics is the authoritative arena of effective good and evil.They therefore engage in policy studies whose end, whether it is stated or not,is action. Defense of freedom, avoidance of war, the furthering ofequality—various aspects of justice in action—are hot subjects of study. Thegood regime has to be the theme of such political scientists, if onlyundercover, and they are informed by the question “What is to be done?” And, ina real peripety, it turns out that the area of political science wheremathematics has had the greatest success is elections, the most exciting anddecisive part of democratic life, where public opinion turns into government andpolicy. The most scientific element of political science is one that makes itspractitioners friends and allies of real politicians, enlightening them andlearning from them. Science here parallels the greatest political thrills andhas no need of changing the perceived nature of its object to study itscientifically.So political science resembles a rather haphazard bazaar with shops kept by amixed population. This has something to do with its hybrid nature and its dualorigins in antiquity and modernity. The reality with which it deals lends itselfless to abstractions and makes more urgent demands than do any of the othersocial science disciplines, while the tension between objectivity andpartisanship in it is much more extreme. Everything in modern natural and socialscience militates against the assertion that politics is qualitatively differentfrom other kinds of human association, but its practice repeatedly affirms thecontrary. Its heterogeneity is perhaps debilitating, and one finds here choicetheorists of the economic-models school, old-fashioned behavioralists, Marxists(who are never at home in economics), historians and policy researchers. Mostunusual of all, political science is the only discipline in the university (withthe possible exception of the philosophy department) that has a philosophicbranch. This has long been an embarrassment to it, and political philosophy wasscheduled for termination in the forties and fifties. “We want to be a realsocial science,” cried the terminators with an exasperated stamp of the foot.But a combination of serious and fervent scholarship on the part of a fewthinkers and the muscle of the rebellious students in the sixties gave politicalphilosophy a reprieve that now looks permanent. It became, for the best and theworst of reasons, the bastion of the reaction against value-free social scienceand the new social science as a whole. It has, where its presence is at allserious, proved to be continuously the most attractive subject in the field forboth graduate and undergraduate students. And as the new scientific persuasionhas lost much of its élan and the field has fragmented in various directionsdictated at least partly by fidelity to the political phenomena, many of thosewho were once fierce enemies of political philosophy have become its allies.Political philosophy is far from ruling, but it provides at least a reminiscenceof those old questions about good and evil and the resources for examining thehidden presuppositions of modern political science and political life.Aristotle’s Politics is still alive there, as well as Locke’s Treatise on CivilGovernment and Rousseau’s Discourse on the Origins of Inequality. Aristotleasserts that man is by nature a political animal, which means that he has animpulse toward civil society. Reading Aristotle helps to lay bare the hiddenpremise underlying modern social science, that man is by nature a solitarybeing, and could provide the basis for making a debate of it again.17Obviously, then, the glory days of social science from the point of view ofliberal education are over. Gone is the time when Marx, Freud and Weber,philosophers and interpreters of the world, were just precursors of what was tobe America’s intellectual coming of age, when youngsters could join the charmsof science and self-knowledge, when there was the expectation of a universaltheory of man that would unite the university and contribute to progress,harnessing Europe’s intellectual depth and heritage with our vitality. Naturalscience was to culminate in human science; Darwin and Einstein would tell socialscience as much as they had told natural science. And modernliterature—Dostoyevski, Joyce, Proust, Kafka—expressed our mood and provided theinsights that social science would systematize and prove. Psychoanalysisprovided the link between private experience and public intellectual endeavor.So unified was the experience that personal desire was intimately connected withintuition of the comprehensive order of things, a simulacrum of the oldunderstanding of philosophy as a way of life. On a much less sophisticated levelbut expressing something of the same ethos, Margaret Mead had a new science thattook one to exotic places, brought back new understandings of society and alsoproved the legitimacy of one’s repressed sexual desires. To young people, thesociologists and psychologists who trod the university’s grounds could look likeheroes of the life of the mind. They were initiated into the mysteries and mighthelp us to become initiates too. Old-style philosophy had been overcome, butnames like Hegel, Schopenhauer and Kierkegaard were thought to offer some of theexperience required for our adventure.Such an atmosphere as surrounded social science in the forties was obviously ofambiguous value for both students and professors. But something akin to it isnecessary if American students are to be attracted to the idea of liberaleducation and the awareness that the university will cause them to discover newfaculties in themselves and reveal another level of existence that had beenhidden from them. American students, it must be remembered, if they have learnedanything at all in high school, have learned natural science as a technique, notas a way of life or a means of discovering life. If anything other than routinespecialized learning is to touch them, they must be given a shock treatment—evenif it is only to make them think about their commitment to natural science andits meaning, inasmuch as their earlier training has been more of anindoctrination, more of a conformism, than the discovery of a vocation. Thesocial science inebriation of the forties was not, I believe, the genuinearticle, but it reproduced something of the intellectual excitement surroundingtheoretical new beginnings. It proved fertile for many students and scholars,generated its own ancillary bohemia and affected the substance of people’slives. It was not just a profession.The hopes for a unity of social science have faded, and it cannot present acommon front. It is a series of discrete disciplines and subdisciplines. Mostare modest, and although there is a lot of nonsense, there are also a fairnumber of really useful parts practiced by highly competent specialists. Theexpectations are radically lowered. Economics is a specialty that has universalpretensions to explain and encompass everything, but they are not quitebelieved, and its popularity does not rest on them. Political science does noteven try to make good its ancestral claim to comprehensiveness and only covertlyand partially makes its special and rightful appeal to the political passion.Anthropology is the only social science discipline still exercising the charm ofpossible wholeness, with its idea of culture, which appears more really completethan does the economists’ idea of the market. Both the superpolitical culturalpart and the subpolitical economic part claim to be the whole, while neithersociology nor political science, apart from certain individuals, really seems tomake any claims over the whole social science enterprise. There is no socialscience as an architectonic science. It is parts without a whole.Similarly, with the possible exceptions of computer science as a model for man,and sociobiology, the expectation of substantive unity between natural scienceand social science has faded, leaving social science a consumer only of naturalscience method. Gone is the cosmic intention of placing man in the universe. Inthe direction of the humanities, it is again only anthropology that hasmaintained a certain opening, particularly to the merchandise being hawked incomparative literature, but also to serious studies, e.g., Greek religion. Noother social scientists expect to get much from nineteenth- andtwentieth-century art and literature, which fascinated many significant socialscientists a generation ago, and there are fewer and fewer social scientists whohave much familiarity with that sort of thing in a personal way. The socialsciences have become an island in the university floating alongside the othertwo islands, full of significant information and hiding treasures of greatquestions that could be mined but are not. Notably, the social scienceintellectual in the German or French mold, looked upon as a kind of sage or wiseman who could tell all about life, has all but disappeared.The students are aware of this and do not turn to the social sciences in generalfor the experience of conversion. Particular things or particular professors maybe of interest to them for one reason or another, but for any who might happento be looking for the meaning of life, or who might be able to learn that thatis what they should look for, social science is not now the place to go.Anthropology, to repeat myself, is something of an exception. The secret ofsocial science’s great early success with intelligent young Americans was thatit was the only place in the university that seemed, however indirectly, to seekthe answer to the Socratic question of how one should live. Even when it wasmost vigorously teaching that values cannot be the subject matter of knowledge,that very teaching taught about life, as shown by such once excitingcontrivances as Weber’s distinction between the ethics of intention and theethics of responsibility. This was not textbook learning, but the real stuff oflife. Nothing like this is to be found there today.Moreover, a great disaster has occurred. It is the establishment during the lastdecade or so of the MBA as the moral equivalent of the MD or the law degree,meaning a way of insuring a lucrative living by the mere fact of a diploma thatis not a mark of scholarly achievement. It is a general rule that the studentswho have any chance of getting a liberal education are those who do not have afixed career goal, or at least those for whom the university is not merely atraining ground for a profession. Those who do have such a goal go through theuniversity with blinders on, studying what the chosen discipline imposes on themwhile occasionally diverting themselves with an elective course that attractsthem. True liberal education requires that the student’s whole life be radicallychanged by it, that what he learns may affect his action, his tastes, hischoices, that no previous attachment be immune to examination and hencere-evaluation. Liberal education puts everything at risk and requires studentswho are able to risk everything.18 Otherwise it can only touch what isuncommitted in the already essentially committed. The effect of the MBA is tocorral a horde of students who want to get into business school and to put theblinders on them, to legislate an illiberal, officially approved undergraduateprogram for them at the outset, like premeds who usually disappear into theirrequired courses and are never heard from again. Both the goal and the way ofgetting to it are fixed so that nothing can distract them. (Prelaw students aremore visible in a variety of liberal courses because law schools are less fixedin their prerequisites; they are only seeking bright students.) Premed, prelawand prebusiness students are distinctively tourists in the liberal arts. Gettinginto those elite professional schools is an obsessive concern that tethers theirminds.The specific effect of the MBA has been an explosion of enrollments ineconomics, the prebusiness major. In serious universities something like 20percent of the undergraduates are now economics majors. Economics overwhelms therest of the social sciences and skews the students’ perception of them—theirpurpose and their relative weight with regard to the knowledge of human things.A premed who takes much biology does not, by contrast, lose sight of the statusof physics, for the latter’s influence on biology is clear, its position agreedupon, and it is respected by the biologists. None of this is so for theprebusiness economics major, who not only does not take an interest insociology, anthropology or political science but is also persuaded that what heis learning can handle all that belongs to those studies. Moreover, he is notmotivated by love of the science of economics but by love of what it isconcerned with—money. Economists’ concern with wealth, an undeniably real andsolid thing, gives them a certain impressive intellectual solidity not providedby, say, culture. One can be sure that they are not talking about nothing. Butwealth, as opposed to the science of wealth, is not the noblest of motivations,and there is nothing else quite like this perfect coincidence between scienceand cupidity elsewhere in the university. The only parallel would be if therewere a science of sexology, with earnest and truly scholarly professors, whichwould ensure its students lavish sexual satisfactions.The third island of the university is the almost submerged old Atlantis, thehumanities. In it there is no semblance of order, no serious account of whatshould and should not belong, or of what its disciplines are trying toaccomplish or how. It is somehow the repair of man or of humanity, the place togo to find ourselves now that everyone else has given up. But where to look inthis heap or jumble? It is difficult enough for those who already know what tolook for to get any satisfaction here. For students it requires a powerfulinstinct and a lot of luck. The analogies tumble uncontrollably from my pen. Thehumanities are like the great old Paris Flea Market where, amidst masses ofjunk, people with a good eye found castaway treasures that made them rich. Orthey are like a refugee camp where all the geniuses driven out of their jobs andcountries by unfriendly regimes are idling, either unemployed or performingmenial tasks. The other two divisions of the university have no use for thepast, are forward-looking and not inclined toward ancestor worship.The problem of the humanities, and therefore of the unity of knowledge, isperhaps best represented by the fact that if Galileo, Kepler and Newton existanywhere in the university now it is in the humanities, as part of one kind ofhistory or another—history of science, history of ideas, history of culture. Inorder to have a place, they have to be understood as something other than whatthey were—great contemplators of the whole of nature who understood themselvesto be of interest only to the extent that they told the truth about it. If theywere wrong or have been completely surpassed, then they themselves would saythat they are of no interest. To put them in the humanities is the equivalent ofnaming a street after them or setting up a statue in a corner of a park. Theyare effectively dead. Plato, Bacon, Machiavelli and Montesquieu are in the samecondition, except for that little enclave in political science. The humanitiesare the repository for all of the classics now—but much of the classicliterature claimed to be about the order of the whole of nature and man’s placein it, to legislate for that whole and to tell the truth about it. If suchclaims are denied, these writers and their books cannot be read seriously, andtheir neglect elsewhere is justified. They have been saved only on the conditionof being mummified. The humanities’ willingness to receive them has taken themoff the backs of the natural and social sciences, where they constituted achallenge that no longer has to be met. On the portal of the humanities iswritten in many ways and many tongues, “There is no truth—at least here.”The humanities are the specialty that now exclusively possesses the books thatare not specialized, that insist upon asking the questions about the whole thatare excluded from the rest of the university, which is dominated by realspecialties, as resistant to self-examination as they were in Socrates’ day andnow rid of the gadfly. The humanities have not had the vigor to fight it outwith triumphant natural science, and want to act as though it were just aspecialty. But, as I have said over and over again, however much the humanedisciplines would like to forget about their essential conflict with naturalscience as now practiced and understood, they are gradually undermined by it.Whether it is old philosophic texts that raise now inadmissible questions, orold works of literature that presuppose the being of the noble and thebeautiful, materialism, determinism, reductionism, homogenization—however onedescribes modern natural science—deny their importance and their verypossibility. Natural science asserts that it is metaphysically neutral, andhence has no need for philosophy, and that imagination is not a faculty that inany way intuits the real—hence art has nothing to do with truth. The kinds ofquestions children ask: Is there a God? Is there freedom? Is there punishmentfor evil deeds? Is there certain knowledge? What is a good society? were oncealso the questions addressed by science and philosophy. But now the grownups aretoo busy at work, and the children are left in a day-care center called thehumanities, in which the discussions have no echo in the adult world. Moreover,students whose nature draws them to such questions and to the books that appearto investigate them are very quickly rebuffed by the fact that their humanitiesteachers do not want or are unable to use the books to respond to their needs.This problem of the old books is not new. In Swift’s Battle of the Books onefinds Bentley, the premier Greek scholar of the eighteenth century, on the sideof the moderns. He accepted the superiority of modern thought to Greek thought.So why study Greek books? This question remains unanswered in classicsdepartments. There are all sorts of dodges, ranging from pure philologicalanalysis to using these books to show the relation between thought and economicconditions. But practically no one even tries to read them as they were onceread—for the sake of finding out whether they are true. Aristotle’s Ethicsteaches us not what a good man is but what the Greeks thought about morality.But who really cares very much about that? Not any normal person who wants tolead a serious life.All the things I have said about books in our time help to characterize thesituation of the humanities, which are the really exposed part of theuniversity. They have been buffeted more severely by historicism and relativismthan the other parts. They suffer most from democratic society’s lack of respectfor tradition and its emphasis on utility. To the extent that the humanities aresupposed to treat of creativity, professors’ lack of creativity becomes ahandicap. The humanities are embarrassed by the political content of many of theliterary works belonging to them. They have had to alter their contents for thesake of openness to other cultures. And when the old university habits werechanged, they found themselves least able to answer the question “Why?,” leastable to force students to meet standards, or to attract them with any clearaccount of what they would learn. One need only glance at the situation of thenatural sciences in all these respects to see the gravity of the problem facedby the humanities. Natural science is sovereignly indifferent to the fact thatthere were and are other kinds of explanations of natural phenomena in otherages or cultures. The relation between Einstein and Buddha is purely foreducational TV, in programs put together by humanists. Whatever itspractitioners may say, they are sure its explanations are true, or truth. Theydo not have to give reasons “why,” because the answer seems all too evident.The natural sciences are able to assert that they are pursuing the importanttruth, and the humanities are not able to make any such assertion. That isalways the critical point. Without this, no study can remain alive. Vagueinsistence that without the humanities we will no longer be civilized rings veryhollow when no one can say what “civilized” means, when there are said to bemany civilizations that are all equal. The claim of “the classic” loses alllegitimacy when the classic cannot be believed to tell the truth. The truthquestion is most pressing and acutely embarrassing for those who deal with thephilosophic texts, but also creates problems for those treating purely literaryworks. There is an enormous difference between saying, as teachers once did,“You must learn to see the world as Homer or Shakespeare did,” and saying, asteachers now do, “Homer and Shakespeare had some of the same concerns you do andcan enrich your vision of the world.” In the former approach students arechallenged to discover new experiences and reassess old; in the latter, they arefree to use the books in any way they please.I am distinguishing two related but different problems here. The contents of theclassic books have become particularly difficult to defend in modern times, andthe professors who now teach them do not care to defend them, are not interestedin their truth. One can most clearly see the latter in the case of the Bible. Toinclude it in the humanities is already a blasphemy, a denial of its own claims.There it is almost inevitably treated in one of two ways: It is subjected tomodern “scientific” analysis, called the Higher Criticism, where it isdismantled, to show how “sacred” books are put together, and that they are notwhat they claim to be. It is useful as a mosaic in which one finds thefootprints of many dead civilizations. Or else the Bible is used in courses incomparative religion as one expression of the need for the “sacred” and as acontribution to the very modern, very scientific study of the structure of“myths.”(Here one can join up with the anthropologists and really be alive.) Ateacher who treated the Bible naively, taking it at its word, or Word, would beaccused of scientific incompetence and lack of sophistication. Moreover, hemight rock the boat and start the religious wars all over again, as well as aquarrel within the university between reason and revelation, which would upsetcomfortable arrangements and wind up by being humiliating to the humanities.Here one sees the traces of the Enlightenment’s political project, which wantedprecisely to render the Bible, and other old books, undangerous. This project isone of the underlying causes of the impotence of the humanities. The best thatcan be done, it appears, is to teach “The Bible as Literature,” as opposed to“as Revelation,” which it claims to be. In this way it can be read somewhatindependently of deforming scholarly apparatus, as we read, for example, Prideand Prejudice. Thus the few professors who feel that there is something wrongwith the other approaches tend to their consciences.Professors of the humanities have long been desperate to make their subjectsaccord with modernity instead of a challenge to it. One sees this in a puerileform in the footnotes to Paul Shorey’s edition of Plato’s Republic, on which Icut my teeth, where he is eager to show that Plato had already divined this orthat discovery made by some American professor of psychology in 1911, while heremains studiously silent about Plato’s embarrassing disagreements with currentviews. Much study in the humanities is just a more or less sophisticated versionof the same thing. I do not deny that at least some professors love the worksthey study and teach. But there is a furious effort to make them up-to-date,largely by treating them as the matter formed by some contemporarytheory—cultural, historical, economic or psychological. The effort to read booksas their writers intended them to be read has been made into a crime, ever since“the intentional fallacy” was instituted. There are endless debates aboutmethods—among Freudian criticism, Marxist criticism, New Criticism,Structuralism and Deconstructionism, and many others, all of which have incommon the premise that what Plato or Dante had to say about reality isunimportant. These schools of criticism make the writers plants in a gardenplanned by a modern scholar, while their own garden-planning vocation is deniedthem. The writers ought to plant, or even bury, the scholar. Nietzsche said thatafter the ministrations of modern scholarship the Symposium is so far away thatit can no longer seduce us; its immediate charm has utterly vanished. When itcomes down to it, the humanities scholar is not motivated by inner necessity, byany urgency, certainly not one dictated by old books. The scholar who chooses tostudy Sophocles could just as well have chosen Euripides. And why a poet, andnot a philosopher or a historian; or why, after all, a Greek, and not a Turk?There are a few humanities departments in universities that have been able toescape respectably into the sciences, such as archeology and some aspects of thelanguages and linguistics. They have almost entirely broken off relations withthe contents of books. Fine art and music are, of course, in large measureindependent of the meanings of books, although the way of treating them does, atleast to some extent, depend on the prevailing views about what art is and whatis important in it. There is in humanities a great deal of purely scholarly workthat is neutral, useful and intended to be used by those who have something tosay, such as the making of dictionaries and the establishment of texts.The list of departments is dominated by the long catalogue of the variousdepartments of language and literature, usually one for each of the Westernlanguages, and conglomerates for the others. Except for English, they all areresponsible for teaching foreign languages. The teachers have had to learn adifficult language well and must teach it to a population of students who do notreally want to learn languages very much. Now, in addition to the language,there are books written in that language, and the learning of the languageentails reading those books. Hence, having learned the language in effectqualifies the teacher to teach the contents of the books, particularly since thebooks do not now belong anywhere else. However, the teachers’ real knowledge ofand affinity with those books is not ensured by their mastery of the language.The books are the important thing, but the language tail tends to wag theliterature dog. These departments are the primary guardians of the classicliterature and protect their dominion over their works ferociously. Universityconvention submerges nature. It issues licenses, and hunting without one isforbidden. Moreover, because of these conventions the professors also listen toone another more attentively than to outsiders, and are listened to moreattentively than others by outsiders, as doctors are more impressive to laymenin matters of health than are other laymen. A cozy self-satisfaction ofspecialists easily results (until there are rude jolts from the outside, such asoccurred during the sixties). Professors of Greek forget or are unaware thatThomas Aquinas, who did not know Greek, was a better interpreter of Aristotlethan any of them have proved to be, not only because he was smarter but becausehe took Aristotle more seriously.This arrangement of the language and literature departments entails otherstructural difficulties. Do Greek poetry, history and philosophy belongtogether, or again, is not the secondary fact of the Greek language determiningthe articulation of the substance? And is it not possible that the properconnections go beyond Greece altogether, constituting such pairs as Plato andFarabi or Aristotle and Hobbes? Willy-nilly these departments are forced toadopt historical premises. Greek philosophers are of a piece and, more likely,the whole of Greek culture or civilization is a tightly woven tapestry of whichthe Greek scholar, not the philosopher or the poet, is the master. From theoutset this arrangement answers the crucial questions about the relation betweenthe mind and history before they are raised, and does so in a way contrary tothe way Plato or Aristotle would answer them.Most interesting of all, lost amidst this collection of disciplines, modestlysits philosophy. It has been dethroned by political and theoretical democracy,bereft of the passion or the capacity to rule. Its story defines in itself ourwhole problem. Philosophy once proudly proclaimed that it was the best way oflife, and it dared to survey the whole, to seek the first causes of all things,and not only dictated its rules to the special sciences but constituted andordered them. The classic philosophic books are philosophy in action, doingprecisely these things. But this was all impossible, hybris, say theirimpoverished heirs. Real science did not need them, and the rest is ideology ormyth. Now they are just books on a shelf. Democracy took away philosophy’sprivileges, and philosophy could not decide whether to fade away or to take ajob. Philosophy was architectonic, had the plans for the whole building, and thecarpenters, masons and plumbers were its subordinates and had no meaning withoutits plan. Philosophy founded the university, but it could no longer do so. Welive off its legacy. When people speak vaguely about generalists vs.specialists, they must mean by the generalist the philosopher, for he is theonly kind of knower who embraces, or once embraced, all the specialties,possessing a subject matter, necessary to the specialties, which was real—beingor the good—and not just a collection of the matters of the specialties.Philosophy is no longer a way of life, and it is no longer a sovereign science.Its situation in our universities has something to do with the desperatecondition of philosophy in the world today, and something to do with itspeculiar history as a discipline in America. With respect to the former,although reason is gravely threatened, Nietzsche and Heidegger were genuinephilosophers and able to face up to and face down both natural science andhistoricism, the two great contemporary opponents of philosophy. Philosophy isstill possible. And on the Continent even now, schoolchildren are taughtphilosophy, and it seems to be something real. An American high school studentknows only the word “philosophy,” and it does not appear to be any more seriousa life choice than yoga. In America, anyhow, everybody has a philosophy.Philosophy was not ever a very powerful presence in universities, although therewere important exceptions. We began with a public philosophy that sufficed forus, and we thought that it was common sense. In America, Tocqueville said,everyone is a Cartesian although no one has read Descartes. We were almostentirely importers of philosophy, with the exception of Pragmatism. One need nothave read a line of philosophy to be considered educated in this country. It iseasily equated with hot air, much more so than any of the other humanedisciplines. So it always had an uphill fight. Students who did seek it could,however, find some refreshment at its source.But it has succumbed and probably could disappear without being much noticed. Ithas a scientific component, logic, which is attached to the sciences and couldeasily be detached from philosophy. This is serious, practiced by competentspecialists, and responds to none of the permanent philosophic questions.History of philosophy, the compendium of dead philosophies that was always mostlively for the students, has been neglected, and students find it better treatedin a variety of other disciplines. Positivism and ordinary language analysishave long dominated, although they are on the decline and evidently beingreplaced by nothing. These are simply methods of a sort, and they repel studentswho come with the humanizing questions. Professors of these schools simply wouldnot and could not talk about anything important, and they themselves do notrepresent a philosophic life for the students. In some places existentialism andphenomenology have gained a foothold, and they are much more attractive tostudents than positivism or ordinary language analysis. Catholic universitieshave always kept some contact with medieval philosophy, and hence, Aristotle.But, in sum, the philosophy landscape is largely bleak. That is why so much ofthe philosophic instinct in America used to lead toward the new social sciencesand is now veering off toward certain branches of literature and literarycriticism. As it stands, philosophy is just another humanities subject, rathercontentless, without a thought of trying to take command in the crisis of theuniversity. Actually it contains less of the exhilarating presence of thetradition in philosophy than do the other humanities disciplines, and one findsits professors least active of the humanists in attempts to revitalize liberaleducation. Although there was a certain modesty about ordinary languageanalysis—“We just help to give you clarity about what you are alreadydoing”—there was also smugness: “We know what was wrong with the wholetradition, and we don’t need it anymore.” Therefore the tradition disappearedfrom philosophy’s confines.All the language catalogued in Part Two was produced by philosophy and was inEurope known to have been produced by philosophy, so that it paved a road tophilosophy. In America its antecedents remain unknown. We took over the resultswithout having had any of the intellectual experiences leading to them. But theignorance of the origins and the fact that American philosophy departments donot lay claim to them—are in fact just as ignorant of them as is the generalpublic—means that the philosophic content of our language and lives does notdirect us to philosophy. This is a real difference between the Continent and us.Here the philosophic language is nothing but jargon.The evident weakness of the division of literature on the basis of the languagein which it was written led, a half-century ago, to the sensible project oftrying to reunite it. Thus comparative literature was founded. But as is thecase with all such undertakings in our times, there was considerable perplexityabout what the new discipline was trying to do, and it tended to generatesystems of comparison that dominated the literary works, tributes to theingenuity of their founders rather than openings through which the works couldreveal themselves freed from arbitrary constraints. Comparative literature hasnow fallen largely into the hands of a group of professors who are influenced bythe post-Sartrean generation of Parisian Heideggerians, in particular Derrida,Foucault and Barthes. The school is called Deconstructionism, and it is thelast, predictable, stage in the suppression of reason and the denial of thepossibility of truth in the name of philosophy. The interpreter’s creativeactivity is more important than the text; there is no text, only interpretation.Thus the one thing most necessary for us, the knowledge of what these texts haveto tell us, is turned over to the subjective, creative selves of theseinterpreters, who say that there is both no text and no reality to which thetexts refer. A cheapened interpretation of Nietzsche liberates us from theobjective imperatives of the texts that might have liberated us from ourincreasingly low and narrow horizon. Everything has tended to soften the demandsmade on us by the tradition; this simply dissolves it.This fad will pass, as it has already in Paris. But it appeals to our worstinstincts and shows where our temptations lie. It is the literary complement tothe “life-styles” science I discussed in Part Two. Fancy German philosophic talkfascinates us and takes the place of the really serious things. This will not bethe last attempt of its kind coming from the dispossessed humanities in theirsearch for an imaginary empire, one that flatters popular democratic tastes.CONCLUSIONThese are the shadows cast by the peaks of the university over the enteringundergraduate. Together they represent what the university has to say about manand his education, and they do not project a coherent image. The differences andthe indifferences are too great. It is difficult to imagine that there is eitherthe wherewithal or the energy within the university to constitute orreconstitute the idea of an educated human being and establish a liberaleducation again.However, the contemplation of this scene is in itself a proper philosophicactivity. The university’s evident lack of wholeness in an enterprise thatclearly demands it cannot help troubling some of its members. The questions areall there. They only need to be addressed continuously and seriously for liberallearning to exist; for it does not consist so much in answers as in thepermanent dialogue. It is in such perplexed professors that at least the ideamight persevere and help to guide some of the needy young persons at ourdoorstep. The matter is still present in the university; it is the form that hasvanished. One cannot and should not hope for a general reform. The hope is thatthe embers do not die out.Men may live more truly and fully in reading Plato and Shakespeare than at anyother time, because then they are participating in essential being and areforgetting their accidental lives. The fact that this kind of humanity exists orexisted, and that we can somehow still touch it with the tips of ouroutstretched fingers, makes our imperfect humanity, which we can no longer bear,tolerable. The books in their objective beauty are still there, and we must helpprotect and cultivate the delicate tendrils reaching out toward them through theunfriendly soil of students’ souls. Human nature, it seems, remains the same inour very altered circumstances because we still face the same problems, if indifferent guises, and have the distinctively human need to solve them, eventhough our awareness and forces have become enfeebled.After a reading of the Symposium a serious student came with deep melancholy andsaid it was impossible to imagine that magic Athenian atmosphere reproduced, inwhich friendly men, educated, lively, on a footing of equality, civilized butnatural, came together and told wonderful stories about the meaning of theirlonging. But such experiences are always accessible. Actually, this playfuldiscussion took place in the midst of a terrible war that Athens was destined tolose, and Aristophanes and Socrates at least could foresee that this meant thedecline of Greek civilization. But they were not given to culture despair, andin these terrible political circumstances, their abandon to the joy of natureproved the viability of what is best in man, independent of accidents, ofcircumstance. We feel ourselves too dependent on history and culture. Thisstudent did not have Socrates, but he had Plato’s book about him, which mighteven be better; he had brains, friends and a country happily free enough to letthem gather and speak as they will. What is essential about that dialogue, orany of the Platonic dialogues, is reproducible in almost all times and places.He and his friends can think together. It requires much thought to learn thatthis thinking might be what it is all for. That’s where we are beginning tofail. But it is right under our noses, improbable but always present.Throughout this book I have referred to Plato’s Republic, which is for me thebook on education, because it really explains to me what I experience as a manand a teacher, and I have almost always used it to point out what we should nothope for, as a teaching of moderation and resignation. But all itsimpossibilities act as a filter to leave the residue of the highest andnon-illusory possibility. The real community of man, in the midst of all theself-contradictory simulacra of community, is the community of those who seekthe truth, of the potential knowers, that is, in principle, of all men to theextent they desire to know. But in fact this includes only a few, the truefriends, as Plato was to Aristotle at the very moment they were disagreeingabout the nature of the good. Their common concern for the good linked them;their disagreement about it proved they needed one another to understand it.They were absolutely one soul as they looked at the problem. This, according toPlato, is the only real friendship, the only real common good. It is here thatthe contact people so desperately seek is to be found. The other kinds ofrelatedness are only imperfect reflections of this one trying to beself-subsisting, gaining their only justification from their ultimate relationto this one. This is the meaning of the riddle of the improbablephilosopher-kings. They have a true community that is exemplary for all othercommunities.This is a radical teaching but perhaps one appropriate to our own radical time,in which proximate attachments have become so questionable and we know of noothers. This age is not utterly insalubrious for philosophy. Our problems are sogreat and their sources so deep that to understand them we need philosophy morethan ever, if we do not despair of it, and it faces the challenges on which itflourishes. I still believe that universities, rightly understood, are wherecommunity and friendship can exist in our times. Our thought and our politicshave become inextricably bound up with the universities, and they have served uswell, human things being what they are. But for all that, and even though theydeserve our strenuous efforts, one should never forget that Socrates was not aprofessor, that he was put to death, and that the love of wisdom survived,partly because of his individual example. This is what really counts, and wemust remember it in order to know how to defend the university.This is the American moment in world history, the one for which we shall foreverbe judged. Just as in politics the responsibility for the fate of freedom in theworld has devolved upon our regime, so the fate of philosophy in the world hasdevolved upon our universities, and the two are related as they have never beenbefore. The gravity of our given task is great, and it is very much in doubt howthe future will judge our stewardship.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------13 [023.html#f13p3ch3s3_13] Natural science simply does not care. There is nohostility (unless it is attacked) to anything that is going on elsewhere. It isreally self-sufficient, or almost so. If some other discipline proved itself,satisfied natural science’s standards of rigor and proof, it would beautomatically admitted. Natural science does not boast, is not snobbish. It isgenuine. As Swift pointed out, its only habitual and apparently necessary sortiefrom its own proper domain is into politics. This is where it itself, if only inconfused fashion, recognizes that it is a part of a larger project, and that itis dependent on that project, which is not a product of its methods. Lowly,despised politics points toward the need for philosophy, as Socrates originallysaid, in such a way that even scientists have to admit it. Natural scientistshave no respect for political science as a science, but they have a passionateconcern for politics. This is a beginning point for rethinking everything. Isthe danger of nuclear war or the imprisonment of Sakharov just an accident?14 [023.html#f14p3ch3s3_14] Psychology is mysteriously disappearing from thesocial sciences. Its unheard-of success in the real world may have tempted it togive up the theoretical life. As the psychotherapist has taken his placealongside the family doctor, perhaps his education now belongs to something moreakin to the medical school than to the sciences, and the research relevant forhim is more directed to treatment of specific problems of patients than to thefounding of a theory of the psyche. The Freudian theories have been incorporatedinto some aspects of sociology, political science and anthropology, and itappears that the self alone had nothing more to tell the social sciences. Thisleaves open the question of what the solid ground is on which therapy stands,and where its newer ideas come from. Serious academic psychology is left withthe segment that has to all intents and purposes fused with physiology.15 [023.html#f15p3ch3s3_15] Undeveloped, bad; developing, better; developed,good—for man and for the science of economics.16 [023.html#f16p3ch3s3_16] I am tempted to say that psychology teaches that sexis the primary phenomenon. It is closer to economics when understood asstimulus-response, closer to anthropology when understood as a hang-up. If onewants something more from psychology, one meets a road sign saying “To theHumanities.”17 [023.html#f17p3ch3s3_17] History, sharing Greek origins with politicalscience, also has elements of the ancients-moderns identity crisis, in additionto the other problems of the strictly modern social sciences. As alreadymentioned, both participants and observers are unsure whether it is a socialscience or one of the humanities. Its matter is resistant to the techniques ofthe behavioral sciences, since it is particular, and therefore not easilygeneralizable, deals with the past, and is therefore beyond controlledexperiments; but it does not want to be merely literature. I believe that noneof the other social sciences includes history as part of the social scienceschema, with the exception of that part of political science which is concernedwith political practice as opposed to social science, e.g., some aspects ofAmerican politics and of international relations. History until the nineteenthcentury meant primarily political history; and it, unlike political science, wasnot refounded in early modernity. Its traditional role was enhanced during thenew foundings because it told what happened, as opposed to old politicalscience, which told what ought to have happened. Therefore history wasunderstood to be closer to the truth of things. History had to wait until thenineteenth century for its modernization by historicism, which argued, as itwere, that being, certainly man’s being, is essentially historical. Historicismappears to have been a great boon for history, a radical step upward in status.But the appearance is somewhat deceptive. Historicism is a philosophical, not ahistorical, teaching, one not discovered by history. Rather than the prestige ofphilosophy adhering to history, the reverse occurred. All humanities disciplinesare now historical—not philosophy, but history of philosophy, not art, buthistory of art, not science, but history of science, not literature, but historyof literature. Thus history is all of these, but also none of them, because theyare discrete disciplines in the humanities. History became the empty, universalcategory encompassing all the humanities, except insofar as it remained itsmodest, narrow political self. But because it does not have an anchor inpolitical passion as does political science, it could float easily away fromthat dock under the influence of the prevailing winds, as politics wasdepreciated by so many other things, especially historicism. So, history, awonderful, useful study, full of most learned individuals, is as a whole amedley of methods and goals, six disciplines in search of a self-definition.18 [023.html#f18p3ch3s3_18] It is to be noted that many students who come to theuniversity intending to go into natural science change their intention while incollege. It never, or almost never, happens that a student who was notinterested in natural science before college discovers it there. This is aninteresting reflection on the character of our high school education in generaland science education in particular."},{"pageContent":"AFTERWORDAndrew FergusonHe had gone public with his ideas. He had written a book—difficult but popular—aspirited, intelligent, warlike book, and it had sold and was still selling inboth hemispheres and on both sides of the equator. The thing had been donequickly but in real earnest: no cheap concessions, no popularizing, no mentalmonkey business, no apologetics, no patrician airs. . . . His intellect had madea millionaire of him. It’s no small matter to become rich and famous by sayingexactly what you think—to say it in your own words, without compromise.—Ravelstein, by Saul Bellow, 1996Bellow’s Ravelstein is a thinly fictionalized Allan Bloom, caught at the peak oflife and rendered, so I’m told by Bloom’s friends and students, with uncannyprecision and ingenuity. We first see him dressed in a blue-and-white kimono,sashaying around the penthouse he’s rented at the Hotel Crillon in the heart ofParis. His lover, a young man from Singapore named Nikki, lies asleep in bed.Bellow wants to impress upon the reader his subject’s physicality. AbeRavelstein’s frame is long and angled and ungainly, but it’s usually adorned in$5,000 suits. When he eats, you sense the pleasure with which he undertakes thetask: “he was stoking his system,” Bellow says, “and nourishing his ideas”; atdinner parties, hostesses are advised to place newspapers under his chair togather the debris from his enthusiastic feeding. His baldness is “geological.”He smokes constantly, twin spouts of tobacco smoke flowing dragonlike from hisnostrils. Bellow stresses the physicality at the beginning of the novel becauseit lends poignancy to the wasting at the end, when Ravelstein endures a tortureddeath from AIDS, as did Bloom. He was carried off in 1992, only four yearsbefore Bellow immortalized him as Ravelstein and five after he published thebook you hold in your hands.Among much else, Bellow dramatizes the suddenness and unexpectedness of thewealth and fame that rained down on Bloom in the late 1980s. The course thatBloom’s classic took on its way to boffo box office is singular even among theendless eruptions and craterings of the American book business. The proposal forthe book was bought by one editor and midwived into print by another, with nomore than modest expectations. The original title, Souls Without Longing, waslovely but uncommercial, so it was changed. The first print run, in February of1987, was ten thousand copies. By spring it was selling twenty-five thousandcopies a week. It hit the bestseller list in April, reached number one bysummertime, and stayed there for two and a half months. It became beach reading!From the top of the list it beat back waves of challengers, including multiplecelebrity memoirs, self-help books, and a particularly gloomy book-lengthwarning about the “coming depression of the nineties.” In March of the followingyear, The Closing of the American Mind was still a bestseller. By then nearly amillion copies had been sold in the United States. Foreign sales were just asprodigious. The best minds in American publishing were boggled. Never in theirexperience had a book about Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Friedrich Nietzsche, andMartin Heidegger outsold books by Patty Duke, Shirley MacLaine, and SamDonaldson.Various attempts were made at the time to account for the runaway success. Thenearest cause was a handful of spectacular early reviews. The book “hits withthe approximate force and effect of what electric-shock therapy must be like,”wrote the daily reviewer in the New York Times, rather awkwardly. “It commandsone’s attention and concentrates one’s mind more effectively than any other bookI can think of in the past five years.” (Cut, print, and blurb.) The Times’sSunday reviewer, a college president, was similarly overwhelmed, calling thebook “rich and absorbing.” Ditto the Washington Post’s reviewer, likewise fromthe Chronicle of Higher Education, and still more from Time and Newsweek.But good reviews, even ecstatic reviews, aren’t sufficient to sell a book, asany number of highly praised authors you’ve never heard of would be happy totell you. Something else was happening here, but we didn’t know what it was.James Atlas, in the New York Times Magazine, conjectured that the book acted asa kind of adult continuing education class: “It appeals to the student in usall.” Bloom’s editor at Simon & Schuster said the book tapped a large reservoirof underserved book buyers eager for intelligent discussion of profound issues.Louis Menand, a literature professor at Princeton and CUNY, was rather moresardonic in the New Republic: “It gratifies our wish to think ill of our culture(a wish that is a permanent feature of modernity) without thinking ill ofourselves.”Menand’s review was part of a second surge of notices, far more critical thanthe first. It was the Revenge of the Eggheads, and when at last it came youcouldn’t help but wonder what took them so long. The Wall Street Journal’srapturous review arrived late enough to note how odd the early praise had been,sociologically and politically, coming as it did from the “culturalestablishment” that had been squarely in Bloom’s crosshairs: “Many of thereviewers who have praised Mr. Bloom’s book have not faced up to theconsequences of Mr. Bloom’s ideas.” The college president in the Sunday Timeswas singled out as an especially unlikely booster. His rave review for the book“shows no indication that the institution over which he presides standsfundamentally indicted by it.” And not only this or that institution: Bloom wasaccusing an entire generation of humanities professors of academic dereliction.They took the book as a personal affront and reacted accordingly. “Bad reviewsare one thing,” James Atlas wrote. “The responses to Bloom’s book have beencharged with a hostility that transcends the usual mean-spiritedness ofreviewers.” Tactics differed. There were attacks on Bloom’s scholarship, hisphilosophical skill, and the empirical support for his broader claims. Therewere also sarcasm, invective, caricature, shaming, and, inevitably then as now,accusations of elitism, racism, sexism, and homophobia. Perhaps the mostcelebrated rebuttal to Closing, considered by many of Bloom’s critics to bedefinitive, was one of the calmest and most measured. Written by the Harvardclassicist Martha Nussbaum, it was a lengthy piece even by the standards of themagazine in which it appeared, the New York Review of Books. Her disputes withBloom over the the ancient texts were too obscure for a layman to adjudicate,but to my mind her characterization of his general argument wasn’t quiteaccurate and in places discredited itself. She tells us, for example, that inClosing “Bloom presents himself to us as a profoundly religious man.” You couldhave fooled me. His preeminent teacher, the philosopher Leo Strauss, liked tomake the distinction between Athens and Jerusalem—a life of philosophy versus alife of faith. After a few approving nods toward the Bible, The Closing of theAmerican Mind shows Bloom to have been an Athens man all the way (not to mentiona Jew, a homosexual, and a Hoosier. Truly, they broke the mold . . .).The most subtle of Nussbaum’s arguments poked at a contradiction lyinghalf-buried in the book. Bloom opens with a patriotic celebration of America’sfoundation in natural rights, the guarantee of equality; by the end of the bookhe seems to argue that the only way to save America from its present course isfor universities to recommit to promoting the philosophical life, a lifeaccessible, he frankly acknowledges, only to a chosen few. The contradiction, ifthat’s what it is, doesn’t cripple his other arguments, but Nussbaum and theother second-wave academics thought it exposed an elitist, antidemocratic agendathat could easily darken into something much spookier—autocracy or worse, a new(or very old) kind of authoritarian rule.One observer estimated that more than two hundred reviews of Closing wereeventually published, and scores of these, in obscure quarterlies and highbrowopinion magazines alike, elaborated the theme of Bloom as authoritarian menace.In Harpers, the political scientist Benjamin Barber called the book “a mostenticing, a most subtle, a most learned, a most dangerous tract.” Americans weretoo susceptible to a “Philosopher Despot” like Bloom, Barber wrote. “Anxiousabout the loss of fixed points, wishing for simpler, more orderly times,” theyfound in his work “a new Book of Truth for an era after God.” This was a commonassertion but a weak one, even on its own terms. In accusing Bloom ofauthoritarian tendencies, Barber and the others exposed their own horror at thecommon folk and made you wonder about their own faith in democracy. Who knewAmericans were so easily duped? Toss them a few quotes from Herodotus and bitchabout their college kids and they’ll think you’ve given them the Book of Truth.Even Franco had to work harder than that! Maybe this whole idea of “governmentby the people” needs to be rethought . . .In time the academic establishment’s horror of Bloom grew too vast for merepaper and ink to contain. Conferences were held to declare him anathema. At oneof these, in Manhattan, the associate headmaster of the Dalton School called thebook “Hitleresque.” Richard Bernstein, then a reporter for the Times, chronicleda gathering sponsored by Duke and the University of North Carolina, where Bloom,though not in attendance, was “derided, scorned and laughed at” by a large groupof humanities professors. “In some respects,” Bernstein wrote, “the scene inNorth Carolina last weekend recalled the daily ‘minute of hatred’ in GeorgeOrwell’s 1984, when citizens are required to rise and hurl invective at picturesof a man known only as Goldstein, the Great Enemy of the state.”It’s worth noting that Duke’s conference was held nearly a year and a half afterBloom’s book was published. Some hatreds need more than a minute to burnthemselves out. And among the establishment—deans and department chairs, thegrim-faced apparatchiks at the American Council on Education and the AmericanAssociation of University Professors—Bloom remained a pariah for the rest ofwhat was left of his life. But he was a jaunty and cheerful pariah, as Bellowshows, for there were compensations: appearing endlessly on TV, acceptinginvitations to Chequers from Mrs. Thatcher and to the White House from PresidentReagan, and laughing in his kimono all the way to la banque.I wonder whether all this fuss will seem bizarre to new and younger readers ofThe Closing of the American Mind. It’s useful to recall the world Bloom and hisbook broke into and riled so. In material ways, the United States of America of1987 seems as remote as Republican Rome. Our national wealth has more thantripled in the last twenty-five years. The digital revolution, with its upendingof the habits and patterns of everyday life, was just getting underway. Musiclovers delighted in the portability and convenience of their brick-sizedWalkmans, never imagining the tiny wonders they would be slipping into theirshirtpockets a decade hence. Cars, on the other hand, seem to have been roughlyhalf their present size. You couldn’t carry around a telephone unless you yankedit off the wall. Nintendo was as sophisticated as gaming systems came. Andnobody used the word “gaming system.”Culturally, the country fretted. Culturally, of course, all countries, or somesegments of them, are always fretting, and have been doing so since Cicerogrieved over O tempora, O mores, up to and beyond Yeats’s insistence that thecenter cannot hold. But by the end of the 1980s in the United States, there werenumbers to underscore the worry. In the previous thirty years, violent crime hadincreased 500 percent, the divorce rate had doubled, the teen suicide rate hadtripled, and the number of “illegitimate births” (this was the last era when youcould use the term) had increased 400 percent.Beyond the numbers, the worriers readily found signs of the culture’sdegradation, if not its imminent collapse. On TV, Geraldo Rivera, JerrySpringer, and Sally Jesse Raphael had introduced a new kind of freak show thatproved enormously popular, banishing modesty and discretion and makingexhibitionism a virtue, qualifying adulterers and wifebeaters and cross dressersto strut their hour upon the stage set. (Eerie fact: exactly nine months afterClosing’s publication date, Snooki Polizzi was born.) Popular fiction chronicleda generation of pampered youth lost to anomie and cocaine. As the Iran-Contrascandal shook the executive branch, pundits discovered among the people a lossof faith in their institutions. A devastating crash on Wall Street was creditedto greed unchecked by law or moral obligation.And as if all that weren’t sufficient cause for alarm, one final word: Madonna.The skittish American public in 1987 was well-prepped soil for a message likeBloom’s. It helped that his subject, colleges and universities, shared in thegeneral unease and were in fact one cause of it. Test scores at all levels ofschooling, but particularly college entrance exams, had been falling since thelate 1960s. Two generations earlier the GI Bill had begun to democratize highereducation by making it available to cohorts that in earlier times would havenever thought it necessary for a fulfilling life. To accommodate the swells ofnew students, and to absorb the subsidies that followed them, schools vastlyexpanded their housing stock, increased the number of classrooms, and,crucially, widened the range of their fields of study.The purpose of a four-year liberal arts program—defended by Bloom as anexploration of the big questions that life presents to the fully conscious humanbeing—became confused. What was the point of a bachelor of arts degree? Was itto plumb the depths and origins of Western civilization, which had after allinvented the university, and to develop the student spiritually and morally? Orwas the point to set the kid up to get a cushy job? Humanists in ouruniversities lost confidence in the traditional answer. And their departments,the seat of liberal arts, suffered in the confusion, losing students to thesocial sciences and programs devoted to professional training, such as pre-lawor business. The humanities responded by either aping the professionalcurriculum or shrinking still further into the theory and abstraction that Bloomdevastatingly describes. Core courses were dropped. Teachers of literature orphilosophy had difficulty describing what they did for a living, or why.By the time Bloom’s book was released the crisis in the humanities wasacknowledged by everyone except the people who worked in the humanities. Parentsin particular began to wonder why their college-age children were taking classescalled “Hip-Hop Eshu: Queen Bitch 101” (at Syracuse University) or coming homeafter four years with degrees in “Peace Studies” that cost $100,000. Phrasesthat were used without irony by many profs in the humanities—“politicallycorrect” (good) and “Dead White Males” (bad)—were captured by their critics andturned into shorthand for the leftwing orthodoxy that filled the vacuum in theliberal arts.The crisis was made political fodder. The Reagan administration took a specialinterest and an especially acerbic tone. Lynne Cheney, chairman of the NationalEndowment for the Humanities, and the Secretary of Education, William Bennett,led the dyspeptic chorus. Both held doctorates in the humanities, which enhancedtheir influence with the higher-ed establishment not at all. When Cheney echoedBloom in a widely publicized report—criticizing efforts by humanitiesdepartments to make themselves “relevant” by treating “great books as littlemore than the political rationalizations of dominant groups”—she earned manymultiple minutes of hate all on her own.With the publication of Closing, Bloom was placed alongside Bellow, Bennett, andlater the jurist and Jeremiah, Robert Bork, in a convenient journalisticcategory: the Doom and Gloomers, or the Killer B’s, or the Grumpy Old Men.(Cheney, alphabetically disqualified to serve with the Killer B’s, wasnevertheless an honorary Grump.) But this grouping wasn’t fair to Bloom, notentirely—and it wasn’t fair to the arguments developed in the book, which had asubtlety and depth that journalism and partisan politics can seldom capture.Bloom was never a movement conservative. In electoral politics he was amoderately liberal Democrat, and more liberal still in personal and socialmatters. Unlike Bennett or Cheney, who considered themselves champions ofordinary American bourgeois life, Bloom viewed it with a disdain that runs justbelow the book’s surface. He was no fan of the free market or the ceaselessgetting and striving that it encourages. He worried that the life that awaitedstudents after college would be just as enervating as their dismal andpurposeless education. And he wasn’t above invoking a brand-name cliché to drivethe point home. In their “Brooks Brothers suits,” he writes, “they will want toget ahead and live comfortably. But this life is as empty and false as the onethey left behind.” Elsewhere he speaks of the “intellectual deserts” ofmiddle-class living and “the dreary professional training that awaits [liberalarts students] after the baccalaureate.”There is no element of moral uplift in his brief against modern life. Discussingthe collapse of the traditional family, which has only accelerated since histime, he writes: “I am not arguing here that the old family arrangements weregood or that we should or could go back to them.” Bloom’s discussion of rockmusic (see pages 68–81 if you’ve forgotten, though how could you?) was alwaysadduced as Exhibit A in the charge of fuddy-duddyism—to most people under theage of thirty-five, his complaints sounded no more informed or intelligent thanthe bellowing of the old crank next door: “Turn it down!” But his case againstrock was entirely his own; he worried that it deadened the passion required forreal education. “My concern here,” he wrote, “is not the moral effects of thismusic—whether it leads to sex, violence, or drugs.” This placed Allan Bloom tothe left of Tipper Gore, at the time an energetic crusader against thedepredations of Mötley Crüe and Def Leppard.In the last quarter-century, the reader will notice, Bloom’s book has grown afew whiskers. Anachronisms are unavoidable. He wrote before the population ofmodernity’s Holy Trinity—Marx, Freud, and Darwin—reduced by two-thirds. Marxlost his allure, at least nominally, after the collapse of the murderous regimesthat claimed to have been built from his ideas. Freud was demoted from scientistto cultural observer, and an unreliable one besides. Some of Bloom’s language isoutdated: no professor today could use the word “Oriental” for “Asian” and longsurvive. He objects to squishy nonce words, but the examples heuses—“commitment,” “values,” “life-style”—are now so deeply embedded in everydayspeech that no amount of ridicule will dislodge them. He’s lucky he didn’t liveto see the infinitely elastic use of the now-meaningless word “issues.” I wastouched by his quaint mention of “Mack the Knife” as an example of Americanlife’s homogenizing effects: mass marketed by Louis Armstrong (I assume hecouldn’t bring himself to mention Bobby Darin), Brecht’s leftist agitprop“becomes less dangerous, though no less corrupt.” What would Bloom have made ofthe taming of the Village People’s “YMCA”—a tribute to the joys of shower-roomsodomy transformed into a surefire crowd-pleaser at middle-school pep rallies?The controversy over “affirmative action,” which he treats at length, wassettled by the subtler logic of “diversity.” And the book gives little notice tothe arrival on campus of gay rights, easily the most consequential socialmovement of the last three decades.But I’m surprised by how few the anachronisms are. Most of Bloom’s criticismsstill apply. I can think of lots of reasons why The Closing of the American Minddeserves as many readers as it earned in the eighties—Bloom’s sly wit and thetorrential energy of his prose are worth the price of admission, in myopinion—but one carries a special urgency. The trends he tagged in highereducation in 1987 have only intensified: toward weaker academic requirements forstudents, greater specialization in the departments, a rigid orthodoxy in theuniversity’s politics and cultural life. The university we face today is stillthe one he described, only more so.At a minimum, what Bloom demands of us in response is awareness—thoughtfulness.He hated unthinking conformity above all. The contemporary university appalledhim because it had conformed to the frivolous culture that surrounds it and fromwhich it was meant to stand apart. The cheap relativism it absorbed ledinevitably to the undoing of the liberal arts. The humanities retreated from thetraditional ways of teaching and learning when humanists stopped believing theeffort could reveal any truths about the perplexities of life. In liberaleducation, relativism is a universal corrosive.1 No discipline can survive it.If there’s no truth, finally, why study the work of dead people who were deludedenough to think there was? And without the pursuit of what’s finally true,higher education becomes post-secondary professional training—that’s if we’relucky; a four-year booze cruise if we’re not.If I had reread The Closing of the American Mind ten years ago, when my ownchildren were themselves under ten, I confess I would have thought Bloom’sportrait of educational decline was overwrought. But then they grew up and wentoff to school.Recall the passage on page 337. A freshman arrives on campus. “He finds ademocracy of disciplines,” Bloom wrote. “This democracy is really an anarchybecause there are no recognized rules and no legitimate titles to rule. Inshort, there is no vision, nor is there a set of competing visions, of what aneducated human being is.” In the end the freshman will likely give up on aliberal education, opting for a major that will get him hired when he graduatesand “picking up in elective courses a little of whatever is thought to make onecultured.”This observation from twenty-five years ago describes what a freshman encountersat a moderately selective university today, and with modest adjustments, even atsmaller colleges that say they specialize in the liberal arts. It is what my ownfamily found. Poring over the catalog of courses in the weeks before my sonenrolled at our big state university (which I have come to think of, for reasonssoon to become clear, as BSU), we discovered that no survey classes wereavailable to him in American history, English literature, the history ofscience, ancient or modern philosophy. His “general education” requirementscould be satisfied by a scattering of electives, none related to any other. Hewas required to enroll in a writing class, which was good. The writing classesoffered were “Mad Men and American Society,” “A History of the Sixties,” and“Intro to Queer Theory.” Which was not.Last year, the Association of College Trustees and Alumni surveyed the catalogsof more than one thousand colleges and universities. Fewer than 20 percent ofthe schools required courses in American government, only a third required aliterature survey class, and 15 percent required anything more than a beginner’slevel class in a foreign language. The “core curriculum,” as at BSU, is largelya sham: a math class may be offered, a science class may be offered, but seldomare both required, and often the content of each has only a glancing relation tothe study of math or science. The results have been predictable. The authors ofAcademically Adrift—the most devastating book about higher education sinceClosing—found that nearly half of undergraduates show no measurable improvementin learning or “critical thinking” after two years of college.Perhaps the most famous image in Closing—certainly the least appetizing—is acartoonish word picture of an MTV-watching, Walkman-wearing thirteen-year-oldboy, the flower of American civilization, the human culmination of centuries oflearning and sacrifice, nonetheless brought low by a degraded popular culture:“a pubescent child whose body throbs with orgasmic rhythms; whose feelings aremade articulate in hymns to the joys of onanism or the killing of parents,” andso on and so on, whose “life is made into a nonstop, commercially prepackagedmasturbation fantasy.”I thought of that boy of thirteen when I finished rereading The Closing of theAmerican Mind not long ago. He is now thirty-eight. His parents, I hope,survived his childhood unscathed; I won’t speculate about the onanism. He likelyhas children of his own by now. And I hope by the time his own daughter is readyfor college, he and all the youngsters he was meant to symbolize will haveforgiven the author of this scandalous but all too realistic caricature. Andwhen he disgorges tens of thousands of dollars to send his daughter to a schoolthat has itself become a caricature of higher education, I am consoled to thinkthat he will be able to consult Allan Bloom as to how such a thing could come topass, thanks to a new edition of his maddening, haunting, towering book.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 I’m aware that defenders of relativism defend it by denying it exists: no one,they say, truly believes that one idea is ultimately as good as any other. Andof course they’re right that none of us act in our own lives as though webelieved this. But most of us profess it nonetheless. In a genial but harrowingreview of Closing, a teacher named Michael Zuckert told how he canvassed thestudents in his American Political Thought class at Carleton College. He askedwhether they agreed that the truths in the first lines of the Declaration ofIndependence were indeed “self-evident.” Seven percent voted “yes.” On furtherconversation, he wrote, it turned out “that they were convinced there is no suchthing as ‘truth,’ self-evident or otherwise, in the sphere of claims of the sortraised in the Declaration.” He would have gotten much the same response in aclassroom today."},{"pageContent":"INDEX OFPROPER NAMESAchilles, 66 [008.html#page_66], 274 [021.html#page_274], 280[021.html#page_280], 281 [021.html#page_281], 285 [021.html#page_285]Adams, Henry,
