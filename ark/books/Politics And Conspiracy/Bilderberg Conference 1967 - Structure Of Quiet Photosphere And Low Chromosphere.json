The organizers of the conference hoped that even if this latter goal appeared too far to be reached, such a meeting would still be useful, if only for enumerating the crucial problems in solar photospheric research, and for defining future subjects of research. About twenty solar physicists from outside the Netherlands participated in the Study Week, while some others, though prevented from actively attending, sub- mitted their comments before the meeting. The two above-mentioned goals were reached: a working model could be estab- lished; yet it became clear that not everyone would agree about this model, and it became obvious too that future research is strongly needed, in particular in the field of line formation (coherence, or non-coherence; local thermal equilibrium), while also the motion field of the photosphere and chromosphere is insufficiently known, and its influence on the formation of spectral lines hardly understood. After the Study Week the preliminary results were circulated and provisionally presented in a meeting of Commission 12 of the International Astronomical Union in Prague.

GINGERICH Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Cambridge, Mass., U.S.A. and C.DEJAGER University Observatory 'Sonnenborgh' and Space Research Laboratory, Utrecht (Received 25 September, 1967) Abstract. From 17 through 21 April 1967, an international study week was held in the 'Bilderberg' near Arnhem, Netherlands, with the aim of obtaining an internationally acceptable model of the solar photosphere and low chromosphere. It was found that such a model, based on observed intensities and center-to-limb observations of the solar continuous spectrum, could indeed be es- tablished. This model, henceforth called the Bilderberg Continuum Atmosphere (BCA), is shown in Table I, which gives the temperature, gas and electron pressures, and other data as functions of the continuous optical depth at 5000 A between 't'5ooo = 10- 7 and 25. The model is characterized by a flat temperature minimum of 4600 0 K between 't'5000\"\" 10- 2 to 10- 4 • The model is homogeneous, and in hydrostatic equilibrium. A hydrogen-helium ratio of 10 has been assumed. Much divergence remains in the interpretation of line-profile observations with regard to the establishment of a photospheric model (Section 4). It proved to be as yet impossible to obtain reliable information on the variation with depth of the following functions: temperature fluctuations, turbulence velocities, convective velocities, and vibrational velocity amplitudes (Section 5). Pro- visionally, it is assumed that Vmaero = 2 km/sec and Vmicro = 1 km/sec, isotropic and independent of depth. 1. Introduction In the course of the last twenty years, many models of the solar photosphere have been constructed. These have been used with more or less success in predicting certain aspects of the solar spectrum or for interpreting observations. Gradually it became obvious that a generally acceptable model of the solar photosphere and low chromo- sphere that could be used as a reference model by all the workers in the field might be useful. It was with a view to this need that the so-called Utrecht Reference Model of the Photosphere and Low Chromosphere (URP; HEINTZE, HUBENET, and DE JAGER, 1964) was established. It fulfilled this requirement in the sense that it has been used by several solar physicists for the intercomparison of results of their computations based on their own photospheric model with the URP model; this proved to be valuable. However, after three years of service, it became obvious that the URP model needed revision in several respects. To arrive at a model acceptable for many solar photospheric workers, and in particular to take account of the heterogeneous mass of observations of various kinds and their implications for our knowledge of solar structure, a study week was convened for the construction of a new and possibly"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"6 O. GINGERICH AND C. DE JAGER internationally acceptable model of the photosphere and low chromosphere. This study week was organized by the Utrecht Observatory and held at the Hotel 'De Bilderberg' near Arnhem, Netherlands, from 17 through 21 April 1967. 2. Program of the Meeting The general schedule of the meeting was as follows: In a period of about five months before the meeting, many participants formulated their opinions about the solar model. These contributions, in the form of some 30 preprints, were distributed prior to the meeting. In the first two days of the conference, the participants discussed their preprints for 10 to 15 minutes, and general discussions followed. On the third day, the results of the previous sessions were reviewed and a first attempt was made to synthesize the various contributions into a model of the photosphere. On the fourth day, some general problems of methodology were discussed; in the afternoon, three working groups were convened to discuss: (a) the establishment of a photospheric model based on continuum measurements; (b) the establishment of a photospheric model based on observations of line profiles and equivalent widths; (c) the variation with optical depth of the following functions: temperature fluctuations, turbulent velocities, convective velocities, and vibrational velocities. On the fifth day, the three chairmen of these groups reported, and a model of the photosphere was established. This model appeared essentially to be based on the continuum observations and hence was named the Bilderberg Continuum Atmos- phere (BCA). The detailed program of the study week is given in Addendum 1. The composition of the three working groups is shown in Addendum II. 3. The Bilderberg Continuum Atmosphere In this and the two following sections, we briefly summarize some of the main con- clusions of the three working groups. The establishment of a solar photospheric model based on continuum observations proved feasible, and, in fact, the participants were surprised to see how well the observations of the various parts of the solar spectrum, including the ultraviolet and infrared ranges, agreed in producing one uniform model of the solar photosphere. This model is outlined in detail here. A brief summary of the results from line-profile observations is given in Section 4; in Section 5, a summary of the meeting's opinions on the temperature and pressure variations and on the velocity fields in the photosphere will be given. To determine empirically the run of temperature in the sun, we must examine the emergent intensities that arise from various depths. This is accomplished in three ways: (a) by investigating absolute intensities over an extended spectral range, exploiting changes in opacity to cause different effective depths offormation;"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"THE BILDERBERG MODEL OF THE PHOTOSPHERE AND LOW CHROMOSPHERE 7 (b) by measuring the intensities close to the extreme limb of the sun; ( c) by studying the profiles of strong lines where great differences in the absorption take place within a few angstroms. Although the first method permits the simplest interpretation (provided the theo- retical absorption coefficients are linked without systematic error throughout the wavelength range), the ordinary visual continuum does not provide much leverage on the solar temperature distribution, because the opacity changes very little between 4000 A and 10000 A. However, in both the micron and millimeter regions, as well as in the ultraviolet, the absorption increases enormously and the emergent radiation originates in higher layers of the sun's atmosphere. Until recently, there were too few observations to sketch a systematic picture of the region of the solar temperature minimum and the low chromosphere by this method, but in the past few years more observations from this extended wavelength range have become available, and their significance for a solar model has been more clearly appreciated. As a result, a number of new measurements were collected and reported for the first time at the Bilderberg Conference and incorporated in the BCA. This new empirical solar model defines the temperature throughout twice as many orders of magnitude in optical depth as the previous URP. Although the observations considered fall into place with remarkable consistency, solar physicists should be aware that conflicting results from line-profile analyses were completely ignored in the formulation of this model. Furthermore, the agreement of the far-ultraviolet and infrared observations may point more toward the meagerness of the data than to the certainty of our deduced temperature distribution. Before the particular observations and the temperature regions they define are discussed, some general remarks about the different spectral regions are in order. In the far ultraviolet, calibrations rest primarily on the rocket results of DETWILER et al. (1961). The ultraviolet opacities, although now much better understood through the work of GINGERICH and RICH (1966, 1968), are still comparatively poorly known. Nevertheless, they point to the spectral region between 1525 A and 1683 A as arising from the solar temperature minimum, and since the minimum region is apparently rather broad, even large errors in the opacity will not appreciably affect the emergent intensity. Furthermore, because the Planck function is extremely sensitive to temper- ature in this wavelength region, an order-of-magnitude error in the absolute intensity calibration will make only a 400 0 difference in the emergent brightness temperature. In the visible spectrum violetward of 4500 A, marked discrepancies still exist between the observed intensities and the model-atmosphere predictions, as reported to the Bilderberg Conference by CARBON, GINGERICH, and KURUCZ (1968). In the absence of any truly convincing explanation for this disagreement, it is best to omit these wavelengths in constructing an empirical solar temperature distribution. This near-ultraviolet region is increasingly blanketed by absorption lines, but these seem to account only partially for the discrepancy. The wavelength region extending from about 5000 A onward into the infrared provides several distinct advantages for determining the solar temperature distribu-"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"8 O. GINGERICH AND C. DE JAGER tion. The comparative paucity of absorption lines eliminates the difficulty of establish- ing the true continuum. The opacity is well known, arising in the infrared regions from the free-free absorption of negative hydrogen ions. Finally, at least some of the non-LTE effects haunting the ultraviolet regions are absent here. Undoubtedly, future models will place increasing reliance on this spectral region as more observations become available. The run of temperatures in the BCA can be roughly divided into three sections: the photosphere, below log '[5000 = - I, the temperature minimum from log '[5000 = - 2 to - 4, and the low-chromosphere temperature rise above log '[5000 = - 4. 3.1. THE PHOTOSPHERE A great wealth of limb-darkening data from the visible regions of the spectrum deline- ates the shape of the temperature distribution between optical depth 0.1 and unity. The models of SAUVAL (1968), HOLWEGER (1967), MUTSCHLECNER (1968), LAMBERT (1967), and Elste (as presented by WITHBROE, 1968) differ from each other or from the URP by less than 200°. Much of the existing disagreement derives from the various values adopted for the absolute intensities of the continuum at various wavelengths. It is clear that not all the values in the literature can be taken with equal weight, and it should be noted that averages including the original, high results of Labs (such as those given in Allen's Astrophysical Quantities) are less trustworthy than the more recent values given by LABS and NECKEL (1962). Some concept of the internal accuracy of measurements can be formed by com- paring the temperatures derived from different wavelengths. For example, the results of Sauval and Holweger show that either the opacities or their adopted continuum intensities are incorrect in parts of the near-infrared. Since any opacity errors would probably show their most conspicuous anomalies in the relatively transparent region of the H- absorption minimum at 16400 A, and since the results of Sauval and Holweger were quite smooth in this particular spectrum region, we conclude that their adopted intensities beyond 20000 A contain errors. The work of Lambert, which was based primarily on the absolute intensities of Labs and Neckel and the relative intensi- ties of Pierce scaled to the intensities of Labs and Neckel, did not show any such anomalies in the infrared. Because the model of Lambert not only appeared internally consistent but closely resembled the model of M utschlecner and the middle column of Elste's three-column model, his model was adopted for the region log '[5000 = -1 to O. At the same time, the value for [5000(0,0) of 4.05 x 10 14 ergs cm- 3 sec- 1 ster- 1 was adopted from the work of Labs and Neckel. The temperature distribution below optical depth unity is rather poorly deter- mined by the observations, since there is no particularly transparent region of the spectrum that permits unambiguous observations of these depths. Models constructed with the mixing-length theory of convection give some guidance to plotting the temper- ature in this vicinity, and sincc the URP already reflected these convective trends, the temperatures at greater depth were simply scaled from that model. In retrospect, it appears that the temperatures below '[5000 = 2 were pressed too low. It is perhaps this"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"THE BILDERBERG MODEL OF THE PHOTOSPHERE AND LOW CHROMOSPHERE 9 decision that has produced the lower predicted 1 5000 (0,0) of 3.91 x 10 14 ergs cm- 3 sec -1 ster -1 in the BCA rather than the desired value of 4.05 x 10 14 • 3.2. THE TEMPERATURE MINIMUM The value of 4600° adopted for the temperature minimum in the BCA rests on two lines of evidence. First, this is close to the color temperature found by TOUSEY (1963) and his colleagues for 1600 A; the reasons for believing that radiation from this wavelength region emerges from the temperature minimum have been given by GINGERICH and RICH (1968). Second, the work of RICH (1966) on the carbon monox- ide spectrum in the solar ultraviolet presents a consistent picture if the lowest temper- atures lie in the vicinity of 4600°. Because the carbon monoxide is formed preferen- tially and with great sensitivity on the high-pressure side of the temperature minimum, it provides a delicate indicator. Should a minimum of 4400° have been adopted, the predicted carbon monoxide spectrum would have been much too strong. With the temperature placed at 4600°, it was easier to draw a smooth transition both to the deeper photosphere layers and to the overlying chromosphere than if the minimum were 4400°. Limb-darkening measurements both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet provide evidence for the broadness of the temperature minimum. The observations by LENA (1968) at 20.4 and 24.2 J1 and by NOYES, BECKERS, and Low (1968) at 22.5 and 24.3 J1 show a center-to-limb intensity variation going from definite darkening at 20 J1 to an essentially flat distribution at 24 J1. This is in distinct contradiction to the URP, which predicts definite limb brightening because its temperature-minimum region is too narrow. The BCA model, on the other hand, yields infrared predictions in satis- factory agreement with the observations. Unfortunately, these infrared measurements are as yet only relative, and consequently, they offer no information about the actual temperature in the minimum region. In the ultraviolet, the spectral region between 1525 A and 1683 A shows neither darkening nor brightening toward the limb. As pointed out in the paper by Gingerich and Rich, the URP predicts considerable limb brightening throughout this region, whereas the BCA is much more satisfactory in this regard. The transition between the photosphere and the temperature minimum (i.e., the region between -1 and - 2 in log '[5000) is comparatively poorly determined. The URP reaches a minimum value of 4500° at an optical depth of 0.025, whereas the models of Lambert and Mutschlecner show at the same point a temperature of about 4800°. The evidence for a comparatively sharp dip in this region comes largely from intensity measurements at the extreme limb made during eclipses (HElNTZE, 1965). Such measurements inevitably carry a rather low degree of confidence because of the difficulties in correcting for the geometry of the eclipse and because of the rough and spiculed nature of the sun's limb. It would be far preferable to determine the temper- atures in this transition region from absolute intensities and limb-darkening measure- ments in some suitably opaque spectral region, for example, from 1900 A to 2800 A. The BCA satisfactorily represents the central intensities determined by BONNET and"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"10 o. GINGERICH AND C. DE JAGER BLAMONT (1968), but it has not been possible to achieve a satisfactory interpretation of their limb-darkening observations. Consequently, in the BCA the temperature distribution in this transition region is simply a smooth curve connecting the points at log '\"5000 = -1 and - 2. 3.3. THE LOW CHROMOSPHERE Absolute-intensity measurements from the millimeter region as compiled by NOYES, BECKERS, and Low (1968) and from the far ultraviolet as interpreted by SAUVAL (1968) established the temperature rise from log '\"5000 = - 5 to - 6. The results from these two extremely diverse spectral regions showed such remarkably good agreement as to border on the unbelievable. If the interpretation of these observations is correct, then inhomogeneities must have comparatively little influence on the model in this region - otherwise, the temperatures derived from the ultraviolet should have been higher than those derived from the infrared because of the non-linear increase in the Planck function for high frequencies. Given the run of temperatures established for the vicinity of the low chromosphere, an interpolation between this region and that of the temperature minimum was comparatively unambiguous. For shallower layers, however, the millimeter-region observations implied a steeper rise in temperature. Although these temperatures are not well determined, we decided to specify them in the BCA as a warning that the temperature distribution between log '\"5000 = - 5 and - 6 should not simply be extrapolated outward. 3.4. NOTES ON THE COMPUTATION OF THE MODEL The model is homogeneous, and is in hydrostatic equilibrium. The abundances are those of GOLDBERG, M tiLLER, and ALLER (1960), except that the ratio of hydrogen to helium by number is 10. The electron contributions of six elements (Si, Mg, Fe, C, Na, and AI) have been considered explicitly; as can be seen in Table I, these elements contribute over 80% of the electrons throughout the intermediate regions of this model. It is necessary to perform detailed calculations of the ionization of these elements that contribute significantly to the electron pressure, because throughout the intermediate regions of the model the negative hydrogen ion is the predominant opacity source at 5000 A. Our studies show that the six elements considered explicitly constitute a sufficiently extensive set. Tables I to IV have been calculated on the Control Data Corporation 6400 com- puter at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory with the program described by GINGERICH (1963). In Table I, the monochromatic opacity at 5000 A is tabulated. The sources of opacity used in the calculation are neutral H, H -, H;, metals, and Rayleigh and electron scattering. The abundances of Si, Mg, and Al affect the opacity, and they playa very important role in the ultraviolet rather than at 5000 A. The treatment of the opacities has been described by GINGERICH (1964) and GINGERICH and RICH (1966). The optical depth/geometrical depth relation has been independently calculated by Linsky, with the conclusion that this integration is quite stable, even at shallow optical"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"TABLE I BILDERBERG CONTINUUM ATMOSPHERE T EFF = 5780.

Conclusions of the Working Group on the Temperature Model from Line Considerations The spectral lines used so far by solar physicists may be roughly divided into three groups: 4.1. LINES FOR WHICH A NON-LTE THEORY IS POSSIBLE These lines have a possible non-LTE theory in the sense that the relation between the electron temperature Tel and the excitation temperature Tex can be derived from know- ledge of a given model. a. The Hand K lines a/Call and MgJJ From various investigations (see the Program for Tuesday 18 April, in Addendum I), a dilemma appears to exist: We have to assume either that the 'base' of the chromo- sphere is located at T5000~ 10- 4 with T~4200-4300oK (case for the thick chromo-"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"10,000 9000 8000 6000 5000 THE BILDERBERG MODEL OF THE PHOTOSPHERE AND LOW CHROMOSPHERE BILDERBERG CONTINUUM ATMOSPHERE UTRECHT REFERENCE PHOTOSPHERE MUTSCHLECNER'S MODEL SAUVAL'S MODEL --- - .... : ........ ...... 4000~ __ ~ ____ ~ ____ -L ____ ~ __ ~~ __ ~ ____ -L ____ ~ __ ~ -7.0 -6.0 -5.0 -4.0 -3.0 -2.0 -1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0, log T 5000- Fig. 1.

This latter situation is the 'optically thin' case, in which the optical depth of the chromosphere in the center of the K line of Can is of the order of 3; furthermore. L1AD~0.15 A. In order to solve this dilemma, we must greatly improve our knowledge of the high chromosphere; we also need good photometry of the Can and Mgn lines, suitable for empirical analysis. We should mention here that the proposed BCA is in contradiction to both alternatives given above, but perhaps a further step forward may be achieved only when the inhomogeneities in the Hand K lines are duly taken into account. b. The Balmer and Lyman Hydrogen Lines It is clear that the theory of the hydrogen lines is now in an adequate state. The wings of Balmer lines are suitably described by the URP model. It is not likely, however. that the minimum temperature in the low chromosphere can be deduced from an investigation of the Balmer lines, since the computations are rather insensitive to the temperature. On the other hand, the lines are so sensitive to the chromospheric model itself that undoubtedly the application of the theory of the hydrogen lines to an investi- gation of the line cores will greatly improve the model of the medium chromosphere."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"20 9000 8500 8000 7500 7000 6500 6000 5500 O.

METAL AND ION LINES FOR WHICH A RELATION BETWEEN Tel AND Tex CANNOT BE DERIVED (a) Holweger's distribution of Tel and his assumption that Tel = Tex appear to account for a very large number of observational data - on central intensities of Fraunhofer lines, with the exception of the resonance lines. However, noticeable differences, which appear mostly for log \"5000< -2, still appear to occur between Holweger's source function and the source functions derived by De Jager and Neven (communi- cation B13; see Addendum I). Part of these differences might be due to the fact that the measurements come from two different sets of observations. There is an obvious need for further accurate observations and for further theoretical investigations re- lated to the source functions in the transition region between photosphere and chromosphere.

BEHAVIOR OF MODERATE INTENSITY LINES FROM IONIZED OR NEUTRAL ATOMS IN FLASH SPECTRA In order to understand Redman's observations about the occurrence of self-reversals in atomic and ionic lines of various excitation potentials in the flash spectrum, as reported by Houtgast (communication B14; see Addendum I), it seems necessary to assume that the different behavior of these lines is caused by the different behavior of the source functions at the same heights in the chromosphere. It may be necessary to assume that the temperature is increasing outward in the region about 500 km above the sun's limb. 5. Temperature Fluctuations, Velocity Fields in the Photosphere and Low Chromosphere Although various valuable attempts have been made in the last fifteen years to deter- mine the microscopic and macroscopic velocity fields and their variation with depth and direction, and to find the distribution function of the temperature fluctuations as a function of the optical depth, it was the consensus that these attempts did not yet yield reliable and generally acceptable results. The reason for these failures can easily be summarized. 5.1. VELOCITY FIELDS We can distinguish between the microturbulent velocity V t with its vertical component /;t and the macro turbulent velocity field, which consists of a convective and a vibra- tional component Vc and v v , respectively. These three quantities should be determined as a function of the optical depth 'C 5 000 and of the angle 8 with the vertical direction. Little information is available in current literature about the relative contributions of Vc and v v , so that we had better sum these two quantities into the macroscopic velocity Vma ('C 5000, 8). Since the determination of the convective-velocity component is extremely sensitive to the assumed L1 T( 'Co) relation, the difficulty in finding this latter function (see the second part of this section) makes it virtually impossible to find VeC'C 5000). Furthermore, the derived values of V t ('C 5000) are also directly dependent on the assumed values of Vma ( 'C 5000), so that the difficulty in finding the latter function also makes it very hard to find the former. It seems probable that perhaps not much weight should be attached to already published values of these functions. For the time being, we think it the safest assumption to take round values: V t = 1 km/sec and Vma = 2 km/sec, isotropic and independent of depth. We should notice at the same time that there are clear indications that Vma > 2 km/sec at log 'C5000 ~ - 6, but the precise value is not yet known. 5.2.

The solar brightness temperature was measured at frequencies of 19.0, 21.0, 22.2, 23.5, and 25.5 GHz on 8 days in February and March, 1966. The observed average brightness temperatures were 10800, 10900, 11000, 10700, and 9800 o K, respectively. The daily values were close to these averages. The solar brightness spectrum near 1 cm wavelength was measured on several days in the period January-March, 1966. The measurements were made with a 5-channel K- band radiometer mounted on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Lincoln Laboratory 28-ft millimeter antenna (STAELIN and BARRETT, 1966). The frequencies observed were 19.0,21.0, 22.2, 23.5, and 25.5 GHz. The measurements were made by taking drift scans across the center of the sun every 10 min for a period of approxi- mately 2 hours each day. The resulting measurements were corrected for atmospheric absorption by extrapolation to zero atmosphere of the observed dependence of solar intensity upon elevation angle. The results were calibrated by comparison of the solar data with the average lunar-brightness temperature observed over a lunation. The comparison was made using the antenna patterns measured at each frequency (STAELIN and BARRETT, 1966). The true lunar brightness temperature was estimated from observations by many observers at many wavelengths (MORAN, 1965). The errors involved in this comparison technique are very nearly the same at each frequency and thus the relative errors are small. The relative errors were dominated by the effective receiver noise and system- gain fluctuations present during the lunar and solar observations. If it is assumed that the true average lunar brightness is within 5% of the assumed 215 OK, then the absolute r.m.s. error at each frequency is approximately ± 700 OK. The measured average solar brightness temperatures of the center of the sun are listed in Table I, together with the relative r.m.s. errors. Only the eight most accurate spectra were averaged. None of these spectra showed evidence of solar flares. The rest of the data are not included here.

LENA Universite de Paris et Observatoire de Meudon, France** (Received 25 April, 1967) Abstract. Existing models of the solar atmosphere predict a limb brightening in the far infrared wavelengths. At shorter wavelengths this effect is confined to the extreme limb but at 25 II it extends inward from the limb to cos () = 0.3. Observations of 1(11)/1(1.0) were made with the McMath Solar Telescope through atmospheric windows at 10.4, 17.9, 20.4, and 24.2 microns, respectively. The measurements, after having been smoothed, are compared with the theoretical predictions taking into account the diffraction pattern of the telescope. The expected brightening does not appear. 1. Introduction Different authors have emphasized the importance of measurements of the center-to- limb variation of the solar brightness at long wavelengths (PECKER, 1965; DE JAGER, 1963), in order to get more information on the transition layer between photosphere and the chromosphere, as well as on the absorption of the H- ion. From different existing models of the solar atmosphere, NOYES et al. (1966) and LENA (1966) have computed expected center-to-limb variations at various wavelengths from the near- infrared to the submillimetric range. At the longer wavelengths, all the computations predict limb brightening at the extreme limb: this effect should be measurable at A=20fl, for cosO :::;0.3. Except for the millimeter to meter wavelengths, the previous observations of the relative intensities at different points on the solar disc in the continuum emission have been made at a wavelength A= 12.95 fl (SAIEDY, 1960), or below (PIERCE et al., 1950), and extend from the center of the disc to, roughly, cos 0 = 0.4 (1 min of arc from the limb). Ina footnote, NOYES et al. (1966) report on an observation at 24.3 fl, cosO=0.2, in which neither brightening or darkening was observed. The present work extends previous observations; the center-to-limb variation has been measured at selected wavelengths between 10 and 25 fl from the center of the disc, cos 0 = 1.0 to cos 0 = 0.14, i.e. 11 sec of arc from the limb (see Note added in proof, p. 35). The results are presented herewith and compared with the theoretical predictions. 2. Observations Measurements have been made with the McMath Solar Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory.

As this is not negligible it will be taken into account for the reduction of the results. The measurements are relative: the intensity at various points along a solar radius is compared to the reference intensity of the center of the disc. Because of the vignet- ting in the telescope's focal plane, it has not been possible to measure at the same time the intensities at two widely different points in the sun's image. Rather, it has been necessary to intercompare the intensity at the center with a point near the limb by slowly moving the sun's image over the slit of the spectrometer and repeating this scan many times. However, by means of a mirror arrangement the detailed profile of the extreme limb has been obtained by rapid scanning of a small portion of the image, for which vignetting is negligible. The limb has been scanned using slits of different widths but of a constant length of 24 mm (55 sec of arc). The scans have been made at equatorial solar latitudes, either at the East or at the West limb. The scanned areas have been chosen without spots or visible solar activity. Spectral isolation is obtained with a grating (Bausch & Lomb, 40 g/mm), plus one InSb or Ge interference filter, plus one or two Reststrahlen LiF reflection filters for wavelengths beyond 15 fl. In each case the amount of short-wavelength radiation reaching the detector has been measured and kept below 0.5% of the long-wavelength signal. The detector is a Golay cell which is made to act as a variable capacitor when placed in a measurement bridge driven atf= .55 Mc/s. The incident radiation is mo- dulated at!' = 10 cis. After suitable demodulation and filtering, the signal is recorded on a strip chart recorder or digitized and summed by a computer. Except for possibly a few weak molecular lines, the spectrum of the sun is conti- nuous in the range 10-25 fl. Since the phenomenon in which we are interested should not be strongly dependent on the wavelength, we are allowed to use a rather broad spectral interval; hence, in order to gain signal, an interval of L1A~ 1.4 fl was employed for most of the measurements. The selection of the wavelengths in the spectrum cannot be arbitrarily decided because of the telluric absorption. The spectrum of the atmospheric absorption made by FARMER and KEY (1965) was examined to decide which windows were to be used for this investigation. In spite of having selected the most open windows, the observed fluctuations of the atmospheric transmission are not negligible. For even on dry days, at wavelengths longer than 15 fl, a 30% variation in transmission in periods of about 10 min was noted. However, the frequency spectrum of this fluctuation varies roughly as Iff in the vicinity of the frequency fo= lc/s. If this is true then there is a gain in scanning the incoming data rapidly and summing repeated scans, as the following analysis shows. Assume a radial scan of the sun and that this scan is sampled to get the measure- ment of the intensity in n points. Let Tbe the total duration of the scan. Each sampled point will correspond to the incident energy E integrated during a time T/n. The signal per point is then Sl = ET/n. (1)"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"30 PIERRE J.

The only limitation in this process has been the response time of the Golay cell (30 ms). The improvement by this technique has been good enough to reach a point where the predominant noise is no longer the atmospheric noise but the detector noise, which is mostly 'white' noise in this frequency range and which is not relevant in the above treatment. In order to add repeated fast scans the SDS 910 computer was used. By suitable programming, the computer took care of scanning the image by the telescope, of the sampling and the numerical filtering of the data, and of the superposition and addi- tion of the successive scans. 3. Reductions Most of the observations have been reduced with a CDC 3200 computer in a four-step process. The COOLEY and TUKEY (1965) algorithm allows a versatile use ofthe Fourier transform for numerical deconvolution and filtering.

The limb to which f1 = 0 refers is the limb at the observed wavelength, arbitrarily fixed at the inflexion point of the observed curve. The scans at 20.4 and 24.2 f.1 cover only the limb area (cose <0.4). To relate them with the reference central intensity, numerous systematic comparisons have been made between the center of the disc and one particular point of the limb, cos e = 0.4, chosen as a secondary reference. The figures show four types of computed curves: Type (a): Original is the curve directly deduced from the model. Type (b): Diffracted is the original curve after diffraction by an objective of 158 cm and smeared by a slit, 2 sec of arc wide, parallel to the limb. (The smear simulates, on the model, some of those shifts which might have occurred during the superposition of successive scans.) Type (c): Filtered and Diffracted is Type (b) numerically filtered by the same process and with the same frequency cutoff as for the data. Figure 3 shows the Gibbs phenomenon from the strong frequency cutoff of the sharp limb. Type (d): Diffracted and scanned by a slit S means that Type (b) curve has been convoluted by a slit of the same width as the scanning slit, and the result filtered at a frequency f1' high enough to just avoid the Gibbs phenomenon. The observational data on Figures 3 and 4 are to be compared with Type (d) curves because they have been filtered at the same frequency cutofff1' and were not deconvoluted. To get an approximation of the diffraction pattern of the limb by the objective, the following analysis is made. The intensity distribution given by a point source in the focal plane of an objective (diameter D, focal length f) is the Airy function f(m) = I2J 1 (m)Y (6) m where m = (nDr )/j)~ at the wavelength A and at a point distant of r from the geometric image. Note that the intensity distribution given by a long straight line source is I 'fw mf(m) A(M)j=2 (2 2)tdm, M m -M \\ (7) which is the Abel transform of f(m). We know that the one-dimensional Fourier transform of the function A is the two-dimensional Hankel transform of the functionf (see BRACEWELL, 1956). Our case is particularly simple since the Hankel transform of 2J 1 (m)/m is the function ll(r/2) which is 1 for r < 1 and 0 elsewhere. Therefore, the Fourier transform of A is simply the convolution square of II (r /2), in two dimensions, according to the properties of the Hankel transforms. This square is the overlapping area of two equal circles and has the analytical expression: A'(s) = n(s)*n(s) = ~. [Arc cos(s) - s(l - S2}'].

LENA and performing the Fourier transform O'(s) = T'(s)·A'(s). (10) Since our observations go very close to the limb, it is important to know just how accurate are the above approximations. As a check, we have first computed the diffracted aspect of a straight limb repre- sented by a step-function. Then, we computed the exact two-dimensional diffraction pattern of a curved limb having the same step-function. In the instance of this parti- cular and simple limb-profile, an exact computation is possible. The results compare within 0.4% for fl ~ 0.1 at A = 25 fl and below. The approximation is then legitimate in the range of our observations and within their accuracy. Thus, it is correct to start from the model T with Type (a) curves and to compute its Fourier transform. Next, one multiplies by the transform A', suitably scaled and then by a smearing function smcs. Finally, one computes the inverse transform which gives curves of Type (b). 4. Discussion Figures 1-4 show the theoretical limb-darkening and brightening curves based on the Utrecht Photospheric Model (HEINTZE et at., 1964). The comparison between the observed and the computed data shows a discrepancy. Below about 15 fl, the com- puted curve is under the experimental points; this trend is reversed at 17.9 fl and longer wavelengths where the observed brightness is smaller than the predicted one. H is obvious that, to the accuracy of our measurements, the expected brightening does not appear. Either a modification of the photospheric model in its highest layers, or a modification of the coefficients of the H- ion free-free absorption, or both, is required to fit observation with theory. In the transition zone between photo- sphere and chromosphere, where the temperature minimum is located, the thermal gradient might be lower than the value accepted in the Utrecht model, or a fortiori, in other models which give still stronger discrepancies at the long wavelengths. As for future work, until observations can be made above the atmosphere, more extended and accurate sets of data are needed at 24 fl. The quasi-total absorption of the terrestrial atmosphere starts above 25 fl, except for a very weak window at 34 fl, noticeable on Farmer's spectra. This fact gives very little hope for observations from the ground at still longer wavelengths, where the phenomenon of limb brightening is accentuated. The present results need to be extended at the extreme limb by improve- ment of the scanning procedures and by reduction of the instrumental noise. Further- more, comparisons should be made with measurements in the far ultraviolet, where the energy and diffraction problems do not exist to the same degree.

(Received 30 June, 1967) Abstract. Observations of the intensity distribution near the solar limb at 2.43 and 22.5 fl, show the absence of limb brightening to within 1 or 2 arc sec of the limb. Observations at 1.2 mm indicate limb brightening at this wavelength. These results are compared with the Utrecht Reference Photosphere and with existing data on the solar flux in the millimeter range, and suggest that the temperature minimum is broad and extends above '1\"5000 =2 x 10- 3 • A sharp rise of temperature is required above T5000 =10- 5 • In this paper we shall discuss a series of investigations that we have carried out during the past year to study the solar intensity distribution in the far infrared and millimeter regions. Part of the work has been reported previously (NOYES, GINGERICH, and GOLDBERG, 1966; NOYES, 1966; NOYES et at., 1966), but some of the results are new. In February and March of 1966 we made preliminary measurements of the solar limb intensity at 24.3 Il in an attempt to see the brightening predicted by several current models of the solar atmosphere (e.g., NOYES, GINGERICH and GOLDBERG, 1966). The results were negative to within the lO-arcsec resolution limit of our measurements. This observation is described in Section 1. Next we measured the infrared limb profile with higher spatial resolution during the November 12, 1966, total solar eclipse. This experiment has indicated that limb darkening at 22.5 Il persists to the limit of our resolution, about 1 or 2 arcsec from the limb. We discuss the experiment and preliminary results in Section 2. At the same time, we have analyzed several drift curves of the sun made at a wavelength of 1.2 mm, and found definite evidence for limb brightening at this wavelength. We describe these data and their analysis in Section 3. Finally, in Section 4 we discuss the implications of these various results for the temperature structure of the low chromosphere. 1.

A carefully selected sheet of black poly- ethylene 0.004/1 thick was placed in front of the telescope to prevent excessive heating of the optics. The transmission of the polyethylene, while very low in the visible, was about 40% at 24 J1. Infrared scans of Venus with and without the polyethylene in place showed no noticeable degradation of the image. The infrared radiation passed through a narrow-band interference filter with its peak transmission at 24.3 J1 and a half width of 0.9 J1, and then through a 5-arcsec circular aperture at the detector. The detector was a germanium bolometer cooled by liquid helium to 4 oK. The detectivity of such a system is actually far greater than the noise introduced by other sources, principally sky transmission fluctuations, but this equipment was already in use for stellar work and was readily available.

LOW scans of the North and South limbs to remove the effects of an asymmetry in the instrumental profile, we were able to draw two conclusions: (a) At a position 40 arc sec inside the limb, where the effect of the instrumental profile on the measurements is small, the slope of the intensity is - 0.06% ± 0.07% arcsec. In terms of J-l=cos8, at J-l=0.28, dI dJ-l= -0.16 ± 0.20. (b) At a distance 10 arc sec from the limb (J-l=0.14), which lies within the instru- mental profile of the apparatus, the instrumentally smoothed profile is asymmetric, even after averaging the North and South limbs. This presumably is caused by an asymmetry in the original unsmoothed derivative of the intensity about the limb position. The direction of the asymmetry at 10 arcsec from the limb is such as to imply limb darkening at that position. Th us we have somewhat indirect evidence that the darkening persists to within at least 10 arc sec of the limb. 2. Eclipse Measurement at 22.5 !l In order to attain better spatial resolution near the limb, we attempted a similar observation during the November 12, 1966, total solar eclipse. This eclipse had the appeal of passing over the Andes, where high-altitude sites are reasonably accessible. We set up a 12-inch f /8 cassegrain telescope at an elevation of 14000 feet on the centerline of the eclipse north of Arequipa, Peru. A prefilter of high-quality black polyethylene, similar to that described above, was stretched over the entrance aper- ture of the telescope. At the cassegrain focus we placed a rectangular slit, 1 arcmin by 3.5 arcmin, with its long axis parallel to the apparent motion of the moon. A rotating two-level mirror displaced the image by 4.2 arcmin in the direction of the long axis of the slit, at a frequency of 12 cps. This allowed us to chop between a region including a 1-arcmin slice of the solar crescent and a region on the dark lunar disk. The chopping eliminated sky-emission fluctuations, but not transparency fluctuations. The solar radiation passed into a liquid helium dewar through a window of Irtran 6, then successively through the focal plane slit, through a 22.5- J-l interference filter (Figure 2), and through a KRS-5 Fabry lens, which finally imaged the objective onto the detector. The detector was a germanium bolometer especially constructed for the experiment at the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory of the University of Arizona, and had a noise-equivalent power of 1.6 x 1O- 12 w at 4 oK. The entire slit-filter-Iens-detector assembly was cooled to 4 oK by a liquid helium bath. * The signal from the detector was fed into a low-noise parametric amplifier, a phase-lock differential amplifier, an integrating digital voltmeter, and a digital printer. On the morning of the eclipse thin clouds covered the sky, gradually thinning out as totally approached. At totality, the sun appeared to be uniformly covered by very thin cirrus, although examination of a large-scale photograph of the sun obtained by * The liquid helium, as well as liquid nitrogen for precooling, was airshipped from the United States, then transported by train and truck to the site, which was 40 miles horizontally and 6000 feet vertically from the nearest paved road.

Shortly after totality the sky became very cloudy. : Before second and third contacts, we attempted to set the slit on the lunar limb at those position angles that were calculated by one of us (BECKERS, 1966) to cause a minimum of resolution loss due to irregularities of the lunar limb and distance off axis from the sun-moon centerline. Unfortunately, flexure in our guide telescope caused an error in positioning the slit, and we missed these optimum positions. Even more serious, at third contact the limb was placed quite close to the end of the slit, where the sensitivity drops rapidly with position. Calibration curves of the variation of slit sensitivity with position were obtained the previous day; these indicate that at third contact a sizeable correction to the data is necessary. The data near second and third contacts are shown in Figures 3 and 4. Figures 3a and 4a show the raw data, i.e., the integrated intensity I (x) between the lunar and solar limbs, as a function of the distance x in arcsec between the lunar and solar limbs. There is considerable noise in the data, consisting of two types: (a) high-frequency (~ 1 cps) noise, which is proportional to the signal I (x) and is almost certainly due to rapid transparency fluctuations, and (b) low-frequency (:::;;0.1 cps) variations, which are presumably due to slower drifts in sky transparency. Fortunately, during the few seconds preceding second contact and following third contact, there is no evidence for drifting in sky transparency. In Figures 3b and 4b we have plotted the 'average remaining intensity' l(x)=I(x)jx. The run of these points itself should be an index of whether the limb region shows brightening or darkening. The fluctuations in these data make clear the difficulty of deriving a very precise estimate ofthe limb darkening from them. Actually, the data for I suffer from other uncertainties, which are not evident in Figures 3b"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"40 R.W. NOYES, J. M. BECKERS, AND F. J. LOW and 4b: (a) there is an uncertainty of about ±O.l arcsec in the location of the limb, which causes a fractional uncertainty of about O.ljx in J at a distance x arcsec from the limb, (b) the third contact data have been corrected for the variation of sensitivity with position in the detector slit, described above. This makes these data considerably less reliable than the second contact data. Nevertheless, there does appear a tendency for the mean remaining intensity J to drop slightly toward the limb. This tendency may be followed to within about 3 arcsec of the limb before second contact, where the apparent influence of irregularities of the lunar profile becomes noticeable, and to within about 1 or 2 arcsec of the limb in the less reliable third contact data. We must emphasize, however, that noise in the data, uncertainties in the calibration, and possible transparency drifts make such a conclusion a probability rather than a certainty. Several curve-fitting procedures have been applied to the data in Figures 3 and 4 in an attempt to get the function J(x)=dI(x)jdx directly.

We also tried other numerical techniques that suppress the high-frequency noise relative to the lower frequency components of the signal. For the second contact data, the various methods concur in yielding either a flat distribution or slight darkening near the limb. (Further than 10 arc sec inside the limit some apparent brightening occurs, but we believe that this is due to a slow drift in sky transparency; for the last 10 arcsec, the time of about 25 sec remaining until contact is sufficiently short to make the sky drift less important.) The amount of darkening near the limb is rather sensitive to the fitting technique used. None of the techniques used produced a brightening at the limb, although the data are not good enough to rule out a very small brightening. The amount of brightening predicted by the Utrecht Reference Model (HEINTZE, HUBENET, and DE JAGER, 1964) seems"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"42 R. W. NOYES, J. M. BECKERS, AND F. J. LOW outside the limits of error, however. The measured darkening for x < 10 arcsec is (1IJ) (dJ/dx) = -0.005 ± 0.005/arcsec, where the uncertainty simply includes the spread among different curve-fitting techniques. The third contact data give identical results, but are unfortunately less reliable, due to the calibration problem mentioned above. However, they can be followed to within about 1 arcsec of the limb, in distinction to the second contact data, and yield no evidence of a brightening even this close to the limb. 3. Millimeter Region The millimeter data consist of three drift curves of the sun obtained in February 1965 at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, using a 5-foot spun plastic antenna with a conical feed into a germanium bolometer. The effective wavelength was 1.2 mm. In addition, both drift curves and North-South scans of the full moon were obtained. The intensity scans of the moon in the North-South and East-West directions ap- peared very similar. Figure 5 shows drift curves of the sun and the moon and their derivatives, with the East and West limbs averaged. Although the solar drift curves do not explicitly show limb brightening, we may infer its presence from the asymmetry of the drop-off of the smoothed intensity at the limb. If the intensity distribution were fiat, we would expect its derivative to be symmetric about the limb position. The lower left curve of Figure 5 shows the observed derivative for the sun.

Both effects are easily explained by the presence of limb brightening which, while not large enough to survive as explicit brightening after instrumental smoothing, does slow down the drop-off of the instrumentally smoothed profile at and just inside the limb. By way of comparison, the lower right-hand curve of Figure 5 shows the analogous curve for the moon, which is known to have considerable limb darkening at 1.2 mm. Here the effects are just the opposite: the increased slope on the side toward the center of the moon due to the lunar limb darkening is clearly evident, as well as a shift of the position of maximum slope inside the limb. A rather crude attempt has been made to correct for the effects of instrumental smoothing, using BRACEWELL'S (1955) chord-construction technique. This method suffers from our lack of detailed knowledge of the antenna pattern. We use the equation (1) where lobs and lcorr are the observed and corrected intensities, respectively (BRACEWELL, 1955). This equation assumes that the antenna profile looks like a single-slit diffraction pattern of halfwidth a. Although we do not know the 'best' value for a, it certainly is at least as large as the halfwidth of the lower left curve in Figure 5, which gives a crude measure of the instrumental profile. (Assuming that the true intensity near the solar limb is nearly a step function. Note that limb brightening can only serve to decrease the apparent halfwidth over the true antenna profile halfwidth.) This mini- mum halfwidth is a = 4.9 arcmin. Figure 6 illustrates the effect of applying Equation (1) to the data for several values of a, and shows explicit brightening for values of a greater than 4.0 arcmin. Thus we have further evidence that the inferred brightening is real. Calculations were made of the area under the upper left curve of Figure 5, com- pared with the area under a step-function distribution extending to the white light limb, where we assume circular symmetry in both distributions. The ratio of these areas should equal the excess flux emitted by the 1.2-mm sun over that of a uniform disk of emissivity equal to that at the solar disk center. We find this ratio to be 1.14 ± 0.03, where the last figure gives the internal consistency of the three drift curves. Systematic errors due to the lack of circular symmetry of the sun or the antenna patterns are possible, but hard to estimate. In addition, the ratio would be an over- estimate if the antenna smoothing lowered the intensity at the center of the disk, but the spread of the inferred antenna profile seems too narrow to allow this. 4.

The present data do not place any further restrictions on the model. However, it is interesting to consider this data in the light of our knowledge of the solar intensity distribution with wavelength in the millimeter region. Figure 7 (see also Table J) shows the various published measurements of brightness temperature TB in the far infrared and millimeter range, plotted versus wavelength in millimeters. The solid curve in Figure 7 is the prediction of the Bilderberg conti- nuum atmosphere* (GINGERICH and DE JAGER, 1968), and is only one of many plausible fits to these rather widely scattered data, but any fit will have to show a rather sharp rise in the 1 to lO-mm range. In order to fit the brightness temperatures observed in the visible and infrared, a rather broad low-temperature region is necessary. * Extrapolated upward according to T(n) = 4820 + 215/y'rl above T1 = 10- 3 , where Tl is the optical depth at I mm.

W. NOYES, J.M. BECKERS, AND F.J. LOW If we accept a homogeneous model of the chromosphere, then, it is clear that a sharp temperature rise must occur above about 1: 1 mm = 1, or 1: 5000 ~ 10- 5. In view of the known inhomogeneous structure (spicules, etc.) above this level, however, such a conclusion seems unwarranted. For instance, the increased brightness temperature past 1 mm could be caused by the increased optical thickness of the hot chromospheric structures, while the mean atmosphere, i.e., the interspicular regions, remain rather cool.

Among the intensities, determined at about 200 wavelengths between A 3000 and A 4100A in the spectrum of the centre of the sun's disk (HOUTGAST, 1965), the 32 highest ones (windows) were plotted and compared with absolute intensities given by other authors. The intensities in between the Fraunhofer lines from A 3600 to A 4000A, as determined here for the first time with high dispersion, reveal a detailed picture of several absorption features, one of which can be attributed to a Balmer jump of 0.03, a value in accordance with that found for stars and in agreement with the strengths of the high Balmer lines. The much higher value of the Balmer jump for the sun, as quoted in literature, in reality refers to the total intensity jump between A 4000 and A 3600A, which is mainly due to the crowding of Fraunhofer lines. 1. Comparison of Results Absolute intensities in the solar spectrum were determined by several authors in different ways. As fundamentally different one can consider the measurements made with low and high resolving power. My measurements were made with the photo- electric equipment of Dr. E. W. Mitchell, attached to the Snow telescope and spectro- graph at Mount Wilson; they have a resolution better than 0.1 A. The measured points were chosen between the Fraunhofer lines, which does not mean that all these points are windows, where the intensity of the continuous spectrum is reached, since this may be prevented by crowding of lines in many spectral regions. Considering the total of 200 measured points, 32 of them, given in the last column of Table I, are distinctly high ones in their surrounding spectral regions. A plot of these points will give us, for the time being, the best impression of some characteristics of the continuous spectrum between A 3000 and A 4000 A. In Table I the results of several authors are given. Great differences are shown, but the best observations agree in more than one respect, e.g. a sudden rise in intensity from A 3700 to A 4000A and the absolute intensities between A 4000 and A 4100A. Five of the series of observations are plotted in Figure 1. All but one series of absolute intensities were taken directly from the pUblications quoted. The one that was corrected by us is that of LABS and NECKEL (1962). These authors describe exactly how and what they have measured, namely integrated inten- sities in wavelength bands of 20.oA. Afterward they made a correction for the influ- ence of the Fraunhofer lines to obtain the intensity of the continuous spectrum by adding to the measured intensities the equivalent widths (from the Utrecht Photometric Catalogue, 1960) of the lines within each interval to the measured intensities.

For the spectrum of the centre of the sun's disk, being GO, the value of D is in agreement with the determination of this paper. This value, deviating considerably from the earlier value of 0.13, fits remarkably well into the values obtained for stars as a function of spectral type. As an illustration of this data of BARBIER and CHALONGE (1939) are reproduced here in Figure 4. There is however more: the height of the Balmer-jump has to agree with the strengths of the high Balmer lines. With the data given by UNSOLD (1955) we can check whether this condition is satisfied. From the Balmer lines he derives the number of hydrogen atoms in the second quantum state and finds 10gNo.zH= 15.7. The ab- sorption coefficient per hydrogen atom at the Balmer limit is R = 1.38 X 10- 17 , result- ing in a total absorption coefficient of 0.07. If we write with Unsold for the spectral depression R caused by an absorption coefficient K: I I I -=-+-, R K Rc in which Rc is the maximum depression in saturated hydrogen lines in the wavelength region considered, for which we may take 0.80, then R= 0.065, which in terms of the Balmer-jump D can be written as 1-10 - D. It follows that D = 0.03, in full agreement with the observational value as derived in this communication. References BARBIER, D. and CHALONGE, D.: 1939, Ann.

(Received 18 July, 1967) Abstract. The increasingly high flux predicted to the violet of 4500 A by many model solar atmospheres stands in contradiction to the observations. Since one possible cause of the disagreement is that the solar 'windows' by which the observed continuum is established might be obscured by line wings, we have made detailed calculations of these narrow spectral regions. With the exception of a few windows affected by the wings of Balmer lines, those redward of the Balmer discontinuity appear free of line blanketing. Even the assumption that the ultraviolet continuum is depressed 5 % by unseen lines not included in our calculations leaves substantial disagreements between the models and observations. The discrepancies could perhaps be explained by a veil of weak lines across the ultra- violet spectrum. Our calculations indicate that the windows become narrower at shorter wavelengths. Many of the ambiguities to the violet of 3600 A would be resolved if spectrophotometric tracings with a band pass of lOrnA were available. 1. Introduction One of the most remarkable discrepancies between many model solar atmospheres and the observations is the increasingly high flux predicted to the violet of A 4500 A. (In the Bilderberg Continuum Atmosphere (GINGERICH and DE JAGER, 1968), this disagreement is less pronounced, but nevertheless present beyond the Balmer discon- tinuity.)

(1950). The values of LABS and NECKEL (1962) redwards of 4010 A are in reasonable agreement with those of Minnaert. The 'observed' Balmer discontinuity given by Minnaert depends on the values of 3800 A and 3700+ A, which have been extrapolated on the assumption that the color temperature remains the same between 3700+ A and 5000 A. If an additional opacity source becomes important around 3900 A and increases to the violet, then the fore- going assumption is faulty and the observed Balmer discontinuity is only an upper limit. The observations of HOUTGAST (1965) suggest that this might be the case; in this paper we shall investigate the alternative possibility that the observed windows have been depressed by line blanketing. The models based on empirical Ter) relations such as the Mutschlecner model (MULLER and MUTSCHLECNER, 1964), the Utrecht Reference Photosphere (URP) (HEINTZE, HUBENET, and DE JAGER, 1964), and the Bilderberg Continuum Atmosphere (BCA) predict significantly higher intensities in the near ultraviolet than the observed values. Theoretical models driven to radiative equilibrium show similar disagreement with the observations in this wavelength region (GINGERICH, 1966; SWIHART, 1966). Attempts to reduce the disagreement by changing the model atmospheres have not produced encouraging results. Although an increase in the efficiency of convective energy transport brings the predicted intensities into slightly better agreement, the improvement is inadequate. Furthermore, the URP and BCA models already take into account the convective gradient. While another continuous opacity source in the ultraviolet could reduce the emergent intensities, it would also diminish the size of the Balmer discontinuity in an unacceptable manner. To avoid the ambiguity of the observed Balmer discontinuity, we define a related parameter I)J4000)/I),(3600). Table I shows that the predicted discontinuities are already too small.

For stars of solar type, departures from LTE in neutral hydrogen lead to an over-population of the n = 3 level and an under-population of the n=2 level (KALKOFEN, 1968). This will lead to an increased flux through the Balmer continuum and to a smaller Balmer discontinuity. Both results will increase the disagreement between theory and observation. Although non-LTE over-population of the bound state of H- would improve the situation, recent estimates of the col-"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"EFFECTS OF LINE BLANKETING ON THE SOLAR WINDOWS 57 lisional cross-section of H- for associative detachment indicate that H- will be in LTE at the continuum-forming depths (SCHMELTEKOPF, FEHSENFELD, and FERGUSON, 1967; DALGARNO and BROWNE, 1967). Because of the discrepancy between the models and the observations, we have re-examined the observational data. The observed values for the emergent intensity depend, of course, upon isolation of the continuum. The results quoted by CANAVAGGIA et al. (1950) and by LABS and NECKEL (1962) were obtained by correcting measurements taken at medium and low resolution for the effects of absorption lines. HOUTGAST'S (1965) results were obtained at much higher resolution and are believed to represent continuum intensities directly (HOUTGAST, 1967). Because the absorption lines become more and more crowded violetward of 5000 A, the possibility arises that at these shorter wavelengths there are no intervals entirely free of the effects of line absorption. If the so-called solar 'windows' (CANAVAGGIA and CHALONGE, 1946; CANAVAGGIA et al., 1950) used in the determination of the continuum intensities are significantly blanketed by the opacities in the wings of neighboring absorption lines, then the observed continuum will be depressed below the 'true' (unblanketed) continuum. Such blanketing could help to explain the discrepancies between the model-atmosphere results and the observations. 2. The Blanketing Calculations In order to estimate the extent of the line blanketing, we have attempted to calculate the detailed spectrum in the vicinity of the solar windows. We have concentrated our efforts on the windows listed by CANAVAGGIA et al. (1946, 1950), since these have been used most extensively by observers for establishing the level of the continuum. The atmospheric model used in our calculations was the BCA with the adopted microturbulent velocity of 2 km/sec (independent of depth). GOLDBERG, MULLER, and ALLER'S (1960) abundances were adopted for the metals. A He/H ratio of 0.10 by number was used. Unless otherwise noted, all results were obtained on the basis of this model. The continuous opacity sources included were neutral hydrogen, H-, Hi, electron scattering, Rayleigh scattering, and bound-free transitions of silicon and magnesium. The parameters used for the calculation of the line opacities were taken primarily from the extensive table compiled by STROM and KURUCZ (1966). This table provided gf values and excitation potentials for approximately two-thirds of the lines indicated by the Revised Rowland Table (MOORE, MINNAERT, and HOUTGAST, 1966) in the vicinity of the windows. With the exception of unidentified weak lines, the remaining third of the lines listed in the Revised Rowland Table fell into two groups. The first and larger group consisted of metallic lines for which no gf values, either theoretical or experimental, are available. The fewer remaining identified lines were due to CN, CH, and NH. In the case of the metallic lines without gf values, preliminary gf values were assigned. These were subsequently adjusted in a fashion to be described later. Since our computer programs have not yet been adapted for molecular calculations, the"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"58 DUANE CARBON, OWEN GINGERICH, AND ROBERT KURUCZ lines of CN, CH, and NH were approximated by artificial lines of CI having 7.7 eV excitation potential. Neutral carbon was chosen, since it would represent an upper limit on the abundances of the radicals, and because it has roughly the same mass and therefore, doppler width as CH and NH. The high-excitation potential was chosen to force the line formation down to the large optical depths indicated by the results of COHEN and STROM (1968) and of WITHBROE (1967). Since lines of low-excitation potential can be observed easily in the laboratory, most unidentified lines must be either higher-excitation lines of abundant metals or lines of rare elements. For this reason the unidentified lines in the vicinity of the windows were represented by artificial Fer lines of 3.3 eV excitation potential. We feel that these very crude approximations did not seriously influence the results of the investigation. The artificial lines were not great in number, generally weak in strength, and, in most cases, not close enough to any windows to influence the level of the continuum. Since the solar windows were chosen far from strong lines, any blanketing should be due to weaker l:nes in the immediate vicinity of the windows. We have, therefore, attempted to reproduce the detailed spectrum for 1.25 A on either side of the window wavelengths given by Canavaggia et al. To do this, a list was made containing every line inside a 4-A interval centered on the window wavelength. At every 0.01 A in this 4-A interval, the opacity from each line in the interval was calculated using a Voigt profile and the atomic parameters described above. For the windows redward of the Balmer discontinuity, the opacities from the wings of the nearer hydrogen lines were also calculated. If the opacity due to any line at a particular point exceeded 0.0001 times the local continuous opacity, it was included in the calculation of the total opacity at that point; otherwise, it was neglected. This procedure was repeated at each of the 400 wavelength points for 30 depths in the model atmosphere (from '5000= 10- 6 to '5000= 17.8). These opacities were then used in an LTE calculation of the emergent intensity /;.,(0,1) at every 10 rnA for the central 2.50 A of the 4-A interval. We then compared the emergent spectrum obtained in this manner with available atlases of the solar spectrum. These were the two unpublished high-dispersion atlases, the McMath-Hulbert Atlas of the Solar Spectrum, and the Atlas of the Solar Spectrum from 3000 to 7500 A (Delbouille, Neven, and Roland, to be published) as well as the lower dispersion Photometric Atlas of the Near Ultraviolet Solar Spectrum (BRUCKNER, 1960) and the Utrecht Photometric Atlas (MINNAERT, MULDERS, and HOUTGAST, 1940). Since the instrumental profiles were known for the McMath-Hulbert Atlas (GATHIER, 1962), the Bruckner Atlas, and the Utrecht Atlas, direct comparions could be made with these atlases simply by folding the calculated spectra through the instrumental profiles. Comparing the calculated spectra with the observed provided a check on the preliminarily assigned gf values. Whenever the calculated line strengths differed significantly from the observed, the gf values were altered to bring the strengths into better agreement. For the lines from the tabulation by Strom and Kurucz, any changes in gf values found necessary were usually within the tentative error brackets of 0.3 in log gf assigned by them. The spectrum was then recalculated with the new gf values, and another comparison made. Quite reasonable agreement between the observed and"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"EFFECTS OF LINE BLANKETING ON THE SOLAR WINDOWS 59 calculated spectra could usually be achieved after three to six trial calculations.

In subsequent calculations we used the 2 km/sec microturbulent velocity distribution adopted at the Bilderberg Conference.

However, since there seems to be no firm basis for choosing any particular depth-dependent microturbulent velocity distribution, we have chosen the 2 km/sec distribution for our calculations. Second, we note that the profiles of lines of moderate equivalent width calculated using the URP T(r) relation show prominent central reversals even at the center of the disk. These reversals are not apparent in any of the atlas traces of the lines. The BCA model, with its much broader temperature minimum, predicts no reversals for the lines included in our calculations. A third point of interest concerns the strengths of the wings of the Balmer lines at the window wavelengths. We used the most recent broadening theory due to GRIEM (1967) in our calculations. The degree of depression of the continuum caused by hydrogen-line blanketing in the BCA is shown in Table II, column two, for those windows that were significantly affected."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"EFFECTS OF LINE BLANKETING ON THE SOLAR WINDOWS 61 TABLE II Depression of continuum by hydrogen lines Window (A) BCA (%) Mutschlecner (%) URP (%) 3659 7 13 9 3665 10 15 13 3692 12 20 15 4000 < 1 <1 < 1 4117 <1 2 <1 4365 <1 <1 <1 4880 <1 2 <1 It must be stressed that the degree of depression of the continuum is dependent upon the choice of model atmosphere. As shown in columns three and four, both the Mutschlecner and the URP T( 't\") relations predict greater depressions than the BCA. The difference between the BCA and the Mutschlecner models arises because the temperatures where much of the continuum is formed ('t\" 5000 ~ 1- 2) are higher in the latter model. Hence it might be more appropriate to speak of the increase in the continuum rather than the depression of the hydrogen wings. 3. Conclusions The windows that we examined were measured by CANAVAGGIA et al. (1946, 1950), and they also correspond to the highest points reported by HOUTGAST (1965). We have found that the windows redward of the Balmer discontinuity are free of line blanketing, with the exception of those listed in Table II. In the region to the red of 3900 A, the McMath-Hulbert Atlas, with its very high resolution, allowed us to compare the calculated and observed spectra with very little difficulty. On the violet side of the discontinuity the situation is slightly ambiguous. The lower dispersion of the available atlases for the ultraviolet made the comparison between predicted and observed spectra troublesome. Only lines that appeared in the atlas traces could be taken into account in the calculations. The low resolution of the available atlases leaves open the possibility that the apparent windows are blanketed by cruciaJly placed, unseen lines of a few milliangstrom equivalent width. Such lines could perhaps introduce as much as 5 % ambiguity into the level of the apparent continuum. Within this uncertainty, however, we find that the windows in the ultra- violet are essentially unblanketed by recognized lines. Even assuming that the continuum is depressed 5 % by blanketing in the ultraviolet still leaves a large discrepancy between the models and observations. We feel that we cannot justifiably account for these disagreements on the basis of blanketing from the lines included in our calculations. These results contradict the investigation mentioned by Peeker (in the discussion following GINGERICH, 1966).

However, their indirect procedure was probably biased by systematic normalization errors in the gf values for ultraviolet iron lines. Although introducing more micro turbulence into the models at large depths would put more blanketing opacity into the line wings, enough microturbulence to blanket the windows significantly would grossly distort line profiles that now agree fairly well with the observations. Both our calculations and the high-dispersion atlases indicate that the windows become narrower at shorter wavelengths. Because the intervals of continuum at shorter wavelengths are so narrow, it is possible that the highest points registered in the Utrecht Atlas are not representative of true continuum, but are depressed by instrumental broadening. If this is the case, then the corrections for blanketing applied by CANAVAGGIA et al. (1950) are not great enough. Since the resolving power of 10 5 reported by HOUTGAST (1965) is comparable to that of the Utrecht Atlas, his results may also represent a continuum depressed by instrumental broadening. It appears possible to estimate the importance, if any, of this effect by comparing the blanketing corrections calculated on the basis of the Utrecht Atlas with those obtained from the high-resolution atlases. The discrepancies could be explained by postulating a veil of weak lines across the ultraviolet spectrum. Since these lines must be very closely spaced to produce the required effect, the veil would act as an additional continuous opacity source similar to bound-free absorption. If the distribution in wavelength of such weak lines resem- bled the distribution of strongerlines (that, is concentrated toward the violet), it might be possible to circumvent the difficulty mentioned earlier, namely, that an additional opacity source would tend to diminish the fA (4000)/ fA (3600) ratio.

BLAMONT Service d'Aeronomie du C.N.R.S., Reduit de Verril?res, Verrit!res-le-Buisson, France (Received 13 June, 1967) Abstract. We succeeded in several attempts at measuring the solar limb-darkening in the continuous spectrum between 1800 A and 2900 A. Good spectroheliograms were obtained during a rocket flight in November 1964 and during a balloon flight in October 1966 at 2190 A, 2665 A, 2885 A, and 1980 A, 2235 A respectively. A rocket flown at the beginning of 1967 provided excellent spectra allowing the measurement of center-to-limb variation in the continuum and lines from 1800 A to 2800A. The first series of pictures yielded absolute values of the central intensity leading to a minimum temperature close to 4700oK. The continuous opacity of the photosphere layers has been deduced from the two first experiments. It seems that a non-metallic source of continuous absorption must be taken into account between 2500 A and 3000 A. Moreover, as the source functions for the shortest wavelengths show a very flat variation near the minimum temperature, it seems that the transition zone between the photosphere and the chromosphere must be very gradual. These results are discussed in the light of the latest results deduced from the new spectra obtained. 1. Introduction In order to measure the ultraviolet solar limb-darkening we have launched a series of four balloon and rocket experiments. All of them make use of photographic film. Three consisted in taking spectroheliograms within narrow bands of the continuum. The other one consisted in recording a stigmatic spectrum of the disk. Table I is a general view of the results obtained in each experiment. The different instrumental specifications are also included. Since two of the experiments have just been launched at the beginning of 1967, the results presented in this paper refer mainly to the two earliest. 2. Observations (Experiments of November 1964 and October 1966) Several spectroheliograms were obtained in November 1964 with a multiple band-pass filter (BONNET and COURTES, 1962) aimed at the sun by a biaxial pointing system built at the University of Colorado (Boulder, USA). The wavelengths were chosen in the 'windows' of the solar spectrum as free as possible from absorption lines at 2190 A, 2665 A, and 2885 A. The adjustable band-width was taken equal to 43 A. The reso- lution achieved on the pictures is always better than 15 seconds of arc (Figure 1). Another experiment of exactly the same type was launched with the biaxial pointing system developed at the Service d' Aeronomie on a 38000 m 3 balloon in October 1966. The wavelengths were chosen for this second experiment at 1960 A and 2280 A in order to frame the silicon discontinuity at 1990 A. The band-pass was 80 A. Due to the vicinity of the atmospheric window at 2100 A, both bands were shifted"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"TABLE I General View of the UV Limb-darkening Results Space Pointing Exposure times Date of Sun accuracy Type of Spectral Wavelengths Spatial and launching Vehicle follower during experiment resolution studied resolution photographic Main Results used flight emulsion November 8, Veronique University of ± l' spectro- 43A 2190A 10\" 0.03 sec and Continuum 1964 Rocket Colorado heliograms 0.06 sec limb-darkening r::: curves a:: tll 2665 A 10\" 0.03 sec and Continuum 0 0.06 sec absolute » ~ intensities ;.: m 2885 A 15\" 0.03 sec III -0, ~ z 0, UV (16 mm) 0 0 tll October 3, 38000 m 3 Service ± l' 30\" spectro- 80A 1980 A 15\" to 20\" 0.08 sec and Continuum '\" m ~ 1966 Balloon d'Aeronomie heliograms 0.11 sec limb-darkening < » 103a-0, UV curves and g 35mm facular z 2235 A '\" 15\" to 20\" 0.08 sec and structure tll m 0.11 sec >-l ~ III-O, UV 35 mm m m -- --- z January 13, Veronique S.P.c. 300 ±T stigmatic OAA Range 15\" to 20\" 0.1 sec and Continuum ,.... 00 1967 Rocket Ball Brothers spectra 1800 A to 0.5 sec and lines 0 0 Research 2800 A 103a-0, UV limb-darkening » z Corporation 16mm curves 0 N Absolute 'D 0 intensities 0 »0 -~-\" .---~--- March 22, 38000 m 3 Service ±2' spectro- 80A 2040 A l' to 2' 0.08 sec and Facular 1967 Balloon d'Aeronomie heliograms 0.11 sec structure 103a-0, UV 35mm 2215 A 30\" 0.08 sec and Limb-darkening 0.11 sec curves 103a-0, UV 0- 35 mm v-."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"66 R.M.

The result of this computation is reported in column 3 of Table II. 4.

(1:;.) with 1: A- In columns 4, 5, and 6 of Table II, we report the values of the central intensity which give a surface temperature To successively equal to 4500°, 4600°, 4700°. Our measurements, together with the determinations from the V.V. fluxes, lead to a sur- face temperature higher than 4700°. As far as LTE is assumed, this result is in good agreement with the determinations of Matsushima, who found from visible limb-darkening observations a surface temperature close to 4650° for wavelengths longer than the Balmer discontinuity of hydrogen and a temperature greater than 4700° below this discontinuity (MATSU- SHIMA and TERASHITA, 1967). Nevertheless, experimental errors are important and lead to a rather broad uncertainty for To. Let us put We have: x = 1 (/1 = 0) and 1(/1 = I) Through logarithmic derivation we obtain: LlT ~ TgA(LlX + LlY). o C 2 X Y Ifwe assume that To = 4700°, and for A=3000 A, we can write: ( LlX Ll Y) Ll To ~ 450 0 X + Y ."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"72 R.M. BONNET AND J.E. BLAMONT We include in X and Y the experimental errors and the incertainty due to the averaging over the band of the filter. Experimental errors on X can be estimated to 5% in the best conditions. But the error due to the inversion of the Laplace Integral cannot be estimated with any certainty. Errors on Yare certainly more important since absolute photographic photometry is not very accurate; we think that they must lie between 15% and 20% at best. The fact that the measurements are not made in the true continuum but are averaged over a finite spectral range including a lot of absorption lines, have opposite effects in modifying X and Y. X is certainly overestimated since the center-to-limb contrast is lower in the lines than in the continuum, as we shall see later, and therefore will lead to a value of To too high. Conversely, Y is underestimated since the absorp- tion by the lines decreases the continuum intensity. Which of these two effects is the most important is difficult to assert! A computation of the limb-darkening and of the blanketing of the lines for all those included in the bands of the filter is the only way to answer the question. This is in progress now, but not entirely finished. If the experimental errors were only taken into account, To could be determined with an accuracy of ± 100°. 5. Empirical Opacity The analytical derivation of,,, (T) leads to d, ,,/dT (T) which, with respect to the same quantity at a given reference wavelength Ao, gives the ratio x,,/x o ofthe corresponding absorption coefficients. As usual, we have taken Ao = 5000 A. The '0 (T) relation for this wavelength has been deduced from Pierce and Waddell's limb-darkening ob- servations (PIERCE and WADDELL, 1961). We note that the model atmosphere given by these authors is in better agreement with the observations at 5000 A than the Utrecht Reference Model Atmosphere or U.R.M.A. (HEINTZE, HUBENET, and DE JAGER, 1964). In the same way the empirical model of MULLER and MUTSCHLECNER (1964) agrees very well with the observations at 5000 A. Consequently, assuming that there must be a unique surface temperature we have chosen 4600°, which is the boundary of the Miillerand Mutschlecner model. It leads to central intensities at 1980 A and 3190 A respectively equal to: 1.015 x 1012t 3 2.020 x 10 14 ) ergs/cm /steradian/sec. As shown by BARBIER (1946) the fact that To is not accurately defined is not of great importance for the determination of the empirical opacity. In Figures 6, 7, and 8 we have reported the results obtained for 4800°,5200°,7000°, and 8000°. They are compared to a theoretical computation made at Meudon follow- ing Gingerich's evaluation of the continuous absorption by various hydrogenic sources and by metals such as magnesium, silicon, carbon, and aluminium (GINGERICH, 1965).

DISCUSSION That the disagreement is greater for low temperatures is not surprising. Given the profile of our source-functions in the corresponding layers, a slight variation in the temperature induces a large variation in the optical depth. More curious is the varia- tion of the empirical opacity compared to that of the computed one.

Effect of the Lines As seen earlier, lines intercepted by the filter have the effect of decreasing the center-to-limb contrast. The result is an apparent increased continuous opacity, and the more numerous the lines, the greater this effect. We think that this effect is very important and our values of the continuous opacity are certainly an upper limit of what can be found in the solar atmosphere. 2. Effect of Inhomogeneities That the sun, even with a resolution of some 15\", cannot be considered as homo- geneous is shown in Figure 2: the 1980 A picture looks very much like the CaK spectroheliogram and, at least for this wavelength, smoothing the limb-darkening curve certainly leads to a poor approximation of the source-function. But as we shall see in Section 6 and as it can be observed on the other pictures of Figures 1 and 2, the inhomogeneities of dimensions greater than IS\" are very diffuse for wavelengths higher than 2190 A. Hence, the disagreement appears in a region where this effect must not play the prime role. Although these two effects must modify the final result once they have been taken into account, we suggest that a non-metallic source of continuous opacity contributes to the solar absorption coefficient in the range 2500-3000 A.

Departuresfrom Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium Let us assume that local thermodynamic equilibrium cannot hold in the photo- spheric layers studied, and that the source functions cannot be identified exactly to the Planck function BA(T) but to (PAGEL, 1963): Hence we have T < Tex. We have introduced in our computation b factors ~ 1- in order to lower the surface temperature close to the minimum of 4500° of the Utrecht Model 1964. The source functions thus obtained have been compared to the '5000 (T) relation given by the average column of this model. The result is a general slight in- crease of the empirical opacity. We have not evaluated what the effect would be of introducing departures from L TE in the computation of metallic absorption but if Ni* is the number density of any metallic atoms involved, computed in LTE, C1.id the corresponding absorption cross-section, and bi the coefficient of departure from LTE. The actual number density of the absorbing atom i is Ni = biNi*, and we have: The asterisk refers to computation in LTE. Since b is lower than unity, we see that the computed opacity in the case of L TE departure is lowered. Consequently the effect of introducing L TE departures is to increase the dis- crepancy existing between computed and measured opacity. 6. Latest Observations (Experiments of January 1967 and March 1967) In order to study in more detail the observed discontinuity in the balloon experiment of October 3, 1966 between 1980 A and 2235 A, we launched on January 13, 1967, a Veronique rocket equipped with a stigmatic double dispersion spectrograph and a biaxial SPC 300 sun follower built by Ball Brothers Research Corporation. The spectral range covered was 1800 A, 2800 A, with a spectral resolution varying from 0.37 A near 2300 A to 0.7 A at the extremities. Excellent spectra were obtained corresponding to exposures of 0.1 sec, and 0.5 sec. Given the very good pointing accuracy, details of angular dimensions lower than 20\" could be resolved in the direction of the slit, which cut across the disk at a distance less than l' from its center. Figure 9 represents two such exposures corresponding to approximately the same solar diameter. It can be seen that the facular plages appear strongly in the regions where the absorption is important and in the chromo spheric emission lines.

Apart from the discountinuity of Ca I at 2028 A and that of Si I at 1990 A which is hardly seen on our spectra, it is the only feature which can explain the very different structures observed on our 1980 A and 2235 A spectroheliograms. In order to be sure of this, we have taken spectroheliograms with wavelengths peaked at 2040 A and 2215 A, during a balloon flight in March 1967.

Anyhow, theoretical computations of metallic absorption must inevitably include a new source to explain the variation of the central intensity at 2076 A. As already shown by KODAIRA (1965), Aluminium could be that source. The discontinuity due to the photo-ionization ofMgr which theoretically occurs at 2510 A is less easily observed, owing to the presence of a strong blend of Fe lines. Nevertheless, the variation of the central intensity by a factor of 2 to 3 at 2650 A and 2500 A can be more likely attributed to magnesium than to any other absorber. The discontinuity observed at2412 A corresponds to a change in the film sensitivity. Another important feature of the spectra is the All auto-ionization doublet at 1934 A. As shown by WITHBROE (1966), the center-to-limb variation of this line brings information on the solar model. Withbroe computed this variation using two different models, the Utrecht Reference Model and the Model of Muller and Mutschlecner. The first predicts a strong limb brightening while the latter leads to the exactly opposite conclusion.

The Photospheric Model The preceding observations and computations are often in disagreement with some characteristics of the Utrecht Reference Model Atmosphere 1964. On the contrary, the model of Pierce and Waddell and that of Muller and Mutschlecner seem to fit quite well visible and UV observations. A. CRITICISM OF THE UTRECHT REFERENCE MODEL 1964 1.

Ultraviolet Observations Since the solar ultraviolet radiation comes from the upper layers of the photosphere near the transition zone, they give more information on these layers than the visible observations (Figure 12). The gradual variation of the temperature near the transition is confirmed: (1) by the smooth limb-darkening profile below 2076 A; (2) by the center-to-limb variation of the auto-ionization doublet of Al I; (3) by the very slow variation of the brightness temperature between 2000 A and 1500 A which never falls under 4700 OK (TOUSEY, 1963). The minimum temperature as determined from our measurements would be close to 4700 oK. Nevertheless, as seen earlier this determination is not very precise and the extrapolation of T near 't'A =0 is certainly affected by inhomogeneities. Therefore, a minimum temperature of 4500 oK is not incompatible with our observations. In the Fig. 12.

Eclipse Observations The gradient dT/d'l:sooo of the V.R.M.A. has been deduced from eclipse observations of the intensity decrease at the extreme limb. RODDIER and DELACHE (1967) pointed out that eclipse determinations of the dT/d'l:sooo gradient are always overestimated. This could explain the remarkable stressed transition of the V.R.M.A. B. REQUIREMENTS FOR A PHOTOSPHERIC MODEL The major criticism that we address to the V.R.M.A. concerns the transition between the photosphere and the chromosphere. The average empirical models of Pierce and and Waddell on the one hand and Muller and Mutschlecner on the other hand, which do not present any chromospheric temperature rising and therefore can be considered as models with very low temperature gradient, are in good agreement with visible and VV observations. The boundary temperature of these models is of some 4600 o K, which is a good compromise between the 4500 OK of the V.R.M.A. and our over- estimated determinations of more than 4700 OK.

Predictions of solar flux and limb darkening calculated from the Utrecht Reference Model, the Mutschlecner model, and the Bilderberg Continuum Atmosphere are compared with the rocket ultraviolet observations. The calculations employ recent experimental and theoretical determinations of metallic photo-ionization cross-sections. The spectral region between the continuous absorption edge from the first excited level of silicon at 1680 A and the ground-state absorption edge at 1525 A proves particularly significant for an investigation of the solar temperature minimum. The analysis indicates that the solar temperature minimum is relatively broad and flat, having a nearly constant temperature over somewhat more than a scale height, and that the chromospheric rise occurs just above '5000 = 10- 4 or so. Within the assumptions of the present models, a satisfactory interpretation of the ultraviolet spectrum can be reached with a temperature minimum of 4600° ± 100 OK. 1. Introduction The solar ultraviolet spectrum shows a pronounced change from limb darkening (above about 1700 A) to limb brightening (below about 1525 A). That the limb- brightened spectrum below 1525 A reflects the chromosphcric temperature rise was pointed out by Tousey in the initial discussions of the 1962 rocket spectrum obtained by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (TOUSEY, 1963, 1964). Since thattime numerous workers have emphasized how the change from limb darkening to limb brightening reflects conditions near the limb of the sun where the temperature must pass through the minimum value. The continuous absorption in this ultraviolet region has been discussed by a number of workers (DE JAGER, 1963; ZWAAN, 1962). Photo-ionization continua of neutral metals appear to make the most important contributions to the opacity. BODE (1965), improving the earlier work of VITENSE (1951), has provided tables and graphs of the total continuous coefficient resulting from the sums of the various contributors in the stellar-like mixture. Unfortunately, many analyses have neglected the explicit consideration of the low-lying excited atomic levels. The explicit inclusion of many levels of each atomic system is limited by practical matters of computing time and effort, but our results show that more than one level must be included. Silicon and magnesium are cases of immediate interest, and whereas the 2510-A edge of the excited 3p O level of mag- nesium appears explicitly in most analyses, the 1680-A and 1980-A edges of the excited levels of silicon have generally been grouped with the ground level."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"THE FAR ULTRAVIOLET SPECTRUM OF THE SUN 83 By explicitly including the 1 D excited level of silicon with its edge at 1680 A, we can show that the continuous spectrum of the sun from 1690 A to 1525 A must arise from the region of the solar temperature minimum. Since it is difficult in the photom- etry to disentangle from the continuum the many emission lines in this spectral region, it is not easy to establish a precise numerical value for the minimum temper- ature. A minimum temperature of 4500 oK is entirely consistent with the observations, but the low-temperature region must be considerably more extended than that given in the Utrecht Reference Model (HEINTZE, HUBENET, and DE JAGER, 1964). 2. Silicon and Metallic Photo-Ionization Cross-Sections Recent theoretical and experimental work in photo-ionization cross-sections has provided improved bound-free absorption cross-sections for those elements that, because of abundances and ionization, appear to provide most of the total absorption coefficient in this region of the spectrum - that is, for silicon, magnesium, and alumi- nium. Table I summarizes these cross-sections. The column labeled 'hydrogenic' con- tains those values calculated from Kramer's formula with an effective nuclear charge (cf. UNSOLD, 1955); although manifestly unreliable for low-lying levels, they never- theless provided some rough indication about possibly important absorbers, and hence furnished considerable incentive for the laboratory work carried out last year by RICH (1966, 1967). The column labeled 'quantum defect' contains those values calculated by various workers who have used BURGESS and SEATON'S (1960) quantum- defect method.

Comparison of Two LTE Models with Observations If we adopt photospheric abundances (GOLDBERG, MULLER, and ALLER, 1960) and if we assume, perhaps naively, that local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) holds throughout these regions in the high photosphere and low chromosphere, we can calculate the ultraviolet flux and limb darkening for a specified temperature distri- bution. We have carried out such computations with a computer program described elsewhere by GINGERICH (1961, 1963). We assume that the outer atmosphere is in hydrostatic equilibrium. Figure 1 compares the results of three such LTE-flux calculations with data from a rocket experiment by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. The three models we use for purposes of illustration are the Utrecht Reference Model, designated 'Utrecht', the Mutschlecner model (MULLER and MUTSCHLECNER, 1964), and the Bilderberg Continuum Atmosphere (BCA). We include all the known significant sources of opacity: the bound-free metallic and silicon cross-sections (experimental values when- ever available), neutral hydrogen, H-, and Hi (GINGERICH, 1964), the quasi-H 2 molecule (SOLOMON, 1964), and Rayleigh scattering. The discontinuities in the calcu- lated continuum result from the idealized metallic and silicon photo-ionization edges. The most striking feature of this figure is the jump at 1680 A due to the 1 D edge of excited silicon. Although its discontinuity does not appear in the comparatively rough data of DETWILER etal. (1961), which have been averaged over 50-A intervals, it is clearly visible in the 1962 rocket spectrum (Figure 2).

Hence, in the region above 1680 A, where absorption lines distort the continuum level, the true continuum should be significantly higher than the experimental data shown, whereas in the region below 1680 A the converse applies. Consequently, if the lines could have been eliini- nated from the photometry, a small discontinuity would appear in the observed continuum. (Similarly, the silicon ground-state emission edge at 1525 A does not show in the coarse photometry, but is clearly seen upon inspection of the 1962 rocket spectrum.) Nevertheless, the predicted discontinuity of two orders of magnitude at 1680 A is too large. The blanketing by the stronger silicon and iron lines on the red ward side of this edge, as well as very many CO lines, can probably amount to only about half an order of magnitude. One important reason that the discontinuity is so large is that a substantial amount of flux arises from deeper layers because of the rapid in- crease in the Planck function in this wavelength region. Hence, an absorption that plays only a minor role elsewhere might be important in this limited spectral region from 1680 A to 1800 A. For example, absorption from quasi-molecular hydrogen has a small but noticeable effect on the predicted continuum. In all models calculated the SCI 1 S jump at 1980 A and the All jump at 2071 A appear to be of about the same magnitude, yet the observations indicate a significant discontinuity only for the aluminum at about A 2085. This fact may have an expla- nation through a number of non-model effects (such as inadequate observations, cross-section and abundance errors, or a misidentification of the absorber at 2071 A"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"86 OWEN GINGERICH AND JOHN C.

Table II summarizes qualitatively the limb darkening and limb brightening pre- dicted by three models at three representative wavelengths. Obviously, the new Bilderberg Continuum Atmosphere is more satisfactory than the previous models. The Utrecht Reference Model predicts limb brightening at 1600 A, contrary to obser- vations, and the extrapolated Mutschlecner model does not predict limb brightening or an emmision edge at 1500 A, again contrary to the observations. 4. Requirements for a Model Of all the ultraviolet spectrum, the region between 1525 A and 1680 A is the most important for the interpretation of the solar temperature minimum. The absorption coefficients show that if any section of the ultraviolet continuum arises primarily from the temperature minimum, this is it. Furthermore, the fact that this region shows neither pronounced limb darkening nor pronounced limb brightening strength- ens this interpretation. Because of the great strength of the silicon absorption, optical depth unity corre- sponds to around T5000=0.001, and therefore the temperature minimum must extend farther out than represented, for example, in the Utrecht model. In other words, the temperature minimum must be rather broad, perhaps constant from T 5000 = 10 - 3 to 10- 4 ; otherwise, the models will predict limb brightening in the region. The radiation temperature for this region, as measured by the NRL group, is 4700 OK. If the measured continuum is raised by emission lines, the radiation temper- ature for the true continuum would be somewhat less. The minimum temperature could actually be somewhat lower than the radiation temperature of this region, provided that significant additional radiation were contributed both by the chromo- sphere and by the photosphere. On the other hand, if this critical region from 1680 A to 1525 A does have some limb brightening, then the spectrum could arise from the low chromosphere and"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"THE FAR ULTRAVIOLET SPECTRUM OF THE SUN 87 redwards of 1680 A from the high photosphere. In that case, the temperature mini- mum could not be directly observed in the ultraviolet. The observational evidence is sufficiently ambiguous, so that this possibility cannot be ruled out. Clearly, it would be immensely desirable to have additional calibrated spectrum and limb observations in this region, especially with somewhat higher resolution. Recently, PORTER, TILFORD, and WIDING (1967) have argued similarly for contrary reasons that nowhere in the ultraviolet solar spectrum does the continuum arise from the region of the temperature minimum. They believe that the presence of CO band heads in absorption in the 1680-A to 1525-A region requires that this spectrum be formed in deeper and hotter photospheric layers. Since the CO lines can be formed by scattering, this argument has not convinced us, particularly in view of the heavy silicon absorption in this region. Unless the first excited level of silicon is enormously depleted by some sort of non-LTE mechanism, it is difficult to construct any reason- able model in which the continuum in this region can arise from a layer as deep as the upper photosphere. Because the analysis of the calcium Hand K lines by various investigators working independently indicates a minimum temperature in the vicinity of 4100 OK, we must now inquire whether such a low minimum is compatible with any interpretation of this spectral region. It would apparently require that the NRL calibration of 4700 OK as the radiation temperature near 1600 A is in error for some unknown reason. Note that at 1600 A a change from 4700 OK to 4200 OK in the radiation temperature corre- sponds to an order of magnitude decrease in the emergent flux. But a further difficulty arises in explaining the intensity of the carbon monoxide lines. The amount of carbon monoxide depends particularly critically on temperature around 4500 OK, and even if the minimum is 45000K the weakness of the CO lines above 1680 A (RICH, 1966) or in the infrared (NEWKIRK, 1966) can hardly be accounted for. With a minimum temperature of 4100 OK, the CO spectrum would be entirely inexplicable. Within the assumptions of the present models, a satisfactory interpretation of the ultraviolet spectrum can be reached with a temperature minimum of 4600 OK ± 100 OK.

In order to obtain a better agreement between observed and computed values of the solar intensity, an improved temperature distribution is deduced for the range 0.02 < '[0 < 10. The intensity observations here considered refer to the wavelength region between l 1980 and l 129500, and the center-limb variations generally go down to cosO = 0.1. The improved model, given in Figure 4 and Table II, differs rather little from the Utrecht 1964 model, used here as a reference. It appears necessary to introduce an empirical correction function to be applied to the continuous absorption coefficient. This function was derived for the spectral region between 2000 and 130000 A; it is shown in Figure 5. Furthermore, an extension of the model (1.10- 7 < '[0< 2.10- 2 ) is deduced (see Table III and Figure 8), which reasonably well represents the observations of the ultraviolet solar flux (ll 900- 1700 A). 1.

Figure 3a shows the results for the average column; points belonging to the same wavelength are joined. We note a very large scattering (0.81 < T;/Tm< 1.08) in the region 0.01 < '00 < 3. However, points corresponding to the wavelength region AA 4200-7000 are situated in a relatively narrow region 0.99-1.05 (see Figure 3b) and a rather close belt appears. We next assume that the observations in the wavelength range 4200-7000 A are the best, and that those in the other wavelength regions are influenced by a systematic effect. We assume that this effect occurs in the absorption coefficients, and in the next section we shall try to determine an empirical correction function to the absorption coefficient for wavelengths outside the region 4200-7000 A. On the basis of this assumption, we can draw a mean curve through the obser- vations referring to AA 4200-7000 A (this is the thick broken line in Figure 3a), and so obtain an improved temperature distribution (Figure 4), which differs little (less than 3%) from the D.R.P. model distribution.

If our hypothesis is correct, it will, hence, be necessary to explain why the absorption coefficient must be changed in this way: this may be a task for theoretical physics. We may conclude that there is a very good agreement between observed and computed values of the solar intensity, from AA 2000 up to 129500 A, when using an improved solar model, not very different from the u.R.P. 64 model, with absorption coefficients corrected as indicated above. 5.

Only the total radiation flux (and not the specific intensity) has been well recorded in this part of the solar spectrum down to 900 A. Nevertheless, the true continuous flux at ,,1,< 1300 A is rather difficult to determine, owing to the presence of the Lyman CI. line and other emission lines. Figure 7 shows the wavelength dependence of 10g!A, the solar flux at earth; circles represent ALLEN'S (1963) summary (the dominating resonance lines are excluded from!A and the radiation from the other lines is smoothed) and the dashed curve corresponds to the observations given in graphical form by TOUSEY (1963).

Figure 7 shows the theoretical curves of the solar flux computed for three recent solar models: the Utrecht Reference Photosphere (HEINTZE, HUBENET, and DE JAGER, 1964), MULLER and MUTSCHLECNER'S (1964) model, and HOLWEGER'S (1967) model (see Figure 8 for the temperature distributions). In order to compute the flux at short wavelengths, it has been found necessary somewhat to extrapolate the two last men- tioned models: if we assume a uniform temperature near '0=0 (4605 or 3900 0 K), the corresponding flux at the smallest A-values is Planckian: fA = n(~y·B\"(T). We note that between 900 and 1700 A none of the computed flux distributions agrees completely with the observations: Holweger's and Mutschlecner's models give far too small values (some orders of magnitude) of the flux (except at A> 1500 A); whereas that computed for the Utrecht model is slightly too large (except near 1000 A). We next assume that the disagreement between the observed and computed values of the solar flux is only due to uncertainties in the temperature distribution and not to errors in the adopted continuous absorption coefficient (BODE, 1965), and we shall try to derive an empirical temperature distribution which' better represents the observations. F or such empirical models, we first assume that the temperature model above the minimum (Tmin =0.02) obeys the following law: T(To) = TOlin + a (log Tmin -logTo), where various values between 0 and 200 0 K are chosen for the parameter a, whereas below the minimum (TO >0.02), we maintained the Utrecht temperature model.

(Received 24 October, 1967) Abstract. The Bilderberg Continuum Atmosphere fails to reproduce the observed limb-darkening throughout the range of wavelengths 4500 A < A < 25000 A. The temperature-pressure diagram for the deep layers of this model is a curve which is flatter than the relation predicted from the mixing length theory. A modification of the Bilderberg Continuum Atmosphere that improves representation of the observations and theoretical results is proposed. 1. Introduction The Bilderberg Continuum Atmosphere at the depth range of 0.1\";; 1: 5000\";; 10 has unfortunately been based on an average over several temperature distributions rather than on an optimum fitting of the observed limb-darkening over a large wavelength range. It is evident in Figure 1 that the adopted procedure leads to an unsatisfactory graduation of the best available measurements of limb-darkening for a range of wavelengths restricted to 4500 A < A < 25 000 A. 2. Observational Basis References to all known measurements of limb-darkening have been appended in a special section of this paper. These have been critically reviewed before the start of the present work. In order to compare observations made at different values of fl = cos e, a set of five limb distances was selected for which all limb-darkening obser- vations were interpolated. It was found practical to interpolate the log [I ifl)/Ii1)] as a linear function of log fl. The data from the various observers were then plotted against wavelength. Whenever systematic differences were found, the observing tech- niques and possible sources of errors have been investigated. If the proper information was missing the observations were rejected. As a result one gains the impression that the extensive and careful photoelectric measurements by PIERCE (1954), obtained with the Snow telescope at Mt. Wilson, can be considered the best after proper correction for scattered light (DAVID and ELSTE, 1962). Up to about 15000 A PEYTURAUX'S (1952, ] 955) observations agree with these within t of 1%. This is quite good consider- ing the lower spectral purity available, and the fact that nothing is known about the scattered light. Towards longer wavelengths Peyturaux's measurements lie system- atically up to 1 % below those of Pierce as well as PIERCE et al. (1950). All three of these observational sets are used in Figure l. * The work described here was supported in part by Contract N(onr)-1224(l9) with the Office of Naval Research."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"COMMENTS ON THE BILDERBERG CONTINUUM ATMOSPHERE 1.0 ,----,----,---,-----,-----,-----,---r-.----r-r-,---,--,--,-, 1.0 .9 .8 .7 .6 . 5 .4 3000 I,.<cos$o) 1,,0.0) r ~ .

Semi-Empirical Solar Models Explaining the observed limb-darkening and energy distribution is not the only con- dition which we may impose on a model. We know from sufficient observational evidence that the hydrogen convection zone lies below the photosphere. Therefore it is reasonable to require for the deep layers that the model atmosphere should behave in the temperature-pressure diagram as the theory predicts for the transition region between photosphere and convection zone. Mrs. BOHM-VITENSE (1958) has calculated such diagrams with the help of the mixing length theory for stars of different effective temperature and luminosity. A model constructed on this basis was reported at the meeting of the 'Deutsche Astronomische Gesellschaft' at Weimar in 1960 (ELsTE, 1960). Instead of solving simultaneously for both the temperature model and the wavelength dependence of"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"108 GUNTHER ELSTE the optical depth r). by employing an analytic method, the theoretically computed absorption coefficient was used to calculate the optical-depth scales. Since this pro- cedure requires knowledge of the pressures, they first were determined by the inte- gration of the hydrostatic equation, to be discussed later. The remaining steps follow standard procedures. Starting from the model published by GOLDBERG and PIERCE (1959) further improvements were obtained by repeated trials. Herein the contribution curves for the continuum emission, i.e., the integrands of the expressions for the specific intensity, served as indicators for the sensitivity range of the limb-darkening at each wavelength. As can be seen in Figure 2 for a few samples, the shapes of the contribution curves, their positions at the disk center, and their shifts with cos () depend on the wavelength. Thus, by sounding out the atmosphere with probes of different widths this procedure allows to use the whole information content of the measurements with advantage. For this first model, called No.9, the energy distribution at the center of the solar disk has been taken from the measurements by LABS (1957) made at the Pic-du-Midi. MATTIG and SCHROTER (1961) have used this model in a successful explanation of the center-to-limb variation of the wings of the Na D-lines.

The high excitation energy of the second quantum state of hydrogen prevents a contribution to the line absorp- tion in the wings of these lines except from very deep layers around \"C = 3. Moreover, the contribution functions are rather sharp as compared with those for the continuum emission. Therefore these lines offer a possibility for checking the model in the tran- sition region to the hydrogen convection zone, which otherwise is not accessible for continuum observations in the visible. After completion of the new determination of the energy distribution at the disk center by LABS and NECKEL (1962, 1963, 1967) a small correction in e = 5040jT had to be applied, which then led to model 10 (ELSTE, 1967). Actually this difference is too small to affect the line spectrum appreciably. Mugglestone used it for the wings of the Na D-lines, WITHBROE (1967) for the profiles of the lines of the CH molecule, WITHBROE (1968) for the center-to-limb variation of the equivalent widths of C 2 , CH, CN, CO, and MgH lines, and ELSTE (1967) for the investigation of the micro- and macroturbulence. The models so far had been computed for a helium-to-hydrogen ratio of 0.16, and the abundances of the remaining elements according to GOLDBERG et al. (1960). But since (i) the calculations for the internal structure of the sun favor a lower value for the helium-to-hydrogen ratio of about 0.1, and (ii) the investigation of the ultraviolet spectrum points towards a temperature stratification of the outer photosphere as given in the Bilderberg Continuum Atmosphere, corresponding changes have been intro- duced in the model here proposed. 4. Discussion Although not yet ideal the new model represents an improvement with respect to the Bilderberg model in both the limb-darkening and the behaviour in the temperature- pressure diagram (Figure 3) for the transition region between the photosphere and the hydrogen convection zone. The best reference curve for the latter is that obtained by KOHL (1967) for the chemical composition used by V ARDYA (1964) with He/H = 0.125. It can be noticed that the Bilderberg model uses too low temperatures in the deepest layers, while the proposed model follows more closely in its depth dependence the curve by Kohl. For the discussion of the limb-darkening we have plotted in Figure 1 as dots the observedI .. (J.l)/I;'(l) for certain representative values of J.l=cos e as a function of 1/J... The relations predicted by the Bilderberg model and by the proposed model are drawn as full and broken lines, respectively. In addition to the values for the limb- darkening, attention should be directed to the almost constant gradient d[I .. (J.l)/!.,(I)] d (1/J..) for a fixed value of J.l.

For the discussion of the infrared observations where the differences are becoming small, let us look at the situation for f1 = 0.6 in more detail in Figure 4. At this limb distance the influence of the finite resolving power of the telescopes used by the different observers is not yet significant. At about 23000 A the observed points lie between the lines for the two models, but at longer wavelengths both models predict too small intensity ratios. Judging from the quite good agreement between the three different observational sets, PIERCE et al. (1950), SAIEDY (1960), and LENA (1968), the observations should not be responsible for the discrepancy. It may be mentioned, however, that the inhomogeneities could provide a key to understanding of at least part of the remaining differences. Some are hard to explain just by additional unidentified absorbers. Let us finally compare the predicted energy distributions at the center of the solar disk with the observations. For this purpose the observations by LABS and NECKEL (1967) have been combined with the relative measurements by PIERCE (1954b) in the infrared and with the other absolute measurements by PEYTURAUX (1952) and by SAIEDY (1960).

LAMBERT Dept. of Astrophysics, University Observatory, Oxford (Received 19 June, 1967) Abstract. A simplified representation of the temperature distribution in the solar photosphere is proposed: () (TO) = ()o - ()llogTO. An expression is derived for the emergent continuous spectrum from the simple model. The limitations and applications of the simple model are discussed. 1. Introduction With an electronic computer the emergent continuous spectrum may be rapidly and accurately calculated for a given model solar atmosphere. By a process of trial and error a model providing the optimum fit to any observations can be readily obtained. The possibility of machine computation renders redundant a variety of approximate methods for deriving a model atmosphere from observations. However, in the course of a detailed investigation of the solar continuous spectrum, an approximate re- presentation for the photospheric temperature distribution was discovered, which enabled a fuller understanding of certain aspects of the machine calculations to be obtained. Two model atmospheres (HEINTZE et at., 1964; LAMBERT, 1965) are displayed in Figure 1. By inspection it i.s seen that to a certain approximation the temperature distribution may be written in the form (1) where 8 = 5040/T, and To is the optical depth at the standard wavelength Ito = 5000 A. In Figure 1 the model described by 8 0 =0.770 and 8 1 = 0.222 is drawn. It may be noted that the Utrecht Reference Photosphere (URP) is apparently well represented by Equation (1) throughout the interval-1.5:O:::; log TO:O:::; + 0.5. It is these layers which are responsible for the continuous spectrum for It;:;; 3 microns and at disk positions cos c/J ~ 0.2. The applications of Equation (1) are explored in this paper. 2.

Its limitations are revealed by a consideration of the observations longward of about 1 micron. The continuous absorption coefficient is defined by p;. and q).o The limb darkening is predicted to be independent of P;.. Since q;.>O the limb intensities are predicted to be greater than the corresponding values for q;. =0. The reverse is shown to be the case (see Figure 3). This discrepancy suggests that a more detailed model is required. The predicted intensities for the URP and Lambert model are plotted in Figure 3. The differences between these predictions and those for the simple model (}1 =0.222 correspond to small temperature differences. For example, the URP predictions for A ~ 0.9 microns (A; 1 ~ 1.0) are about 2 to 3% less than simple model predictions. This is largely attributable to an increased slope in the URP model between about 10g't\"o=0 and-1.5 (see Figure 1). 4. Applications of the Simplified Model It is clear that the simple model cannot be expected to predict sufficiently accurately the limb darkening over a wide range of wavelengths. However, it may be expected to prove sufficiently reliable for an assessment of differential corrections arising from errors in the absorption coefficients. Machine calculations demonstrated that the predicted limb-darkening for A <2.5 microns was insensitive to the assumed set of theoretical H- absorption coefficients. The original calculations by CHANDRASEKHAR and BREEN (1946) and the later ones by OHMURA (1964) differ by approximately 50%. Yet, the limb-darkening predictions differ by less than 0.5%. This insensitivity is predicted by the simple model. According to Equation (8) the limb-darkening is independent of a straight increase (or change in P;. in Equation (5) in the absorption coefficient, and insensitive to changes in the temperature dependence (or q;.). Clearly, the limb-darkening observations at these wavelengths are an unsatis- factory test of the continuous absorption-coefficient calculations. These calculations can be checked only by comparison with the absolute intensity observations (see Equation (7».

For the absolute intensity observations by LABS and NECKEL (1961) an accuracy of about 2.5% is claimed. These measurements extend to about 1.2 microns. The accurate relative measurements by PIERCE (1954) can be used to extend the absolute measurements to about 2.5 microns with an overall uncertainty"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"124 D. L. LAMBERT of about 3%. The estimates based on the simple model indicate that with these measurements the accuracy of present calculations of the H - absorption coefficient might be assessed. Although the simple model cannot predict sufficiently accurately the observed continuous spectrum, it can provide accurate estimates for certain differential cor- rections. It is for this latter purpose that the model is presented. It is hoped that it may also be of use in problems associated with the Fraunhofer lines. References CHANDRASEKHAR, S. and BREEN, F.

MOLLER Observatoire de Geneve, Switzerland and BODO BASCHEK and HARTMUT HOLWEGER Inst. fur Theor. Phys. und Sternw., University of Kiel, Germany (Received 2 June, 1967) Abstract. Several lines of neutral oxygen observed at various positions on the solar disk were used to study the influence of (1) the temperature distribution, (2) the velocity field, and (3) the damping on the line profiles and the abundance of oxygen in the photosphere. Theoretical profiles were calculated on the basis of four different model atmospheres in LTE. It was found that the model proposed by HOLWEGER (1967) best reproduced the center-to-limb observations of the lines studied. The weighted mean of the oxygen abundance turned out to be logeo = 8.83 on the basis of 10geR = 12.00. 1. Introduction In recent years several new photospheric models have been proposed which differ both by the temperature and the turbulence distributions. The first question that arises is which of the models will best reproduce the observed line shapes and, hence, may be used for the determination of the chemical composition of the photosphere. Secondly one may ask whether or not the differences in the proposed models seriously affect the abundance of the elements in the photosphere. It is clear that answers to these questions can only be given after having analysed many lines formed in quite different atmospheric depths. As a start we have chosen the lines of neutral oxygen, because in the solar spectrum both low and high-excitation 01 lines are observed. The high-excitation lines (around 10 e V) are permitted transitions. Some of them are of medium strength, the others are very faint. The low-excitation lines are forbidden transitions. They are very faint and are 0 or 2 e V lines. Thus, although not many 0 I lines occur in the solar spectrum, they originate in quite different photospheric layers. Their analysis may give some insight as to the validity of some of the photospheric models recently proposed. 2. Observations For our analysis we have selected the medium strong infrared triplet at A 7774 and A 8446 A, two faint permitted lines near A 6157 A, and three faint forbidden lines at AA 6364,6300, and 5577 A. The photoelectric spectrograms were kindly secured for us by Dr. R. Teske with the vacuum spectrograph of the McMath-Hulbert Observatory. The spectrograph was used in the single pass arrangement. The observations were made at the following positions on the solar disk: p, = 1.0,0.7,0.5,0.4, and 0.3."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"126 EDITH A. MULLER, DODO BASCHEK, AND HARTMUT HOLWEGER The local continuum was drawn in the usual manner through the highest intensity level in the neighbourhood of the lines in question. The dispersion on the tracings is about 60 mm/A for the stronger lines and about 130 mm/A for the fainter lines. The observed profiles were corrected for stray light, using a stray-light correction of s=2.5% estimated by MOHLER (1963). The stray-light correction was applied in the following way: Let I; be the observed intensity in percent of the continuum. Then the true intensity in percent of the continuum will be given by: I; - s 1,,=--- 100 - s The reduction of the observed lines was done by means of a two-dimensional measuring engine. A mean profile was then derived from the two to four observations of each line at any given position on the solar disk. Since no appreciable systematic asymmetry was detected in the profiles of the .Ie 7774 triplet, the violet and the red side of each line was averaged. The profiles of the faint lines are not as well defined as those of the stronger lines. Tracing noise, uncertainties in the location of the con- tinuum, and disturbances by neighbouring lines make it difficult to obtain a reliable profile of a very faint line. Out of the five faint 01 lines we selected the two best ones for which the profiles at 11 = 1.0 and 0.3 appeared to be reasonably well established. They are the .Ie 6158 and the A 6300 lines. The latter line was observed by SWINGS (1966) with the Liege spectrograph at the Jungfraujoch Scientific Station. Its profile observed at the center of the solar disk agrees very well with the corresponding profile reduced from the McMath-Hulbert tracings. The equivalent widths were measured both with a planimeter and by integration of the profiles registered with the two-dimensional measuring engine. Both results are in excellent agreement. The random scatter of the equivalent widths due to different tracings is of the order of 2% for the .Ie 7774 triplet lines and about 5% for the A 8446 triplet lines. Near the limb (11 = 0.3) the scatter is only slightly larger. The random scatter of the equivalent widths of the fainter lines is larger, due to the fact that a small displacement ofthe local continuum appreciably affects the measured equivalent width. The scatter between individual measurements of the faint lines is of the order of 10% and, in some instances, may reach 20%. SWINGS' (1966) compilation gives an idea of the scatter in equivalent widths of the forbidden [01] lines measured by different authors. In Table I the observed equivalent widths and central depths at the five selected positions on the solar disk have been collected. The values followed by a double point (:) are uncertain, due to the relatively large random scatter of the individual observa- tions. The central depths are given only for those lines for which profiles were analysed. The lines of the triplet transition at .Ie 8446 have very similar wavelengths and, hence, form a blend in which only two absorption lines are clearly visible. These two lines have been listed in Table I with their corresponding central depths. The equivalent width was measured for the entire blend. It is interesting to note that the two faint permitted lines display a center-limb behaviour similar to the stronger 01"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"CENTER-TO-LIMB ANALYSIS OF THE SOLAR OXYGEN LINES 127 TABLE I Observed equivalent widths and central depths of the oxygen lines at various positions on the solar disk (stray light correction was applied) WA(mA) ro(%) A Il = 1.0 0.7 0.5 0.4 0.3 Il = 1.0 0.7 0.5 0.4 0.3 7771.95 88.0 79.5 70.0 65.0 59.5 33.1 29.9 26.9 25.8 23.9 7774.18 71.0 63.5 56.5 52.5 48.0 29.9 26.5 23.7 22.0 20.4 7775.39 54.0 47.5 41.0 37.5 33.5 24.8 21.5 18.6 18.3 15.5 8446.38* ~ 147 133 120 113.5 106 30.3 26.6 24.0 23.1 22.1 8446.76* 16.8 13.7 11.2 10.3 9.0 6156.80 4.9: 4.1 : 3.7: 3.5: 3.4: 6158.17 5.0 3.0 2.3 2.0 2.0 3.1 1.8 6363.81 1.8: 1.9: 2.2: 2.5: 3.1 : 6300.31 4.3 4.7 5.2 5.5 5.7 3.8 4.5 5577.34 3.2: 3.7: 4.0: 4.1 : 4.6: * See discussion of this blend in Section 4.D. lines. This is to be expected, since they are also high-excitation lines. Their equivalent widths decrease from center to limb. In contrast, the equivalent widths of the low- excitation forbidden lines increase from center to limb. For all lines the variation of the equivalent width across the solar disk follows a remarkably smooth curve, as is shown in Figure 1 for the strong lines and in Figure 2 for the faint lines. Recently DE JAGER and NEvEN (1967) published center-to-limb profiles of the 01 triplet at A 7774, observed with the Liege spectrograph at the Jungfraujoch Scientific Station. Their profiles (averaged over the violet and the red side) are in good agree- ment with our observations, except for the wings, which they observe to be appreciably deeper. Consequently, their equivalent widths are greater than ours by about 20% at the disk's center. For comparison with our measurements we include in Figure 1 the center-to-limb variation of the equivalent widths as measured by De Jager and Neven (dashed lines). Their results do not follow a smooth curve. Our observed profiles are presented in Figures 3-12 by a solid line. 3. Theory and Numerical Computations The theoretical line profiles and the abundances were derived for the following atmospheric models: Mutschlecner's model (see MULLER and MUTSCHLECNER, 1964); the Utrecht Reference Model (HEINTZE, HUBENET, and DE JAGER, 1964); HEINTZE'S (1965) model; and the HOLWEGER (1967) model. Essentially, these four models differ by (a) the value of the temperature minimum T min , (b) the extent in optical depth f min at which the temperature minimum occurs, and (c) the variation of the micro- turbulence with depth. These three characteristics ofthe atmospheric models employed are presented in columns 2, 3, and 4 of Table II respectively. Only the average column of the Utrecht Reference Model (URM) was considered, i.e. the atmospheric in- homogeneities as described by the three columns in the URM were neglected."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"128 100 80 60 EDITH A.

For the profile computations the following basic assumptions were made: (1) the atmosphere is homogeneous and plane-parallel; (2) the lines are formed under conditions of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE); (3) the macroturbulence is neglected. We made use of the fine analysis program of BASCHEK, HOLWEGER, and TRAVING (1966), by which a direct integration of intensities is performed in order to obtain the line profile. The abundances were derived by an iterative procedure fitting the com- puted equivalent widths to the observed ones. Details of the physical and numerical methods are described by Baschek et al. We carried out the numerical computations at Kiel (Xl) and Hamburg (TR4) in ALGOL and at Geneve (CDC 6600) in the corresponding FORTRAN translation by Peytremann (see PEYTREMANN et al., 1967). The computations are based on the line data collected in Table IV.

The loggfvalues (column 4) of the permitted lines were obtained with the Coulomb approximation and LS coupling (see GOLDBERG, MULLER, and ALLER, 1960), and for the forbidden lines the loggfvalues of GARSTANG (1951) were used. The last column of Table IV lists the logarithm of the interaction constants C 6 , due to van der Waals broadening. The values of C 6 were derived with UNSOLD'S (1955) approximation: 32 [( 13.6)2 (13.6 )2J C 6 = 1.61 x 10- ~- - ~- X - Xu X - Xl where X is the ionisation potential of 01 and Xu and Xl represent the excitation potentials of the upper and lower levels respectively. It should be noted that here the interaction constants are defined by the relation Llw = Cdri Llw being the angular frequency shift and r the relative distance of the two colliding particles. The broadening due to electron collisions is small compared to the broad- ening by van der Waals forces. Nevertheless, the damping due to collisions with electrons was taken into account in the computations of the strong lines. The inter- action constants, C 4 , employed are those given by HUNGER (1960),i.e.log C 4 = -14.46 for multiplet 1 and logC 4 = -14.35 for multiplet 4. In order to compare directly the observed and the theoretical profiles, we have folded the latter with ELSTE'S (1964) provisional instrumental profile of the McMath- Hulbert vacuum spectrograph.

This clearly demonstrates the influence of the sharp temperature minimum proposed in Heintze's model at the depths that contribute most to the cores of these lines. The central emission is due to the rapidly increasing temperature in the higher layers. For illustration the profiles based on the Heintze model are included in Figures 3 and 4 corresponding to fI-= 1.0 and 0.7. In contrast to Heintze's model the three other models on the whole reproduce the shape of the observed profiles reasonably well. This is due to the fact that all three models exhibit a similar temperature distribution in the most important regions for the formation of these lines. Some differences are noticed, however, between the profiles computed with the three models. For all three lines and at all values of fI- the URM predicts central depths which are too low compared to the observations. Consequently, the profiles based on the URM appear too steep. The main cause of this behaviour is the small value of the turbulence given in the URM for the deeper layers. Both the Holweger and the Mutschlecner models reproduce the observed profiles equally well at fI-= 1.0. Towards the limb the profiles obtained with the Holweger model fit the observations just as well as at the disk's center, whereas the central depths computed with Mutschlecner's model become too deep.

The Turbulence Field In order to gain insight into the question of the microturbulence variation with depth, we combined the temperature and pressure distributions proposed by HOLWEGER (1967) with different microturbulence distributions, such as (A) an anisotropic but depth-independent turbulence, or (B) an isotropic turbulence which increases with height. In case (A) the value of the depth-independent turbulence was chosen such that it corresponds to the value of Holweger's anisotropic and depth-dependent turbulence field at the approximate depth r* of the line-forming region. This depth may be defined as the r corresponding to 'rl +c/f1 = 1. The profile computations based on Holweger's model showed that for the triplet at }, 7774 seen on the disk's center the depth of line formation is r* = 0.20. At this depth the Holweger model gives a radial turbulence velocity of about (1'= 0.3 = 1.9 km/sec. Correspondingly, for f1 = 0.3 the turbulence velocity is about (1'=0.3 =2.4 km/sec. For case (B) we chose the isotropic turbulence increasing with height as proposed by the URM. Thus we computed the profiles of the lines at AA 7772, 7774, and 7775 A for the"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"CENTER-TO-LIMB ANALYSIS OF THE SOLAR OXYGEN LINES 135 7.(%) )1 = 0.4- \" 7772 A 7774- A 7775 / • ....• ' .......

The open circles are the results of case (A), i.e. ~/L=1.0 = 1.9 km/sec and ~/L=O.3 =2.4 km/sec. The crosses correspond to the results obtained with the URM turbulence distribution. For comparison we included in Figures 8 and 9 the theoretical profiles derived with Holweger's turbulence field (dots connected by a dashed line). The figures clearly show that if appropriate values of the depth-independent but anisotropic turbulence are chosen, the theoretical profiles of these lines reproduce the observed ones just as good as Holweger's turbulence field. The calculations yield an abundance difference of only 6% at the center and near the limb, the depth-independent turbulence requiring the larger value. In case (B) the turbulence given in the URM is relatively small, its value being about 1.1 km/sec for i* = 0.20. As a result the predicted profiles are too steep and the central depths too low. The abundance based on the URM turbulence distribution is up to 35% greater than the value found with Holweger's turbulence field. ~(~%)~ __ '- __ -' ____ -' __ ~~'- ____ r-~A __ =T'_·0 __ -'~~, ____ -r ____ '- __ ~~ }. 7772 ... ~ .- / x:' ,~' x: 10 20 30 0.1 0.2 0.3 0 .. \" 7774 0.1 0.2 0.3 .dA(A) 71 7775 , , t f 0,1 Xl X.' 0,2 Ho, 1.9 UR,.., 0.3 Fig. 8.

The calculations show that a turbulence which either remains constant or de- creases with height, requires an anisotropic turbulence field, in which the radial component is smaller than the horizontal component. If, however, the turbulence field is assumed to be isotropic, then the two different values of the turbulence - which are necessary to reproduce the profiles at the disk's center and near the limb - indicate that over a depth range of about i* = 0.20 to about 0.06 the turbulence must increase from 1.9 to about 2.4 km/sec. The variation of the turbulence with depth cannot be decided from calculations of lines of one multiplet only. Other lines formed in various different depths of the atmosphere must be analysed in order to obtain an indication as to the way the turbulence varies with depth. 3. The Damping As can be seen from Figures 3 to 9 all models predict profiles which are too flat in the outer wings compared to the observations. Accordingly, the theoretical halfwidths are larger than the observed ones, inasmuch as the computations are normalised to the observed equivalent widths. The flat theoretical wings suggest that, possibly, an inadequate damping factor was employed. Since for these lines the damping is mainly"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"138 EDITH A. MULLER, BODO BASCHEK, AND HARTMUT HOLWEGER due to van der Waals broadening, we computed a few profiles increasing the inter- action constant C 6 . We arbitrarily chose logC 6 = -30 instead of logC 6 = -30.88 obtained with Unsold's approximation and found an excellent agreement between the calculated and the observed profiles. For illustration we show, in Figure 3, by filled triangles the profile of A 7772 at f.1 = 1.0, calculated with the higher value of C 6 • Due to the increase of the van der Waals broadening the resulting abundance becomes smaller. The amount by which the abundance is lowered obviously depends on the strength of the line. When increasing C 6 by a factor of 7.6 the abundances obtained from the analysis of the A 7772, 7774, and 7775 A lines at f.1 = 1.0 are smaller by 15, 10, and 5% respectively than the corresponding values found with logC 6 = -30.88.

THE FAINT LINES As mentioned earlier, we have selected the better of the two faint permitted lines and the best of the three forbidden lines for the comparison of observed and theoretical profiles.

The center-limb behaviour ofthe A 6158 line confirms what was found for the A 7774 triplet. At .u = 1.0 the Holweger and the Mutschlecner models predict the observed line shape equally well. The URM requires a deeper central depth and, consequently, a steeper profile, thus reflecting the small value of the turbulence proposed by this model for the deeper layers. Towards the limb the line weakens appreciably. For such a very faint line of high excitation the theoretical profiles calculated with all three models coincide at .u = 0.3 and are in accord with the obser- vations. The faint forbidden line at A 6300 A, being a zero Volt line, originates in higher layers of the photosphere. Its center-limb behaviour is shown in Figure 11, the upper part corresponding to .u = 1.0, the lower to .u = 0.3. Within the uncertainty of the observations the models of Holweger, Mutschlecner or Utrecht reproduce the observed line shapes very well, both at the center and near the limb ofthe sun. We have included in Figure 11 the results obtained with the Heintze model. Whereas the profile pre- dicted by the Heintze model agrees with the others at the disk's center, it becomes deeper and, hence, steeper at .u = 0.3, as a consequence of the different temperature distribution proposed by this model in the relevant layers.

THE OXYGEN ABUNDANCE The oxygen abundance was derived by iteration from the observed equivalent widths of the three medium strong lines at A 7774 A and the five faint lines at all five selected positions on the solar disk. In Tables V, VI, and VII the individual results deduced from the models of Holweger, Mutschlecner, and Utrecht respectively, have been collected. They are normalised to the hydrogen abundance 10gsH= 12.00. The values followed by a double point (:) are uncertain results, due to the larger random scatter of the measured equivalent widths. The last column of each table lists the mean of logs of the abundances found for each line at the five positions across the solar disk.

This is true at all positions on the solar disk. The difference is similar for all three models and amounts to about 30% at J1 = 1.0 and about 40% at 1l=0.3. Secondly, we notice a systematic increase of the abundance from center to limb for all permitted lines, the effect being more pronounced for the very faint lines. Among the lines of medium strength the strongest line (A 7772) tends to have the greatest center-limb variation. For this line the Holweger and the Mutschlecner model yield a center-limb abundance difference which is about double the value of the abundance difference found between the strongest and the weakest of the triplet lines at J1 = 1.0. With the URM the center-limb difference of the triplet lines is smaller than the abundance difference between the strongest and the weakest of the three lines. The forbidden lines behave differently. The abundances derived from these lines either remain unchanged or tend to decrease from center to limb. For the best line, A 6300, the Holweger model yields a center-limb abundance decrease of about 30%. The other models give smaller variations. It should be pointed out that the abundance differences from center to limb or from stronger to fainter lines are all relatively small and remain within a factor of 2 (except for the uncertain results of the A 6157 line). The effects may be caused by various factors, such as uncertainties in the turbulence field (see Section 4.A.2), inadequate damping (see Section 4.A.3), temperature inhomogeneities, and obser- vational inaccuracies. The intercomparison of the last column in the Tables V to VII indicates that for the permitted lines the Holweger model yields the smallest, the Mutschlecner model the largest abundances. The greatest difference amounts to about 35%. In the case of the forbidden lines the Holweger model tends to give the largest, the URM the smallest abundances, but the differences are only 15% at the most. These effects clearly reflect"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"142 EDITH A. MULLER, BODO BASCHEK, AND HARTMUT HOLWEGER the differences in the temperature distribution and the turbulence field proposed by the three models. In the deeper atmospheric layers, where all three models have a similar temperature distribution, it is mainly the turbulence field which produces the abundance differences. Thus, the URM with its small turbulence in the deeper layers yields the largest abundance for the A 7774 triplet at J1 = 1.0. In higher layers both the temperature and the turbulence distributions differ in the three models and, therefore, both playa role in the abundance results obtained from the forbidden lines and from the permitted lines observed at J1=0.3. Finally, we derive an average abundance for each ofthe three models. We use the results derived from all lines and all positions on the solar disk. The results are weighted such that the uncertain values are given only half the weight. Thus, the weighted mean of the oxygen abundance is found to be 8.83, 8.90, and 8.87 (on the basis of 10ge H = 12.00) for the models of Holweger, Mutschlecner or Utrecht re- spectively. It is interesting to note that the three results differ by less than 20%, although the three models propose a different physical structure of the photosphere. Since the Holweger model best reproduces the observed profiles of the strong and the faint 0 I lines both at the center and near the limb, we consider logeo = 8.83 the most reliable result of the photospheric oxygen abundance. The oxygen abundance determined by GOLDBERG, MULLER, and ALLER (1960), corrected by ZWAAN (1962) for an inadequate electron pressure, is loge o = 8.86, in close agreement with the results obtained here. D. THE BLEND AT A 8446 A The blend at A 8446 A is composed of three lines corresponding to the triplet transition 3s 3sO - 3p 3p. As mentioned earlier, two of the lines, i.e. A 8446.26 and A 8446.38, lie very close together and are not resolved in the spectrograms. The third line, A 8446.76, lies far enough on the redward side to be resolved but not far enough to be entirely separated from the main component of the triplet. The observed blend is shown in Figure 12 by the solid line. For an abundance determination this blend is not suitable. Instead, we may employ the mean abundance derived from the other neutral oxygen lines to compute the profile of the blend. We restricted ourselves to the Holweger model and, accordingly introduced the oxygen abundance loge o = 8.83 into the calculations. As a result it was found that the central intensity ratio of the two main components was not in accord with the observations. The calculations yielded 1.2 for the A 8446.38/8446.76 central intensity ratio, whereas the observations indicate a ratio of 1.8. This discrepancy cannot be accounted for by an effect of the model. Likewise it cannot be due to incorrect relative I-values, since these are obtained by means of the J-file sum rule which is independent of coupling. Furthermore, RICHTER and HAAG (1967) made a high-frequency dis- charge experiment and determined the intensity ratio in question. Their measurements confirmed the theoretical f-value ratio. Therefore, the discrepancy can only be"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"CENTER-TO-LIMB ANALYSIS OF THE SOLAR OXYGEN LINES 10·· 20 )'I' = 1.0 30 -.4 -.2 . ..

According to the recently published Solar Spectrum Wavelengths (MOORE, MrNNAERT, and HOUTGAST, 1966) the following two Fer lines might be expected to occur in the blend: A 8446.42 of multiplet 1272 and A 8446.56 of multiplet 1267. On high -dispersion laboratory spectra of neutral iron RICHTER and HAAG (1967) confirmed the presence of an Fer line of multiplet 1272, which has a wavelength of A 8446.40. The predicted Fer line of multiplet 1267 is not detectable. The f-value of the A. 8446.40 line was measured on these spectra by Miss Haag. Reduced to the abso- lute scale given by CORLISS and WARNER (1964) it becomes loggf= -0.27. The lower excitation potential of the line is Xl = 4.97 e V.

With this value for the iron abundance the Holweger model predicts an equivalent width of 40 rnA for the Fer line at A 8446.40 A ifit appeared unblended in the solar spectrum. Knowing all the relevant data concerning the Fer line at ), 8447.40 A it is possible to compute the blend composed of the three Or lines and the one Fer line. The theoretical profile (folded with the instrumental profile) based on the Holweger model is shown in Figure 12 by the dots. The two main absorption features now have central intensities, which are in accord with the observations. The calculated ), 8446.38/ 8446.76 central intensity ratio is 1.8, which is just what is observed. The wings of the theoretical profile, however, do not reproduce the observed blend correctly. The theoretical profile is too steep and, thus, the deviations from the observed blend become more pronounced further out in the wings and in the intermediate region between the two main absorption features. Part of these differences may be accounted for by additional faint lines occurring in the blend. Also, an inadequate damping and the temperature inhomogeneities may play a role. The blend is to be investigated further. 5. Conclusions The analysis of the lines of neutral oxygen revealed that Holweger's temperature distribution, together with his proposed anistropic turbulence which decreases with height, best reproduces the observations. The profiles predicted by the Mutschlecner model are in good agreement with the observed line shapes at f1 = 1.0, but reveal some differences with the limb observations on account of the isotropic turbulence assumed in this model. The URM produces profiles of the high-excitation lines which are too deep and too steep due to the low turbulence proposed for the greater photospheric depths. The sharp temperature minimum of the Heintze model occurring relatively deep in the photosphere produces line profiles with central emission cores. From the oxygen lines only, no definite conclusion can be drawn as to the increase or decrease of the turbulence with height. For this, further analyses are necessary of lines of other elements formed in different layers of the photosphere. The oxygen abundance based on the Holweger model turns out to be 10gBo = 8.83 relative to the hydrogen abun- dance which is set to be 10geH = 12.00. The abundance derived from the other models differ by less than 20% from this value. Our result is in very good agreement with the abundance determined by GOLDBERG, MULLER, and ALLER (1960) after applying ZWAAN'S (1962) correction which yields 10gBo = 8.86.

WITHBROE 3. Photospheric Models In interpreting the observations we shall use five recent photospheric models. The first of these, Elste's Model 10 (ELsTE, 1964, unpublished), was derived from an analysis of limb-darkening observations of the spectral continuum. The second model, that of MUTSCHLECNER (1963), is very similar to Model 10 and has been used to explain the center-limb behavior of lines of the iron group of elements (MULLER and MUTSCHLECNER, 1964). Both Elste and Mutschlecner proposed classical models in which the electron temperature decreases monotonically with decreasing optical depth. The third model, the Utrecht Reference Model (HEINTZE, HUBENET, and DE JAGER, 1964), has a temperature minimum located at T 5000 = 0.02. In the upper layers of the photosphere, T 5000 < 0.1, the Utrecht model is homogeneous while in the lower layers it is inhomogeneously multicolumnar. The fourth model, HEINTZE'S (1965), was developed from the Utrecht Reference Model and an analysis of limb- darkening observations made at the extreme limb during an eclipse.

Theory The center-limb behavior of the equivalent widths, W\"\" of the molecular lines was computed by the method of weighting functions. The appropriate formulae are given in an earlier paper (WITHBROE, 1967), hereafter called Paper 1. In Paper I we pointed out that CO formation seriously depletes the population of free carbon atoms in the upper layers of the photosphere. The computations discussed below allow for this. Unless otherwise stated we have used an isotropic microturbulence, which is inde- pendent of depth and has a magnitude of 1.4 km/sec, and have also assumed local thermodynamic equilibrium (L TE). This appears to be a fairly good first approxi- mation for molecular lines (e.g. NEWKIRK, 1957; COWLEY, 1964; WITHBROE, 1967). The theoretical equivalent widths for the three-stream model were evaluated from the equation, 3 I A i 'I i (/1)' W i (/1) w'\" = i=l 3'~-- (1) I A i 'IJ/1) i= 1 where Ai is the area of stream i, Ii is the intensity of the continuum in stream i, /1 = cos e, e is the angle of radiation flow measured from the outward normal to the atmospheric surface, and Wi is the equivalent width of a line formed in stream i. The relative areas of the hot, medium, and cool streams are respectively 1: 2: 1. Equation (1) is applicable only as long as the three streams can be considered independently. Near the limb we cannot make this assumption, since the observer's line-of-sight will pass through more than one column. That is, molecules in one column may absorb energy from the continuum formed in a neighboring column. If we assume that the columns have diameters comparable with the size of the solar granulation, about 700 km, then Equation (1) should be valid for /1~0.3. 5. The Excitation Temperature of C 2 and MgH NEWKIRK (1957), COWLEY (1964), and WITHBROE (1967) found that the excitation temperatures of CO, CN, and CH can be satisfactorily represented by the local electron temperatures in photospheric models similar to Model 10 or Mutschlecner's model. In order to see whether this is also the case for C 2 and MgH, I computed theoretical equivalent widths for lines of these two molecules, using Model 10. The C 2 and MgH lines are sufficiently weak that their equivalent widths are proportional to the number of molecules excited to the lower level of the transition responsible for the line. That is (2) where C is a constant, fJ is the rotational contribution to the oscillator strength, Ev is the vibrational energy of the lower level of the transition, Er is the rotational energy"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"150 GEORGE L.

The vibrational energy is the same for all lines in a given vibrational band and Er = hcBJ (J + 1) where B is a constant for all lines in a given band and J is the rotational quantum number. Therefore it follows from Equation (2) that heR log W;./fJ = constant - 0.43429448 kT J(J + I).

The theoretical line fits the observations very well, suggesting that the excitation temperature of the C z lines can be adequately represented by the photospheric local electron temperature. Figure 4 presents similar data for MgH. The agreement between the observations and the theoretical line is not as good as it is for C z . However, the MgH equivalent widths are so small, the order of 3 to 4 mA, that they may be in error by as much as 50%. Therefore, within the limits imposed by observational error, the theoretical line fits the observations. Thus, these results and those mentioned earlier provide evidence that the exci- tation temperatures of solar molecular lines do not differ significantly from the local electron temperature in the region of line formation."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"THE CENTER-LIMB BEHAVIOR OF SOLAR MOLECULAR LINES 151 •• QO • • Q2 • • • • • • • • -0.8 • -1.0 L------50LO-----,OLOO-----'--,S..LO--lO ;r (J\" +1) Fig. 4.

C z The observed center-limb behavior of the ratio W;.(/1)/W;.(l.O) for the C z lines is given in Figure 5. Within the observational scatter the center-limb behavior of these lines is independent of line strength. Consequently all of them could be grouped together and placed in a common diagram. In Figure 5 we have also plotted lines to show the results of computations made with the different photospheric models.

If a large fraction of the free carbon atoms in an atmospheric layer have been combined into CO molecules, the layer becomes relatively insensitive to changes in temperature.

This may or may not be significant, because of the unreliability of the eN equivalent widths.

Discussion of the Results The results presented in Figures 5 through 10 show that the different photospheric models have varying degrees of success in accounting for the center-limb behavior of the molecular lines. The three-stream model gives the most satisfactory results for C 2 and CO and accounts fairly well for the MgH observations. It also explains the CH observations, particularly when the anisotropic microturbulence is used. (The C 2 , CO, and MgH lines are so weak that their center-limb variation is almost identical for the isotropic and anisotropic microturbulence models.) The CN observations are not explained very well by any of the photospheric models; however, as suggested above, this may result from the inaccuracy of the equivalent widths. New observations of the CN lines would be useful. In general the homogeneous models and the Utrecht Reference Model are not as successful as the three-stream model in accounting for the observed center-limb variation of molecular lines. These models, particularly the Utrecht Reference Model and Heintze's model, tend to predict equivalent widths that are too large at the limb. Elste's preliminary three-stream model better explains the observations of the molecular lines because, in contrast to the others, it contains fairly large inhomogeneities in temperature in the molecular line-forming layers. Of the different homogeneous models tested, Mutschlecner's model and Elste's Model 10 appear to be the most satisfactory with Mutschlecner's yielding slightly"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"158 GEORGE L. WITHBROE better results. Both the Utrecht Reference Model and Heintze's model appear to be unsatisfactory for the upper layers of the photosphere. The possibility cannot be ruled out that the molecular lines can be explained with these models and departures from L TE. However, since the observations of molecular lines are fairly well ex- plained by the three-stream model under the assumption of L TE, it does not appear to be necessary to introduce the difficulties of departures from LTE when analysing the behavior of molecular lines. 9. Conclusions These results present evidence for the existence of significant inhomogeneities in the upper layers of the photosphere where molecular lines are formed, - 2.5 ~ log'!: 5000 ~ - 0.5. If the temperature minimum is located in these layers, as several investigators have suggested (PAGEL, 1956, 1961; DE JAGER, 1963; HEINTZE, 1965), then our results suggest that inhomogeneities may be important in the region of the temperature minimum. Mutschlecner's model and/or Model 10 seems to represent the average physical conditions in the upper photosphere better than Heintze's model or the Utrecht model. The assumption of LTE appears to be adequate for explaining the behavior of molecular lines in the solar photosphere. Acknowledgements I wish to express my appreciation to Dr. G.

Photographic observations of the mean Hand K profiles are given for several positions across the solar disk (0.1 < /1< .6). The core profiles of Hand K are nearly identical at the same position on the sun. Estimates of the mean Doppler width and the depth of formation of the K2 emission peaks are given. A more elaborate analysis confirms that the K2 peaks are formed in a relatively shallow layer (ro ~ 3) in which the Doppler width decreases rapidly inward. The relevance of these conclusions to current attempts to predict theoretically the Hand K profiles is discussed. 1. Introduction The Hand K lines of ionized calcium are among the most sensitive indicators of chromo spheric structure available to the astronomer. Their power in delineating the shape and vertical extent of solar atmospheric structures has been recognized since Hale's initial investigations. During the past few years, they have yielded important information on the structure of solar and stellar chromospheres. Thus, the concept of a highly inhomogeneous solar chromosphere, organized into columnar structures arranged along a 'coarse network', has emerged from careful studies of calcium spectroheliograms. A fascinating correspondence between the strength of the magnetic field and the intensity of the K-core emission has been established, principally by the Mt. Wilson investigators (BABCOCK and BABCOCK, 1955; LEIGHTON, 1959; HOWARD, 1959; SIMON and LEIGHTON, 1964). The oscillatory component of the chromo spheric velocity fields has also been extracted from K-line observations (JENSEN and ORRALL, 1963). In the hands of O. C. Wilson and his co-workers, the K line has become an important tool in the study of the atmospheres of G, K and M stars. Two important relations have been uncovered: the width of the K-emission core correlates with absolute magnitude (WILSON and BAPPU, 1957) and the brightness of the core declines with the age of the star (WILSON, 1963). These results give promise of new insights into the development of convection zones during the evolution of the cool stars. If we are to extract maximum information from these solar and stellar K-line observations, we must have a thorough understanding of the origin of the K-emission core. An adequate theory for the dependence of the core profile upon such atmospheric parameters as temperature, density, turbulence, macroscopic motions, and magnetic field has still to be developed. Several explanations of the self-reversal of the core have been offered (GOLDBERG, 1964; SUEMOTO, 1963; JEFFERIES and THOMAS, 1960) but none has yet been generally accepted. Nearly all the emphasis in current work is upon the prediction of solar Hand K"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"THE SOLAR HAND K LINES OF IONIZED CALCIUM 165 profiles, starting from some model atmosphere. The number of free parameters avail- able in such a calculation is large, because the chromospheric model is very poorly known. Little, if any, attention has been given to the analysis of the observations, i.e. the attempt to extract relevant information about the chromosphere directly from the observations. It is the purpose of this paper to present a new set of Hand K observations and a preliminary analysis that sets limitations on any acceptable interpretation. These observations were obtained photographically. They have the important virtues of extending close to the solar limb (to J1, ~ 0.1) and of revealing the point-to- point variations of the profiles. Moreover the observations of Hand K are precisely simultaneous, so that the effects of seeing are the same for each. In the following section, the observations and their reduction are described. An analysis of the center-limb variation of the mean K profile follows. The results are discussed in the last section. 2. Observations The data reported here are based on simultaneous, photographic observations of the Hand K line profiles along a radius of the sun. The observations were made at the Sacramento Peak Observatory with the 12-inch coelostat and 13-m spectrograph. Table I gives some of the relevant parameters.

Slit width: 100 Ii Exposure time: 30 sec During the exposures, the spectrograph slit lay along a solar radius in approxi- matelya North-South direction and cut the solar limb near the South Pole. Figure 1 is a reproduction of the K-line spectrum. The solar limb is at the top of the figure; the chromosphere is visible in the line core as a bulge extending beyond the limb. The spectrum contains information on the variation of the K profile from the limb inward to a point corresponding to cosJ1,=0.7. The spectra cover the intervals A 3964-3988 and A 3917-3938 at a dispersion of 3.54 mm/A. Considerable fine structure is visible in the K2 red and K2 violet emission peaks. Fine mottles as small as 2 sec of arc, and coarse mottles, of the order of 7 sec of arc, are clearly resolved. In addition, several arch-like feature& that connect the red and blue emission peaks are visible.

Spectrogram of the core of the K line, made with a radial slit. The limb of the sun is at the top. Chromospheric emission appears beyond the limb at the line core. In addition to the observations near the limb, a pair of calibration spectra (with exposure times of 30 and 15 sec) were obtained at the center of the disk with a nine- step wedge placed over the slit. Moreover, spectra of the disk center, covering the range AA 3838-4020, were obtained the following day with a special long-frame camera back and with the step wedge in place. These latter spectra were used to determine the intensity, relative to the continuum, at several wavelengths near Hand K. As is well known, the true continuum is masked by the overlapping of many Fraunhofer lines in the spectrum below A 4000 A. In order to establish an absolute photometric scale in this spectral region, it would be necessary to compare the radiation of the sun at a given wavelength with a black-body source, and to make proper allowance for the transmission characteristics of the optical system. Rather than undertake the extensive investigation required to establish an absolute photometric scale, I adopted the following procedure. The long-frame spectrum was traced on the Sacramento Peak microdensitometer and converted to a plot of relative intensity (log I) vs. wavelength. In this conversion, a single characteristic curve was used (corresponding to A 3954.3 A). Previous tests had shown that the shape of the"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"THE SOLAR HAND K LINES OF IONIZED CALCIUM 167 curve is independent of wavelength over the interval of interest. A straight-line envelope was then drawn to fit the highest intensity peaks (which occur at A 4013 and A 3909). This envelope was adopted as the continuum level. The intensity of any wave- length in the spectrum can now be related to the continuum intensity at that wave- length. In order to relate the intensities of the continuum at different wavelengths, I next assumed that the color temperature of the continuum below A 4013 is 6500 oK. The variation of the continuum brightness is quite small (,1logI= .013) over the wave- length interval from A 4013 to A 3909. After carrying out this calibration procedure, HOUTGAST'S (1965) preliminary absolute intensity scale came to my attention. In Table II, I compare the results of the above calibration procedure with those of Houtgast. The agreement is satis- factory. The K and H-line observations were traced on the SPO microphotometer in the direction normal to the dispersion (i.e. at a series of fixed wavelengths). Deflections on the tracings were converted into intensities in units of the continuum at the center of the disk at the wavelength of the center of K.

No correction has been applied to these data for light scattered by the grating into the line cores. The spectrograph was used in its normal single-pass mode during the observations. Previous comparisons between single and double pass observations (EVANS and WADDELL, 1962) suggested that the scattered light contribution to the present data might be as large as I % of the continuum. It was therefore of considerable interest to compare the present observations with photoelectric, double-pass obser- vations made with same spectrograph and grating by WHITE and SUEMOTO (1967). The latter were kindly communicated to the author in advance of publication, and should be virtually uncontaminated with scattered light.

While it is difficult to rule out completely such an error in my choice of the continuum level, the agreement with Houtgast's continuum makes such an error most improbable. B. THE SOURCE FUNCTION OF THE KLINE The bulk of this section is devoted to an attempt to extract from the K-line observations the run of the K source function with depth through a mean solar atmosphere. As a preface, it is useful to estimate the mean Doppler width of the K line absorption coefficient. 1. Mean Doppler Width It is reasonable to assume that the absorption coefficient for the K line has a Doppler profile, at least out to some 2 or 3 Doppler widths from the line center. We may estimate this width using the method of JEFFERIES and CURTIS (1965). We assume that the source function is independent of wavelength and depends only on geometric depth (or, equivalently, on the optical depth (ro) at the wavelength of the line center). We may determine the source function from the observations of the limb-darkening at any wavelength. Thus, let"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"then THE SOLAR HAND K LINES OF IONIZED CALCIUM 00 I(A, /1) = f S e-TA/I' d,;J/1 = a). + b)./1 + C)./1 2 • o 173 Since the coefficients a)., b)., C). have been determined by the least-square fit to the limb-darkening observations at the wavelength A, we may determine S in terms of ,)., the optical depth at this wavelength.

The slight tendency for the width to increase inwards is probably not significant. Note that consistent widths are obtained from observations ranging from the line center out to the K2 emission peak (LlA~0.2 A). The method fails in the vicinity of the emis- sion peaks. These results suggest that the emission peak lies at about 1 or 1.5 Doppler widths from the line center, i.e., within the Doppler core of the absorption coefficient. Additional preliminary information concerning the K line source function and an independent check on the mean Doppler width may be derived with a method devised by WHITE (1967). Assume that the K2 emission peaks reflect the presence of a peak in the source function at some definite depth in the atmosphere (say 'Oo='Op in the optical depth at the line center). If the atmosphere is viewed at an angle () to the normal, the emission peaks appear at a wavelength LlAp (from the line center) such that the optical depth '0). down to the level 'Oo='Op has the value /1=cos(}.

This method gives a slightly smaller Doppler width than the preceding method, but the conclusion that the K2 emission peak lies within the Doppler core is unmodified. The optical depth (L p) at which the peak in each source function occurs is astonishingly small in view of the great strength of the lines. ATHAY (1967) has suggested that White's method is extremely sensitive to small errors near Jl = 1, and yields gross underestimates of L p if the Doppler width varies rapidly in depth. As we shall see in the next section, this estimate of the optical depth of the source-function peak is confirmed by a more elaborate analysis. 2.

We may show this directly. Assume that the Doppler width is constant. Then, the emergent intensity I(A, Jl) equals 00 I(A, Jl) = f S('Oo)e-<01>)'//l(~;')d'Oo.

Thus, if the K2 peak has an intensity lp at Jl= 1, it must have the same value lp at all Jl < 1. The wavelength at which the peak appears is fixed by the condition v=ln(<p;./Jl)=ln(<p;.t!1.0)=const., where A1 is the wavelength of the peak at Jl= 1.0. If we examine the mean K line profiles (Figure 3), however, we see that the intensity of the K2 peak decreases towards the limb. Thus the Doppler width cannot be constant, but must vary with depth, angle, position, etc. If we attempt to analyze the profiles in terms of a homogeneous, isotropic atmosphere, we can only assume that the Doppler width is depth-dependent. We have the following problem then: given a set of mean K profiles that corre- spond to different positions on the disk, find a depth-dependent source function and Doppler width that satisfy the observations. After some preliminary experimentation with a perturbation method, the following iteration scheme was devised: (a) Choose an initial depth-variation of the Doppler width. (In practice, I chose LI = .15 =const.) (b) Use this Lito extract the corresponding source function, S('Oo), from obser- vations at one position on the disk. (In practice, I chose the profile at Jl = 0.6, but supplemented it with the limb-darkening curve at the line-center.) (c) Use this initial S(TO) to extract a new depth-variation of the Doppler width from the observations of the intensity of the K2 peaks at various Jl. (d) Iterate, until the process converges. The final S('Oo) and LI ('00) must predict the complete Doppler core at all other values of Jl.

One can show, from elementary considerations, that such a decrease is required to account for the decrease of the K2 peak intensity toward the limb .

The representation of the data by these two functions is fairly good from the center to the emission peaks but is quite poor near K 1 , especially near the limb. Evidently the iteration procedure described above has yielded an incorrect source function and Doppler width in the deeper layers (In T;G 3). This is hardly surprising, since no information regarding the shape of the absorption coefficient in these layers has been entered into the compu- tation: the Doppler width was simply assumed constant ( = 0.125 A). A more complete analysis, taking into account the variation of the Doppler width and the influence of the damping wings in the deep layers will be required to reproduce the observed Kl intensities. 4.

KLINE --- OBSERVATIONS CALCULATIONS ·06 .04 fL = .1 .02 .6 Fig. 9. Representation of the data by the source function and Doppler-width variations shown in Figure 8. The solid lines are the original observations. Doppler width is large and increasing rapidly outward. It seems reasonable to identify this region with a steep chromo spheric temperature rise. Unfortunately, the magnitude of the Doppler width gives little direct information on the temperature. For example, at 't\"K=1 the inferred Doppler width (0.15 A) corresponds to a Doppler velocity of 11.4 km/sec. If the atomic motions are purely thermal, a temperature of 3 x 10 5 OK is indicated; but if non-thermal motions exist (equal to the velocity of sound) a temperature of 4500 oK is indicated. Thus the most valuable clue on the chromo spheric model arising from the preceding analysis is the low opacity of the chromosphere down to the region where K2 is formed. Current attempts to predict theoretically the K profile begin with models that imply an opacity of 10 2 to 10 4 for this upper portion of the chromosphere (see a.o. Athay and Skumanich's paper in the present Proceedings of the Bilderberg Conference; Solar Physics 3, 1968, No.1). It seems clear that models with a steep temperature rise at an optical depth of 't\"K ~ 3 should be investigated. We may estimate the amount of material down to this depth as follows. The optical depth is given by 't\"p = 1X0xu(N;.n) I Ne dh = 8.3 x 10- 18 xuI Ne dh. Most of the contribution to 't\"p takes place at such temperatures that Xu (the average fraction of calcium atoms that are doubly ionized) is approximately unity. Thus if we require 't\"p~3, then S Ne dh~3.6 X 10 17 . For example, if Ne~ 10 10 , the thickness of the calcium chromosphere can only be 360 km."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"178 J.B; ZIRKER Whether such an optically thin chromosphere can, in fact, produce the required peak in the source function is a question that only calculations can settle.

INVERSION OF THE EMERGENT INTENSITY INTEGRAL Throughout the analysis, the convolution form for the emergent intensity 00 -00 was found most useful. In the first step of determining S (To) with A = .15 A, the kernel (K) has the form K (z) = ex p [ - e Z + zJ , with I\"-' 00 K dz = I, z = U + v, in the notation given above. A simple matrix inversion scheme was found to work satisfactorily. The emergent intensity was expressed as where Sj is the source function at 10 equally spaced depths in the In To scale ( - 3 < InTo<6). Observations were chosen at values of Vi =In (¢;.I/1)i = -Ui that place the maximum of the kernel (i.e. the contribution function) at the spccified values of Uj=lnTo. Thus, three observations at AA=O (In/1=-3,-2,-I) and seven obser- vations at /1=0.6 (lnv=O,-I,-2, ... ,-6) were chosen. I also assumed that the source function remains constant (and equal to its value at the end-point) outside the specific range - 3 <In TO < 6. Essentially the same procedure was used with a depth-dependent Doppler width. In this situation, the kernel is a function of A and /1 separately: As before, observations along the /1=0.6 profile were chosen at wavelengths AA such that the kernel maximum fell at the specified values of /1 = In TO. The equations specifying the source function are even worse - conditioned than with a constant Doppler width. As a result the source function could be determined simultaneously only at five optical depths: In T = - 3, - 1, + 1, 3, 5. However, by using another set of points on the /1=0.6 profile, the source function at the intermediate depths (- 2,0,2, 4, 6) were determined. The two solutions fit moderately well."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"THE SOLAR HAND K LINES OF IONIZED CALCIUM 179 B.

SKUMANICH High Altitude Observatory, Boulder, Colo., U. S. A. (Received I June, 1967) Abstract. Profiles of the Hand K lines of Mgn and the K line of Can are computed using a two-level atom for five model atmospheres distinguished from each other mainly by the location of the temper- ature minimum. In the five models the temperature minimum and the chromospheric temperature are adjusted to give best agreement between computed and observed profiles. The parameters e and ro are prescribed as functions of T from a density model of the atmosphere. By comparing computed and observed profiles of the K3, K2 and inner Kl components of the lines we determine both the approximate depth variation of .dAD and the best of the temperature models. We find that the Doppler width increases rapidly with height in the chromosphere beginning from a value of 1.6 km/sec at Tc ~ 10- 2 . This latter value corresponds closely to the thermal velocity of Mg atoms in the upper photosphere. The preferred temperature model is one for which the temperature minimum occurs near Te(A 2800) ~ IO- L 10- 5 with a value T min::S 4200° and which has a temperature near 7000° at Te = 10- 6 where K2 is formed. The intensity in K3 is determined largely by d.dAD/dT in the K2 and K3 regions. 1. Introduction The faint self-reversed emission cores in the solar Hand K lines of Call have long been a source of curiosity and speculation. Relatively few attempts have been made, however, to provide an explicit quantitative theory to explain these phenomena. The discoveries of similar, but more pronounced, emission cores in the Hand K lines of Mgn and of self-reversal in the Lyman-IX and Lyman-f3lines in the solar spectrum, as well as the discovery of the Wilson-Bappu effect in stellar spectra, have prompted a more concerted effort to provide such a theory. Qualitative and semi-quantitative theories are no longer capable of furnishing adequate guidance to the understanding of self-reversal and its applications in observational astronomy. In essence, those who have worked on the problem of self-reversal can be divided into three schools of thought typified by the following broad divisions: (1) those who would explain the reversals in terms of a mechanistic theory, such as a change from coherent to non-coherent scattering (cf. MIYAMOTO, 1957); (2) those who would ex- plain them in terms of a Schuster-Schwarzschild type layer producing an emission core that is simply added to an independently formed monotonic absorption profile (cf. WILSON and BAPPU, 1957); and (3) those who would explain the profile in terms of a Milne-Eddington type model in which the profile is a direct mapping of the source function assumed to be a continuous function of height (cf. JEFFERIES and THOMAS, 1960). Most likely there are elements of truth in all three approaches, and, in point of fact, many of the apparent differences are superficial rather than funda- mental. Perhaps the most important distinctions between the three schools of thought are"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"182 R. GRANT ATHAY AND A. SKUMANICH in the underlying assumptions. For example, group (2) assumes, either implicitly or explicitly, that there are in fact two distinct profiles formed in two distinct parts of the atmosphere. Usually, the profile is assumed to be made up of a normal absorption profile and a normal emission profile which show a composite self-reversal only because of the manner in which they add together. It is also usually the case that the emission core is assumed to be formed in discrete optically thin clouds overlying a more or less homogeneous medium. By distinction, group (3) usually asserts that the self-reversal results from the chromospheric temperature rise, essentially inde- pendently of any inhomogeneities in the chromosphere, and that the emission features are formed in layers where the opacity is moderately large. No proposed explanation of the profiles has been both sufficiently accurate and sufficiently quantitative to serve as a basis on which to build a more complete theory. Our purpose in this paper is to provide such a basis. We treat the problem in a manner that appears to us to be the most direct, and we introduce just enough complexity to be consistent with the inherent difficulties of the problem and somewhat consistent with reality. We begin by adopting a model atom with just two energy levels. Hence, we ignore all interlocking transitions, even between Hand K themselves. We assume non- coherent scattering throughout the line. The model atmospheres used for computing profiles are spherically symmetric in all their properties, but we allow all of the parameters of the atmosphere influencing the line profiles to vary with depth. The basic method of calculating a profile follows that initiated by JEFFERIES and THOMAS (1960). Our purpose, quite deliberately, is to introduce as few complications as possible in the model atom, but to make the model atmosphere as realistic as possible. We hope, in so doing, to provide a quantitative starting basis for improved models and improved calculations. We do not attempt to account for the more detailed features of the profiles, such as asymmetry in the emission peaks. On the other hand, as we shall show in the following discussion, we do obtain a first-order representation of the K2 emission features and the inner portions of Kl in both Mgn and Can with a realistic model chromosphere. Parenthetically, we note that the resultant model, even though approached from a Milne-Eddington point of view, bears certain resemblances to a Schuster-Schwarz- schild model. The role of the chromosphere in producing the self-reversed emission core is described primarily in terms of its temperature, density, and opacity at line center. Continuum opacity in the chromosphere enters only secondarily. Also, we note that similar attempts at fitting the Can profiles have been made by other authors (cf. JEFFERIES and THOMAS, 1960; LINSKY, 1966). Differences between our results and theirs arise from their neglect of one or more essential aspects of the model atmosphere and not from differences in the fundamental approach to the problem. The ensuing calculations illustrate the effect of various atmospheric parameters on the amplitude and position of the emission peaks. Consequently, they offer a guide to the observed changes in the emission cores from point to point on the solar disk"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"EMISSION CORES IN HAND K LINES.

Method of Computing Profiles and Observed Profiles In keeping with our attempt to minimize the complexity of computing a profile for the H or K lines, we restrict our discussion to the two energy levels involved in the line formation. This means that we treat Hand K independently and ignore any coupling between the upper levels of the two transitions. Since, in reality, these levels are strongly coupled, we are ignoring an important feature of the problem. However, the coupling between the upper levels will affect primarily the relative intensities of Hand K rather than the absolute intensities. By ignoring the coupling we tend to maximize any differences between Hand K that may occur. We also ignore inter- locking with other levels, such as the 3d levels of Can. The consequences of this are not entirely clear, but LINSKY (1966) reports that ignoring the 3d levels changes the computed intensities by no more than 1 % of the continuum. Since the residual intensities in Hand K of Can are of the order of 2 to 5% of the continuum intensity, this is not an insignificant error. We regard this and the coupling between excited p levels as refinements of the problem to be added at a later date. By restricting the problem to two energy levels and ignoring the interaction of these levels with the continuum, we may write the frequency independent part of the line source function, S, in the form (JEFFERIES and THOMAS, 1960): S J.cfJ. dv + BB S=----- 1 + B (1) where J.=mean intensity, cfJ.=normalized absorption profile, B=C 21 /A 21 , and B=Planck function. This equation ignores stimulated emissions, which are not important in this particular problem. Equation (1) is combined with the transfer equation, using a method described in detail elsewhere (ATHAY and SKUMANICH, 1967, hereafter referred to as Paper I), to obtain 00 1 2 f <P y dH y S = B + B + b -lie <P y + ro dTo dy. o (2) The notation used is <P y = the Voight absorption profile normalized to unity at line center, y=LlA/(LlAD(T c = 1»= LlA/LlA6, ro=dTc/dTo, b=2r o S~ <Py/(<P y + ro) dy, and Hy=the monochromatic flux at y, which depends upon S. The mathematical procedure for computing a profile is briefly as follows: B, B, ro and <p y are all prescribed as functions of To or T c , whichever is more convenient. Equation (2) is then solved for S. Sand B are combined to give the total source function S =~S+_r_o_B t, y <P y + ro <P y + ro ' (3)"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"184 R. GRANT ATHAY AND A.

We will, in fact, compute a representative set of active region profiles that more or less span the limits of the observed variations in profiles. Figure 2 shows the Mgn profiles averaged over the central third of the solar disk (PURCELL et ai., 1962).* We expect the Mgn profiles to vary considerably from point to point on the disk and in active regions. The Mgn profile shown, therefore, should be regarded as a composite of many rather diverse profiles and not as a profile truly representative of any particular region of the sun. On the date of the Mgu observations, 21 August 1961, the central regions of the solar disk contained several plages and these may have contributed substantially to the observed profiles. Also, corrections for scattered light have been made which are large at points near the saddle in the profile centered at about 0.6 A from line center. Thus, these regions of the profiles are relatively inaccurate compared to the remainder of the profiles.

Observed Mgn Hand K profiles averaged over the central third ofthe solar disk on August 21, 1961, when several plages and sunspots were present (PURCELL et at., 1962). considerably narrower than either the K3 core or the K2 peaks midway between the K12 minimum and K2 maximum. Hence, we do not expect any pronounced distortion of the profiles resulting from instrumental effects, but we do expect significant distortion from the poor spatial resolution. We have arbitrarily adopted a mean K2 peak intensity of 60-65% for fitting purposes. It is a point of considerable interest, as pointed out by GOLDBERG (1965), that the Hand K relative intensities are reversed in Mgn as compared to Can on the un- disturbed disk. In the plage reported by Zirker the relative intensities of Hand K of Call are of the same sense as for the average disk for Mgn and are reversed from the Can profiles for the normal disk regions as reported by GOLDBERG et al. (1959). The Call profiles given by Goldberg et al. are measured relative to the continuum at A 4000 rather than at the wavelengths of the lines. The relatively large separation of Hand K for Can (~33 A) provides a distinct possibility that the continuum may change appreciably between the two lines. This, plus the presence of numerous other absorption lines in this spectral region suggests that one should regard the published results with considerable caution. We note at this point that if the source functions were identical in Hand K the H profile would lie above the K profile in the K3 core, intersect the K profile near the K z maximum, fall below the K profile on the declining part of K z farthest from line"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"186 R. GRANT ATHAY AND A. SKUMANICH center, and again rise above the K profile in the Kl region. This point was noted by GOLDBERG (1965), who also noted that this never seems to happen in the solar profiles. The assumptions made in this paper lead necessarily to an inequality between the source functions for the Hand K lines in the K3 and K2 regions because of the difference in r o , hence in optical thickness of the chromosphere for the two lines. The inequality is such that the H profiles always falls below the K profile in K3 and K 2 . Deeper in the atmosphere where the Kl profile is formed the source functions both approach B, and therefore become equal. This equality brings the H profile back above the K profile in the Kl region. In all cases our computed profiles agree with the types of profiles shown in Figures 1 band 2 with respect to the relative intensities of Hand K. As already noted, the neglect of collisional coupling between the upper levels of the Hand K transitions, which would tend to equalize the source functions if included, tends instead to maximize the difference between the source functions. Zirker's results show that the H profile falls below the K profile by about 25% throughout K3 and K 2 . In Mgn the observed profiles differ in intensity by about 20% at the K2 peaks. The computed Mgn profiles differ by somewhat more than this amount when we reduce the chromo spheric opacity by a factor 2 for the H line. This is in- dicative of the fact that we have overemphasized the differences between K and H by ignoring the coupling between the excited levels. As might be expected, there is considerable freedom in the parameters that give satisfactory agreement with the observed profiles. Also, rather different sets of para- meters that approximate the Mgn K profile tend also to give an acceptable fit to the Can K profile. Thus, with the crude data available one does not really gain much in the way of added discrimination by using the two sets of profiles. Furthermore, a set of parameters that fits the K profile of Mgn fits the H profile about equally well. The same is not true in Can because of the unexplained behavior of the H profile relative to K. We have, in effect then, just one profile to fit and from which we must determine all of the free parameters of the calculations. Because of the greater amplitude of the K2 peak in Mgn, we deal primarily with the Mgn K profile. 3. Choice of Parameters Of the four quantities B, e, ro and o/y only three are truly independent. In principle, at least, ro is determinable from the other three, assuming that abundances are known. However, even the three independent quantities permit far too many degrees of free- dom if they are each allowed to vary arbitrarily with depth. It is necessary by some device to restrict the adjustable parameters to a number that is consistent with the information contained in the observations. We choose five points in the profile to describe its shape: the K3 minimum, the K2 peak, the K12 minimum, a point midway between K2 and K12 and a point in Kl at Ll2=2 A. To specify these five points we need seven quantities, intensities at the five points and the values of Ll2 at K2 and K i2 . Hence, we cannot allow more than seven adjustable parameters in the model atmos- phere."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"EMISSION CORES IN HAND K LINES. I: THE OPTICALLY THICK CHROMOSPHERE 187 In order to make an intelligent choice of parameters it is necessary to understand their effect upon the nature of the profile, which we now briefly review. JEFFERIES and THOMAS (1960) showed that when B( '1:) goes through a minimum near the top of the photosphere followed by a chromo spheric temperature rise S tends to parallel B through the region of temperature minimum and to go through a maximum in the vicinity of initial temperature rise. This maximum in S supposedly produces the K2 maximum in Iy at a particular value of y. The amplitude of K2 depends mainly upon four factors: (a) the amount by which the temperature rises, (b) the coupling efficiency between Sand B, (c) the optical thickness of the chromosphere, and (d) the shape and depth variation of ¢y- The coupling efficiency between Sand B is measured bye, which is directly proportional to electron density and depends only slightly upon temperature. For large densities, e is relatively large and efficient coupling takes place. Hence, the amplitude of K2 is strongly affected by B( '1:) and e( '1:), both of which occur explicitly in Equation (1). The effect of e represents a direct coupling between the radiating atoms and the free electrons, i.e., the thermal energy of the plasma. An added source of coupling between Sand B, hence an added effect on the K2 amplitude, arises through the optical thickness (at line center) of the chromosphere, '1:6. This coupling can be thought of in terms of the mean number of scatterings experienced by a photon before it escapes the atmosphere. Photons generated at depths where the line opacity is large but the continuum opacity is small may escape the atmosphere either by diffusion in 'I: space or by diffusion in frequency space. The thermalization length, i.e., the number of scatterings required before the photons are destroyed by superelastic collisions, is given by ae- 2 for a~e, Hence, when '1:6 <ae- 2 most of the photons escape, and S is less than B. If diffusion in frequency is ineffective, i.e., a<e, then most of the photons escape by diffusion in 'I: space and SIB is controlled mainly bye. However, if diffusion in frequency is effective (a>e) so that photons escape primarily by this means, then SIB becomes a function of the parameter controlling the diffusion in frequency, i.e., a. To escape by diffusion in frequency photons must reach a value of y such that ¢y::::; ('1:6) -1. The effectiveness of this diffusion is controlled by the shape of ¢y while the distance they diffuse is controlled by the shape of ¢y and '1:6. Hence, SIB becomes a function of ro since '1:6 = /(r o ), as well as a and e. Diffusion is most effective for a line with strong wings (large a) or for large ro (small line opacity). Thus, a large ro or broad wings on ¢y depress K2 and small ro or narrow ¢y enhances K 2 . There is also a coupling between the diffusion in 'I: and y spaces and this introduces an effect on SIB from gradients in ¢y and ro with r. For the moment, we ignore the effect of gradients in ro on SIB and consider the effect of gradients in ¢y on both SIB and K 2 (max). The effects on the K2 amplitude of B, e, ro and ¢y(a) so far discussed are direct effects in the sense that they determine S('I:), and they depend only on the local values of these parameters. There is a further effect of ¢y on K2 of a less direct and more subtle nature. Both the value of S and the mapping of St, y( '1:) into Iy by the processes of radiative transfer depend upon changes in ¢y with depth. If, for example, d¢y/d'l:"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"188 R. GRANT ATHAY AND A. SKUMANICH is negative through the regions of the atmosphere where S is near its maximum, two effects are present. Smax increases somewhat tending to enhance I(K2) but I spreads out in wavelength tending to weaken K2 and enhance K3 and K 12 • Here we note only that the two effects exert opposing influences on I(K2) and we defer further discussion to the following section. The influences of a and B on the K3 intensity are somewhat similar to their influences on K 2 . However, aB is essentially determined by the K2 intensity. Thus the only freedom we have with K3 is in the choice of ro which controls the optical thickness of the chromosphere and in </Jir) which controls the greyness of the chromosphere. The optical thickness of the mean chromosphere is known within reasonable limits and we do not feel justified in varying ro enough to fit the K3 profiles by adjusting this parameter alone. Thus, we use </Jy(r) to regulate K 3 • We do, however, consider the influence of varying ro in Section 5, where we discuss the profiles in active re- gions. Thus far we have noted five effects on the K2 amplitude: the absolute values of B, a and ro in the chromosphere, the bandwidth of </Jy, which is determined by the Voigt parameter a, and d</Jy/dr o . Hence, we must use at least two parameters for </Jy and if we use one each for a and ro we are left with only two parameters to describe B(r). Hopefully, we would like to conclude something about the location and value of the temperature minimum and a value of T for at least one point in the chromosphere. This requires a minimum of three parameters in B( r). Since it is possible to estimate values of a, ro and a from a density model of the atmosphere without knowing B(r), it is tempting to resort to this and to use all of the six adjustable parameters in B( r) and d</Jy/dr. However, the wisdom in this depends upon how strongly a, ro and a influence the final profile. The principal influence of a on the line profile is through the coupling efficiency between Sand B. On the other hand, ro and a affect both the opacity of the chromo- sphere, hence the approach of S to B, and the mapping of St, y into I y • Thus, ro and a have a considerable stronger influence on the shape of the profile than does a. Further- more, a is perhaps more accurately known than roo The sensitivity of the profiles to a and ro requires that we retain at least one free parameter for each of these quantities, and we need at least two parameters for d</Jy/dr. However, we adopt fixed values of a in order to permit three degrees of freedom in B(r). Values of a based on densities given by THOMAS and ATHAY (1961) are given in Table I. These were computed for collisional cross-sections for Can and we assume the same cross-sections, hence the same a's for Mgn.

The second term in Equation (5) contains D rather than D2 because the Voigt parameter is proportional to LI},;;-l. This term is included in cPy only for y> 1. We have chosen a form for the broadening term, D, that has the approximate Tc dependence of the velocity curve derived for the low chromosphere by UNNO (1959). However, we investigate the effects on the line profiles of varying each of the para- meters in Equation (6). The most important effects of, are in determining the location of K2 in wavelength and the relative separations of K2 and the minimum in K 1 . The parameters () and Z influence rather markedly the intensity of K2 and more especially the relative intensities of K2 and K 3 . Because we have used three parameters in specifying D, whereas we have allowed room in the analysis for only two parameters, we cannot evaluate the three para- meters uniquely. We therefore must regard the combination of () and Z as essentially a single parameter. The remaining two parameters ro and B( T) are perhaps equally uncertain. If we use Te as the basic depth parameter, fo depends upon dTo/dh in the line and the scale height of Te' The absorption coefficient at line center depends upon total density, the relative abundance of the ion and the broadening velocity. So far as is known both Can and Mgu are the dominant ions of their species throughout the region of line formation. Hence, for our purposes the major uncertainties in dTo are in the total densities and relative abundances of Ca and Mg. The scale height of Te is also un- certain, particularly in the upper photosphere and low chromosphere. As a result of these combined uncertainties in both dTc/dh and dTo/dh we can make only rather crude estimates of ro. The order of magnitude estimates given in Table I are obtained from total densities given by THOMAS and ATHAY (1961), relative abundances given by ALLEN (1955) and an assumed scale height for Te of 100 km. We emphasize that the estimated ro could perhaps be in error by over a factor of 3, particularly in the regions where T e >1O- 3 • Values of ro for Mgn differ from those for Can because of differences in dTe/dh and in the relative abundances of Call and Mgn. Mg is about a factor of 20 more abundant than Ca and for H- absorption Ke increases by about a factor of 3 from A 3900 to }, 2800. It may be that additional sources of continuum opacity are present at A 2800, but we do not consider this possibility. The values of ro most important for our purposes are those in the optical depth range Tc~1O-JO (To~l) to Te~1O-2, i.e., in the atmospheric regions producing K 3 , K2 and the inner K1 profiles. When ro < 10- 10 we encounter oscillations in our solutions for S( T) indicative of numerical instability. Thus, we have been forced to limit r 0 to values of 10 -1 0 or greater. This is near the estimated value of f 0 at To = 1 for Can but about an order of magnitude greater than the estimated ro for Mgn at To = 1."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"EMISSION CORES IN HAND K LINES. I: THE OPTICALLY TllCK CHROMOSPHERE 191 Absolute values of ro affect both the K2 and Kl component rather strongly. However, in K2 a given change of ro may be effectively cancelled by a change in B(-r), whereas this is not the case in K 1 . The location of the K12 minimum in y is strongly affected by ro and ¢y and only secondarily by B(-r). Hence in fitting the profile we are ulti- mately forced to adopt values of ro and ¢y that properly locate the K12 minimum. We assume for ro a -r dependence and leave a single adjustable constant. The estimated values of ro in Table I vary approximately as -r6/ 3 . We therefore adopt 1/3 1 10- 10 ro = ro, 1 -ro + x , (7) which has the proper form for ro> 10- 10 • Equation (7) seriously overestimates ro for Mgn for regions with -ro < 10 2 • The resultant effect on Iy is very small, however, because the total optical thickness of the chromosphere is much larger than 10 2 • The values of ro in Table I suggest ro,1~4x 10- 11 for Mgn and 2x 10- 10 for Can. We adopt these as initial values, but we shall investigate the effect on the profile of varying r O ,l' In choosing among the wide variety of possible forms for B(-r) we again follow the same scheme adopted for D, viz., we assume the form of the -re dependence but leave adjustable constants to fix the amplitudes. Two sets of B(-r) curves for A 2800 are selected, one with a relatively narrow minimum near -re= 10- 2 and one that permits a broader minimum with the chromospheric rise in B(-r) beginning at an adjustable value of -re' The first set, designated by subscript 1, is represented by the equation (8) and the second set by (9) The coefficient of -re in the linear term approximates the limb darkening coefficient at A 2800. The value of B min is controlled by OCn' The two constants C n and Xn are used jointly to determine the value of -re at B min and therefore act effectively as a single adjustable constant. An determines the amplitude of the chromospheric rise in B. Equation (9) is used to investigate three sets of temperature models, designated by subscripts n=2, 3 and 4, with minima occurring near -re= 10- 3 , 10- 4 , and 10- 5 , respectively. The corresponding values of C and Xn are C 2 = 101, X2 = .21; C 3 = 10 7 , X3 = .28; and C 4 = 10 8 , X4 = .28. The values of Xn are dependent, of course, on our choice of Cn. However, the choice of C n is not critical so long as Cn~ 105. The reason being that the observed K2 peak intensity fixes B(-r) at -re~ 10- 6 within rather narrow limits. Thus, the only remaining freedom in B(-r) in the low chromosphere is in the value and location of B min , and, hence, the gradient in B( r) between the minimum and -re~ 10- 6 • For the four models mentioned above we adopt somewhat arbitrarily '=3, c5 = 10 4 and Z = 1-- This gives a step-like rise in LlAD with an amplitude of 4: 1 and with the region of increasing LlAD extending from about -re= 10- 3 to 10- 5 • In these"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"192 R.

From these models we select what appears to be the most favorable form for B(,), which turns out to be model 3. We then construct model 5 by adopting the values of en and Xn for model 3 and changing the parameters in D to ,= 8, b = 10 8 and Z =t. This has the effect of increasing the ampli- tude of the rise in A)'D and of both shifting and spreading out the regions of increasing AAD so that it extends from about 'c= 10- 6 to 10- 10 . K2 and K3 are now formed in layers where AAD is changing rapidly and this strongly influences the intensities of both K2 and K3 as well as their ratio. Parameters of the five models are summarized in Table n. 4. Results for Normal Regions Rather than reproduce many series of calculations with different sets of parameters, we shall try to extract from the calculations the essential effects on the resulting profiles and to explain them wherever they are understood. This reflects our feeling that this set of calculations should serve only as a starting-point for improved calculations using improved data, a more realistic model atom and perhaps a more complex chromosphere. The coupling between the chromo spheric Band S that gives rise to the K2 peak is conveniently represented, for fixed CPY' by I:'~, where, as before, ,~ is the opacity of the chromosphere. Since for constant Yo, ,~ is proportional to Yo 1,~, we have The values of I: and Yo in Table I give I:/Y o ;::::,10 6 for Mgn and I:/Y o ;::::,10 5 for Call. Hence, the source functions are strongly coupled to the chromosphere for Mgn when ,~;G 10- 6 and for Can when ,~;G 10- 5. This difference between the coupling conditions for the two ions immediately provides a reason for the much stronger emission peaks in Mgu. Also, we note that because Yo is larger by a factor of two for the H lines than for the K lines, we expect stronger coupling hence stronger K2 peaks for the K lines than for the H lines. When cPy is allowed to vary, the choice of a and the location of the gradient in CPy affects the K2 amplitude markedly whereas, has only a secondary effect. Also, I: and An affect K2 directly.

The observed K2 maximum is at 0.15 A. Hence for Z=-!-, AAD in the chromosphere is ~.06 A, corre- sponding to a doppler velocity of 6.4 km/sec. An upper limit on , is set by this value of AAD in the chromosphere and the thermal doppler width in the photosphere. For a temperature of 4000° the thermal doppler width for Mgu is .015 A. Since AA1 cannot be less than this, , cannot exceed 3. For Z =t the situation is somewhat different because of the increased range in rc through which D(r) increases. We have not performed sufficient calculations with this value of Z to establish a general rule for the location of Ymax' One of the principal difficulties in matching the observed profiles is to keep the separation between the K2 maximum and the K12 minimum as small as it is observed to be. The location ofthe minimum is affected most strongly by a and less strongly by 'oland (. The observed location of Ymin is ~0.6 A for Mgn, or Ymin~4Ymax' This"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"196 R.

On the other hand, the value of Iy at y::::; 10Ymax is essentially independent of, and shows opposite effects from changes in a and r O ,l' This allows us to select the parameters a, and r O ,l somewhat independently. The location of Ymin requires a value for a of about 10-3, which we have adopted as a minimum value. The value of Ymin further requires, > 2 for models 1-4. Fortunately, this is close to the upper limit '~3 required by the location of Ymax, so we adopt' = 3. Finally, we determine a value for r o , 1 that gives a satisfactory value for Iy at y::::; 10Ymax without seriously disrupting the value of Ymin' In all cases we find that a value of r O ,l near to the suggested value of 4x 10- 11 for Mgrr is sufficiently good. For each temperature model we adjust An and (Xn to give the best intensities for the K2 maximum and the K12 minimum. The maximum can be completely controlled so we obtain an unambiguous value for An once a, DC'I:) and r O ,l are specified. Un- fortunately, the intensity of the K12 minimum cannot be fully controlled independently of the location. Thus, the values of a, , and r o , 1 selected to give the best 'shape' for the profile exert an influence on the intensity of the K12 minimum. We therefore consider this region of the profile in some detail. For '=2-3, Ymin falls near y=30, and for a=.OOl, cP30=1O- 6 • Hence 1:30=1 corresponds to 1: 0 ::::;10 6 , or, using the values of r o in Table I, to 1: c ::::;10-3. Since (B21:0/a)~ I at this depth, we expect S::::;B, and since 1:c~ I we expect 1:30 to be domi- nated by line opacity. Because of backward irradiation by the chromosphere into the region of B min and since the chromosphere contributes to the observed intensity to a point in the profile beyond the K12 minimum, the value of Iy at the minimum in the profile lies above the minimum value of B. The amount by which Iy (min) exceeds B min depends, in part, upon a, , and r O ,l as may be seen from inspection of Figures 3a, 3b, and 4b. If a or , are large or if r o , 1 is small, the 'wings' of the K2 emission blend with Kl and fill in the K12 minimum. This filling in of the K12 minimum restricts our knowledge of B min to an upper limit, which we obtain by equating Iy (min) to B min • The observed K12 minima have reported intensities of about 5% for Can and 4% for Mgn. The corresponding radiation temperatures are 4200° for Carr and 4250° for Mgrr. Both profiles contain relatively large uncertainties but the very strong de- pendence of the intensity on T rad makes these estimates of T rad quite reliable. For example, if T rad = 4500°, the K12 intensities increase to 8-9% for the two lines, which would seem to be beyond or near the limit of the probable errors in the profiles. We feel confident, therefore, that T rad <4500°. Computed intensities of the K12 minimum decrease as we decrease T min down to values of about 4000° and thereafter remain essentially independent of ~nin' Even at T min = 4000°, the computed K12 intensities fall above the observed intensities. Hence we adopt values of T min of about 4000° corre- sponding to B min ::::; 0.2. This determines the parameter (X for each of the models.

In summary, then, the four free parameters for each of the first four models are determined essentially from the following scheme: a from Ymin, '0,1 from Iy at y:::dO, An from the K2 amplitude and ex from the requirement that Bmin;S0.2. We then choose the particular model from the four that gives the best overall agreement with the Mgn and Can profiles.

We note from Figure 9b that the Can profile for model 5 has the correct ratio of 1 2 /1 3 , The fact that both the Mgn and Can profiles for model 5 agree reasonably well with the observed profiles, lends considerable confidence to our basic approach.

Thus, the fact that our computed intensities in Call lie somewhat above the observed intensities is not particularly disturbing. Obviously, improvements are needed. These include improved observations, an improved model atom with additional energy levels, an improved model atmosphere and perhaps improved collisional excitation rates for Call and MgII. We have demonstrated only that there is approximate agreement between the observed profiles and the adopted model atmosphere. We emphasize again that some caution is needed in interpreting the results. The rather complex interactions of a, ro, e and DCr) on the computed profile necessarily results in a certain amount of ambiguity among these parameters. This ambiguity is undoubtedly reflected to some extent in the adopted temperature model. It is difficult to make a reliable estimate of the possible magnitude of these affects. S. Active Regions Call K profiles in active regions shows a variety of changes in the K2 and K3 regions from the profiles observed in quiet regions. One such change is shown in Figure 1 b. The K2 peak has intensified and moved somewhat closer to line center. K3 has filled in and K12 has both filled in and moved further from line center. In some cases, the K2 peaks intensify and move further from line center, and in others they move much closer to line center, even to the point where K3 disappears and a single emission peak occurs. As noted in the preceding discussion the K2 amplitude is affected by all the para- meters of the problem except ct.. It seems probable that in active regions all of the parameters change and one therefore cannot reach a general conclusion about the changes in anyone of the parameters from the simple fact that K2 is intensified. For example, an increase in K2 may result from a rise in temperature in the chromosphere, a rise in density, an increase in the optical depth to the temperature minimum, or a reduction of ,. On the other hand, the location of K2 is affected mainly by the latter two factors. The influence of D (,) on the intensity of K2 and the shape of the profile has been discussed in the preceding. The effect of chromospheric opacity, which we characterize by C, also affects both the K 2 10cation and the K3 intensity in a systematic way. It is of interest therefore to investigate the particular influence of the parameter C. We show in Figure 10 several profiles computed for values of C ranging from 10 4 _ 10 12 . The parameters xm Am a and '0,1 have the values 0.23,80, .006 and 2x 10- 10 respectively, for each of the profiles. An = 80 corresponds to Tch = 12000° and in- creases K2 by about a factor of 3 over its normal value. The parameter e has been adjusted to give roughly the same K2 intensity for the different profiles. The para- meter, is set equal to 3 for 104~ C~ lOB, and 0 for lOB ~ C~ 10 12 . This latter change was necessary because of numerical instabilities encountered for combinations where both C and, were large.

Influence of C on the Call K profiles suggestive of the types of changes observed in active regions. profiles. For small values of C the changes in K3 are produced by changes in B. However, for large values of C the filling in of K3 is directly related to the decreased separation of the K2 peaks produced by elevating the base of the chromosphere, i.e., reducing the chromo spheric opacity. Similarly, wide separation of the K2 peaks with no enhancement of K3 results from increasing the chromospheric opacity by de- pressing its base. We emphasize again that effects of different Del:) are undoubtedly present. However, the merging of the K2 peaks to form a simple emission core is strongly suggestive of an increase in C. Since this behavior of the profile is found mainly over sunspots, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the base of the chromo- sphere is elevated. Widely separated K2 peaks are associated with some flares and, again, it would not be unreasonable to suppose that the chromosphere begins some- what lower in this case. We suggest therefore that a substantial part of the observed changes in the K profile from point to point on the solar disk results from changes in the location of the temperature minimum.

Pour traiter ce probleme il faut, suivant l'etude theorique faite par Thomas et Jefferies resoudre simultanement les equations de l'equilibre statistique et les equations differentielles du transfert du rayonnement. Les equations de transfert du rayonne- ment sont integrees a l'aide de la methode de FEAUTRIER (1964) qui est une application de la methode generale d'integration de Fox (1957). La methode utilisee pour resoudre Ie probleme pour un atome a plusieurs niveaux est decrite dans un article precedent (CUNY, 1967).

En particulier, nous rappellerons, lorsque ce sera necessaire, les equations de cet article en faisant preceder leur numero du chiffre I. En introduisant l'expression des solutions b k et b j des equations d'equilibre sta- tistique (THOMAS, 1957), on obtient: Sjk = J jk + Njlc (2) 1 + Djk , ou 00 J jk = J Jv<Pv dv.

Calcul de J: formule de quadrature. Le resultat de l'integration numerique des equations de transfert depend assez fortement de la formule de quadrature utilisee pour calculer Ie terme de rayonnement de Ly cx. Dans ce paragraphe nous supprimons les indices indiquant les niveaux definissant la transition. Pour calculer Jon partage l'intervalle d'integration que I'on prend fini en une suite d'intervalles; dans chaque intervalle on admet que la fonction a integrer peut etre representee par un polynome: on peut done utiliser les formules de quadrature de Gauss- Legendre ou de Tchebysheff. 1.

Le facteur K doit etre au moins de l'ordre de grandeur de 10. Avec K egal it. 100Ia precision est bonne. Dans Ie cas de Ly rx, a une profondeur optique de 10 5 les valeurs numeriques sont les suivantes : a = 0,4 x 10- 3 D = 0,46 X 10- 4 . On obtient done, pour K egal a 10: A cette profondeur: LlAD = 0,04 A, ce qui donne pour la largeur utile: LlAu = 0,8 A (K = 10). Cette valeur est une valeur minimale. Un facteur K egal a 100 donnerait une valeur de LlAu ega Ie a 8 A. Nous avons execute des calculs avec pour Ly rx diiferentes valeurs LIAR de l'inter- valle represente par la formule de quadrature. Nous avons limite la valeur de LIAR afin de reduire Ie nombre de points de la for- mule de quadrature et par suite Ie temps de calcul. 2. Nombre de points de la formule de quadrature. Pour dis cuter l'influence de la formule de quadrature nous reprenons les resultats de l'etude du bilan des processus radiatifs faite dans l'article precedent: J 15=1-- S' N S=---. D+i5 (7) (8) La valeur numerique de 15 est due d'une part a la dimension semi-infinie du milieu, d'autre part a la non-linearite de la fonction source qui est tres importante dans Ie cas de Lyrx: il suffit pour s'en convaincre de se reporter a la Figure 7. A une altitude donnee, soit 'tv la profondeur optique de la transition a la frequence v: (9) (lorsque la constante d'amortissement est petite la profondeur optique au centre de la raie est tres peu diiferente de 't).

Lorsque la fonction source varie lentement, ce qui est Ie cas Iorsque Net D sont constants, une formule de quadrature a points relativement espaces donne une assez bonne precision. La fonction source de Ly rx presente une courbure variant tn':s rapidement en fonction de la profondeur optique, que ce soit au voisin age du maximum ou dans les regions plus profondes OU sont formees les ailes du profi!. Les points de la formule de quadrature doivent donc etre serres. Nous avons verifie que la valeur du maximum de la fonction source de Ly rx depend tres fortement de la formule de quadrature choisie au voisin age de XIIf defini par l'Equation (10) pour la profondeur optique 7: du maxi- mum. La valeur de b a cette profondeur est due essentiellement ala non-linearite de la fonction source. Pour limiter Ie temps de caleul nous avons utilise des formules it peu de points, repartis Ie plus judicieusement possible. L'erreur sur Ie maximum de la fonction source est inferieur a 20%. Lorsque la largeur LiAR est trop petite l'intensite du rayonnement des ailes du profil est fortement surestimee; par contre la region centrale du profil depend assez peu de l'etendue des ailes du pfofil utilise. 3. Procede iteratif. Nous verrons plus loin que Ie continu de Lyman est forme a la meme profondeur que les ailes de Ly rx. Les equations de transfert du rayonnement de ces deux transitions sont donc couplees. Si l'on itere en traitant separement Ie continu de Lyman et Ly rx, en introduisant dans les equations de l'equilibre statistique Ie bilan des processus radiatifs de Ly rx, on obtient a la deuxieme iteration une solution tres eloignee de la solution physique, avec de fortes valeurs de b negatives, conduisant a des populations et des intensites de rayonnement negatives. II est donc necessaire de resoudre simultanement les equations de transfert du rayonnement de Ly rx et du continu de Lyman. Les solutions des iterations pour Ly rx et Ie continu de Lyman oscillent aut our de Ja solution. J'ai arrete les caleuls ala geme iteration: I'incertitude relative sur la solu- tion est de l'ordre de grandeur de 10% (par defaut). En substituant a la solution obtenue a la fin d'une iteration une combinaison des solutions de cette iteration et de la precedente il doit etre possible d'accehSrer tres fortement la convergence: trois iterations devraient etre suffisantes.

Nous discuterons les resultats obtenus avec les differents modeles en partant de l'intensite du rayonnement emis dans la region centrale du profil et de fa<;on plus precise en partant de l'intensite maximale du rayonnement. Le Tableau I montre que l'intensite depend des sections de choc, ce qui est justifie par la theorie de la formation de Ly IX: la fonction source aux profondeurs OU est forme Ie corps du profil est determinee par les collisions. L'intensite du rayonnement depend egalement du modele. Le rapport des intensites maximales des profils donnes par les modeles HAOI et de Coates est voisin de 2. Le rapport des termes de collision aux profondeurs 'M des deux modeles est egal a 3,4, Ie rapport des den sites electroniques est egal a 1,5. II semble que Ie facteur densite electronique soit determinant. La variation de l'intensite du rayonnement dans la serie de calcul executee avec les modeles a divers gradients de temperature est due a la densite electronique; Ie maximum de la fonction source est toujours forme a une altitude de temperature electronique peu differente de 20000oK: a I'altitude correspondante la densite electronique est d'autant plus faible que Ie gradient de temperature du modele est lui-meme plus faible. 4.

Dans Ie cas du modele HAOlles termes de collision sont inferieurs aux termes de photoionisation aux profondeurs ou est ferme Ie centre du profil (-r=I, altitude: 2000 km); mais ils en sont assez proches.

Conclusions L'etude des profils theoriques de Ly rx et Ly f3 calcules a partir d'un modele en appli- quant la theorie de la formation des raies de Jefferies et Thomas nous a permis de degager certaines caracteristiques du modele de la haute chromosphere. La depression centrale du profil de Ly f3 est due a un palier de la temperature electronique de la chromosphere. La valeur de la depression, ainsi que celle du profil de Ly rx dependent de la longueur de ce palier. La fonction source de Ly rx, aux profondeurs OU est forme Ie centre du profil, est determinee par les collisions: l'energie emise depend donc de la temperature et de la densite electroniques. Pour les modeles qui donnent une valeur de l'energie compa- rable a celle qui est mesuree, Ie maximum de la fonction source est forme au voisin age de l'altitude de temperature electronique 20000oK. L'energie depend de la densite electronique a l'altitude correspond ante. Le modele de Coates, qui est moins dense que Ie modele HAOI, donne une valeur de l'energie proche de celle qui est mesuree. Enfin l'etude de la formation des pics des profils de Ly rx et Ly f3 permet d'expliquer leur distance et permet de com prendre pourquoi la distance des pics des profils observes de Ly rx est toujours voisine de 0,2 A. Le profil de la raie Hrx donne des renseignements sur la basse chromosphere. L'intensite residuelle du centre du profil est essentiellement determinee par les pro- cessus de photoionisation; cependant l'effet des collisions n'est pas negligeable. Les modeles donnant des termes de collision trop grands, la temperature ou la densite electronique etant trop elevees, donnent une intensite residuelle trop grande."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"CONTRIBUTION A L'ETUDE DU SPECTRE SOLAIRE DE L'HYDROGENE 239 Summary The continuous and line spectrum of hydrogen emitted by the sun is computed, taking deviations of local thermal equilibrium into account, The theory of line formation as given by Jefferies and Thomas has been applied to the computations; a comparison of these results with the observations gives information on the solar atmospheric model. The energy emitted by Lyman rx has been computed for a two- and three-level atom: it appears to increase slightly with the number of levels. The energies, com- puted with the BAO model and the model of Coates, are larger than the observed values. The core of the Lyman rx profile is determined by collisions; the peaks are formed at a height where the electron temperature is about 20000oK; the energy depends very strongly on the electron density of the model. It is shown that the profile of Lyman f3 only shows a central self reversal if the model of the high chromosphere has a temperature plateau. An interpretation of the observed distance of the peaks of the Lyman rx and Lyman f3line profiles is possible; it can also be shown why the distance of the Lyman rx peaks to the line centre is always of the order of 0.2 A. The residual central intensity of Brx increases slightly with the number of atomic levels; the value computed with a five level atom, with the BAO chromospheric model, and the Utrecht photospheric model (1964) does not differ very much from the observed value: it is slightly smaller than the observed value and the computed profile is narrower than the observed profile. In the case of the BAO model the source function of Brx is dominated by the photo-ionization terms; nevertheless, the collision terms are not much smaller than the photo-ionization terms; the residual central intensity of Brx computed with a chromo spheric model similar to the interspicular model of Athay and Thomas but assuming a higher electron temperature and density is larger than the observed value.
