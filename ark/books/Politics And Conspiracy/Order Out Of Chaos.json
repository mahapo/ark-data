Moreover, it is a menace to each and every one of us individually. It is a danger to our family, our way of lif e and our children’s future. You will learn what it is, who is behind it, what they are doing to achieve it and why, and finally how we can ensure its destruction. The bulk of this book consists of names, places and dates. Everything is documented by mainstream media reports . The level of mainstream citation I include was not possible ten years ago but it is today because the agenda is so blatantly in our faces that they have to admit to it. Most of the book concentrates exclusively on new information that has developed since September 11 2001. While I do provide background where it is absolutely necessary, the first chapter for example, many issues are not cove red. Things like the Oklahoma City Bombing or the Kennedy assassination all fi t into the same agenda but they have been so exhaustively documented by other re searchers that it would be a waste of my time to simp ly re-hash old material. This book is merely one of many keys that you will need to unlock the truth and so I suggest you read all the information of the subjects not covered in this book if you haven’t already done so. The hunger, brutality, suffering, genocide a nd horror that has plagued the third world is coming to our shores. But it is not set in stone and we can choose to reverse the evil at any point. Everyone is presented with a chance of influencing the world in whatever field they excel at. However, many spurn the opportunity because they are not prepared to risk deviati ng from the manipulated ‘path’ that has been set for them. “Most people can't think, most of the remainder wo n't think, the small fraction who do think mostly can't do it very well. The extremely tiny fracti on who think regularly, accurately, creatively, and without self-delusion- in the long run, these are the only people who count.” - Robert Heinlein The nature of intelligence as perceived by the conditioned ‘norm’ is judged by how many numbers you can add together or how many names you can put to dates. This is not intelligence of mind - it is system of mind. Systems of mind are like physical machines; they are limited in po tential by the intelligence that built them. Likewise, the systems of mind that masquerade as ‘intelligence’ only function to the standard of fuel that is fed into them in the first place. Systems of mind can be changed at any time by the controller of the system (the government). They can say 2 + 2 = 5 and the vast majority of people will not question it. This proves to us that su ch systems of mind are not ‘intelligence’ because true intelligence is infinite, whole and unchanging. Remembering all the events I write about in this book and matching them with dates, names and places and then telling someone else is not going to get the job done. You need"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"to couple the hard evidence with your own personal insight and this will reach others on a level of true intelligence. Who are ‘they’ and what do ‘they’ want? What's it all about? The New World Order is not a 'conspiracy' in the strictest sense of the term - it is an agenda. T he agenda is orchestrated by a power elite that thinks it has the divine right to commandeer total control of your life. But who are 'they'? Who are the 'power elite'? The UN, the EU, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderberg Gr oup, the Trilateral Commission, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the Royal Inst itute of International Affairs, the Club of Rome. The list goes on and there have been many books written that cover the history of these groups and how they connect to each other. The intention of this book is to highlight how their unifi ed agenda manifests it self in modern day developments with particular attention paid to the Hegelian Dialectic. To research these groups and their unified agenda is to understand who really controls your destiny and where this planet is he ading, unless we speak out against the agenda itself. The agenda is a worldwide consolidation and centralization of power into the hands of an all-encompassing World Govern ment. This system will evolve from the European Union, (already in place) the Americ an Union, (derived from NAFTA) and the Asian Union. When these three models are in existence, they will be merged together to creat e the One World Government. The society and control mechanisms they are manufacturing to 'compliment' this World Government combine the most extreme aspects of communism and fascism, mixed with a nightmare Orwellian technocracy. Specifically (and in no particular order): a microchipped population; a world army; a world centralized banking system; the utter destruction of all national identity and pride; the destruction of all religion except their ow n 'world religion'; the ability to control each and every person through means of mind control (interlocked with the microchip); to bring an end to all industr ialization; to seize control of the environmental movement at the top of the power stru cture and use it for the purposes of continental land-grabs; to init iate a program of population control (via warfare, vaccination, starvation and dis eases) whereby 80% are 'terminated'; to encourage and eventually legaliz e the use of drugs and to make pornography and other expressions of hedonism an 'art form'; to suppress all scientific development except that which aids their agenda (an example being cold fusion and other technologies that would end our dependency on fossil fuels); to demoralize humanity and breed culture to become more and more decadent (meaning when the sick and absurd becomes a cceptable) - this is achieved via drugs, pornography, mindless television, degenerate rock, pop, rap, hip-hop music, among a host of ot hers; to encourage multicultu ralism, immigration, and to brand anyone who opposes these issues as 'racist'; to make pedophilia, rape and sexual conquests acceptable and respect able; to cause total collapse of the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"world's economies and engender political chaos; to penetrate and subvert all governments and coerce them into destroying their country's national sovereignty; to take control of education in the developed world with the intention of suppressing non-consensus informa tion and pushing left-wing, liberal, socialistic viewpoints (Socialism ma squerades as a movement of the downtrodden masses but is in fact clearly an attempt at consolidating wealth and power by the elite); to use terrorism or 'scareorrism' as a means of gaining the consent of the public, who which actually support th is agenda and give up their basic rights if it is presented as the solution to terrorism. There are many caveat goals within this agenda that fall under the umbrella of those mentioned above. You will notice m any of these goals have already been achieved. Ways in which to defeat the agenda are covered later in this book but the main one is simply to know what the agenda is and tell others how it directly affects them. This will stir people from their apathy and make them realize they are under attack. Their survival mechanism wil l kick in, they will become educated on the issues and they will wake their fe llow human. Remember - those who fought and died for freedom in the American Revo lution only had 5% of the population on their side. To avoid having to die for freedom, we need to win the war of information. The New World Order Goes Primetime In the last few years we have seen what some call the externalization of the hierarchy. In other words, the mainstream media has actually reported that there is an agenda to create a global governm ent and it is being implemented by secret societies. One of the most powerful known secret societies is Skull and Bones, which was set up by William H. Russell in the 1830’s and is based on an offshoot of the eighteenth-c entury society, the Illuminat i. It is based at Yale University and calls itself The Brotherhood of Death. George W. Bush admits to being a member in his own autobiogr aphy. In April 2001 journalists for ABC News and the New York Observer were able to film members enacting mock throat-cutting rituals, Most of the speculative lore about the Skull and Bones ritual has centered on its death fixation. Beyond the obvious skull-and-cros sbones insignia, of course, the most persistent story is that initiates spend their senior year in the basement crypt of the Bones Tomb taking turns lying in a coffin and, in two long, intense, psycho-drama autobiographical sessions in said coffins, recount their personal and sexual history to the other 14 chosen ones. The better to bond for life with those they know best and prepare for their destiny as stewards of the ruling class. 1   1 ‘At Skull and Bones, Bush's Secret Club Initiates Ream Gore’ - Ron Rosenbaum – The New York Observer – April 23 2001 - http://www.nyobserver.com/pages/story.asp?ID=4136 "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"[INSERT FIG 1.1] [CAPTION: The Tomb, the home of the Skull and Bones Society at Yale in New Haven, Connecticut.] The 2004 election will likely see George W. Bush run against another Skull and Bones member, John Kerry. A few year s ago, anyone who talked about Skull and Bones was a ‘conspiracy theorist’ – now adays it’s calmly reported on by USA Today , Bonesmen have long helped Bush; he received a fair chunk of his early business financing from them and turned to them for help when he needed a job, investors and campaign assistance. Even his baseball-team purchase involved at least one Bonesman. As president, Bush has appointed fellow Bonesmen to high-level positions, such as Edward McNally, the general counsel of the Office on Homeland Security and senior associate counsel on national security. Yet, although one of his first social gatherings at the White House was a Skull and Bones reunion, Bush feigned ignorance when asked recently about Bones: \"The thing is so secret that I'm not even sure it still exists,\" he replied. 2 The Bilderberg Group is one of the premie r organizations in the manipulation of global developments. There ar e doubtless many higher-lev el groups that we are not aware of. Every year since 1954, the secretive B ilderberg Group (named after the hotel they first met in the Netherlands), co mprising elite powerbr okers from Europe and North America, has met to discuss, and influence, the changing global, political, economic and social landscape. In the early 1990s, a relatively unknown Home Affairs spokesman for the Labour Party, Tony Blair, was invited to a Bilderberg confab. By 1997, he was Prime Minister of Great Britain. Similarly, in the late 80's, a little known Governor of Arkansas by the name of William Clinton gladly accepted an invitation to a Bilderberg. A few years later he was l eader of the so-called 'free' world. William Hague was the Bilderberg me mber who provided the shill, phony 'opposition' to Tony Blair at the last general election. He forwarded a weak anti- European posture that failed dismally . This equated any anti-European (anti- Orwellian power block) mindset as being outdated and smeared with preconceptions of association with the laughable Tory election campaign. Europe is good and loving, sovereignty is evil, ri ght wing, racist and outdated. It's true; I read it in the newspaper. And who owns the newspapers? The Bilderberg Group. Surely senior officials of the Worl d Trade Organization, Federal Reserve, Financial Institutions like Rockefeller (the man himself), the EU and UN World Government models, and cor porate oil conglomerates couldn't belong to the same group as the leading politicians and the media? Well, they do. They all belong to the Bilderberg Group.   2 ‘White House Bonesman leads nation into the dark’ – Alexandra Robbins – USA Today – September 25 2002 - http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2002-09-25-opcom_x.htm "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"So, who belongs to the other quasi-secret steering organizations such as the Council on Foreign Relations and the Tr ilateral Commission?

If it happens, you can bet it was planned that way.\" Franklin D Roosevelt Understanding the Hegelian Dialectic George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was born in 1770 in Germany and became a successful philosopher of the mind, hi story and religion during the 1820’s. Although the Hegelian Dialectic today manifests itse lf differently to how it originated under Hegel, the founding principles remain. Hegel proposed that all spirit ual, intellectual and histor ical development (whether negative or positive) progre ssed from the outcome of two opposing ideals. Thesis clashed with antithesis and this produced synthesis. The modern day application of the dialectic is used by the ruling e lite to create mass groupthink that enables them to further their agenda without opposition. In its simplest form, it is brainwashing. In the past, the dialectic has been used to manufacture war. Both the Bolsheviks and the Nazis were funded and supported by the global elite. These two forces were then made to clash in order to foment the chaos of world war two. The widely used term amongst researchers t oday is ‘Problem-Reaction-Solution’ and the tactic is mainly used to oppre ss populations, advance the police state and further the geopolitical aims of the New World Order. It wo rks like this – the manipulating body covertly creates a problem and then directs the media to incessantly focus on it without recourse. Remember, you only need to control the top of the pyramid – most media coverage is an exercise in regurgitating what the big newspapers and T.V. stations are reporting. The problem could be anything – a war, a financial collapse, a rash of child abducti ons, or a terrorist attack. The power of the media can create the false perception that a big problem exists, even if it doesn’t. An example would be the child abduction ‘epidemic’ during 2002, which was dramatized by t he media even though official figures confirmed that child abductions have been decreasing yearly since the 70’s. Another example is the SARS ‘epidemic ’ of 2003 which was a story created solely out of media hype. SARS killed a few hundred in a few months (at time of press) while the common flu kills 250,000 a year. Once you have created this problem you make sure that an individual, a group or an aspect of society is blamed. This then rallies the population behind the desperate lunge for a solution to the pr oblem. ‘Something must be done!’ they cry in unison. The people that created t he problem in the first place then come back in and offer the solution that the people demand. Remember – the people"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"screaming for a solution do not know that th e problem was artificially created in the first place. The solution to the problem is always a further curtailment of freedom and an advancement of one or more aspects of the New World Order agenda – whether that is geopolitical expansion, new laws or the implantation of new societal worldviews. Let’s look at a few examples. A terrorist attack hits America. Ev en though authorities claim they had no possible inclination that such an attack would happen, the culprits for the attack are named within hours of the event before any type of investigation has been concluded. The pictures of these culprits and their leader are flashed ad infinitum on worldwide television ther efore immediately providing the ‘official version of events’. The horror of the attack is so s ubstantial that people immediately call for a restriction of personal freedoms and a fo reign war to stop it from happening again. In the weeks and months that follo w, the government of America restricts personal freedoms through legislation and launches a foreign war. I just described September 11. A government arms a small country with chemical and biological weapons which it then uses against another country. A fe w years later, the government that armed the country with chemical and bi ological weapons tells its people that there is a problem because a small country has chemical and biological weapons which it might use against another count ry. Despite some opposition, many people agree that the sm all country should be bombed and invaded. The government tells its army to bomb and invade the small country. I just described the first Gulf War and the 2003 war on Iraq. The media tell the people that child abduction is on the increase and is becoming a big problem. Pictures of young innocent children and footage of their crying parents are flashed on television nationwide. The tragedy of these events is so heart-wrenching that people i mmediately call for parents to be licensed, stronger power for the emergency takeover of co mmunications to alert people when a child is abducted, and implantable microc hips that can track children for their safety. The government introduces em ergency legislation and a government- affiliated company announces that they have developed an implantable tracking chip. I just described the child abduction flap of 2002. Understanding the Problem-R eaction-Solution paradigm and how it is being used to steer the world towards a prison planet is the basis of this book. The name of the game is order out of chaos.

None of them can resist kill ing innocent people to further a political agenda. In this context, ruling authorities, in order to ruthlessly centralize power into their own hands have used a tactic conventionally ascribed to terrorists. Nero Fiddled While Rome Burned Nero Claudius Caesar was, by far, one of the most infamous Roman emperors ever. His rule of Rome lasted from AD 54 to 68. A little known fact is that Nero actually began his reign as a fairly popular leader, banning capital punishment, reducing taxes, and letting slaves br ing lawsuits against their masters. However, after around five years, Nero ’s temperament fell apart. His senior advisors began to die and his overbearing eg o came to the fore. Absolute power began to corrupt absolutely. Even before Ro me burned, Nero passed a series of treason laws, which put anyone to death who was considered a threat. This enabled him to eliminate his political ri vals and even his own wife and mother. Nero needed a pretext to justify turn ing the new laws against the civilian population and specifically the Christians who, although still relatively unpopular, were rising in prominence. The Christians lambasted the empire for its decadent practices and Pagan worship. On the night of July 18, 64 AD, a fire star ted that would, after a week, turn 70% of Rome to ash. Historians differ as to whet her or not Nero was actually in Rome when the disaster began. Certainly, Nero re turned to his palace as the fire roared at its peak. He composed poetry and sang as his people burned to death. This is where the saying ‘Nero fiddled while Rome burned’ came from. While Nero fiddled, he had ordered his guards to patrol the streets making sure efforts to extinguish the blaze were thwa rted. Attempts to do so were prevented by Nero’s menacing gangs. Torches were openl y thrown in to fan the flames, by men crying that they acted under orders. These actions caused a rumor to circulat e the city, namely that Nero himself had started the blaze. Whet her he had given the order to start it or simply let it burn is debatable but the consequences are not. Nero immediately blamed the Christians for setting the fire. His only ev idence was that Chri stians had identified other Christians as the perpetrators. This was after they were brutally tortured to make such a confession of course. Sinc e the fires began in the poor area of the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"city, it isn’t logical to suspect the Chri stians. They lived in those poor areas. If they wanted to make a statement why would they burn down their own homes and not Nero’s palace? Nero was the only person who stood to gain from setting the city ablaze. He hated the disjointed layout of the city and wanted to rebuild it in his own image. As soon as the fires were put out, work began on a total redesign of the city along with several new palaces in Nero ’s honor. Meanwhile, the Christian scapegoats were ripped limb from limb by the lions in the circus and used as human torches. Nero had achieved two ai ms by burning Rome or at least allowing it to burn. He had complete ly renovated the city and eliminated an underground threat to both his authority and his ego. Ne ro’s short-term future was secured. However, his act of tyr anny brought about divine retribution. The horrific treatment of the Ch ristians turned them into martyrs, such as Peter and Paul. The people of Rome began to sympat hize with their suffering and Nero’s empire self-destructed after his suicide in AD 68. Diocletian’s Unity in the Empire The Roman Emperor Diocletian came to power in 284 AD. He was an army general with a repressive disdain of hi s subjects. Diocletian ran his government as a general runs an army, giving order s and expecting them to be carried out. He believed that only severe restricti ons on personal freedoms could bring order to the empire. By 301 AD, after the conclu sion of conflicts with the Germans and the Sassanids, Diocletian needed a new enemy to justify his tyrannical form of government. At the same time, the Emperor declared the economy to be in crisis and implemented astronomical taxation increases. Amongst the people there surfaced a gradual unrest towards Dioclet ian's economic policy. The Emperor needed a new enemy to regain the support of his pseudo-slaves. After the earlier successful persecution of the Manichaeans, Diocletian slowly turned his head in the direction of the Chri stians, his thumb pointing down. This came despite the fact that he had largely ignored them for the past fifteen years. Across the empire, Christians made up around ten percent of the population, their number having doubled in about fifty years. Two kings had been converted: the king of Osroene in northeastern Me sopotamia and the king of Armenia. Christians were serving in Rome's a rmies, and they were working as civil servants in local government or in lowly positions on the imperia l staff. Diocletian could see his scapegoat. In the autumn of 302 AD Dio cletian visited Antioch in Syria for an official engagement. Prior to this of course, ther e had to take place the customary Pagan sacrifice. However, this time t here was a problem. As the bloodletting ritual began, so did the vocal denouncem ents of the onlooking Christians. Many made cross signs to ward off the evil in fluence of the sacrifice. Prominent amongst these brave dissenters was a Christian named Romanus. Diocletian"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"fumed, In the first, while Diocletian was sacrificing in public, the chief interpreter of the victims' organs reported that he could not read the future in them because of the hostile influence of Christians standing around. Diocletian burst into a rage, insisti ng that all in his court should offer sacrifice, and sent out orders to his army to follow suit. 1 This provided Diocletian wit h the perfect opportunity to launch his persecution. Romanus had his tongue cut off and languish ed in agony for over a year after in jail. Meanwhile, the Emperor demanded the Christians sacrifice to the gods of the state or face execution. Many refu sed and further retreated underground in the hope of avoiding the manic dict ates of this mad general. Diocletian's vice-emperor, Galerius, di dn't have a hard time in persuading him that if a Palace were just to burn down, Diocletian could really accelerate his crusade against the Christians. Just by coincidence, twice within sixteen days toward the end of Februar y, Diocletian's palace in Nicomedia burned. The Christians were immediately blamed. [INSERT FIG 2.1] [CAPTION: The Emperor Diocle tian needed a crisis to put the purge of the Christians into overdrive. This was accomplis hed when he had his guards set fire to his own palace in Nicomedia on two different occasions at the end of February 303 AD.] A monumental crackdown then occurred as Diocletian issued four edicts against the Christians. Christian assemblies were forbidden. Bibles were confiscated and burned, and churches were destroyed. Christ ians were torn limb from limb in the arena, the animals goaded on by a mindl ess population who had accepted at face value the guilt of the Christians. Others were imprisoned and offered release if they appeased the Emperor's sick P agan blood lust and made one sacrifice. The majority refused, yet Diocletian w anted disunity within the Christian ranks and so had some marked down as having made a sacrifice, even though they didn't. The purges slowly and intermittently dr agged on into the year 305, but by now the Christians had become too numerous ac ross the empire to be wiped out. The despot Diocletian retired through illness in 305 AD. The vice-emperor in the east, Galerius, began a joint rule of the empire with the vice-emperor in Rome and the west: Constantius. Constantius died in ba ttle in 306 AD and his son, Constantine, succeeded him. The thousands of Christi ans butchered by Diocletian in the purge had not died in vain. Constantine was to change the world by becoming the first Christian emperor.

In early 1933 the German Weim ar Republic was awash with different parties lobbying for control. Although the Nazi’s had the majority, this was not enough to give Hitler the unchallenged and unaccountab le office he craved. Furthermore, the Nazi’s were losing momentum in t he months preceding the election, which was set for March 1933. When Herman Goering took control of t he Prussian state police, he replaced officers loyal to the Republic with officers loyal only to Hitler. These SA and SS were trained to despise so-called enem ies of the state and after raiding Communist headquarters in Berlin they acqui red a full roster of Communist Party members. The round up list was already in place. Hitler had erected the police state he would later put to use in antic ipation of the immi nent burning of the Reichstag. In February of 1933, Herman Goering, Joseph Goebbels and Hitler finalized a plan to cause chaos by burning the Re ichstag parliament building and then blaming it on their political adversaries , the Communists. The three had obviously studied the actions of Nero hundreds of years before. In the week preceding February 27, a mentally retarded Dutchman named Marinus van der Lubbe wandered around Berlin attempting to set fi re to government buildings. The state police, now under Hitler’s contro l, refused to arrest him. After stalking the area all day, on t he night of Februar y 27, van der Lubbe somehow managed to break in the guarded Reichstag. He removed his shirt and set it on fire, vainly attemp ting to spread the relatively confined blaze to a wider area within the building. He received a large dose of help when Hitler’s storm troopers, led by SA leader Karl Er nst, used an underground passageway that connected Goering’s cellar with the cellar in the Reichstag. They entered the building and scattered gasoline and incendiari es to feed the flames. Once they had suitably increased the blaze they escaped back through the tunnel. Hitler and Goebbels, his propaganda minister , immediately rushed to the scene of the fire and screamed at German news r eporters that the Communists were to blame. Hitler stated, \"You are now witnessi ng the beginning of a great epoch in German history...This fire is the beginn ing,\" and from this moment onwards the official story of the ‘Comm unist plot’ was repeated ad infinitum across the world’s media.

Despite massive waves of propaganda, the Nazis only achieved 44 per cent of the total vote. Hitler needed a two-thirds majority in order to legally dismantle the Republic and install himself as Fuhrer. [INSERT FIG 2.2] [CAPTION: The Reichstag burns, Hitler takes control.] After the elections, Hitler used his em ergency decree, along with the SS and SA, to raid the offices of local governm ent and throw out anyone unsympathetic to the Nazi regime, replacing them with t hose loyal only to him. This is how he would subsequently achieve the majority he needed to become dictator. In the meantime, Hitler pressured President Hindenburg to si gn more draconian edicts, making it an offence to criticize the Na zis and setting up military tribunals where the defense is afforded no jury or legal counsel. These measures steamrolled many Reichstag members into intimidat ion and ensured their support through fear. On March 23 the newly elected Reichstag me t in the Kroll Opera House in Berlin and passed Hitler’s Enabling Act. This a llowed Hitler to basically abolish the German constitution and proclaim himsel f legal dictator. Hitler’s carefully managed brutal police state tactics had ensured more than two thirds were frightened enough to pass the act. The Na zis had the majority they needed and could now build the dreaded Third Reich. This dictatorship would never have occurred if Hitler hadn’t eliminated his enemies and the German Republic by burning the Reichstag in February 1933. Treason at Pearl Harbor On the Sunday morning of December 7 1941, against the Pearl Harbor naval base in Hawaii, Japanese Adm. Chuichi Nagumo's Operation Z carrier task force launched its attack that des troyed nearly 200 American aircraft, sank five battleships, severely damaged three cr uisers, three destroyers and three auxiliaries, and killed 2,476 U.S. servicemen and civilians.   3 ‘The Decrees of 1933’ - http://web.jjay.cuny.edu/~jobrien/reference/ob60.html"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"In 1941 the U.S. believed that war with Japan was inevitable and that the United States should provoke it at a time t hat suited its own interests. Analysts recommended an eight-point plan, known as the McCollum Memo, designed to provoke a Japanese attack. The plan in cluded military provocations and a recommendation to completely embargo a ll trade with Japan in collaboration with a similar embargo by the British Empire. The US cited Japan’s continued wars on the Asian mainland as the reason for placing embargoes (mainly o il) on them. The real r eason behind such measures was that America knew this would force Japan into an attempted seizure of oil and mineral riches in Indonesia. In order to do this, the Japanese would have to nullify the threat of the American fleet stationed at P earl Harbor. In order to enrage the American public into supporting the war effort t hat the American government sought to engage in, President Franklin Roosevelt needed to ensure that Japan’s first strike seemed as dram atic, surprising and bloody as possible. As a consequence, Roosevelt kept many in the dark as to what his administration was hatching. Even some of his own co mmanders in Hawaii never knew what was coming, that way Pearl Harbor woul d be written into the history books as one of the most shocking and unprovoked acts of war. As the world went about its unwitting business, the propaganda wa s being carefully prepared for the events that were about to take place. Soon enough, the psychological war would also kick into operation on American soil, and the mindset of the American public forever altered. To emphasize how desperate the Roosevelt administration were to enter the first world war, the Scotsman reported that hundreds of fo rmer prisoners of war in the Philippines were deliberately blocked from leaving the country by order of the then American President, so their capture by the Japanese could be used as propaganda in the U.S. to stoke war fever, A former prisoner has uncovered papers in the US National Archive that she claims prove the government restricted the travel of 7,000 American citizens from the Philippines, while at the same time encouraging evacuation of Americans from other potential Japanese targets in China and south-east Asia. A federal lawsuit filed yesterday in Washington, DC , alleges that the government at first wanted to keep Americans in the Philippines to discourage Japanese aggression, but later used them as a political tool. A group of 500 former prisoners claim the plan was devised by the US wartime leader, Franklin D Roosevelt, with the approval of Winston Church ill, Britain’s Prime Minister, to cause outrage among American citizens unwilling to back a war on Japan. Americans were denied passport and travel document s to let them flee. They were later captured by the Japanese and held in notorious camps under appalling conditions. Marcia Fee Achenbach, one of those captured, was four when her camp was liberated by US soldiers in 1944. She discovered the papers while doing research in the National Archive. Among the evidence uncovered was a telegram that Francis Sayre, the high commissioner of the"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Philippines, had sent to the US state depar tment urging an evacuation plan. The state department’s confidential reply read: \"Visualise the remaining of Americans generally in the Philippines in an emergency, and plan accordingly.” Other evidence includes a letter from one of the commissioner’s secret aries indicating that officials were not to issue passports. The secret ary states that she wrote more than 5,000 letters rejecting passport applications during the build up to Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor. 4 De-classified documents show that the Pentagon had prior knowledge of the attack on Pearl Harbor, indeed, that they provoked and instigated the “unprovoked” attack and did nothing to stop it. A July 22 1941 report by Admi ral Richmond Turner read, It is generally believed that shutting off the American supply of petroleum will lead promptly to the invasion of Netherland East Indies... it seems cert ain that she (Japan) would also include military action in the Philippine islands which would immediately involve us in a Pacific war. 5 Also, a Top Secret Army Board report of October 1944 clearly states that in the period leading up to Pearl Harbor, the US military received information regarding the intentions of the Japanese to declare war, including specific details of when the attack on Pearl Harbor would occur, In this period numerous pieces of information came to our State, War and Navy Departments in all of their top ranks indicating precisely the in tentions of the Japanese including the probable exact hour and date of the attack. 6 On November 24th, 1941, Admiral Isor oku Yamamoto sent a radio message to Admiral Chuichi Nagumo, Commander of th e Pacific Striking Fleet, which read, The task force, keeping its movement strict ly secret and maintaining close guard against submarines and aircraft, sha ll advance into Hawaiian wate rs, and upon the very opening of hostilities shall attack the main fo rce of the United States fleet in Hawaii and deal it a mortal blow. 7 This message was intercepted in Hawaii at a radio intercept station known as \"Station H\" overlooking Kaneohe Bay on windward Oahu. The information was passed on to Lieutenant Commander Geor ge Pease of the Office of Naval Intelligence on December 4 1941, three days before the atta ck.

Operation Northwoods – Lies, Provocation and th e Masterminding of Terror It has been officially revealed via declass ified government docum ents that the US military and government has covertly pl anned to perpetrate acts of terror upon innocent civilians in order to justify an engagement in conflict t hat would have, at the time, benefited the government’s wider geopolitical agenda. In 1962 at the height of the Cold War, The Joint Chie fs of Staff, under the chairmanship of General Lyman L. Lemnitzer, drew up plans to create and launch a war on Cuba based solely on a fabric of lies. Thes e lies revolved around the murder of hundreds of Americans. According to ABC News , In the early 1960s, America's top military leaders reportedly drafted plans to kill innocent people and commit acts of terrorism in U.S. cities to create public support for a war against Cuba. 9 Long hidden documents, uncovered in 2001 by former ABC News investigative reporter James Bamford, code-nam ed OPERATION NORTHWOODS, put a haunting perspective behind the events of September 11. The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) documents propose launching a se cret and violent war of terrorism against their own country in order to condition the people of the USA into supporting an intended war against Cuba. These sickening plans called for innocent American civilians to be shot, for Cuban refugees to be blown up, for violent and continued acts of terrorism to be perpetrated in ma jor American cities, for innocents to be framed for bombings , and for planes to be hijacked. This would then be blamed on Fidel Castro and Cuba, thus inciting hatred for him and Communism, and instigating the public backing that the JCS needed as an   8 ‘US 'fired first shot' at Pearl Harbor’ – Rupert Cornwell – London Independent – August 30 2002 - http://news.independent.co.uk/world/a mericas/story.jsp?story=328705 9 ‘Friendly Fire’ – David Ruppe – ABC News – May 1 2001 - http://abcnews.go.com/sections/us/DailyNews/jointchiefs_010501.html "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"excuse to launch the pre-planned war. [INSERT FIG 2.4] [CAPTION: ABC News reports on Operation Northwoods.] The first instance of deception on the par t of the JCS was to the new president, John F. Kennedy, telling him that Amer ica should press ahead with an invasion of Cuba that would trigger an internal upr ising against Fidel Castro, thus ensuring his speedy downfall. This was a total lie. The CIA itself had reports that stated that the majority of the Cuban public looked upon Castro as a hero after he had ousted the excessive and repressive regi me of Batista two years previously. Those people were unaware of the future horrors Castro had planned for them but the point is that any uprising against Castro was very unlikely at this time. Indeed, Lemnitzer himself knew this to be the case and would later refer to the CIA Bay Of Pigs operation that follow ed as ‘The Cuban debacle’. Nevertheless, at the time Lemnitzer and the JCS submitted a positive recommendation for the operation, possibly knowing that the CIA led invasion would fail and that he could then push for a more active involvement in Cuba and around the world, for himself, the Pentagon and the JCS. After the inevitably bungled Bay of Pigs operation, responsibility for dealing with Cuba was shifted from the CIA to t he Pentagon, where the project would be known as OPERATION MONGOOSE. Under the guise of Lemnitzer and Air- Force One star General Edward G. Lans dale, the Pentagon saw its opportunity to further remove itself from civilian aut hority, particularly that of JFK who was seen by many generals as a ‘no win ch ief’ who did not understand military judgments. Military officials craved for the good old days of jurisdiction under the military mind of president Eisenhower, and many government elites were also this way inclined. By February 1962 it was clear that an upris ing in Cuba was highly unlikely. In addition, it was generally accepted that Ca stro had no desire to attack America or anything belonging to America. Lansdale had also been told to drop all anti- Castro efforts by Robert Kennedy, and t he JCS saw their opportunities slipping away. There was only one option left fo r Lemnitzer and Lansdale, and that was NORTHWOODS. The strategy of NORTHWOODS was outlined, US military intervention will result from a period of heightened US-Cuban tensions which place the United States in the position of suffering ju stifiable grievances. World opinion, and the United Nations forum should be favorably affected by dev eloping the international image of the Cuban government as rash and irresponsible, and as an alarming and unpredictable threat to the peace of the Western Hemisphere. 10   10 ‘Justification for US Military Intervention in Cuba’ – Joint Chiefs of Staff Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense – March 13 1962 – p5 – available at http://www.propagandamatrix.com/northwoods.pdf "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" It is clear that Lemnitz er and the JCS had gone over the edge. They admitted that the operation would mean a sur ge in both Cuban and American casualties, but that they intended to go ahead with it anyway. The Northwoods document goes into extensive detail about the propos ed actions that the operation would involve, (1) Start rumors (many). Use clandestine radio. (2) Land friendly Cubans in uniform “over the fence” to stage attack on US base. (3) Capture Cuban (friendly) saboteurs inside the base. (4) Start riots near the base main gate (friendly Cubans) (5) Blow up ammunition inside the base; start fires. (6) Burn aircraft on air base (sabotage) (7) Lob mortar shells from outside of base into base. Some damage to installations. (8) Capture assault teams approaching from the sea or vicinity of Guantanamo City. (9) Capture militia group which storms the base (10) Sabotage ship in harbor; large fires - - naphthalene (11) Sink ship near harbor entrance. Conduct funerals for mock victims. 11 The later sections of the report begin to outline the plots of te rror that the U.S. Government would covertly instigate upon innocent people. The first suggestion was to re-create an incident of 1898 w hen a mysterious explosion aboard the battleship Maine in Havana Harbor killed 266 US soldiers and sparked the Spanish-American war. The horrific explosion influenced more than a million volunteers for duty and is now widely c onsidered to have been an act of treason where the U.S. attacked itself to cr eate an enemy and a pretext. The Northwoods document continues, A Remember the Maine incident could be arranged in several forms: a. We could blow up a ship in Guantanamo Bay and blame Cuba. b. We could blow up a drone (unmanned vesse l) anywhere in the Cuban waters...The presence of Cuban planes or ships merely investigating t he intent of the vessel could be fairly compelling evidence that the ship was taken under attack... Casualty lists in the newspapers would cause a helpful wave of national indignation...We could develop a communist Cuban terror campaign in the Miami areas, in other Florida cities and even in Washington...the terror campaign could be pointed at Cuban refugees seeking haven in the Un ited States. We could sink a boat load of Cubans enroute to Florida (real or simulated) . We could foster attempts on lives of Cuban refugees in the United States... 12 The JCS then go on to discuss how they could actually shoot down a mock chartered civil aircraft and blame Cuba, Hijacking attempts against civil air and surface cr aft should appear to continue as harassing measures condoned by the government of Cuba...It is possible to create an incident which will demonstrate convincingly that a Cuban aircraft has attacked and shot down a chartered civil air liner enroute from the US to Jamaica, Guatem ala, Venezuela or Panama. The destination would be chosen only to cause the flight plan route to cross Cuba. The passengers could be a group of college students off on a holiday, or any group of persons with a common interest to support   11 Ibid p10-11 12 Ibid p11"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"chartering a non-scheduled flight... 13 The plan was to replace said aircraft wit h an identical drone, flown by remote control, and land the original plane at an air force base where passengers, boarded under prepared aliases, would be evacuated. The drone would then fly the route and when over Cuba, emit a di stress signal before being destroyed by radio signal. A further plan concerning a plane involv ed a USAF craft appearing to be shot down by Cuban MIGs in an ‘unprovoked atta ck’ over international waters. The pilot would broadcast that he was under attack and then cease all transmission. He would then fly back to a base wher e the plane would be given a new tail number and the pilot would resume his real identity. Then a US submarine would disperse some destroyed plane parts in the water. Thus the result is a missing plane, pilot and wreckage in international wa ters after reports of an attack by MIG aircraft. I would emphasize that before t hese documents became well known, government officials denied their very existence, even though they had been unclassified and released by the National Se curity Archive. Anyone with Internet access can read them and yet Robert S. McNamara, Kennedy's defense secretary states, \"I never heard of it. I can't believe the chiefs were talking about or engaged in what I would call CIA-type operations.” 14 As a caveat, if Northwoods had the hallm ark of the CIA then what has that particular agency carried out t hat we are not aware of? Operation Northwoods reminds us, as if it were needed, that governments owe no allegiance to the people that elect t hem. The cry that ‘the y’d never do that’ can be dismissed with hard evidence – gov ernment documents. The Joint Chiefs would have carried out the plan if Kenne dy hadn’t blocked it. This outright rejection was one of the reasons behind Kennedy’s assassination little over a year later. The Gulf of Tonkin – Organized Deception The Vietnam War killed one million Vi etnamese and 58,000 Americans. It was launched after two incidents in August 1964, the first of which was provoked and the second never happened. With careful av oidance of the fact s, then president Lyndon Baines Johnson was able to ram th rough the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, denouncing those who raised suspicious voic es as anti-Americ an, and receiving a validation for war.

The ship was actually attacked bec ause it was part of a joint CIA-South Vietnamese covert intelligence oper ation called ‘Operation Plan 34A,’ The CIA-South Vietnamese covert force cond ucted airborne, maritime and overland agent- insertion operations. S outh Vietnamese covert operatives were to gather intelligence, recruit support, establish bases of resistance and carry out psychological operations behind enemy lines. The maritime operation began as an infiltration operation. But beginning in June 1962, with the loss of the vessel Nautelas II and four command os, it evolved into hit-and-run attacks against North Vietnamese shore and island installation s by South Vietnamese and foreign mercenary crews on high-speed patrol boats. 16 Far from being an ‘unprovoked attack’ as President Lyndon Johnson had stated, the attack was an expected retaliation as a result of aggressive CIA-South Vietnamese maneuvers. Johnson himself a cknowledged Operat ion Plan 34A in recently released White House tape recordings, \"There have been some covert operations in that (Tonkin Gulf) area that we have been carrying on - blowing up some bridges and things of that kind, roads and so forth. So I imagine (the North Vietnamese) wanted to put a stop to it.\" 17 The second incident occurred two days later on August 4. The USS Maddox and the USS C. Turner Joy r eported a second attack, this one occurring within 17 hours of 34-Alpha raids on No rth Vietnamese facilities at Cap Vinh Son and Cua Ron. Earlier that day the National Secu rity Agency had warned that an attack on the Maddox appeared imminent. The early reports stated that four unidentified vessels had approached the Maddox at high speed and launched 20 torpedo missiles. The U.S. responded by firing 249 5-inch shells, 123 3-inch shells and four or five depth charges. Around two hours later, Adm.

There was nothing but black water and American firepower.” 18 In 1965, Lyndon Johnson stated, “For a ll I know, our Navy was shooting at whales out there.\" 19 If this was all the President knew, and numerous intelligence cables throughout the day indicated that no attack had taken place, why on the evening of August 4 did he declare, “The initial attack on the destroyer Maddox, on August 2, was repeated today by a number of hostile vessels attacking two U.S. destroyers with torpedoes. The destroyers and supporting aircraft acted at once on the orders I gave after t he initial act of aggression. We believe at least two of the attacking boats were sunk. There were no U.S. losses.” 20 There were no U.S. losses because no U. S. ships were under attack. The whole incident was staged. Some argue that co mmanders did initially believe they had been attacked. If this is so then why, nine hours after it had been established that no attack took place, did the President s ound the war cry to millions of American people? The plan to launch a war on a fabric of lies had clearly been in place for many weeks or months. This was the reward after the Gulf of Tonkin resolution passed almost unanimously just days a fter the ‘attacks’. Another manufactured crisis set the scene for the slaughter of millions of unwitting troops on both sides of the subsequent conflict. The history of tyranny is the history of ruthless indi viduals and ruling elites, who launch wars against both countries and populations by creating acceptable justification. This excuse is only m ade possible because those seemingly ‘under attack’ have in fact attacked themselv es and identified a useful scapegoat. It is important to understand that while the real story behind these events was confined to being regarded as rumor at t he time in some instances, subsequent historical record and government doc uments confirm all of the details.

David Shayler worked for MI5 for over six years before quitti ng in 1997. Amongst other departments he primarily worked for G branch, the international terrorism desk. Shayler headed the agency’s Libyan sect ion for around two years. During this period he developed a good working relationship with his opposite number in MI6. In 1995 Shayler gained access to se cret MI6 documents concerning a plot to assassinate Colonel Mu'ammar G addafi, the Libyan Head of State. [INSERT FIG 3.1] [CAPTION: Former MI5 agent David Shayler pictured here with his girlfriend, Annie Machon. Shayler wa s arrested for revealing British in telligence links to international terrorist organizations.] Mu'ammar Gaddafi was born in the desert near Sirte in 1942. He overthrew the Libyan monarchy in 1969 and launched a cultural revolution to remove traces of imported ideology. He has supported a br oad range of militant groups including the IRA and the Palestine Liberation Organiza tion. Alleged Libyan involvement in attacks in Europe in 1986 led to US milit ary strikes against Tripoli. For several decades Gaddafi tried to portray himself as leader of the Arab world, and has now taken up the mission of uniting Africa. A document released on the Internet by Shayler confirms MI6 had foreknowledge of the Gadaffi assassination plot. Shayle r insists he has further information to prove MI6 paid a Libyan member of t he Al-Qaeda terrorist network at least £100,000 ($156,000) to lead a 20 man team in carrying out the operation. This agent was code named TUNWORTH, his MI6 handler was code named PT16. In a press release Shayler stated, We need a statement from the Prime Minister and th e Foreign Secretary clarifying the facts of this matter. In particular, we need to know how around £100,000 of taxpayers' money was used to fund the sort of Islamic Extremists who hav e connections to Osama Bin Laden's Al Qaeda network. Did ministers give MI6 permission for this ? By the time MI6 paid the group in late 1995 or early 1996, US investigators had already es tablished that Bin Laden was implicated in the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center. Given the timing and the close connections between Libyan and Egyptian Islamic Extremists, it may ev en have been used to fund the murder of British citizens in Luxor, Egypt in 1996. 1   1 Press release by David Shayler – November 11 2001 – available at http://cryptome.org/shayler-gaddafi.htm"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The assassination attempt was carried out in early 1996 but failed with tragic consequences. ‘TUNWORTH’ was to place a bomb under Gaddafi’s convoy. However, he foolishly placed the bomb under the wrong car, killing six innocent bystanders. Despite former British Forei gn Secretary Robin Cook describing the allegation as ‘fantasy,’ a 2001 Metropolitan Police inve stigation sought no charges against David Shayler for perjury or wasting po lice time, confirming that his detailed sworn statement was honest, reliable and true. How can it be that the fo reign intelligence agency of the British government was colluding with Al-Qaeda terrorists who had already been charged with the 1993 World Trade Center bombing? Several of th ese individuals are still at large, appearing on the FBI’s most wanted terrorists list. The 1994 bombing of the Israeli Embassy was one of the worst terrorist bombings London has seen. A 50-pound (22 kg) car bomb injured 13 and almost destroyed the embassy. Later that night a second bomb injured six people at the London offices of Britain's main Jewish c harities and pro-Israel institutions. A previously unknown group, the Palestinian Resistanc e Jaffa Group, claimed credit for the attacks. Two Pa lestinians were later convicted for the attacks. The presiding judge said it was only \"providenc e\" that more people were not seriously injured or killed. Shayler alleges that the British inte lligence service MI5 was warned in advance of the bombing, yet it took no action, faili ng even to tip off the police or the Israeli government. The warning, a written r eport from a highly trusted source, was sent for assessment to a desk officer in MI5's international terro rism section. After she failed to act on the report, it was late r found buried in the filing cupboard of another officer, leading to speculation of a bungled cover up. Neither officer was disciplined and MI5 management failed to in stitute procedures to prevent the recurrence of such an incident. Shayler would have obviously been in a posit ion to learn of the cover up. He also worked at G branch, the inte rnational terrorism desk. Responding to the revelations, Israel's ambassador to Britain Moshe Raviv said, \"This story is completely new to me. The Embassy had passed on to the Foreign Office general warnings based on information from Jerusalem. These warnings had been sent to a number of our embassies and as a consequence we had asked the Foreign Office to step up security and vigilance at the Embassy in London. If this informati on is correct, it is amazing that greater efforts"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"were not made to prevent the attacks.\" 2 Shayler also made the allegation that MI 5 had prior knowledge of numerous IRA bombings in London, most notably the 1993 Bishopsgate bombing, in which an IRA truck bomb devastated the Bishops gate area of London's financial district, killing one and injuring 44. Shayler’s July 2000 Punch Magazine article entitled ‘MI5 could have stopped the bomb going off’ detailed how MI5, the po lice anti-terrorist br anch and GCHQ - the government's electronic eavesdropping c enter, had tracked the bombers for six months before the operation and were fully aware of the specifics of the plot before it was carried out. Punch was fined £5,000 for contempt of co urt but the charge was later reversed on appeal. However, the back issue contai ning the article cannot be sold in Britain. I personally ordered a copy but ended up with a refund after being told that particular issue was unavailable. The article in full is available on the Internet. 3 As I will later document, the Bishopsgate case is just one example of MI5’s link to Irish Republican terrorism. The Gag Shayler’s revelations were first pub lished in a series of reports for the Mail on Sunday in August 1997. From this point onwar ds, all articles by or about David Shayler had to be passed through a special branch of the Ministry of Defence, whereupon the attorney general, Lord William s, scanned them for any details that would breach the 1989 Official Secrets Act. The publishers were then told whether or not they were allowed to print the report. The British government had appointed itself as state censor. Thei r argument that publishing Shayler’s information would breach national security can be debunked by the very fact that their own intelligence agencies are a threat to national security by way of their treasonous behavior. Following the Mail on Sunday expose, Shayler fled to France in an attempt to avoid arrest.

This exchange continued up until Shayler’s return to the UK when his tria l for violating the Official Secrets Act commenced in October 2002. On Monday October 7th 2002, numerous arti cles appeared in British newspapers specifying how top Labour cabinet member s were intimidating the judge of the Shayler case, Justice Alan Moses. MP’s such as Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and Home Secretary David Blunkett were tr ying to force Moses to accept Public Interest Immunity Certificates that woul d make part of the case, i.e. the £100,000 bin Laden transfer, secret. Upon mention of this mate rial, media and public would have to leave the courtroom. By the evening of October 7th, the Br itish newspaper reports had either been removed from their respective web site s or completely amended. The original London Guardian report that was la ter erased stated, Ministers have demanded that part of the trial of David Shayler, the former MI5 officer, which starts at the Old Bailey today, be held in secret in what lawyers say is an unprecedented attempt to influence the course of criminal proceeding s. The home secretary, David Blunkett, and the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, have signed public interest imm unity certificates - a device designed to gag a court - insisting that the media an d the public leave if activities of the security and intelligence agencies are raised by the defence Government officials and lawyers persuaded the two cabinet ministers to sign the PII certificates after they learned that Mr Shayler intended to defend himself at the trial. They appear to be worried that he will make further allegations about MI5 and MI6 knowledge of a plot to assassinate the Libyan leader, Muammar Gadafy, in 1996. A book, Forbidden Truth, published this summer claims that British intelligence was in contact with \"Osama bin Laden's main allies\" who were opposed to Colonel Gadafy. 4 By the late evening of October 7th, the London Evening Standard and the Scotsman had also removed their original reports concerning the trial. The London Evening Standard were forced to censor the following, Shayler will be defending himself during the trial. He is expected to claim that British secret service agents paid up to £100,000 to al Qaeda terrorists for an assassination attempt on Libyan leader Colonel Gadaffy in 1996. He is seeking perm ission to plead a defence of \"necessity\" - that he acted for the greater good by reveali ng wrongdoing by the security service. 5 Whereas the Scotsman , before completely changing t he nature of the article, stated, The renegade agent, who faces six years imprisonment for breaching the Official Secrets Act after making a number of sensational revelations about MI5 to a national newspaper in 1997, will   4 ‘Ministers issue gag orders for MI 5 trial’ – Richard Norton-Taylor – London Guardian - October 7 2002 – available at www.propagandamatrix.com/ministers_issue_gag_orders_for_mI5_trial.htm 5 ‘Calls for secret Shayler trial’ - Patrick McGowan – London Evening Standard – October 7 2002 - http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/articles/1488303 "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"represent himself for part of the landmark case.

He also claimed the secret services ignored warnings that might have prevented bombings in the London in 1993 and 1994. 6 It became apparent that a D-No tice had been issued to gag the story. A D-Notice is a mandate emanating from an office of the Ministry of Defence called the Defence Advisory Committee, effectively silencing any media report that is considered harmful to nati onal security implications. Luckily, I had already saved and printed these deleted stories, which ena bled me to use them as a basis for an article I would subsequently write for my web site, entitled ‘ShaylerGate.’ After I advised my readers to mass E ma il the British media, asking them why they had deleted these stories, the London Guardian was forced to print a small blurb in its October 8 edition which read, An Old Bailey court yesterday heard legal arguments relating to the trial of David Shayler, the former MI5 officer charged with breaking the Offi cial Secrets Act. The judge ruled that they cannot be reported. 7 So in effect, using the analogy of Ru ssian dolls, the British government had gagged the gag. They had ensured parts of the Shayler trial remain secret and at the same time, prevented the mainstream British press from reporting on the very debate of whether that was in the public interest. An Australian newspaper later confirmed this, The British media have been gagged from reporti ng sensational courtroom evidence of former MI5 spy David Shayler, including his alleged proof that the British secret service paid $270,000 for al Qaeda terrorists to assassinate Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 1996. In its efforts to contain Mr Shayler's allegations to the privacy of the court, the government has even stopped the media from reporting its successful attempt to win a gag order. The British media widely reported on Monday that lawyers acting for Mr Shayler had accused the government of trying to \"intimidate\" Justice Mo ses. But on Tuesday the newspapers - many of which had mounted their own legal case against t he application of the ce rtificates - reported simply that the court had heard legal arguments relating to Mr Shayler's trial. \"The judge ruled that they (the legal arguments) cannot be reported,\" The Guardian reported. Although Mr Shayler's jury trial is expected to begi n next week in the Old Bailey, any evidence relating to sensitive security or intelligence matte rs will be kept private. After the judge's ruling on Monday, several articles detailing Mr Shayler' s anticipated evidence - and the government's efforts to keep it secret - were withdrawn from newspaper websites across the country. 8 Note that according to The Age , the Al-Qaeda payoff was even greater, standing   6 ‘Renegade MI5 agent ready to face jury’ – Karen McVeigh – The Scotsman – October 7 2002 – available at http://www.propagandamatrix.com/renegade_mi5_agent_to_face_jury.htm 7 ‘Shayler Hearing’ – Richard Norton-Taylor – London Guardian – October 8 2002 - http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,806640,00.html 8 ‘Media gag on alleged plot to kill Gaddafi’ – Paul Daley – The Age – October 10 2002 - http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/10/09/1034061258269.html "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"at £170,000.

The Security Service has at least two agents working in every major newspap er office.

The argument that the st ory was gagged because it c ontravened the Official Secrets Act and was a threat to national se curity does not hold sway. Recall, this was the same Labour government that befor e it came to power argued vigorously to amend the Official Secrets Ac t to protect whistleblowers. The story was gagged because at that time its implications would severely undermine both the validity of the war on terrorism and the rhetoric behind the impending invasion of Iraq. Jack Straw, the British Foreign Secr etary who issued one of the PII gag certificates, was involved in soliciting illegal weapons trans fers to numerous countries, deals that directly contravene international protocol. As I document elsewhere in this book, Britain has been caug ht shipping arms to India, Pakistan, Israel and Iran – directly fomenti ng instability in those regions. In addition, Shayler insists he has more revelations concerning the British tool company Matrix Churchill and the arms to Iraq scandal, which originally broke under the former Tory government. Again, th is is covered in detail elsewhere in this book. I have no doubt, and the man himself has pub licly stated so, that Shayler has even more damaging information concerning British intelligence collusion with the very organizations we are told are our supposed enemies. A £100,000+ Al- Qaeda payoff, after they had bombed the World Trade Center in 1993, may only be scratching the surface. The paranoid and authoritarian reaction of the British governm ent in censoring both the Gadaffi plot and David Shayler’s trial begs the question - what else do they have to hide? Protecting bin Laden’s Lieutenants In September of 2002, one year after the attacks on New York and Washington, French intelligence officials angrily accused MI5 of failing to cooperate in stifling Islamic terrorist groups.

Qatada is described by many as the leader and mastermind of Al-Qaeda's European netwo rk. Videos of Mr Qatada's speeches were found in the Hambur g flat of Mohamed Atta, w ho is believed to have been the leader of the September 11 hijackers. 9 Qatada has links with terror suspects in Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Britain and S pain. Baltasar Garzon, a Spanish National High Court judge charged with leading Spain's Al-Qaeda crackdown, named Qatada as the \"spiritual head of the mujahi deen in Britain.” 10 In 1993 Qatada was sentenced to life impris onment, in his absence, by a court in Jordan for his involvement in a terrorist bombing campaign. He escaped jail by fleeing to West London and bought a house in Acton. Claiming political refugee status, he avoided extradition. After September 11th, Qat ada was identified as a ‘specially designated global terrorist’ by a US executive order. 11 He was also categor ized by the British Treasury as ‘believed to have committed, or pose, a significant risk of committing or providing material suppor t for acts of terrorism.’ 12 Qatada disappeared from his London home in December 2001, just befor e the implementation of new anti- terrorism legislation would have finally paved the way for him to be deported. In the summer of 2002 a sensational Time Magazine report revealed where exactly Qatada had gone, Senior European intelligence officials tell TIME that Abu Qatada is tucked away in a safe house in the north of England, where he and his family are being lodged, fed and clothed by British intelligence services. \"The deal is that Abu Qatada is deprived of contact with extremists in London and Europe but can't be arrested or expel led because no one officially knows where he is,\" says the source, whose claims were corr oborated by French authorities. \"The British win because the last thing they want is a hot potato t hey can't extradite for fear of al-Qaeda reprisals but whose presence contradicts London's support of the war on terror. 13 Despite official denial French anti-terrorist officers stated on the record that they were certain MI5 were protecting Qa tada, and in addition believed they had actually colluded in his disappearance.

The leaders of the ‘war on terrorism’ seem to treat high-level Al-Qaeda members with reverence, even recruiting them as agents. Why wasn’t Qatada sent to be held in U. S. military custody at Guantanamo Bay? He is a known Al-Qaeda terrorist, ex presses support to Osama bin Laden’s ideals and is named, in British government documents, as highly likely to be involved in future acts of terrorism. Qatada wasn’t transferred to Guantanamo because he act ually was a terrorist, unlike the other ‘residents’ of the naval brig. A Guantanam o official, quoted in the Los Angeles Times , stated, “some of these guys lit erally don’t know the world is round.” 15 The same report detailed how U.S. authorities had yet to identify any senior Al Qaeda leaders among the nearly 600 terror suspects from 43 countries being held at Guantanamo Bay. The torture camp consisted of nothing more than a group of goat herders that had been given a gun and thrown onto the front line by the Taliban. As the Qatada case highlights, the r eal Al-Qaeda and Taliban leadership were whisked away to safety by orders of U.S. and British intelligence.

The Real IRA: MI5 For more than 30 years, Catholics and Pr otestants have fought bitterly over whether Northern Ireland shoul d belong to Ireland or to Britain. The conflict has left 3,600 people dead on both sides and mo re than 30,000 injured. There was hope in 1998, when the landmark Good Fr iday peace agreement was reached. The agreement created a government in which both Protestant and Catholic representatives could share power in Northern Ireland. Bu t tensions continued to grow between Catholics and Pr otestants, especially after the IRA refused to destroy or surrender its weapons. The Real IRA is a hard line group of between 70 and 170 members dedicated to an armed campaign aimed at driving the British out of Ireland.

Since its founding in 1997, the Real IR A has been fully infiltrated by British intelligence - MI5. The first double agent to infiltrate the Real IRA on behalf of the British government was David Gary Rupert, an elusive loner born in Madrid, New York State. Rupert first surfaced at an Irish Freedom Committee meeting in Chicago in 1997. Eye Spy Magazine reported, He was a well-known figure at meetings and beca me the talk of the IFC. Many believed he had contacts that wended their way to the very top of organisations like Sinn Fein and the IRA. MI5 had successfully tracked US fund-raising effo rts to certain US citizens and groups through bank accounts. But they needed more information. T ogether with the FBI and Irish security police, they spoke to Mr Rupert who agreed to work for them as a double agent. It was a major coup. Throughout the last four years he has supplied in telligence on fundraising, bank accounts, and recruiting campaigns. He \"networked\" between various rival factions and was so trusted he eventually befriended members of the Real IRA and several political organisations, such as the 32 County Sovereignty Committee. Similarly, he was befriended by Martin Galvin, a New York lawyer and the head of Noraid, the American fundra ising arm of the Provisional IRA. Rupert was given codes and access to various associated groups and learned of leading personnel on both sides of the Atlantic. As Rupert forwarded donatio ns to Ireland and elsewhere, MI5, the FBI and the Garda were carefully following the transactions, collecting details of every bank account the money was channelled through. In 1999 Rupert met with Michael McKevitt, who MI5 believe is the head of the Real IRA. Mr McKevitt is said to have introduced Rupert to other leading players in the group. And, according to sources, he handed over a £10,000 donation to ‘cement relations’. Rupert told the Garda that the organisation was planning a series of top-level meetings at a certain location. The Irish security services pl anted listening devices and surveillance equipment in the room. Much evidence was apparently acquired and then the Garda asked MI5 and the FBI if it was time to act. The agencies mind was made up for them when Rupert said McKevitt had allegedly asked him to participate in a terrorist ac t. The Garda said that if they arrested McKevitt, Rupert would have to testify and this meant blowing his cover. MI5 knew they were about to lose one of their most important agents, but the priz e they believed was worth it. Rupert agreed to testify for a massive sum of money and a new identity. He was also relocated. 16 Twenty-nine people were killed and 200 badly injured, when a 500 lb bomb exploded in a busy shopping street in Omagh, Northern Ireland, on 15 August 1998. The bomb was planted by the dissi dent republican group, the Real IRA, although at the time of writing only one individual, Colm Murphy, has been formally charged. The tragedy clai med nine children as victims. MI5, along with the Royal Uls ter Constabulary, knew at least two days before the attack not only that an attack would take place, but also the name of the bomb maker and his car registration. If they had placed this terrorist under surveillance, the horror of Omagh would have been prev ented. British intelligence had a reason for allowing the bombing to go forw ard. One of the terrorists in the bombing team was a double agent. He was working for MI5.   16 ‘MI5 Infiltrate the Real IRA’ – Eye Spy Magazine – August 31 2001 - http://www.eyespymag.com/features/mi5ira.html"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"[INSERT FIG 3.3] [CAPTION: The Sunday Herald report on MI5 involvement in the 1998 Omagh bombing should have led to arrests and reprimands bu t it was just calmly reported in the back of the newspaper.] This damning information was released by Kevin Fulton (a pseudonym), another British double agent in the IRA. Fulton was an ex-Briti sh army soldier and one- time member of the army's covert Force Research Unit. Fulton says he was recruited by the secret service to inform on the activities of the IRA in the 1980s. He claims to have been an informer up until the IRA cease-fire in 1996. Included in a whole raft of separate allegations is Fulton’s contention that MI5 and the FBI helped him travel to the United States and buy state of the art infra-red equipment for the IRA so that they could trigger bombs from over a mile away. 17 Fulton was also involved in the process of actually mixing explosives to make new types of bombs. He also coordinat ed political assassinations and robberies to help finance the IRA. This policy came directly from the very top; then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher received a weekly briefing on Fulton’s activities. Fulton states, “I was told 'there'll be no medals for this, and no re cognition, but this goes the whole way to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minist er knows what you are doing.” 18 Fulton had to slip into the role of a terrori st to prevent his co ver from being blown. He helped plan murders and torture innocent people with the backing and encouragement of t he Prime Minister and MI5. When Fulton had outlived his usefulness he realized that MI5 and m ilitary intelligence were fully prepared to leave him to be killed. It was at that poi nt that he distanced hi mself from both the IRA and British intelligence and b egan a whistle-blowing campaign. Fulton alleges that 48 hour s before the Omagh bombing he met with a senior member of the Real IRA in a pub in D undalk. The man was covered in dust and gave off a strong odor of fe rtilizer sediment. He had obviously been making a bomb. The man told Fulton “there’s something big on.” Within hours, Fulton informed his handler , telling him the name of the man and his car registration number, along with a descr iption of the vehicle. The sensitivity of the information would have meant t hat Fulton’s RUC handler immediately pass it on to higher authorities. Any informati on portending to an immediate threat to British national security is subject to a ‘FLASH’ classification of urgency, meaning it instantaneously receives the attention of MI5 and MI 6 counter terrorism agents.

And the question is, if it was shared, what happened? And why didn’t someone turn up in Dundalk and watch this man for 48 hours?” 19 British intelligence sat back and did nothi ng as the bomb traveled from Dundalk to Omagh in a vehicle they could easily have identified and apprehended. It has now been confirmed by the Sunday Herald that MI5 allowed the bombing to take place because one of its own double agents had successfully infiltrated the Real IRA and his cover would have been blown if the bomb plot had been exposed. Of course, this in itself is a whitewash. The agent, code named ‘Stakeknife’ had managed to tap the upper echelons of the terrorist group and MI5 valued the continued position of him as a key informe r over and above the 29 lives that were suddenly ended on that hot August afternoon. The Sunday Herald source stated, “The only reason the RUC would not act on a tip-o ff which stated a bomb was in the offing is if a member of the bombing team was a highly-plac ed agent and they needed to keep him in place. If the operation was allowed to go ahead then the agent would be seen as a good guy by the Real IRA; but if it failed, he could have come under suspicion of being an informer and been killed.” 20 How can the MI5 and the RUC justify allowing a terrorist bombing to proceed to simply keep an agent in place? An inform ant is supposed to have the rationale of warning his superiors so that they can ta ke action to avert such a catastrophe, as mentioned earlier in the circumstances surr ounding the infiltration of the Real IRA by David Rupert. This wasn’t the case in Omagh. So why did the British government authoriz e the bombing?

Again we see the Hegelian dialectic at work. Create the problem (allow the bombing to take place), apportion blame (the Real IRA), get the desired reaction (shock, revulsion and a desire for vengeance) and then hurriedly offer the solution (draconian police state laws) that do nothing to stop real terrorists and only strip innocent people of fundamental human rights.

In saying this, it is no surprise to learn that the people who c ontrol Israel use the same tactics as their peers to oppress their populati on beneath a choking police state.

When asked about this r eport, White House pr ess secretary Ari Fleischer simply dismissed the question.

The Globalists have no intention of sett ling the conflict and will likely use it several years down the line to initiate a near-apocalyptic third world war that will fully ensconce their wicked empire. The final phase is a stage-managed ‘clash of civilizations’ between the Arab world, po ssibly supported by China, and the west. According to United Press International , Israel and Hamas may currently be locked in deadly combat, but, according to several current and former U.S. intelligence officials, beginning in the late 1970s, Tel Aviv gave direct and indirect financial aid to Hamas over a period of years. 2 Israel wanted to radicalize the dispute by molding Hamas into a fundamentalist militant crusade to ape the Khomeini revoluti on in Iran. So much so that Israel groomed potential Hamas leaders, pressuri ng Israeli authorities to give them licenses to set up food kitchens, clinics, schools, and day-care centers, to create a governing structure alternat ive to Arafat's Fatah. T hese were known as ‘Village Leagues’ - and provided future Hamas operatives with a political and governmental foothold. This began in 1978 when Prime Minister Menachem Begin, himself a former terrorist l eader, approved an application from Sheik Ahmad Yassin to license the Islamic A ssociation, which would later produce a military wing, Hamas, in 1987. The Israeli Likud party propped up Yassin because they both had the same agenda, to destabilize Arafat’s Fatah. The Village Leagues were then infiltrated by the Israeli intelligence agency Shin Bet, which provided weapons training for the Palestinians and also created a network of thousands of informers. Th is funding and support continued even after the signing of the 1993 Oslo accords. The deliberate insertion of a competing faction would dilute support for the Palestinian Liberation Organization. Current Israeli Prime Mini ster Ariel Sharon had a key role in the formation of this po licy. After the first wave of suicide bombings began in 1994, Israel could also discredit the PLO by linking it with Hamas after every terrorist atrocity.

The closest the world came to seeing a settlement in Israel was during the term of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Rabin had signed the Oslo agreement with Yasser Arafat, which was the framework fo r the establishment of a Palestinian state by 1998. Rabin was by no means a so ft touch to the Palestinians during his early years in office, but by late 1995 he had reached effective accords with both the Palestinians and Jordan, and was on the verge of repeating the trick with   3 ‘Bush and the media cover-up of the jihad school book scandal’ – Jared Israel – April 9 2002 – http://emperors-clothes.com/articles/jared/jihad.htm 4 ‘CIA worked in tandem with Pakistan to create Taliban’ – Times of India – March 7 2001 – available at http://www.propagandamatrix.com/cia_tandem_create_taliban.html 5 ‘Sharon War Plan Exposed: Hamas Is His Gang Tool’ – Jeffrey Steinberg – Executive Intellligence Review – July 20 2001 - http://www.prisonplanet.com/news_alert_hamas5.html 6 ‘Analysis: Hamas history tied to Israel’ - Ibid 7 ‘Who controlled Abu Nidal ?’ – Patrick Seale – International Herald Tribune – August 22 2002 – http://www.iht.com/cgi-bin/generic.cgi?t emplate=articleprint.tmplh&ArticleId=68357 "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Syria. As Arab governments’ support for t he initiative increased, their funding and support of Hamas decreased. It was at this point, on November 4 1995, that Rabin was gunned down by a ‘lone nut assassin’ after a peace rally in Tel Aviv. His assassin, Yigal Amir was trained by Shin Bet, the Israeli domestic in telligence service. Shin Bet had received multiple warnings in the weeks preceding the event that an assassination attempt would take place. Strange t herefore that Rabin’s security detail, who were trained to immediately fire upon any armed intr uder, stood idly by and watched as Amir walked within six feet of Rabin and di scharged his weapon. According to the New York Times , Rabin was able to get up and enter his nearby limousine stating, “it hurts, but it's not so bad\" before being dr iven to the hospital. Upon arrival, Rabin’s chauffeur had to spri nt through the hallways shouti ng in an attempt to get some attention. The notion that a hos pital wouldn’t have a medical team on standby for the arrival of a seriously woun ded Prime Minister is inconceivable. These are just a few pieces of evidence out of hundreds to suggest that Rabin was meant to die. Rabin’s wife, Leah, directly blamed the Likud party and particularly its bloodthirsty leader, Benjamin Netanyahu. The Rabin murder underlines the fact that whether Hamas dupes or their ow n agents are utilized, the tactics and ideology are always the same. Israel’s right-wing elite and their global puppet masters were anxious to crumble any hope for peace, which before Rabin’s assassination was a viable possibility. Another reason for Rabin’s eliminati on was his open underst anding that Hamas was a tool of the Israeli el ite, according to Yasser Arafat. In an interview with the Italian daily Corriere della Sera , Arafat said, \"We are doing everything to stop the violence. But Ha mas is a creature of Israel which at the time of Prime Minister [Yitzhak] Shamir [the late 1980s, when Hamas arose], gave them money and more than 700 institutions, among them schools, universities and mosques. Even [former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak] Rabin ended up admitting it, when I charged him with it, in the presence of [Egpytian President Hosni] Mubarak.\" 8 Rabin defined Israel’s covert support of Ha mas as a “fatal error” and was in the process of putting an end to it before hi s assassination. He expelled 400 of its operatives in 1992 and arrested 4,000 of t hem in the months before his death. Hamas responded by taking a ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’ stance and pledged allegiance to the Israeli opposit ion party, the Likud. Taking into consideration the fact that such information could have been propaganda emanating from either Arafat or Rabin, a Jerusalem Post editorial still concluded that the Hamas-Likud part nership wasn’t bellicose propaganda – they defined it as “conventional wisdom.” 9   8 ‘Israeli Roots of Hamas are Being Exposed’ - Dean Andromidas – Executive Intelligence Review – January 18 2002 - http://www.larouchepub.com/other/2002/2902isr_hamas.html 9 ‘The Hamas-Likud Pairing’ – Jerusalem Post – August 25 1995 – http://www.prisonp lanet.com/news_alert_hamas4.html"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" Israeli, American and British control of Palestinian terrorists can be put in the context of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Abu Nidal was accused of nearly 900 political assassinations spanning the entire globe, as member of the Palestinian terror group Fateh Revolutionary Council. This group mysteriously escaped any Israeli reprisal, leading many analysts to conclude that it was firmly under Mossad control and used to discredit t he PLO. In August of 2002 Nidal was found dead in a Baghdad hotel. Experts were certain that he had committed suicide to escape capture but the fact that he had sustained multiple gunshot wounds heavily suggests he was killed by Iraqi operatives. According to The Intelligence Network , Abu Nidal was working for the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad, for the last four years and was plotting a coup against Iraqi president Saddam Hu ssain at the behest of Western powers, top diplomats said. 10 Many experts contend that Israel was pulling Nidal’s st rings as far back as the 1960’s. Nidal was somehow able to obtai n multi-entry visas and passports for numerous countries. Mossad had to shift him around the globe on several occasions to avoid his arrest. As the anti- war chorus grew to a crescendo in late 2002, the Americans began to formulate contingency plans that would enable them to overthrow Hussein without the need for a full-scale invasion of Iraq. The Iraqis, who themselves utilized Nidal in t he 70’s, learned of t he Israeli/American plot to use the asset Nidal an d consequently had him neutralized. After the mid-seventies, Nidal’s re negade attacks on Palestinian Fatah leaders far outweighed those against Israelis and Je ws. Arafat’s most trusted lieutenants were Nidal’s favorite targets, most not ably PLO's former intelligence chief Abu Iyad. Apart from Arafat, a ll the other founding members of Fatah were killed by Nidal in concert with Israel. Israel exploi ted their control of Nidal to the greatest effect in June 1982, Three gunmen seriously wounded then-ambassador Shlomo Argov in London, giving Menachem Begin's government the excuse it needed to impl ement then-defense minister Ariel Sharon's plan to invade Lebanon and push the PLO out of Beirut. To ld it was Abu Nidal's men, not Arafat's, who shot Argov, then-chief of staff Rafael Eitan was reported to have said, \"Nidal, Shmidal, they're all the same.\" 11 Nidal always acted in the countries w here Palestinian support was the strongest such as Greece, Cyprus and Sudan, and nev er in the occupied areas. He was in essence a gun for hire, carrying out assassinations on behalf of Syria and Iraq during the eighties. Israel took full advantage in that they could use Nidal to both attack the PLO directly and commit terroris m, which Israel would then falsely link to the PLO.   10 ‘Nidal planned to oust Saddam’ – The Intelligence Network – August 28 2002 - http://www.intellnet.org/news/2002/08/29/11285-1.html 11 ‘Abu Nidal reported dead in Baghdad’ - Danny Rubinstein and Yossi Melman – Ha’aretz – August 20 2002 - http://www.haaretzdaily .com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=199312 "},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" The European Union began as a free trade agreement but is now a centralized, un-elected, unaccountable federal power block that has subjugated the sovereignty of its member states. The parallels between Hitler’s plan for Europe and the developments that actually transpi red under the EU are frightening. As with all attack arms of global governm ent, the EU’s success is dependent on creating problems that it then ‘solves’ by increasi ng its own authority. The militarization of the EU as a standing a rmy (and one not restricted to Europe) would be worthless and unprofitable unless t here was a healthy supply of global chaos to counteract. Therefore we shoul d not be surprised that EU money is being laundered to Hamas. According to the EU Observer , The allegations have been in the air for over two years: EU money is being used by Yassir Arafat's Palestinian Authority to fund terrorist ac tivities. The claim by Ariel Sharon's government at the beginning of May that it had found \"damning evidence\" to support this allegation brought the polemic into the open. Concerned at the ac cusations, the Parliament suspended payment of some 18.5 million euro due to the Palestinians until May 19. 12 Why Arafat would want to channel money into those groups that actually weaken his authority is unclear. It s eems more likely that Sharon is trying to distract from his own administration’s funding of Hamas. As for the EU, this issue is very unpopular in the European parliament. At the time of writing, a bill proposed to investigate the matter looks set to be abandoned because the petition is 17 names short of its required total. Despite the EU’s cl aim that its hands are clean and that any money that reaches t he hands of terrorist groups is the responsibility of the Palestinian Aut hority, they have been nothing short of desperate to prevent a simple probe, EU Commissioner for External Affairs Chris Pa tten has successfully persuaded 12 of the MEPs that wanted to sign on to the petition to withdr aw their support on the basis that he has seen no evidence of misuse of EU money, and has accu sed the MEPs supporting the investigation of \"flogging a dead horse.\" MEP Charles Tannock says he is astonished by his fellow Conservative Party colleague's attitude: \"My campaign has in curred the wrath of Commissioner Patten, who regards this initiative as a direct challenge to hi s authority and credibility. The sole purpose of this investigation is to clear the air, and I have always maintained a balanced approach to the Israel/Palestine question, favoring a peacef ul settlement based on a two-state solution.\" Commissioner Patten's response is that he needs an investigation of PA abuse of his funds \"like I need a hole in the head.\" Patten's unwillingness to investigate how the PA used the money it was given by the EU seems remarkably peculiar consider ing that the EU Court of Auditors declined last November to approve the EU's budget for the eighth year running, admitting it can only guarantee that 5 percent of taxpayer s' money is being spent properly. 13 The question has been raised as to, if Ya sser Arafat is such a loose cannon and a danger to the Israeli/Globalist agenda, why hasn’t he been assassinated?

The meeting is a coming together of the world’s most pow erful individuals and yet yearly media coverage is non-existent. Bilderberg is arguably the highest-level known semi- secret organization pushing a one-wo rld order. Bilderberg has used its considerable influence to oust political figures that cease to cooperate with the global agenda, most notably Ma rgaret Thatcher who was proving a thorn in the side of European federalism until she was replaced by the Carlyle Group’s John Major. The Bilderberg Group also counts am ongst its members one Yasser Arafat. Arafat attended the gr oup’s June 1999 meeting in Sintra, Portugal. I suspect Arafat is an unwitting accomplice to the Globalists and is being manipulated to react in ways that are har mful to his own cause, and of course beneficial to those who seek to i ndefinitely enflame the Middle East.

The purpose of this s egment is to ascertain how Iraq acquired its arsenal of weapons that eventually led to it being declared as a ‘rogue state’. Again, I stress that some of these subjects have been exhaustively documented elsewhere numerous times. The scope here is to provide a thumbnail sketch that includes the latest up to date information. It is necessary to understand why the Globalists arm rogue nations only to overthrow them ten or fifteen years later. Obviously it makes significant amounts of money for giant defense contractor s, which often have tentacles into government itself, like the Carlyle Gr oup. Any such rogue state will not be provided with the latest advanced weaponr y but will receive enough arms to make it a threat to its neighbors, thus destabilizing its geographic region. This then provides the pretext fo r the Globalists to later invade the country in the name of saving the region from colla pse, citing dangerous weapons of mass destruction that the Globalists had provided the rogue state with in the first place."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"We are in the arena of geopolitical c hess.

In effect the US is saying trust us, and there are many who just will not.” 15 British Foreign Secretary Jack Stra w bemoaned ‘big gaps’ in the Iraqi declaration. U.S. Secretary of Stat e Colin Powell called the omissions ‘troublesome’.

Th is was cited as a fundamental reason justifying the invasion of Iraq. • Pralidoxine: An antidote to ner ve gas which can be easily back- engineered to create nerve gas. U.S. Defense Department Documents detail that Britain sold the drug to Iraq in March 1992, AFTER the Iraqis had gassed the Kurds and AFTER t he end of the Gulf War. The Sunday Herald reported, The shipments to Iraq went on even after Saddam Hussein ordered the gassing of the Kurdish town of Halabja, in which at least 5000 men, women and children died. The atrocity, which shocked the world, took place in March 1988, but a month later the components and materials of weapons of mass destruction were continuing to arrive in Baghdad. 17 • West Nile Virus: West Nile virus was actually used as a bio-weapon to attack America, Israel and Saudi Ar abia from the late 1990’s onwards. You didn’t hear about it because the mosquito-borne agent was also given to Hussein by the U.S., as outlined in the CDC letter. An Iraqi defector reported in 1997 that Saddam had bragged he would use West Nile to attack the U.S. and that his scientists had developed an unusual strain of the virus. The first outbreak in New York City was by way of an ‘unusual strain’ of the virus. 18 • Botulinum: Iraq admitted making 20,000 liters of botulinum toxin, a deadly poison produced by the Clostridium bot ulinum bacteria, and putting some of it into weapons. The American Type Culture Collection sent six strains of Clostridium botulinum to the University of Baghdad in the May 1986 shipment. The September 1988 ATCC sh ipment to Iraq also contained one strain of Clostridium botulinum. In March 1986, the CDC sent samples of botulinum toxin and botulinum toxoid (used to make a vaccine against botulinum poisoning) directly to Iraq' s al-Muthanna complex, a center for Iraq's chemical weapons program and the site where Iraq restarted its dormant biological weapons program in 1985. • Gas Gangrene: Gas gangrene, caused by the Clostridium Perfringens bacteria, causes toxic gases to form inside the body, killing tissues and causing internal bleeding, lung and liv er damage.

On Christmas Eve 2002, Pyongyang vow ed to “destroy the earth” if anyone interfered with its interest s. A similar threat was issued on February 6th 2003 when North Korea publicly stated it would wage “total war” on t he United States by way of a pre-emptive nuclear st rike. Propaganda posters from the country show missiles hitting the White House and other famous landmarks, along with North Korean soldiers depicted as giants, crushing American soldiers in their hands. North Korea is controlled by a hereditary Stalinist dictatorship that has starved two million of its citizens to death in fa vor of building a million-man army. Some people put the figure at four million, one-quarter of the popul ation. In the far north of the country there is a network of forced labor gul ags where people who have ‘expressed a bland political opi nion’ are, along with their entire families, tortured, raped and executed. Horrific bio-chemic al experiments are performed on mass numbers of people. Babies are delivered and then stam ped to death by the camp guards. If the mother screams while the guards are stamping on the baby’s neck, she is immediately assassinated by a fi ring squad. These guards are rewarded with bonuses and promotions for ripping out prisoners’ eyeballs.

And Kim’s regime has successfully test ed the Taepo Dong, a missile capable of hitting Japan; the missile’s next generation may be able to strike Alaska. 27 President Bush publicly claims to loathe Kim Jong-Il and yet his administration has, like Bill Clinton’s before him, armed North Korea to the teeth with anything up to and beyond 200 nuclear bombs. Every other month t he media report on how the U.S. continues to transfer highly sensitive material to North Korea, all t he while fear mongeri ng about how it's not a matter of if but when a city gets nuked. This isn't merely a case of double standards - it's absolute lunacy. Under the 1994 Agreed Framework, the Clinton administration agreed to replace North Korea’s domestically built nuclear reactors with light water nuclear reacto rs. So-called governm ent-funded ‘experts’ stated that light water reactors coul dn’t be used to make bombs. Not so according to Henry Sokolski, head of the Non-proliferati on Policy Education Centre in Washington, \"LWRs could be used to produce dozens of bom bs' worth of weapons-grade plutonium in both North Korea and Iran. This is true of all LWRs -- a depressing fact U.S. policymakers have managed to block out.\" 28 Sokolski has also gone on the record as saying, \"These reactors are like all reactors, they have the potential to make weapons. So you might end up supplying the worst nuclear violator with the means to acquire the very weapons we're trying to prevent it acquiring.\" 29 The U.S. State Department c ontends that the light wa ter reactors cannot be used to produce bomb grade material and yet in 2002 urged Russia to end its nuclear co-operation with Iran for the reason that it does n’t want Iran armed with weapons of mass destruction. Russia is build ing light water reactors in Iran. The State Department announced on its own web site, In the official answer to a question asked at t he January 31 State Department daily briefing, the State Department said the United States has \"c onsistently urged Russia to cease all [nuclear] cooperation with Iran, including its assistance to the light water reactor at Bushehr.\"   27 ‘Aiding and Abetting the Axis’ - William Norman Grigg – The New American – February 24 2003 - http://www.thenewamerican.com/tna/2003/02-24-2003/vo19no04_korea.htm 28 ‘Nuclear Succor for North Korea’ – Matt Bivens – Moscow Times – Septemner 16 2002 – available at http://asp.afghanwar.spb.ru/cgi/answer_e.asp?ID=525 29 ‘US grants N Korea nuclear funds’ – BBC – April 3 2002 – http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1908571.stm"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" \"We have underscored to Russia that an end to Russ ian nuclear assistance to Iran would allow the United States and Russia to reap the full pr omise of our new strategic relationship, benefiting Russia economically and strategically far more t han any short-term gain from construction of additional reactors or other sensitive transfers to Iran.\" 30 Therefore according to t he State Department, light wa ter reactors in Iran can produce nuclear material but somehow the same rule doesn’t apply in North Korea. More hypocrisy is encountered when we learn that the United Stat es’ closest ally Britain has also shipped bomb grade ma terial to Iran. Sources for the BBC disclosed that the UK government rubber stamped the shipment of key nuclear weapons-grade material to Iran, who have p ublicly stated their desire to build an atomic bomb, The programme has also interviewed a leading nuc lear weapons expert in the UK who says that the Beryllium and other items which the DTI has licensed to Iran add up to a shopping list for a nuclear weapons programme. 31 Many questioned why, in late September 2001, UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw was suddenly dispatched to Iran to meet with Iranian President Mohammad Khatami. Behind the public facade of 'dip lomatic discussion' it is now clear that Straw was bartering for the sale of me tal beryllium, a key component for the manufacture of nuclear weapons. This, despi te a ban on the sale of arms to Iran under international protocol. Metal beryl lium has virtually no conventional use and is exclusive to the development of nuclear weapons. Let us return to the issue of North Korea and light water reactors. Light water reactors are far more expens ive to build than coal or gas-fired plants so we can safely conclude that arming North Korea’ s nuclear arsenal is not a matter of saving money. On the contrary, it’s like handing a psychopath a loaded gun. The 1994 Agreed Framework deal gave Nort h Korea the capacity to generate enough nuclear fuel to produce almost 100 nuclear bombs per year. A 1999 congressional study undertaken by the House North Korea Advisory Group warned, Through the provision of two light water reactors [LWRs] under the 1994 Agreed Framework, the United States, through KEDO, will provide North Korea with the capacity to produce annually enough fissile material for nearly 100 nuclear bombs, should the Democratic People's Republic of Korea [DPRK] decide to violate the Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. 32 The group further cautioned that the country that receives the largest amount of   30 ‘State Department on Russia-Iran Nuclear Cooperation’ – U.S. Department of State – January 31 2003 - http://usinfo.state.gov/topical/pol/arms/03020321.htm 31 ‘UK sells bomb material to Iran’ – BBC – September 23 2002 - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2275249.stm 32 ‘Clinton Deal Gave N.

Th e North Korean people are enslaved by a government that is using food as a weapon. Perhaps this is why The EU and the United States, via t he UN World Food Program, resumed the shipment of hundreds of thousands of tons in food aid at the end of February 2003. This goes directly to the sitting dict atorship, which then decides who gets it by their level of allegiance to the stat e.

In the follo wing three chapters I will cover the events before, during and after the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. Initially we will document the overwhel ming amount of evidence indicating that the US knew the attacks were about to take place. The question of why the attacks took place despite the fact t hat they could have been prevented runs parallel throughout this ext ended section of the book. It is important to note that the official story of 9/11 can be di smantled from two or more different angles. If we are to believe that nineteen suicide hijackers carried out the attacks on behalf of Al-Qaeda then it can be proven that these men were trained, funded and allowed into the country by the U.S. establishment. They were tracked and traced and their intentions were well known by the authorities, many months and even years before that fateful day. I will present the evidence to verify these claims in this chapter. In the following chapter I will switch to the second and more cutting edge angle of re search, namely that the Al-Qaeda plot was merely a smokescreen to shadow who really carried out the attacks and what methods were used. Alleged Hijackers Trained at U.S Air Bases Common sense suggests that to prevent future acts of suicide hijacking, one needs to go to the source of the hijacker’ s training and shut it down. At the very least, stern questions need to be asked c oncerning why three or more of the alleged September 11 perpetrators were trained at one of the USA's foremost Naval complexes, and why this shocking notion received scant media attention and was subsequently subject to a complete press blackout. September 14th, just three days after the attack on Amer ica, FBI director Robert S. Mueller stated, \"perhaps one could have averted this.\" 1 This was in response to reports confirming that several of the suicide hijackers had received flight training within the United States. For the moment we will set aside the shocking revelation that seven or more of the named nineteen suicide hijackers are still alive, this evidence will appear later. For the sake of clarity, at this point we will work from the notion that the FBI's nineteen named hijackers are actually the ones who carried out the September 11 atro cities, albeit operating under slightly changed birth dates and/or names with regard to the discrepancies between military training records and the official FBI list.   1 ‘FBI Knew Terrorists Were Using Flight School s’ - Steve Fainaru and James V.

The Complex in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties employs more than 16,000 military and 7,400 civilian personnel. It is also where as many as four of the FBI's nineteen su spected suicide hijackers participated in the facility's flight training program fo r foreign military trainees in the 1990's. 2 Three of these individuals listed thei r addresses on drivers’ licenses and car registrations as the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Fla. according to a high- ranking U.S. Navy source. 3 Namely, Saeed Alghamdi and Ahmad Alnami, who allegedly were two of the four men that hijacked United Airlines Flight 93 and subsequently crashed in Stony Creek Township, Pennsylvania, and Ahmed Alghamdi, alleged co-hijacker of United Airlines Flight 75, which hit the south tower of the World Trade Center. Military re cords also confirm that the three used their address as 10 Radford Boulevard, a base roadway on which residences for foreign military flight trainees are located. The Florida link is clear. The FBI list s no less than eleven of the hijackers as having lived or living in Florida, including six in the Delray Beach area alone. It is also interesting to note that several of the hijackers, including the lead hijacker Mohamed Atta, lived in Hollywood, har dly a puritanical hotbed of Islamic fundamentalism. With regard to the three Pensacola students, it is confirmed that their training was financed by Saudi Arabia, birthplace of the majority of the nineteen hijackers and a supposed ally of the United States. Days after Newsweek published this story, Florida Democratic Senator Bill Nelson angrily faxed a message to Attorney General John Ashcroft, demandi ng to know if it was correct. The response was a deafening silence. A spokesman for Senator Nelson subsequently stated, “In the wake of those reports we asked about the Pensacola Naval Air Station but we never got a definitive answer from the Justic e Department. So we asked the FBI for an answer ‘if and when’ they could provide us one. Their response to dat e has been that they are trying to sort through something complicated and difficult.” 4 The FBI never did provide an answer. The Pensacola-terrorist link has been buried. The story broke in a few mainst ream publications in mid-September 2001 but has since vanished. Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee Bob Graham also requested information on the Pensacola tie-in. We must assume that he was also stonewalled or otherwise told to keep the information confidential, due to the fact that, once again, this st ory has not since appeared in the mainstream media.   2 ‘Pensacola NAS link faces more scrutiny’ – Larry Wheeler – Pensacola News Journal – September 17 2001 – available at http://www.propagandamatrix.com/pensacola_nas_link_scrutiny.html 3 ‘Alleged Hijackers May Have Trained at U.S. Bases’ - George Wehrfritz, Catharine Skipp and John Barry – Newsweek – September 15 2001 - http://www.msnbc.com/news/629529.asp?cp1=1 4 ‘Did Terrorist Pilots Train at U.S. Military Schools?’ – Daniel Hopsicker - http://www.madcowprod.com/index5.html"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The Clinton Administration’ s Protection of Terrorists The government terrorism paradigm is by no means divided down party lines. The Clinton administration provided the framework from which Al-Qaeda grew in stature. The September 11 pl ot could have been crushed in the last years of the 20th century. It is accepted that the complex sequence of events we saw unfold on September 11th would have generated an excessive vo lume of communications - whether by radio, cell phone, land lin e, fax or modem - among t he terrorists, among their Middle-Eastern sponsors and among commerc ial contacts here and abroad. The contention that the NSA purposefu lly avoided intercepting Al-Qaeda communication doesn't even have to be debated when it is known that bin Laden's network had the sophisticated co mmunication equipment necessary to duck detection up until the late nineties. A nd who sold them that equipment? As was the case with Iraq, the U.S. Go vernment. The Clinton administration provided the terrorist supporting nation of Syria with spread-spectrum radios, fiber optics and highly advanced computer networks that are invulnerable to wiretap. Syria in turn passed this technology on to numerous terrorist cells around the world, including Al-Qaeda. According to World Net Daily , The dozen or so Islamic terrorists who pulled off the plot to strike at America's nerve centers in New York and Washington spent at least five years researching, planning and coordinating the surprise attacks, U.S. security officials say. And they did it completely in secret, using the world's most sophisticated telecommunications equipm ent, some secured by advanced encryption technology that most armies don't have...the NSA wa sn't able to detect the Islamic terrorists' plot because of the high quality of the communications gear that they've been ac quiring over the last couple of years, thanks to the Clin ton administration's decontrols on advanced telecommunications equipment. 5 However, this was by no means t he only way in which Clinton and his administration proliferated the activities of the international Al-Qaeda network. Clinton security chiefs repeatedly reject ed vital intelligence that would have resulted in stifling numerous worldwide terror cells, primarily Osama bin Laden and Al-Qaeda. The government of Sudan of fered to both arrest bin Laden or at least closely monitor his activities within the country, and turn over files, some an inch and a half thick, a vast databas e on bin Laden and more than 200 leading members of his Al-Qaeda network.

The Monica Lewinsky scandal was re leased intentionally to distract the American public from this treasonous activity.] In the spring of 1996, Sudan, using a back channel direct from it s president to the CIA, offered to arrest bin Laden and plac e him in custody in Saudi Arabia. The initial meeting took place at a hotel in Ar lington, Virginia, on Ma rch 3 of that year. One of the officials who oversa w this and subsequent engagements was Mansoor Ijaz, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and chairman of a New York-based investment company. He states, “From 1996 to 1998, I opened unofficial channels between Sudan and the Clinton administration. I met with officials in both countries, including Clin ton, U.S. National Security Advisor Samuel R. \"Sandy\" Berger and Sudan's president and inte lligence chief. President Omar Hassan Ahmed Bashir, who wanted terrorism sanctions against Suda n lifted, offered the arrest and extradition of Bin Laden and detailed intelligence data about the global networks constructed by Egypt's Islamic Jihad, Iran's Hezbollah and the Palestinian Ha mas. Among those in the networks were the two hijackers who piloted commercial airliners into the World Trade Center. The silence of the Clinton administration in responding to these offers was deafening.” 7 The Saudi Fahd Monarchy didn’t treat bi n Laden’s proposed extradition to Saudi Arabia with enthusiasm. Geopolitical hesit ation meant that the White House did not press the Saudis on this issue at a ll. This meant that, following intense pressure from Saudi Arabia and the U. S., Sudan agreed to expel bin Laden and up to 300 of his associates. They were now free to leave for Afghanistan, providing total anonymity and escaping t he sophisticated tracking methods that the Sudanese were capable of and had o ffered. Subsequent analysis by U.S. intelligence confirms bin Laden had full access to his Sudanese assets from his new position in Afghanistan, directly cont radicting a previously held White House assumption that it was valuable in itself to force bin Laden out of Sudan, supposedly tearing him away from hi s extensive network of business, investments and training camps. This thin king was proven woefully inaccurate. Sudanese intelligence believed this to be a great mistake and indeed it had disastrous consequences, Sudan expelled Mr. bin Laden on May 18, 1996, to Afghanistan. From there, he is thought to have planned and financed the bombings of the U. S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, the near-destruction of the American destroyer Cole in Yemen last year and the devastation in New York and Washington on Sept. 11. 8   7 ‘Clinton Let Bin Laden Slip Away and Metastasize’ – Mansoor Ijaz – L.A.

Philippine authorities learned of the plot after a small fire in a Manila apartment, which turned out to be the hideout of Ramzi Yousef, who was later convicted for his role in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. Yousef escaped at the time, but agents caught his right-hand man, Abdul Hakim Murad, who told them a chilling tale. \"Murad narrated to us about a plan by the Ramzi cell in the continental U.S. to hijack a commercial plane and ram it into the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, and also the P entagon,\" said Rodolfo Mendoza, a Philippine intelligence investigator.

Four young Algerians, members of a subgroup called Phalange of the Signers in Bl ood, commandeered the plane at the airport and ordered it to fly to Marseille, from which they said they wanted to fly to Paris. But they demanded that it be loaded with 27 tons of fuel — about three times as much as required for the flight to Paris. The plane was an Airbus A300, which is nearly as large as the Boeing 767's that struck the World Trade Cent er. The French authorities determined from hostages who had been released and from other sources that the group planned to explode the plane over Paris or crash it into the Eiffel Tower...Eight months earlier, in April 1994, a flight engineer at Federal Express who was facing a disciplinary hearing that could have ended his career, boarded a DC-10 as a passenger and stormed into the cockpit with a hammer, hitting each of the three members of the cockpit crew in the head and severely injuring all of them.

Not according to the Justice Department. The case of Zacarias Moussaoui highlights another disturbing example of how key intelligence that would have prevented September 11th was purposefully withheld fr om well-intentioned FBI agents. It is now clear that Moussaoui was s upposed to have been the fifth hijacker on board flight 93 that crashed in southwest P ennsylvania. He was absent from that role due to being placed in detention on minor immigration charges on August 17, 2001, and cheered from his Sherburne County jail cell as the attack unfolded on that fateful day. Moussaoui, a 33-year-old French national, lived in London for 9 years, a follower of radical Islamic cleric and MI5 lovech ild Abu Qatada, befor e receiving $15,000 in bank transfers from known associates of the September 11 suicide hijackers. He then set off for the Pan Am Internat ional Flight Academy in Eagen, just outside Minneapolis. Once ther e, Moussaoui only sought training in making turns - not take-offs and landings - and specific ally asked about flying over New York air space. Moussaoui made it clear that he was there to learn how to pilot a 747- 400, despite the fact that he had only been trained on a single-engine Cessna and was relatively incompetent as a studen t. His instructor, a former military pilot, urgently briefed Minnesota Congressman Ja mes L. Oberstar and other officials concerning his suspicions and directly wa rned the FBI, \"Do you realize that a 747 loaded with fuel can be used as a bomb?\" 29 The FBI officials in turn promptly wa rned the Federal Aviation Administration, who took no action and saw no reason to check scores of other flight schools where Middle Eastern men were seeking flight training.

A French intelligence report clearly implicated Moussaoui with an Algerian terrorist group and a trip to Afghanistan (where he is believed to have attended one of bin Laden's training camps). The French warned the US about his Al-Qaeda links on two occasions, September 1st and September 5th. According to an account of that meeting in Le Monde, U.S. participants said Moussaoui's case was in the hands of the immigration authorities and was not a matter for the FBI. The French also warned British MI5 intelligence about Moussasoui, highlight ing the fact that the Abu Qatada meetings were also attended by Djame l Beghal, a 36-year-old Algerian who moved to London from France in 1997 and was arrested in Dubai in July 2001 for allegedly being part of a plot to blow up the American embassy in Paris. French requests to MI5 for Moussa soui to be placed under surveillance were completely ignored. The Justice Department shut the lid on the case and refused the FISA request. Decent FBI agents who actually did thei r job correctly and wanted to stop terrorism were outraged. A last gasp effo rt to deport Moussaoui to Paris, where French authorities could hold him for as l ong as three days while they sought a legal way to search his laptop, was cu t short by the events of September 11. After September 11, it emerged that Moussaoui had direct ties to Al-Qaeda operatives in Malaysia, home to the cons ulting firm where he claimed to work. The FBI now, albeit too late, had a search warrant for Moussaoui's hard drive. They discovered a flight simulation software program plus a multitude of information concerning wind currents, je tliners and crop-dusting airplanes. The information was considered sufficiently al arming that FBI officials requested the immediate downing of all crop-dusting airc raft, fearing that terrorists might be plotting to use them for a chemical or biological attack. 31 In mid-December 2001, Moussaoui became the first person indicted for involvement in the events of Sept. 11, charged with conspiring with bin Laden and Al-Qaeda. Although the trial is still ongoing, Moussaoui faces the death penalty.

This, despite a National Commission on Terrorism report released in 2000, which urged closer infiltration noting that there were no human inte lligence sources insi de groups like bin Laden's Al-Qaeda. This was not an ‘intelligence failure,’ it was a policy directive. Of course, the policy of holding intell igence agents back from going after Al- Qaeda was merely to keep the compartmen talized well-intenti oned investigators in line.

According to two people with kn owledge of the events, the agent relayed the informant's remarks to supervisors in the fiel d office, who passed the information to FBI headquarters in Washington, where it was referr ed to the Osama bin Laden unit in the bureau's Counterterrorism Division. 34 The Justice Department and the FBI were not interested in pursuing the opportunity because they deemed it illegal.

The agent is represented by David Schippers, a pivotal player in t he Clinton impeachment proceedings, being investigative counsel for the House Judiciary Committee. Schippers was responsible for all investigati ons under the impeachment inquiry. Before September 11th, Schippers represented a group of FBI agents who were seething because their superiors had pulled them off te rrorism related investigations.

Schippers frantically tried to arrange a meeting with Atto rney General John Ashcro ft right up until a month before the attack. Ashcro ft made it clear to his underlings that he was not interested in the information and Sc hippers was rebuffed again and again. Wright was jointly represented by Judicial Watch, who stated, “Based on the evidence, the FBI Special Agent belie ves that if certain investigations had been allowed to run their courses, Osama bi n Laden’s network might have been prevented from committing the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks which resulted in the deaths of nearly 5,000 innocents.” 36 In a May 30 National Press Club conferenc e, Robert Wright t earfully apologized to the relatives of the victims of 9/ 11 after he detailed t he numerous instances where he had been impeded by his superiors from conducting terrorism investigations.

Compare his treatment to that of Colleen Rowley, general counsel in the FBI Minneapolis office, who was afforded free speech and whistle-blower protection. Rowley released a watered down report full of ‘intelligence failures’ and to be sure she was purposefully brought out to act as a shill when the prior knowledge issue broke in the mainstream media in May 2002. For the fi rst few days after t he story broke, the   35 Ibid 36 ‘ACTIVE FBI SPECIAL AGENT FILES COMPLAINT CONCERNING OBSTRUCTED FBI ANTI-TERRORIST INVESTIGATIONS’ – Judicial Watc h – November 14 2001 - http://www.judicialwatch.org/1075.shtml "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"government was in deep trouble, scrabbling around for excuses. At that point they hyped up Rowley and her information acted as a steam valve – the government were able to manage the stor y and it dissipated soon thereafter. Judicial Watch Chairman Larry Klayman described Rowley’s evidence as, \"a cover your derriere, PR maneuver.\" 37 Wright told of terroris t training camps in Chicago and Kansas with links to the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that he was on t he verge of closing down in 1998. The FBI higher-ups took him off the case. He discussed money laundering operations with links to Hamas (Likud) and Al-Qaeda that he was on the verge of cracking before again being taken off the case, The motive for this conduct his simple and quite disturbing,\" Wright charged. He said that by preventing the criminal prosecut ion of the subjects of their intelligence gathering \"these intelligence agents avoide d the new and additional work that would be required...\" He said once these agents had a case going, \"they would 'milk it ' for years, not taking on any additional work.\" They regarded Wright and others who wanted to pr osecute suspects \"as a threat to their job security.\" The net result, according to the lawsuit, was that \"the FBI was merely gathering intelligence so they would know who to arrest when a terrorist attack occurred.\" 38 Exactly a year after the attacks on New York and Washington, Judicial Watch issued a press release which stated that the FBI were still preventing prosecution of terrorists, SA Wright points to recent misconduct and falsific ations of wiretap warrant applications by FBI agents (signed-off by the former FBI Director, Louis Freeh) to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Court. Prior to September 11th, SA Wright alleged FBI intelligence agents lied and hid vital records from criminal agents for the purpose of obstructing his criminal investigation of the terrorists in order to protec t their “subjects,” and prolong their intelligence operations. SA Wright was stunned to learn recently that some of the FBI intelligence agents that had stalled and obstructed his criminal investigatio ns of terrorists in Chicago had also lied to the judges of the FISA Court in Washington, DC. 39 In addition, the former head of the Am erican visa bureau in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Michael Springman, was cons istently ordered by high level State Department officials to issue visas to unqualified applicants. These 'unqualified applicants' were terrorists operating on beha lf of Osama bin Laden. Despite bitter complaints to the General Accounting Offi ce, the Inspector General's office and the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, in t he same vein as Sen. Bob Graham, he was stonewalled.

Accordingly, they were issued with multi-level visas wh ich enabled them to open bank accounts, obtain drivers licenses, enroll in flight schools and leave and re-enter the USA at will. When Almihdhar’s visa expired in June 2001, after he had been linked to the bombers of the USS Cole, the Stat e Department issued him a new one. Both hijackers, while being closely monitor ed by the CIA, were allowed to leave the States to attend a January 2000 Al-Qaeda meet ing in Kuala Lumpur. Surveillance was then passed over to the Malaysian Special Branch who compiled a detailed dossier on the two individuals which was then passed back to the CIA as al-Mihdhar and al-Haz mi re-entered the United States, Yet astonishingly, the CIA did nothing with this information. Agency officials didn’t tell the INS, which could have turned them away at the border, nor did they notify the FBI, which could have covertly tracked them to find out their mission. 40 So the CIA identify two known terrorists, issue them with visas, allow them to leave the country to attend a terrorist meeting, and allow them back into the country without apprehension. Lower leve l FBI agents were astounded at this negligent policy. They charged that if the CIA had passed the information on, they would have been able to crack the entire nineteen-man hijack plot that unfolded on 9/11. Again - the mainst ream media report all this and the government admits to it. Yet the spin is always ‘we screwed up’ ‘it was an intelligence failure’ – if this is the ca se then why has not one senior CIA or FBI official been fired as a result? According to an unnamed FBI agent, he too had identified the future hijackers as terrorists long before September 11 but w hen he sought permission to track them down within the U.S. his superiors to ld him to cease his investigation and aggressively shut the lid on the case . The irate agent chillingly retorted, “Whatever has happened to this — some day someone will die — and wall or not, the public will not understand why we were not more effectiv e and throwing every resource we had at certain ‘problems’. Let’s hope the FBI’s national security law unit will stand behind their decisions then, especially since the biggest threat to us now, Osama Bin Laden, is getting the most ‘protection’.” 41 Furthermore, in another deplorable develop ment, it emerged that after the Al- Qaeda summit in Malaysia, which the CIA viewed on videotape, al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi moved in with an FBI informant who helped them open bank accounts, enabling them to subsequently enroll in flight school training in preparation for the 9/11 plot,   40 ‘The Hijackers We Let Escape’ - Mi chael Isikoff and D aniel Klaidman – Newsweek – June 4 2002 – available at http://www.propagandamatrix.com/The_Hijackers_We_Let_Escape.htm 41 ‘The ignored warning’ – Sunday Times of London – September 22 2002 – available at http://www.propagandamatrix.com/the_ignored_warning.htm "},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" Upon leaving Malaysia, Almihdhar and Alhazmi went to San Diego, where they took flight-school lessons. In September 2000, the two moved in to the home of a Muslim man who had befriended them at the local Islamic Center. The landlor d regularly prayed with them and even helped one open a bank account. He was also, sources tell NEWSWEEK, a “tested” undercover “asset” who had been working closely with the FBI office in San Diego on terrorism cases related to Hamas. 42 The FBI office in San Diego knew that the terrorists were living with the informant. The case agent called the in formant on several occasions and was always forewarned when the two were in the room and able to hear the conversation. The terrorist’s Saudi nati onality, in alliance with President Bush’s “back off” directive, ensured al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi were left alone. This was a full year before 9/11 and is yet another smoking gun to confirm the plot could have been unraveled if not for criminal protection of terrorists by the upper echelons of the CIA and FBI. Another of the hijackers who was alle gedly (we have to use that term because there is no proof any of t he named hijackers were on bo ard the planes) on Flight 77 that hit the Pentagon, was Hani Hanjour. From 1996 onwards Hanjour was enrolled in flight school tr aining in Phoenix Arizona. It was here that a paid FBI informant, Aukai Collins, was asked to monitor Hanjour and his fellow Arab associates. Collins maintained his work entailed t hat the FBI had an extensive dossier on Hanjour, Collins said the FBI knew Hanjour lived in P hoenix, knew his exact address, his phone number and even what car he drove. \"They knew everyt hing about the guy,\" said Collins...\"When I said there's this short, skinny Arab guy who's part of this crowd, drives such-and-such a car, I assumed that they would then, you know, start tracing him and see who his contacts were,\" he said. 43 So we know the FBI were closely moni toring Hanjour for at least five years before 9/11. What is more, they also knew that Hanjour was conducting test flights in the vicinity of the World Trade Center and the P entagon in the months leading up to the attack, Law enforcement officials tell (CBS reporter) St ewart they have now confirmed that Hanjour rented small aircrafts in the Maryland and New Yo rk areas three weeks bef ore the attacks. They say he made practice flights using those aircrafts in the vicinity of both the Pentagon and the World Trade Center towers. The purpose of the fli ghts, officials surmise, was to study landmarks and examine possible approach routes to the targets. 44   42 ‘The Informant Who Lived With T he Hijackers’ – Michael Isikoff - Newsweek – September 16 2002 – available at http://www.propagandamatrix.com/the_informant_who_lived_with_the_hijackers.htm 43 ‘FBI Was Warned of Sept. 11 Hijacker’ – John McWethy - ABC News – May 23 2002 – available at http://www.propagandamatrix.com/FBI_Warned_of_Sept_11_Hijacker.htm 44 ‘Sept. 11 Hijacker Made Test Flights’ – Jim Stewart – CBS News – October 9 2002 – available at http://www.propagandamatrix.com/sept_11_hijacker_made_test_flights.htm "},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Let us recap. We have an Arab enrolled at a flight school who the FBI see as dangerous enough to justify monitoring him for five years. They know where he lives, his phone number and even what ca r he drives. The FBI thinks he could possibly be a member of Al-Qaeda. This same suspected terrorist then charters a plane and goes snooping in and around t he WTC and Pentagon. A three-year- old could connect these dots, even indep endently of the voluminous other evidence confirming the WTC and Pentagon as targets. Hanjour wasn’t the only hijacker to perform a 9/11 dry run right in the face of American intelligence. Actor James Woods took a flight from Boston on August 1 2001. Once in the air, Woods noticed a group of Arab m en who had no hand luggage acting strangely. Woods said t he FBI had warned him not to disclose details but he went on the record as sa ying that at least two of the four individuals fit the description of two of the named hijackers (one possibly being Atta). Their behavior suggested to Woods t hat the men were pl anning something. Woods informed the flight attendant who eventually informed the FAA. The FAA, who were warned from numerous different sources that a plot involving hijacking was likely to occur in 2001, did nothing wit h the information. They refused to pass it on to any law enforcement or intellig ence agency. The FBI only investigated the incident after September 11. Common Knowledge If a freshman school kid knew about t he imminent September 11th attack, then how on earth could the biggest intelligence agencies in the world not know? An MSNBC reporter visited a Brooklyn school to disprove an unreliable urban myth but actually confirm ed an amazing story. On September 6 — five days before the attack — An toinette DiLorenzo, who teaches English as a second language to a class of Pakistani immigr ants, led a class discussion about world events. She asked a freshman (his name has been withheld ): “What are you looking at?” The youth was peering out the third floor window toward lower Manhattan. After he made the remark about the World Trade Center not being there next week, the teacher didn’t immediately think much of it, though it stuck in her mind. 45 Note that the remark does not just broadl y state that the towers will be attacked, but specifically that they will disappear. Th is came in the middle of a heated class debate at the New Utrecht High School. The boy remains unnamed, the only details being that he was a 15-year-old Palestinian. It later emerged that the same boy made a further prediction afte r September 11. He predicted that a plane would crash in New York on Nove mber 12. That very day, American Airlines flight 587 crashed in Queens after bo th its engines ‘fell off’ its wings in an ‘accident’. The FBI was told of the boy’s warning befor e the ‘accident’ but didn’t follow up on it.   45 ‘Trade Center warning baffles police’ – Jonathan Alter – MSNBC – October 12 2001 – available at http://www.propagandamatrix.com/Trade_Center_warning_baffles_police.htm "},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Jeffrey Scott Shapiro, the journa list who broke t he story before MSNBC got hold of it, was able to confirm that the FBI were investi gating two other strikingly similar predictions of catastrophe on 9/11, On Sept. 10, 2001, a sixth-grade student of Middl e Eastern descent in Jersey City, N.J., said something that alarmed his teacher at Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School. \"Essentially, he warned her to stay away from lower Manhatt an because something bad was going to happen,\" said Sgt. Edgar Martinez, deputy director of police services for the Jersey City Police Department. Initially, the Jersey City rumor was met with so me controversy. The New York Times called it an unsubstantiated rumor, and both the Daily Ne ws and the Jersey Journal quoted a board of education official who denied that the boy had made any reference to the Sept. 11 attacks at all. Despite their reports, Martinez sa id the FBI-JTTF took over the matte r for further investigation. On Sept. 11, NYPD school-safety offi cers interrogated a Middle Eastern boy at Health Opportunities High School in the Bronx who had made similar comments that alarmed his teacher. Catie Marshall said the boy told his peers somethi ng as the school was being evacuated on Sept. 11. \"He warned them not to ride any city buses be cause he had been told at his mosque the week before to stay off all public transportation fo r a while,\" said one NYPD officer from the investigating 40th Precinct. \"He said it wouldn't be safe.\" The FBI-JTTF since has taken over the matter. 46 Shapiro learned that many other students attending the New Utrecht school had approached teachers wit h their own stories of prior knowledge and large numbers had conveniently decided to br ing their cameras to school on September 11. Shapiro tried in vain to have his story covered in the mass media. The New York Times and many others refused to touch it and Shapiro’s last word on the matter was that the FBI had shut down the case. This is just one of numerous smoki ng guns to suggest that the Muslim community across the world was aware of the impending terrorist attack. Islamic calendars circulated in t he months preceding Septem ber 2001 depicting a plane crashing into lower Manhattan. The FBI confirmed that many Middle Easterners were warned not to go near lower M anhattan on September 11. The plot was even the subject of everyday street gossip in Cairo Egypt in August 2001. Everybody knew. Are we to believe the most sophisticated intelligence agencies in the world didn't? New York police o fficers investigating these ‘rumors,’ including evidence that a large number of Arabs working in the WTC didn’t show up for work that day, stated that leads of prior knowledge were so ‘overwhelming’ that they didn’t know where to start. Os ama bin Laden himself publicly stated that all his associates should return to Afghanistan by September 10. [INSERT FIG 5.4] [CAPTION: There are countless examples of posters, advertisements, album covers and television shows which depicted an attack on the World Trade Center before September 11 2001.

The letter stated that agents of Osama bin Laden had entered the US and were about to carry out an attack via an airline or airlines. Some of the alleged hijackers were reported to have attended strip clubs the night before the attack (there’s t hat staunch fundamentalism and highly sophisticated planning in evidence), w here they bragged to the bartender that “America’s going to see blood, wait till tomorrow.” 47 Marwan Al Shehhi, who piloted the sec ond plane into the World Trade Center, could not contain himself about his role in the plot, bragging to anyone that would listen of his upcoming ‘martyrdom’ while living in Hamburg, Germany. This came to light during the trial of Mouni r El Motassadeq, an alleged Al-Qaeda conspirator. Al Shehhi told a librarian t hat thousands would die in an attack on the World Trade Center. This didn’t seem to concern the CIA at the time. A 29-year-old Iranian deportee phoned US po lice and the White House from his German cell to warn of an imminent a ttack on the World Trade Center. The Lower Saxony Justice Ministry has c onfirmed the man wa rned of the impending series of terrorist attac ks, but had not been believed. They refused to confirm exactly when the calls were made, but it was before September 11th. The man warned of imminent attacks on the World Trade Center that would “change the world order” – the White House hung up. This is another example of how virtually the entire Arab worl d was aware of the fact that the WTC had been targeted for imm ediate destruction. Time after time, U.S. authorities refused to follow up on the information. Warnings From Israel The Israeli intelligence agency Mossad warned the CIA and the FBI in August 2001 that terrorists linked to Osama bin Lad en were planning large scale terrorist attacks on highly visible targets of commerce and military, to take place imminently. The CIA completely ignored t he warning despite the fact that it correlated with similar urgent warnings from a multitude of other sources, The Telegraph has learnt that tw o senior experts with Mossad, the Israeli military intelligence service, were sent to Washington in August to alert the CIA and FBI to the existence of a cell of as many of 200 terrorists said to be preparing a big operation. 48 The U.S. Justice Department, from March 2001 onwards, made a series of arrests of Israelis. It later transpir ed that these were Mossad agents and had   47 ‘Warning signs’ – Chris Hansen – Dateline NBC – September 23 2001 – available at http://www.propagandamatrix.com/warning_signs.htm 48 ‘Israeli security issued urgent warning to CIA of large-scale terror attacks’ - David Wastell – London Telegraph – September 16 2002 – available at http://propagandamatrix.com/israeli_security_issued_ur gent_warning_to_cia_of_large_scale_terror_attacks.html "},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"prior knowledge of the September 11th attacks. Many of these spies were suspected of being tasked with the logi stics of preparing the September 11 attacks. If the Justice Department arrested spies with prior knowledge of 9/11 in March 2001, then the Justice Department also had prior knowledge of 9/11 in March 2001. Another Israeli link concerns the in stant messaging company, Odigo. Two hours before Flight 11 crashed into the north to wer, two employees at Odigo received text messages stating that an attack on the World Trade Center was about to occur. Nothing was done, Alex Diamandis, vice president of sales and ma rketing, confirmed that workers in Odigo's research and development and international sales office in Israel received a warning from another Odigo user approximately two hours prior to the first attack. Diamandis said the sender of the instant message was not personally known to t he Odigo employees. Even though the company usually protects the privacy of users, the employ ees recorded the Internet protocol address of the message's sender to facilitate his or her identific ation. Soon after the terrorist attacks on New York, the Odigo employees notified their managemen t, who contacted Israeli security services. In turn, the FBI was informed of the instant mess age warning. FBI officials were not immediately available for comment today. 49 Leaders of the Jewish community in Argentina were also warned that a massive attack on America was about to take place fr om what they described as a reliable intelligence source. The alert was more specific than the usual ‘chatter’ and was passed on to American intelligence, who di dn’t treat it with much urgency even after similar warnings had emanated from the Argentine embassy a few weeks before the October 20 00 U.S.S. Cole bombing. As an aside, yes, the U.S. government had prior knowledge of the Cole bombing and many intelligence agents, such as Kie Fallis of the P entagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency, resigned in disgust. Despite numerous red flags that an attack using a small boat was about to take place, the government refused to put out an alert that would have prevented a tragedy that claimed the lives of seventeen Americans. Warnings From Egypt Egyptian intelligence was credited with helping to halt the July 2001 plot to slam an airliner into the G8 summit in Genoa. Their warnings were grave enough to prompt authorities to posit ion snipers on the roof of the conference buildings. Twelve days before September 11, they were again in contact with the CIA to alert the Americans to an impending terrori st strike. Like numerous other foreign countries, the Egyptians had managed to inf iltrate an agent into Al-Qaeda’s inner circle. The agent learned of an immediate pl an to attack America and was able to ascertain that commercial jetliners would be involved. The information was   49 ‘Instant Messages To Israel Warned Of WTC Attack’ - Brian McWilliams – Washington Post – September 27 2001 – available at http://www.propagandamatrix.com /instant_messages_to_israel_warned_of_attack "},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"passed on to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarek, who in turn opened communication with the CIA, “We expected that something was going to happen and informed the Americans. We told them,'' Mubarak said. He did not mention a U.S. response. 50 The Egyptians tried desperately, with no help from the CIA, to learn more of the plot so as to halt it. Again, taken on it s own this piece of information amounts to nothing more than a wasted opportunity. Add it to the fact that the CIA had close tabs on many of the actual hijackers who were being briefed directly on the terror plot and a different picture emerges. Warnings From Russia Dr. Tatyana Koryagina is a senior re search fellow in the Institute of Macroeconomic Researches subordinated to Russian Ministry of Economic Development (Minekonom). She is reportedl y close to President Putin’s inner circle of advisors. Her credibility s oared after she accurately predicted the collapse of the Russian economy in 1998. In a July 21 Pravda cover story, Koryagina outlined how a shadow organization was about to attack America in order to ac t as a catalyst for worldwide economic destruction. Out of this chaos, this organi zation would establish itself as the new world government. Koryagina was undoubted ly talking about the New World Order. She estimated a date of August 19, just a few weeks before the WTC attack, Pravda: All the participants at the hearings stated that America is a huge financial pyramid which will crash soon. Still, it is hard to understand how th is could happen in the first and richest country of the world – without a war, wi thout missile or bomb strikes? Koryagina: Besides bombs and missiles, there are other kinds of weaponry, much more destructive ones. ... Pravda: Well, economic theory. But how it is possi ble for you to give an exact date [for the U.S. crash] – August 19? Koryagina: The U.S. is engaged in a mortal econo mic game. The known history of civilization is merely the visible part of the iceberg. There is a shadow economy, shadow politics and also a shadow history, known to conspirologists. T here are [unseen] forces acting in the world, unstoppable for [most powerful] countries and even continents. Pravda: Just these forces intend to smash America on August 19? Koryagina: There are international \"super-state \" and \"super-government\" groups. In accordance with tradition, the mystical and religious comp onents play extremely important roles in human history. One must take into account the shad ow economy, shadow politics and the religious component, while predicting the development of the present financial situation.   50 ‘Egypt Leader Says He Warned America’ – Joe Panossian – Associated Press – December 7 2001 – available at http://www.propagandamatrix.com/egypt_leader_says_he_warned_america.html "},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" Pravda: Still, I don't unders tand what could be done to this gi ant country [the U.S.], whose budget is calculated in the trillions of dollars. Koryagina: It is possible to do anything to the U.S. ... whose total debt has reached $26 trillion. Generally, the Western economy is at the boiling point now. Shadow financial actives of $300 trillion are hanging over the planet. At any mom ent, they could fall on any stock exchange and cause panic and crash. The recent crisis in Southeast Asia, which touched Russia, was a rehearsal. Pravda: What is the sense of smashing just America? Koryagina: The U.S. has been chosen as the object of financial attack because the financial center of the planet is located there. The effect will be maximal. The strike waves of economic crisis will spread over the planet instantly and will remind us of the blast of a huge nuclear bomb. 51 In a separate interview, Koryagina ex panded on who exactly the attacking group was. She described it as a criminal fu sion of modern day secret societies and Mafia interests with assets totaling $300 tr illion. Koryagina identified scientology and an elite cabal know as ‘The Dead Head’ as two organizations that use their influence to insert operatives at the hi ghest level of governments. They have no qualms about killing large numbers of people to further their agenda. It is important to emphasize that Koryagina isn’t what the media would call a ‘conspiracy nut’ – she’s an economic advis or to the President of Russia. Delmart Edward “Mike” Vreeland, an American citizen whose claims to being a US Naval Lieutenant assigned to the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) are being increasingly corroborated in open court, has been in a Canadian jail since December 6, 2000. On August 11 or 12 of 2001, the date is uncertain, after trying to verbally alert his Canadian jailers to the coming World Trade Center attacks, he wrote down key information and sealed it in an envelope which he then had placed in jailers’ custody. Canadian author ities do not dispute this event. The letter specifically listed a number of targets including the Sears Towers, the World Trade Center, the White House, the Pentagon, the World Bank, the Canadian parliament building in Otta wa and the Royal Bank in Toronto. A chilling sentence follows the list of ta rgets, “Let one happen. Stop the rest!!!” Vreeland obtained this information while co nducting clandestine work in Moscow.

The CIA Meets bin Laden From July 4th-14th 2001, Osama bin Laden was being treated for kidney infection at the American Hospital, Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Bin Laden arrived by air via Quetta, Pakistan acco mpanied by his doctor and a close aide, possibly Ayman el Zawahiri, a leader of Eg ypt's Islamic Jihad, and was treated in the urology department headed by Dr. Terr y Callaway. There, on multiple occasions, he met with CIA station Chief Larry Mitchell. Bin Laden gave Mitchell 'precise information' regarding 'an imminent attack' on the U.S. 53 This was originally reported by the respected French daily Le Figaro and later picked up by United Press International . Although the CIA denied the report Le Figaro refused to retract it and said thei r French Secret Se rvice and American Hospital staff sources were reliable. This is one of several examples where French intelligence, furious with their US and UK counterparts for treating terrorists as friends, have blown the whistle and commendably so. The International Herald Tribune rubbished the report but Radio France International was able to confirm its veracity. 54 [INSERT FIG 5.5] [CAPTION: The American Hospital in Dubai, united Arab Emirates – scene of a July 2001 meeting between Osama bin Laden and the CIA.] Bin Laden also met with numerous members of his family, who left the U.S. by chartered flights after September 11th with the full blessings of the U.S. government.

Le Figaro came to the only conclusion possibl e, namely that bin Laden was still working for the CIA in accordance with ‘a certain American policy’. They referred to the fact that bin Laden’s Kenya and Tanzania embassy bombing operatives were supported and armed by the Americans, Inquiring into the attacks of August 1998 against the American embassies of Nairobi (Kenya) and Dares-Salaam (Tanzania), the investigators of the FBI discovered that the traces left by the loads come from a military explosive of the American army and that this explosive was delivered three years before to Arab Afghans, the famous intern ational brigades of volunteers, engaged at the side of Oussama Ben Laden lasting the war of Afghanistan against the Soviet army.

Warnings on the Eve of the Attack Newsweek twice reported that t op Pentagon officials had got a warning of the impending attack on September 10th and cancel led their flights for the next day. This confirms that these officials knew both the locations of the imminent attack and the method of using jetliners as bom bs.

Alex Brown was acquired by Bankers Trus t, which in turn was bought by Deutsche Bank. His last post before resigning to take his senior role in the CIA was to head Bankers Trust – Alex Brown's private client business, dealing with t he accounts and investment s of wealthy customers around the world. 63 The stocks of companies with offices in the World Trade Center, such as Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. and Merrill Lynch & Co were also subject to suspicious short-selling, Merrill Lynch & Co., with headquarters near t he Twin Towers, saw 12,215 October $45 put options bought in the four trading days before the attacks; the previous average volume in those shares had been 252 contracts per day [a 1200% increase!].

Elgindy tried to liquidat e his children’s $300,000 (£204,000) trust account on September 10, while informing his stockbroker that the Dow Jones, then at 9,600, would fall to below 3,000, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ken Breen told a j udge in San Diego. \"Perhaps Mr. Elgindy had pre- knowledge of the Sept. 11 attacks. Instead of tryi ng to report it, he tried to profit from it.\" 65 Elgindy was able to forecast the mark et drop because two FBI agents, Jeffrey Royer and Lynn Wingate, whom he had bribed, were providing him with ‘confidential agency material’. Royer and Wingate were subject to an FBI search warrant upon which ‘classified information’ was found. Therefore, we don’t know if this information was directly related to the events of September 11. Taking into account that Elgindy was already known as a ruthless short-seller on Wall Street, I think it’s safe to assume that his involvement in the 9/11 insider trading scam was deliberately engineered to veil the role of the CIA and Alex Brown/Deutsche Bank. We are promised that the investigation is ‘ ongoing’ so don’t hold your breath. But what about...? One of the most common r eplies to the issue of pr ior knowledge and government involvement is ‘how can you carry out such a massive operation and not be caught?’ – the answer is that they have been caught. There are literally hundreds of smoking guns and the evidence lis ted here is only the beginning. I’d also add that, as with any agency, enter prise or business, the U.S. intelligence agencies are highly compartmentalized. Th is means that those at the lower levels just follow orders and don’t see the bigger picture. Of course, they’ll have read many media reports of ‘intelligence failures’ and ‘missed signals’ – but when this only equals a pay rise what incentiv e would these lower level agents have for digging deeper? Even so, people rightly say that at least a handful of people within government and the milit ary would find out and blow the whistle. And again I respond, yes they would and they hav e! Robert Wright, Tatyana Koryagina, David Schippers, Mike Vreeland, and se veral others have come forward. Another misconstrued form of logic is the question of ‘if these people are a threat to the government and they are telling the truth then why haven’t they been killed or silenced?’ – if they we re killed or silenced they would become an even bigger threat to the government. The New World Or der doesn’t want to create martyrs. If those exposing the truth were physicall y ‘taken out’ then it would only lend absolute credibility to everything they had said. Far easier for the government to label everything as a ‘conspiracy theory’ and assassinate characters rather than bodies.

Pub licity is a safeguard.

Another variation on this is ‘if you are saying the mainstr eam media lies all the time then why are you using it to document your argument ?’ The mainstream media cannot always manufacture what happened because people w ould notice. They report on what happened, give you the truth but them spin it to look like something else. It’s like putting a couple of oranges in a blender. The same thing that you put in comes out, it just looks different. So the news will tell you tha t, for example, a plot to attack buildings with planes was known bef ore September 11. What they won’t do is link that to the fact that the World Trade Center was the primary target. Furthermore, they will also ‘forget to in clude’ the fact that many government officials cancelled flights into New Yo rk on September 10. This is just one example, I could use many. The point is that they don’t link different things together. Everything is just a big accident and every event has no relation to the next one. They count on you not having a me mory. Another point I would make is that the vast majority of the news stories I cite never appeared at the top of the evening news headlines. The media obfusca te by distraction. They’ll tell you what the big Hollywood star was weari ng at the ceremony last night and this leaves little time to report the CIA’s friendly chat with Osama right before the attack. And finally, believe it or not, the mainstream j unta is sparsely sprinkled with some decent journalists who actually earn their money by reporting the unvarnished truth. Another tactic the media use, as many of you are pro bably aware, is that they link anyone who talks about a different story behind 9/11 in with a host of different ‘conspiracies.’ This has t he effect of overwhelming the average reader/listener/viewer – making it a far mo re attractive proposition to label the whole lot as a paranoid delusion than act ually take the time to personally investigate it. An example would be an ABC News story entitled ‘What Consensus?

They then link this with ‘extraterrestrial aliens’ (don’t ask me how) and the whole thing turns into a circus.

The same ‘journalists’ who label people like me as a conspiracy theorist are the ones reporting with straight fa ces that the FBI found one of the hijacker’s paper passports in the rubble of the WTC on September 11.

Why were none of t he planes intercepted? Andrews Air Force Base is only ten mile s from the Pentagon. Air defense around Washington is provided mainly by fighter planes from Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland near the District of Columbia bor der. The D.C. Air National Guard is also based there and equipped with F-16 fighter planes. In a blatant reversal of Standard Operat ing Procedure, the Air Force, via willful negligence, is given stand down orders not to intercept Flight 77, which will subsequently hit the Pentagon. Flight 77 is known by NORAD to have been hijacked by 8:50am. Yet it is a full 48 minutes until any fighters are scrambled, as two leave Langley AFB just two minutes before Flight 77 hi ts the Pentagon at 9:40am. Andrews AFB had two combat ready squadrons that would have intercepted Flight 77 had they been allowed to leave upon confirmation of its hijacking. It is Standard Operating Procedure to intercept al l air traffic that fails to respond to radio calls immediately. This was t he case with the golfer Payne Stewart's chartered Lear Jet that crashed in Oct ober 1999. F-16 Fighter s (without the need of a Presidential mandate) had interc epted the aircraft within 21 minutes. This represents willful coordinated negl igence between the FAA, NORAD, the Pentagon (who also track all air traffic) and President Bush, who as this was all unfolding, was reading a book about a pet goat to a group of schoolchildren. Perplexing Connections One of the biggest smoking guns to indica te that the terrorist attack was an inside job is the CIA’s direct connec tion with the hijackers via Pakistan ISI Director General Mahmoud Ahmad. Gener al Mahmoud Ahmad instructed Ahmad Umar Sheikh to hotwire $100,000 to the 9/11 lead hi jacker, Mohammad Atta. On September 11th, Ahmad was a guest of former clandestine CIA officer and CFR member Rep. Porter Goss and Sku ll and Bones/CFR member Senator Bob Graham. Since September 4th, he had me t with top brass at the CIA, the Pentagon and the White House, includi ng Colin Powell, Richard Armitage, Joseph Biden and George Tenet.

The Incredible 9/11 Evidence We’ve All Been Overlooking In trying to piece together what really happened on Sept ember 11, a lot of work has been done - much of it useful and intere sting - into those hijacked flights for which the publicly available evidence is sketchy and contradictory. There are web sites for instance wholly dedicated to invest igating the true fate of Flight 93 and others that attempt to get a clearer idea of what rea lly happened at the Pentagon. Both these incidents however are c haracterized by a pronounced absence of substantive material evidence and it is th is, I suppose, that raises our suspicions and curiosity. There is one flight however that has rece ived insufficient attention and this is American Airlines Flight 11, the plane that allegedly crashed into WTC 1, the north tower. It was the first of the terro rist attacks that day. It has been a big mistake not to subject this flight to the same kind of scrutiny as the others because, unlike the others, a very good and important piec e of documentary evidence of this flight exists in the public domain. This is the so-called 'Fireman's Video' and we really haven't looked at it closely enough. It really does deserve a second look. The story of the 'Fireman's Video' is well known. Two French filmmakers, the Naudet Brothers, were in New York on September 11 making a documentary about the New York Fire Service. The f ootage shows that, while filming in Canal Street, firemen and crew are distracted by a plane flying low overhead. The camera operator instinctively turns his ca mera towards the north tower and, for little more than a second or so, we get a clear view of the plane crashing into the north tower. It is a precious, priceless second. It is the one-second of video that really makes the sinister Bush junta ner vous. It really gives them nightmares. They really didn't want a professional cameraman to catch that moment on broadcast-quality tape. [INSERT FIG 6.1] [CAPTION: The Naudet Brother’s video of the first plane crashing into the WTC.] If you've got it on tape I strongly suggest you take another look at it, with the pause and frame-forward bu ttons at the ready. "},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"When seen at full speed, you might first of all think that there isn't a great deal to see. There's half a second or so when we see the plane flying through the air then it smashes into the tower, creati ng an explosion and leaving a great gash across the building. Notice though that imm ediately before it hits the building the plane emits a brief, bright flash. Notice t oo that the scar it l eaves on the building is rather larger than seems appropria te for the size of the aircraft. Now pause the sequence at the beginning and adv ance it frame by frame. Firstly, look at the plane. Does that look like a Boeing jet to you? Is its wingspan wide enough? Does it have engines attached to its wings? These however are but minor details compared with what comes next. Watch carefully what happens as the plane approaches and crashe s into the tower. I leave you to come to your own conclusions about what you see (wat ch it over and over again, backwards and forwards), but I'll tell you what I see. Immediately before the plane strikes it fi res a missile that blows a hole in the building's facade. This is the cause of t hat brief flash. The plane then begins to disappear neatly into this hole, le aving no wing impressions. A plane disappearing into a hole? Where have I heard that before; wasn't there something about a plane at the Pentagon? Just before it disappears however it fires two more missiles from somewhere ne ar its tail. One goes to the left, one to the right (and up a bit) and it is the blas t holes from these three separate missiles that form the great gash across the bu ilding. There's more. Keep an eye on the adjacent east side of the building, which is also visible. See how, a few frames into the explosion, a white jet of smok e erupts out of the east side at the same level as the plane. The jet comes straight out of the wall at right angles to it, not angled in accordance with the trajectory of the plane. Also it's just white smoke and dust, no orange flames or anything like that. It is clearly a bomb going off, creating the gash that appears on the east wall. I know what I am describing sounds incredible. I suggest only that you look at the footage yourself and come to your own conclusions about what you see. To view the video, go online to http://www.propagandamatrix.co m/firsthit.detail.mov - you will need QuickTime to view the sequence. Go to 'open file' an d then copy and paste the URL. Use the freeze frame tools to analyze the footage. It doesn't take a diploma in imaging expertise to see the massive flash that isn't done justice in published pictures. See the evidence for yourself! The plane that hit the north tower was not American Airli nes Flight 11. It was not a Boeing 757. It was a bespoke military pl ane carrying three missiles that created the impression of a plane crash without le aving any wreckage. In order for it precisely to strike the correct part of the tower (in line with the bomb already planted in the east wall) it must ha ve been flown remotely using cruise navigation. I believe a similar plan e was used to strike the Pentagon. It is instructive to compare the footage of the first crash (Flight 11) with the"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"second one (Flight 175) of which there is a great deal of footage. Now: both Flight 11 and 175 were 767s. They were both flying from Boston to the West coast and they had both been in the air for around 45 minutes before they crashed so they should have had roughly the same amount of fuel on board. Compare the two crashes. Flight 11 is a rather modest explos ion which clears soon and there isn't much flame. What fl ame there is reddish. The collision of Flight 175 on the other hand produces a va st yellow fireball that dominates Manhattan and the resultant fire is pretty intense. I think what we can deduce from this is t hat Flight 11 had very little fuel on board (the missiles and bomb cause the principa l explosion) while Flight 175 was probably full of fuel, thus giving a more s pectacular show for the media that had by then arrived. Also Flight 175 is clearly not a military plane but a regular 767. It has no missiles and nor is it flown using cruise navigation because the 'pilot' almost misses the building and has to swer ve in at the last second. A cruise- controlled craft would not do this. The 'Conspiracy Theorists' have got it dead right this time. The true Flights 11, 175, 77 and 93 were indeed substituted wit h other planes when the transponders were switched off. Someone hijacked the hi jackers to make sure the job was done properly. The technology enabling interc eption of aircraft via remote control from the ground has existed for years, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. developed a remote-controlled reconnaissance plane for the Air Force called Predator, which flew in Bosnia during the conflict there. Used by the military since 1994, it can be landed by pilots lin ked by satellite using controls on the ground or ordering an onboard computer to do the job. 1 A top panel of experienced civilian and milit ary pilots (conspiracy theorists) under the chairmanship of Colonel Donn de Grand met for an exhaustive 72-hour conference in Portugal. The committee was endorsed by Dr. Paul Roberts, former Assistant Secretary of the US Tr easury, and presently Senior Research Fellow at Stamford University. They conclu ded that the flight crews of the four passenger airliners, involv ed in the September 11th tr agedy, had no control over their aircraft, In a detailed press communiqué the inquiry stated: “The so-called terrorist attack was in fact a superbly executed military operation carried out against the USA, requiring the utmost professional military skill in command, communications and control.

According to Hill it had flown on a pre-programmed flight path under the control of a pilot in an outside station. The panel questioned why none of the pilots punched in the four-digit code into the flight transponder to alert ground c ontrol that a hijacking had taken place. Colonel Donn de Grand summarized by sayi ng that the attack was carried out by the U.S. government to deceive its people into backing a crusade against Muslims and an eventual war against Iraq. This major report by respected experts received absolutely no attention in the States or Britai n. Why? Where is the government’s rebuttal? Where is their evidence to prove it was carried out by Al-Qaeda? They haven’t presented any. The 'Fireman's Video' is Bush's true smokin g gun. It is in the public domain and it is even available on DVD. It is probably sitting in the video s helves of thousands and thousands of homes across the world. It is vitally important that the American people see this video frame by frame so t hey can make their own minds up about what really happened on September 11. There has been a silent coup in Americ a but few have noticed yet. The Bush Administration is clearly very sinister indeed and God only knows what it has in store for us next. There is a clue though in the things of which it accuses Saddam Hussein: building and using weapons of mass destruction (nuclear and biological) and killing his own people. Bush is of course describing himself. We have entered the Age of t he Conjurer and it is going to be a tricky time. The 9-11 stunt was a huge magic tr ick and we all bought it at first. Magicians can be very convincing. You have to look very hard to see the trick and not be fooled. On this occasion slow motion exposes t he sleight of hand, but remember how the magician works: he can make almost any thing seem real if he can make his audience look in the wrong pl ace at crucial moments. Only the American people can now st op the imminent slaughter and the imposition of a global fascist police state, but they are currently sleepwalking into their own enslavement. It may already be too late. But maybe if enough Americans get out their videos and their remote controls (pardon the pun) and take a long hard look at that remarkable footage of that plane hitting the north tower, then an armed and outraged middl e America might just pull it off.

The obj ect could very well be what it is reported as being, American Airlines Flight 11. Or is it? Public Action report, The second clue comes from the first New York eyewitness on NBC. She had no question about what she saw. You could hear it in her voice. If she was the state's wi tness, the defense team would have their heads between their knees before she stopped talking.

She was certain in her description -- most people know the difference between a big round-nose commercial jet and a smaller plane. 3 Furthermore, In his testimony before t he Senate Armed Services Committee on October 25, 2001, NORAD commander Ralp h Eberhart said of the first September 11 report, \"We were told it was a light comm uter airplane. It didn't look like that (damage) was caused by a light commuter airplane.\" 4 As is now well known, at least eight of the September 11 ''suicide hijackers' either died before the event or are ac tually still alive.

Hardly the profile of a fundamentalist with an overbearing grudge against wealth and capitalism. Atta's father, again to emphasize, a well respected lawyer and not a crackpot, is in the media every other m onth telling of how his son is still alive and had nothing to do with September 11, \"He is hiding in a secret place so as not to be murdered by the US secr et services,\" Mohammed el-Amir Atta, 66, told the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag. \"As I saw the picture of my son,\" he said, \"I knew that he hadn't done it.

Still, he must have been a pretty fast worker to have overpowered a staff of nine f light attendants, two pilots and eighty-one passengers, before guiding t he plane into the WTC north tower with expert precision. From this evidence it is by no means a leap of the imagination to suggest that Flight 11, if it was Flight 11, was hijack ed not by Muslim terrorists but by Global Hawk remote control technology. T he plane was loaded beforehand with advanced laser missiles, which were fired ju st before it entered the building. This was to ensure the building would later co llapse, destroying the evidence. Such advanced weaponry would expl ain early reports attri buting the unusually low death toll to victims being vaporized, theref ore leaving no trace of their remains. The north tower collapsed after the sout h tower, even though it was hit first. Using the conventional explanat ion of the tower's collaps e, namely 'oh, you see, the towers got really hot and, erm, melted,' we would expec t that the first tower to be hit would also be the first one to coll apse. This was not the case. The south tower collapsed first because it was clear ly filled to the brim with shape charger bombs that detonated just befor e, and during its collapse. The untold story of Flight 11 is merely another drop in the ocean of evidence confirming the highest levels of the US government not only had prior knowledge of September 11 but actually engineer ed the attacks. As more smoking guns surface, it becomes clear that , on at least two of the four flights hijacked that day, there were no 'suicide hijackers' at all. What Brought the Towers Down? Many researchers have asked the basic question – why did the towers collapse and why did they collapse so quickly? No building had ever collapsed before from fire damage. Why was there no satisfactory invest igation of the World Trade Center rubble? Why was it shipped off to China within weeks of the collapse? The handling of the World Trade Center rubble almost mirrors that of the Oklahoma City Alfred P. Murrah building. After eyewitnesses reported several explosions and original newscasts deta iled the recovery of second and third explosive devices, the government dec lared that there was just one bomb and the remains of the building were prof essionally demolished by Controlled Demolitions Inc., the same company that was first on the scene to cart away the WTC rubble. Debris of the f ederal building was then carted off to a private landfill and guarded 24 hours a day by Wackenhut priv ate security. Nothing to hide there then, eh?

Hours after the collapse of the twin towers, Romero stated that the event resembled a professi onal demolition using bombs placed at strategic points within the building, The collapse of the buildings appears \"too methodical\" to be a chance result of airplanes colliding with the structures, said Van Romero, vice pres ident for research at New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. \"My opinion is, based on the videotapes, that after the airplanes hit the World Trade Center there were some explosive devices inside the buildings that caused the towers to collapse,\" Romero said. 10 Romero went on to point out that many terrorist atta cks often feature a second, less noticeable but more deadly event that does most of the damage. The initial event, in this case the shocking scene of planes slamming into buildings, is in essence a diversionary tactic. In an amazing turnaround, Romero revers ed his position just ten days later and told journalists that the jet fuel had caus ed the collapse.

Romero said he has been bombarded with electronic mail from the conspiracy theorists. \"I'm very upset about that,\" he said. \"I'm not trying to say anything did or didn't happen.\" 11 The actual engineers that designed the twin towers were baffled that an impact from a 747 could have caused the total failu re of the structures. Like Romero, some changed their minds after the appropriate ‘pressure’ was applied from authorities, A lead engineer who designed the World Trade Center Towers expressed shock that the towers collapsed after being hit by passenger jets. \"I designed it for a 707 to hit it,\" Lee Robertson, the project's structural engineer said. The Boeing 707 has a fuel capacity of more than 23,000 ga llons, comparable to the 767's 23,980-gallon fuel capacity. Another architect of the WTC, Aaron Swirski, lives in Israel and spoke to Jerusalem Post Radio after the attack: \"It was designed around that eventual ity to survive this kind of attack,\" he said. Hyman Brown, a University of Colorado civil engineering professor and the World Trade Center's construction manager, watched in confusion as t he towers came down. \"It was over-designed to withstand almost anything including hurricanes, high winds, bombings and an airplane hitting it,\" he said. 12 Another ‘conspiracy theorist’ who report ed bombs in the twin towers was Louie Cacchioli, a 51-year-old firefighter assi gned to Engine 47 in Harlem with over twenty years experience. Cacchioli was part of the first rescue team that entered the south tower after Fli ght 175 struck. He told People Magazine , “I was taking firefighters up in the elevator to t he 24th floor to get in position to evacuate workers. On the last trip up a bomb went off.

These spikes suggest that massive underground explosions may have literally knocked the towers off their foundations, causing them to collapse. In the basements of the collapsed towers, wher e the 47 central support columns connected with the bedrock, hot spots of “liter ally molten steel” were discov ered more than a month after the collapse. Such persistent and intense residual heat, 70 feet below the surface, in an oxygen starved environment, could explain how t hese crucial structural supports failed. 20 Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Eart h Observatory is 21 miles north of the WTC site. Seismographs recorded a 2.1 magnitude earthquake during the 10- second collapse of the South Tower at 9:59:04 and a 2.3 quake during the 8- second collapse of the North Tower at 10:28:31. Immediately before the collapse of the two towers, identical seismic spikes occurred which dwarfed the actual energy jolt registered by the falling of the debris, These unexplained “spikes” in the seismic data lend credence to the theory that massive explosions at the base of the towers caused the collapses. A “sharp spike of short duration” is how seismolo gist Thorne Lay of Univer sity of California at Santa Cruz told AFP an underground nuclear explosion appears on a seismograph. The two unexplained spikes are more than 20 times the amplitude of the other seismic waves associated with the collapses and occurred in t he East-West seismic recording as the buildings began to fall.   19 ‘Unexplained 9-11 Explosion at WTC Complex’ – Christopher Bollyn – American Free Press – July 14 2002 - http://www.americanfreepress.net/07_14_02/Unexplained_9-11_/unexplained_9-11_.html 20 ‘NEW SEISMIC DATA REFUTES OFFICIAL EXPLANATION’ – Christopher Bollyn – American Free Press – September 3 2002 - http://www.americanfreepress.net/09_03_02/NEW_SEISMIC_/new_seismic_.html "},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Experts cannot explain why the seismic waves peaked before the towers actually hit the ground. 21 The notion that advanced laser/particle beam weaponry was used to bring down the towers correlates with footage of the radio antenna on the nor th tower literally disintegrating into thin air as the building begins to collapse.

Kazakhstan , Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan possess largely unexplored reserves worth over $3 trillion. I say ‘over’ because the fact that they are untapped leads some exper ts to conclude that Kazakhstan alone may hold more oil than Saudi Arabia. An oi l consortium that included BP, Mobil, Shell and Total completed a seismic study of the Caspian Sea region in early 1996. It was decided that the only feasible route for the pipeline at this time would be straight through Afghanistan. Other options were dismissed due to political wrangling and cost. This resear ch team included Zalmay Khalilzad, who was by pure coincidence later appointed Bu sh’s special envoy to Afghanistan. A 1996 London Telegraph article concluded, Another pipeline route exists, and is already at a det ailed planning stage. This pipeline, initially for gas, would begin in the Dauletabad field in centra l Turkmenistan, traverse Afghanistan along the Herat-Kandahar corridor, territory controll ed by the Taliban, and exit into Pakistan. 1 In late 1997 the Taliban paid a visit to Texa s to meet with representatives of the energy giant Unocal company at t heir Sugarland headquarters. Under the headline ‘Taleban in Texas for talks on gas pipeline,’ the BBC reported, A senior delegation from the Taleban movement in Afghanistan is in the United States for talks with an international energy company that want s to construct a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan across Afghanistan to Pakistan. 2 The Taliban delegation’s visit was set- up and sponsored by The Center for Afghanistan Studies, which received $1.8 mill ion over two years from Unocal in exchange for the development of regional contacts that would enable Unocal to secure the pipeline deal over compet ing companies, such as the Argentinean firm Bridas.

By this time, negotiations with the Taliban were still ongoing but Unocal were becoming frustrated. After the Bush administration came to pow er, construction of the pipeline became even more paramount. U.S. and Taliban dipl omatic representatives met several times in Washington, Berlin and Islamabad. The last meeting occurred just five weeks before the attacks on Washingt on and New York. Respected authors Jean-Charles Brisard and Guillaume Dasquie were closely tracking developments for a book that would onl y become even more striking after the events of September 11 put the s aga in a devastating perspective, Brisard and Dasquie draw a portrait of the closest aides to Bush, linking them to the oil business. Bush's family has a strong oil background, as do so me of his top aides. From Vice President Dick Cheney, through the director of the National Securi ty Council Condoleezza Rice, to the ministers of commerce and energy, Donald Evans and Stanley Abraham, all have for long worked for US oil companies. Cheney was until the end of last y ear president of Halliburton, a company that provides services for oil industry; Rice was between 1991 and 2000 manager for Chevron; Evans and Abraham worked for Tom Brown, another oil giant. 4 In an earlier chapter, we discussed Bush’s order for the FBI to “back off” investigation of Al-Qaeda bef ore September 11. While this was partly to protect Saudi business interests, it was also to keep the Taliban sweet over the oil deal. John O’Neill, then Deputy Director of the FBI and Osama bin Laden’s main pursuer was furious at his efforts to catch terrorists being blocked and desperately tried to warn that a massive at tack would take place if the terrorists continued to be protected. O’Neill quit tw o weeks before 9/11 to work as head of security at the World Trade Center and died on his first day in the collapse as he rushed back in to save victims. A plan to hunt down bin Laden had been drafted at the very end of Bill Clinton’s tenure (Clinton had nothing to do with it of course) and Bu sh let it sit on his desk for eight months while a deal with the Ta liban was still possible. Of course the media described this as 'an accident’ and wh en Bush finally did activate the plan, in the week before September 11, it was a pure coincidence that this was also the time when it was decided that the Taliban negotiations were to be brought to a halt. During the final meeting, a U. S. representative told the Taliban, 'either you accept our offer of a carpet of gold, or we bury you under a carpet of bombs.'

The wider objective, according to Mr Naik, w ould be to topple the Taleban regime and install a transitional government of moderate Afghans in it s place - possibly under the leadership of the former Afghan King Zahir Shah.

Of course, the document is presented as a battle plan to fight terrorism but is basically a mandate to invade over 60 c ountries, one after the other. The first stage was the invasion of Afghanistan and was, by sheer coincidence I assure you, drawn up just days after it was conc luded that the Talib an were unwilling to finalize a deal on the oil pipeline, Officials did not believe that Bush had had the opportunity to closely review the document in the two days between its submission and the Sept. 11 attacks. But it had been submitted to national security adviser Condoleezza Rice, and the officials said Bush knew about it and had been expected to sign it. Such a directive would normally be approved with the president’s knowledge by his Principals Committee, which in Bush’s White House incl udes Rice, Attorney General John Ashcroft, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of State Colin Powell, Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill and CIA Director George Tenet, among other senior administration officials. 6 In June 2001 the Indian public affairs magazine News Insight reported that Russia and the U.S. were about to inv ade Afghanistan because the Taliban were advancing and threatening to take control of the entire regi on’s oil supply, India and Iran will \"facilitate\" US and Russian plans for \"limited military action\" against the Taliban if the contemplated tough new economic sa nctions don't bend Afghanistan's fundamentalist regime. 7   5 ‘US planned attack on Taleban' – George Arney – BBC – September 18 2001 - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1550366.stm 6 ‘U.S. planned for attack on al-Qaida’ – MSNBC – May 16 2002 - http://propagandamatrix.com/US_planned_for_attack_on_al-Qaida.htm 7 ‘India in anti-Taliban military plan’ – News Insight – June 26 2001 - http://www.indiareacts.com /archivefeatures/nat2.asp?recno=10&ctg=%20 "},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Bear in mind that throughout this peri od the Taliban made numerous offers to hand over bin Laden but the State Departm ent said no.

Poppy Paradise: The CIA Regains Control In July 2000, the Taliban government by order of Mullah Omar imposed a total ban on opium production. Prior to the ban, Afghanistan accounted for 70% of the world’s opium and 80% of heroin des tined to North American and European markets. Opium is extracted from poppy seeds and then converted into a morphine base, white heroin or one of th ree grades of brown heroin. After the ban, poppy production dwindled by more than 90% for 2001. The global narcotics trade is a turf wa r between pocket rebel groups around the world and the CIA in league with Wall Stree t. If these groups pay their cut then they are left alone, if they don’t then t hey are labeled as terrorist organizations and obliterated. This is how people lik e Noriega go from being business partners to enemies. At an estimated $200 billion, the Afghan Golden Crescent drug trade makes up over a third of the worldwide annual turnov er of narcotics. Countless investigations and evidence presented by respected journalists and people who worked for the government have establis hed that the CIA run the global drug trade, they ship in the heroin to des troy your children’s lives and entire communities of people. When the bombing began in Af ghanistan Tony Blair vo wed to “bomb the poppy fields” and yet since late 2001 poppy production and supply has again ballooned to record levels. The CIA put their puppet government in, t he drug control agency were kicked out of Afghanistan by the No rthern Alliance, their vehicles were stolen and their headquarters occupied, In order to receive US aid, Hamid Karzai's coalition had to make a pro forma announcement in January that opium cultivation is still forbidden, but the extent of this renewed commitment to abstention from Afghanistan's prime cash crop was almost simultaneously displayed in the unceremonious ejection of Afghanistan's drug contro l agency from its offices in Kabul, with the drug czar's desk being kicked physically into the street. 12 [INSERT FIG 7.1 [CAPTION: After the CIA-fr iendly puppet government was installed in Afghanistan, opium once again flowed out of the country at record levels.] Exactly like the issue of the oil pipe line, the mainstream media called the narcotics agenda a conspiracy theory while at the same time reporting how baffled they were that heroin was flooding western streets at record levels. Less than a year after the bombing began and the new government was installed, heroin production had soared a whopping 1400 per cent,   12 ‘Opium and Afghanistan’ - Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair – Counterpunch – March 6 2002 - http://www.counterpunch.org/bumpercrop.html "},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" Now the UN estimates that more than $1bn worth of the crop is now being produced in farms in the country.

The London Independent reported, Heroin is likely to continue flooding into Britain from a huge stockpile in Afghanistan, the Government has been warned by customs officials. The drug appears to be as readily available as ever, despite a series of significant heroin se izures in recent months, according to officials. 14 The majority of modern wars have eit her had a financial agenda of oil or drugs behind them. Vietnam was about shippi ng drugs back to the States to promulgate the phony hippie movement, which laid the foundations for the destruction of morality and the strong family unit – an attack which accelerates unabated today. It angers me to see y oung people my age using drugs because they think they are rebelling against the sys tem. They are in fa ct destroying their own lives using government products paid for by the blood of innocent babies killed in foreign wars. The Patriot Act In the case of every te rrorist atrocity, from th e Omagh bombing in Northern Ireland to the Oklahoma City bombing, t here is always a mammoth package of legislation already ready to be pass ed immediately after the incident when people’s fear and desire for ‘protection’ is at its peak. September 11 was no different. The USA Patriot Act was pa ssed on October 25 after the American people had been told that the terrorists had attacked because they hated their freedom. By this very definition the Bush administration were terrorists because they signed into law a bill that was an insult to the principles of freedom. Congressman Ron Paul told Insight Magazine that the House wasn’t even allowed to read the bill and Dick Cheney said that anyone who di dn’t vote for the bill would be publicly blamed for the next terror attack, Paul confirms rumors circulating in Washingt on that this sweeping new law, with serious implications for each and every American, was not made available to members of Congress for review before the vote. \"It's my understanding the bill wasn't printed before the vote — at least I couldn't get it. They played all kinds of games, kept the House in session all night, and it was a very complicated bill.

Section 802 defines domestic te rrorism as actions which, Involve acts dangerous to human life that are a viol ation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State. 16 Read that back again to yourself. Any crim inal act – jaywalking for example – is defined as terrorism. What follows is a deeper analysis of how the different provisions violate the U.S. Constitution by Alex Jones. Alex’s ‘Save the Bill of Rights Campaign’ has had nat ionwide success in persuading city councils to adopt a resolution opposing the Patriot Act. Th is is just a snapshot of some of the powers the bill grants, - Gives the Attorney General and Secretary of State the power to designate domestic groups including political and religious organizations as \"terrorist organizations\" under the \"Enemy Combatant\" designation. - The \"Enemy Combatant\" designation gives law enforcement the unprecedented power to secretly seize citizens and non-citizens without ever charging them with a crime, and the dictatorial elements of the Federal Governme nt claim the right to detain these \"Enemy Combatants\" indefinitely, at secret, secure m ilitary installations inside and outside the United States and to deny them legal representation, all of this while never being charging them with a crime or telling them why they are being held. T he Justice Department also claims the right to execute those designated \"Enemy Combatant\" in secr et after a trial by secret military tribunal. - Grants power to the Attorney General to subjec t citizens of other nations to indefinite detention as well as transporting them to third-party c ountries like Egypt and Morocco, where the Justice Department claims they can legally be tortured. - Authorizes total surveillance on confidential communications between attorneys and their clients in Federal custody in terrorism and non-terrorism cases. - Limits disclosure of public documents and re cords under the Freedom of Information Act. - Section 213 of the USA Patriot Act allows any branch of the Federal or State Governments to break into your home or business, to remove any items (or place items) they wish without a warrant and without informing the person or busine ss of this total violation of the Fourth Amendment. - Section 213 of the USA Patriot Act also decap itates the First Amendment protection of Freedom of Speech by forcing silence on those victimized by their Unconstitutional, warrantless searches. - Section 215 of the USA Patriot Act gives law enforcement expanded authority to obtain library and book store records (violating the Fourth Amendment) all the while prohibiting librarians and store workers from informing patrons of monito ring or information requests (violating the First Amendment).   16 ‘Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT ACT) Act of 2001 – Section 802 – Available at http://infowars.com/HR_3162/Sec_802.htm "},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"- The USA Patriot Act is the enabling legislation empowering the reorganization from the International to the local level through the Homeland Security enforcement mechanism. The reorganization of the government under Homeland Security is centralized in the new North American Military Command. We are witnessing a complete transformation of the governmental structures in America. The new system that is emerging, what President George W. Bush calls \"the Homeland\" is right out of a college te xtbook detailing the development, expansion and maintenance of dictatorships. The Homeland Secu rity system is the institutionalization of a military-industrial complex dictatorship. It is all co lor of law, finding its roots in Imperial Rome and fascist Germany. 17 As if Patriot Act I wasn’t bad enough, Patr iot Act II – the Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003, went even furt her in abolishing every vestige of personal freedom. It had already been wri tten up and amended several times in secret just waiting to be passed after the next government terror attack. A copy was leaked from inside the government ( again proving we still have good people within the enemy on our side) to the Center for Public Int egrity. Again we will cite Alex Jones’ excellent analysi s in revealing the key sections of this terrorist document, Here is a quick thumbnail sketch of just some of the draconian measures encapsulated within this tyrannical legislation: SECTION 501 (Expatriation of Te rrorists) expands the Bush administration’s “enemy combatant” definition to all American citizens who “may” have violated any provision of Section 802 of the first Patriot Act. (Section 802 is the new definition of domestic terrorism, and the definition is “any action that endangers human life that is a violation of any Federal or State law.”) Section 501 of the second Patriot Act directly connects to Sect ion 125 of the same act. The Justice Department boldly claims that the incredibly broad Section 802 of the First USA Patriot Act isn’t broad enough and that a new, unlimited definition of terrorism is needed. Under Section 501 a US citizen engaging in lawful activities can be grabbed off the street and thrown into a van never to be seen again. The Ju stice Department states that they can do this because the person “had inferred from conduct” that they were not a US citizen. Remember Section 802 of the First USA Patriot Act states that any violation of Federal or State law can result in the “enemy combatant” terrorist designation. SECTION 201 of the second Patriot Act makes it a criminal act for any member of the government or any citizen to release any in formation concerning the incarceration or whereabouts of detainees. It also states that law enforcement does not even have to tell the press who they have arrested and they never have to release the names. SECTION 301 and 306 (Terrorist Identificati on Database) set up a national database of “suspected terrorists” and radically expand the database to include anyone associated with suspected terrorist groups and anyone involved in crimes or having supported any group designated as “terrorist.” These sections also set up a national DNA database for anyone on probation or who has been on probation for any crime, and orders State governments to collect the DNA for the Federal government. SECTION 312 gives immunity to law enforcement engaging in spying operations against the American people and would place substantial restri ctions on court injunctions against Federal violations of civil ri ghts across the board.   17 ‘Save the Bill of Rights Campaign’ – Alex Jones - http://infowars.com/resolution_resist_tyranny.html"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"SECTION 101 will designate individual terrorists as foreign powers and again strip them of all rights under the “enemy combatant” designation. SECTION 102 states clearly that any information gathering, regardless of whether or not those activities are illegal, can be considered to be clandestine intelligence activities for a foreign power. This makes ne ws gathering illegal. SECTION 103 allows the Federal government to use wartime martial law powers domestically and internationally without Congress de claring that a state of war exists. SECTION 106 is bone-chilling in its straightforwar dness. It states that broad general warrants by the secret FSIA court (a panel of secret judges se t up in a star chamber system that convenes in an undisclosed location) granted under the first Pa triot Act are not good enough. It states that government agents must be given immunity for carrying out searches with no prior court approval. This section throws out the entire Fourth Amendment against unreasonable searches and seizures. SECTION 109 allows secret star chamber co urts to issue contempt charges against any individual or corporation who refuses to incriminat e themselves or others. This section annihilates the last vestiges of the Fifth Amendment. SECTION 110 restates that key police state clause s in the first Patriot Act were not sunsetted and removes the five year sunset clause from other su bsections of the first Patriot Act. After all, the media has told us: “this is the New Americ a. Get used to it. This is forever.” SECTION 111 expands the definition of the “enemy combatant” designation. SECTION 122 restates the government’s newly announced power of “surveillance without a court order.” SECTION 123 restates that the government no long er needs warrants and that the investigations can be a giant dragnet-style sweep described in press reports about the Total Information Awareness Network. One passage reads, “thus the focus of domesti c surveillance may be less precise than that directed against mo re conventional types of crime.” *Note: Over and over again, in subsection after subsection, the second Patr iot Act states that its new Soviet-type powers will be used to fight in ternational terrorism, domestic terrorism and other types of crimes. Of course the government has al ready announced in Section 802 of the first USA Patriot act that any crime is considered domestic terrorism. SECTION 126 grants the government the right to mi ne the entire spectrum of public and private sector information from bank records to educational and medical records. This is the enacting law to allow ECHELON and the Total Information Aw areness Network to totally break down any and all walls of privacy. The government states that they must look at ev erything to “determine” if individuals or groups might have a connection to terrorist groups. As you can now see, you are guilty until proven innocent. SECTION 127 allows the government to takeover coroners’ and medical examiners’ operations whenever they see fit. See how this is like B ill Clinton’s special medical examiner he had in Arkansas that ruled that people had committ ed suicide when their arms and legs had been cut off. SECTION 128 allows the Federal government to place gag orders on Federal and State Grand Juries and to take over the proceedings. It also disallows individuals or organizations to even try"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"to quash a Federal subpoena. So now defendi ng yourself will be a terrorist action. SECTION 129 destroys any remaining whistleblower protection for Federal agents. SECTION 202 allows corporations to keep secret thei r activities with toxic biological, chemical or radiological materials. SECTION 205 allows top Federal officials to keep all their financial dealings secret, and anyone investigating them can be considered a terrorist. Th is should be very useful for Dick Cheney to stop anyone investigating Haliburton. SECTION 303 sets up national DNA database of suspected terrorists. The database will also be used to “stop other unlawful acti vities.” It will share the information with state, local and foreign agencies for the same purposes. SECTION 311 federalizes your local police department in the area of information sharing. SECTION 313 provides liability pr otection for businesses, especi ally big businesses that spy on their customers for Homeland Security, violating their privacy agreements. It goes on to say that these are all preventative measur es – has anyone seen Minority Report? This is the access hub for the Total Information Awareness Network. SECTION 321 authorizes foreign governments to spy on the American people and to share information with foreign governments. SECTION 322 removes Congress from the extradi tion process and allows officers of the Homeland Security complex to extradite American citizens anywhere they wish. It also allows Homeland Security to secretly take individuals out of foreign countries. SECTION 402 is titled “Providing Material Support to Terrorism.” The section reads that there is no requirement to show that the individual even had the intent to aid terrorists. SECTION 403 expands the definition of weapons of ma ss destruction to include any activity that affects interstate or foreign commerce. SECTION 404 makes it a crime for a terrorist or “other criminals” to use encryption in the commission of a crime. SECTION 408 creates “lifetime parole” (basica lly, slavery) for a whole host of crimes. SECTION 410 creates no statute of limitations for anyone that engages in terrorist actions or supports terrorists. Remember: any crime is now considered terrorism under the first Patriot Act. SECTION 411 expands crimes that are punishable by death. Again, they point to Section 802 of the first Patriot Act and state that any terrorist act or support of terrorist act can result in the death penalty. SECTION 421 increases penalties for terrorist fi nancing. This section st ates that any type of financial activity connected to terrorism will re sult to time in prison and $10-50,000 fines per violation. SECTIONS 427 sets up asset forfeiture provisio ns for anyone engaging in terrorist activities. 18   18 ‘A Brief Analysis of the Domestic Security Enhancement Act 2003, Also Known as Patr iot Act II’ – Alex Jones – February 10 2003 - http://infowars.com/print_patriotact2_analysis.htm "},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Along with the leak of Patriot Act II came a whole new stack of bills including The Universal National Service Act of 2003, which creates a mandatory draft under Homeland Security of every young person in the country.

Camps and Combatants The Patriot Act created the scope to broaden the definition of terrorism to encompass any activity deemed ‘subversive’ by the government. It also focused attention towards domestic terrorists – th is crackdown isn’t just about Mohamed with the Turban, it’s about American ci tizens and their families. The Bush administration has developed a parallel legal system to rival those of Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany. By ‘parallel’ I mean unconstitutional. Whether you are part of the constitutional legal system or the uncons titutional ‘parallel’ legal system is determined solely by the federal government. They can secretly arrest you, declare you to be an enemy combatant , and hold you indefinitely at places like Camp X-Ray, which amounts to nothing more than a modern day concentration camp.

In August of 2002, Reuters published a story detailing how, on the order of Bush, anyone could be immediately executed without trial. The story appeared on mainstream web sites like ABC News for about an hour but was mysteriously pulled. I managed to save a copy of the text and here it is in full, WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a su rprise move sure to raise outcries from foreign governments, civil liberties groups and others, The White House today announced with little fanfare that effective immediately, certain individuals whom Pr esident Bush or other high-level Administration members have designated as terrorists are subj ect to summary execution by either Homeland Security operatives, U.S. intelligence operatives , and in some cases by U.S. military personnel.

The White House gave notice of the new policy in as quiet a way as possible, making the announcement late Sunday evening from Crawford, Texas. The unprecedented move is thought certain to generate a firestorm of protest from numerous quarters. Citing national security considerations, Bush Administration spokespersons have declined to comment on the new directive. In light of the Pr esident's slippage in recent opinion polls, many political analysts believe the Administration will avoid making any further public references to what is sure to be a very contentious and unpopular decision. 20 The same story albeit reworded and put in the context that these executions will only take place abroad, was then released four months later, U.S. citizens working for al-Qaida overseas can legally be targeted and killed by the CIA under President Bush's rules for the war on terrorism, U.S. officials say. The authority to kill U.S. citizens is granted under a secret finding signed by the president after the Sept. 11 attacks that directs the CIA to covertly attack al-Qaida any where in the world. The authority makes no exception for Americans, so permission to strike them is understood rather than specifically described, officials said. 21 Do you understand what this means? This officially makes Bush a dictator, a King, an Emperor – his authorit y now overrides all Constitutional protection. This has nothing to do with fighting Al-Qaeda - the real Al-Qaeda work for the CIA – up to 8000 of them were flown to safety out of Kunduz in November 2001. All Bush has to do is say you are working with Al-Qaeda and you are dead! No evidence, no legal representation, no trial, no jury – you’re just immediately killed! I just quoted the Houston Chronicle saying the same thing! What to do with American citizens w ho become ‘enemy combatants’? Ah yes, what about that network of concentrat ion camps in America that have been sitting there quietly for decades waiting to be filled? In August 2002 the L.A.

It was no surprise to those of us who hav e been trying to warn people about this, but to see it so blatantly in your face was astounding, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft's announced desire for ca mps for U.S. citizens he deems to be \"enemy combatants\" has moved him from merely being a political embarrassment to being a constitutional menace. Ashcroft's plan, disclosed last week but little publicized, would allow him to order the indefinite incarceration of U.S. citizens an d summarily strip them of their constitutional rights and access to the courts by declaring them enemy combatants.

The Detroit Free Press reported, In one simulation, involving a fake plague that struck at a rock concert in Chicago, questions arose about what to do with people who insisted on breaking the quarantine, said Randy Larsen of the AnserInstitute, a security think-tank in Arlington, Va.

State seizure of firearms, seizure of property, food management, clothing management, takeover of all forms of transport, troops on the streets. This scenario has been play ed out in countless mock terrorist attacks and hour-long TV dramas to condition peo ple on how to react when the biological gets released.

Feel the Love: Martial Law, Foreign Troops and Torture The training of our militar y and police has shifted in emphasis from a notion of protecting citizens to that of viewing citizens as a dangerous enemy that needs to be firmly kept under close scrutiny. Even so, many American soldiers and cops will refuse to obey orders to kill, quar antine or otherwise harm American citizens. That is why foreign troops are being br ought into America – they are willing to carry out ruthless orders without remors e. The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 states, From and after the passage of this act it shall not be lawful to employ any part of the Army of the United States, as a posse comitatus, or otherwise , for the purpose of executing the laws, except in such cases and under such circumstances as such employment of said force may be expressly authorized by the Constitution or by act of Congr ess; and no money appropriated by this act shall be used to pay any of the expenses incurred in the employment of any troops in violation of this section. 28 This prevents the military from engagi ng in domestic law enforcement. The erosion of this law began long before S eptember 11. In the last few years we have seen an explosion of ‘Urban Warfare’ operations where t he U.S. Army run training operations in U.S. cities and practice running checkpoints, raiding homes, confiscating guns and rounding up citizens to be held in internment camps. It is now confirmed that Russian troops we re involved in the Waco siege of 1993, where the BATF on orders of Bill Clinton and Janet Reno, torched the Branch Davidian complex – killing 76 people, in cluding over 20 children.

Foreign assets. A new military agreement was signed with Canada to allow U.S. and Canadian troops to cross each other’s borders and main tain order in the event of a terrorist attack in either country, Under the agreement, either country can reques t military help from the other. Any U.S. troops operating in Canada would be under the command of a Canadian officer, while any Canadian troops operating south of the border would be under U.S. command. The agreement calls for increased joint operations and exercises against terrorism. It also creates a new planning group to study how both countries would jointly deploy military forces and emergency services in response to a terrorist attack or other disaster. 33 And it’s not just Canadian troops t hat will be barging down doors and arresting Americans. This pact opens the gateway fo r foreign troops of any nation to be used in domestic law enforcement. Many ar e already in the country and training with your local police force and army unit in preparation for the next terror attack. Now that you have been defined as a terrori st you can expect to be tortured by the Homeland Love Brigade. All joking aside, torture of ‘terrorists’ (shoemakers and farmers in the case of the G uantanamo prisoners) began and the media even started discussing whether torture of terrorist suspect’s children was legitimate. So I guess it was OK for t he Nazis to torture people they defined as their enemies and I guess it was OK for American prisoners captured in Korea and Vietnam to be tortured? The United States is condoning the torture and ille gal interrogation of prisoners held in the wake of September 11, in defiance of international la w and its own constitution, according to lawyers, former US intelligence officers and human rights groups.   31 ‘Northern Command General Endorses Posse Comitatus Review’ – Newsmax – July 22 2002 - http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2002/7/22/01218.shtml 32 ‘Biden backs letting soldiers arrest civilians - Joyce Howard Price – Washington Times – July 22 2002 – available at http://www.prisonplanet.com/news_alert_072202_martial.html 33 ‘New military cooperation pact allows Canadian, U.S. tr oops to enter each other's territory’ - Tom Cohen – Associated Press - December 10 2002 – available at http://www .prisonplanet.com/news_al ert_121002_martial.html "},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"They claim prisoners have been beaten, hooded and had painkillers withheld.

That was the message celebrity lawyer and civil libertarian Alan M. Dershowitz delivered to a crowd packed into a gymnasium Sunday at the Jewish Community Center in Creve Coeur. Dershowitz was the opening speaker for the Jewish Book Fair. 35 But what about that ‘balance between liberty and security’? There is no ‘balance’ – either there is liberty or there is Nazi Germany. As Thomas Jefferson said, \"I would rather be exposed to the inconv eniences attending too much liberty than to those attending too small a degree of it.\" So we have the government giving itself the authority to secr etly arrest anyone they deem to be a terrorist, which under the terms of the legislation is anyone who unwittingly breaks a law. The gover nment can then declare that person an enemy combatant, ship them off to a FE MA camp and have foreign troops torture them and their children. And they said the terrorists wanted to take away our freedoms? I agree, the terrorists have ta ken away our freedoms but the terrorists wear sharp suits. America is now officia lly a police state but all these new laws are null and void because they violate the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Black people were slaves because of a la w and just as then, we have to stand up, resist and make it known that we don’t follow laws drafted by terrorists. The Whitewash The intelligence committees of the Senat e and House of Repr esentatives held a series of hearings through to the end of 2002 with a second committee set up to ‘investigate’ September 11 scheduled for the later months of 2003.

As independent research has hi ghlighted, the Bush adminis tration not only had prior knowledge of the terrorist a ttacks, but actually ran the entire operation. This will strike the naive reader as a bold statem ent indeed. The informa tion I cite that enables me to make it is as voluminous as it is disturbing and I have already presented it in the previous two chapters. The investigation was a complete wh itewash. The mid-2002 media blitz concerning what the government knew before 9/11 was an orchestrated campaign to put the real evidence of gov ernment complicity in the shadows. This enabled the CIA and the FBI to dismiss this watered down issue as one 'intelligence failure' after another. The House and Senate committees comp rised of several well-meaning representatives with good voting reco rds and honorable reputations. However, both groups were dominated by individuals who owe allegiance to interests that directly conflict with the pr omise of a balanced inquiry. The Carlyle Group, a secretive Washi ngton, D.C., invest ment firm managing some $14 billion in assets, including stakes in a number of defense-related companies, is making substant ial profits from the war on terrorism. Ca rlyle also donated a total of over $57,000 to various me mbers of the two panels who, if this were not a dummy operation, would be r equired to investigate them. Carlyle number just one of numerous companies feeding the war machine that have bankrolled the structure of t he 9/11 probe. If the war on terrorism took a blow from this investigation, so would t hese representative's bank balances. Where was the incentive for a fair hearing? Where was the balance? Many of the committee members alr eady stated their position on pre-9/11 warnings before the investigation began. They rubbished the very issue they were about to 'investigate.' Likewise, several had a direct hand in crafting the USA Patriot Act. As we have seen, this legislation defines anyone who breaks the law as a terrorist and allows the aut horities to search your home without you even knowing about it. These people are put in office to uphold the U.S. Constitution and yet have actively disse cted it. September 11th justified the Patriot Act in their eyes. They are not about to humiliate themselves by questioning this justification. Furthermore, a disturbing majority of t he House and Senate representatives hold membership to elite organizations publicly sworn to destroying America in favor of a Globalist one world order system. This trend ranges from the now public U.S. centered Council on Foreign Relati ons through the Trilateral Commission to the quasi-secret international ist Bilderberg Group.

P2OG: Making Sure Terrorists are Angry For all the fear mongering and apocalypti c warnings, post-9/11 America hasn’t suffered another terrorist attack and I sinc erely hope that is still the case as you are reading these words. To this end, the Pentagon decided that in order to create the likelihood of more terrorist a ttacks both on U.S. so il and abroad, they would need to provoke terrorists into action. P2OG stands for the Proactive Pre-emptiv e Operations Group and is a fusion of the military and CIA. The gr oup’s allocated budget is an estimated $3.3 billion, according to the Asia Times 37 , but other sources have placed it closer to $7 billion. This body would launch secr et operations aimed at \"st imulating reactions\" among terrorists and states possessing weapons of mass destructi on - that is, for instance, prodding terrorist cells into action and exposing themselves to \"quick- response\" attacks by U.S. forces. 38 So there we have the L.A. Times telling us that the Pentagon will now be manipulating terrorists groups to ensure that they atta ck U.S. interests. Once again, it’s out in the open and in your face . And yet again the rationale is similar to MI5 having their agents carry out bom bings and kill children supposedly to retain their cover in terror ists organizations – total lunacy. The program evokes flashback to the maniacal planning of Lemnitzer and his Operation Northwoods cronies. Moscow Times writer Chris Floyd one was of t he few journalists to be rightly outraged by P2OG, Let's say this plainly, clearly and soberly, so t hat no one can mistake the intention of Rumsfeld's plan -- the United States government is planning to use \"cover and deception\" and secret military operations to provoke murderous terrorist attacks on innocent people. Let's say it again: Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, George W. Bush and t he other members of the unelected regime in Washington plan to deliberately foment the murder of innocent people -- your family, your friends, your lovers, you -- in order to further their geopolitical ambitions. 39   37 ‘P2OG allows Pentagon to fight dirty – David Isenberg – Asia Times – November 5 2002 - http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/DK05Ak02.html 38 ‘The Secret War’ – William M.

Fr om the evidence we’ve seen, this sounds like another ‘CIA practicing crashing planes into buildings’ - the attacks won’t be imaginary, they will be real. T he government will precipitate them by saying there’s no doubt they will happen and then seize on them after they happen by reassuring you t hat they will protect you by taking your rights away. Stasiville The constant (government ) threat of terror ha s turned people into willing informants. The new definition of patriotis m is helping the state in any way you can to stop the terrorists, even if it fundamentally violates the rights of the individual. Even a high-tech dictatorship cannot keep track of all its slaves short of putting them in camps and so the ci tizens need to be encouraged to spy on each other. That sounds like the old So viet Union I hear you say! And yet, The Bush Administration aims to recruit millions of United States citizens as domestic informants in a program likely to alarm civil liberties groups. The Terrorism Information and Prevention System, or TIPS, means the US will have a highe r percentage of citizen informants than the former East Germany through the infamous St asi secret police. The program would use a minimum of 4 per cent of Americans to report \"suspicious activity\". 40 The TIPS program was quietly announced as part of the Citizen Corps initiative under the jurisdiction of FEMA. Its intent ion was to hire people in the kind of professions that involve a high degree of contact with the public – postal workers, truck drivers, utility employees etc. These snoops would compile reports on individuals they considered to be engaging in suspicious or subversive activity and in some instances even perform a search on that person’s home. This information would then be fed into a c entralized Justice Department database. Just read that back again to yourself and think how far America has been flushed down the toilet in the name of securi ty. Here we have the government openly testing a program where Americans are in forming on each other to ‘protect the homeland’. The stuff of tacky but nightmarish fu turistic movies like The Running Man is actually being implemented in front of our noses. John Mason, a professor of political science at William Paterson University in New Jersey put his finger on the issue in stating, \"It is not going to do anything useful, and it is about maintaining a climate of fear, a sort of mobilisation for war. It has a lot to do with politics and it gives the general public a way of participating in a war without a visible enemy.” 41   40 ‘US planning to recruit one in 24 Americans as citizen spies’ – Ritt Goldstein - Sydney Morning Herald – July 15 2002 - http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/07/14/1026185141232.html 41 'I'm happy to spy for America' - Charles Laurence – London Telegraph – July 21 2002 - http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/07/21/wsnoop21.xml&sSheet=/news/2002/07/21/ixworld.ht ml"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Before the program was ‘abandoned’, traini ng centers in 10 American cities were set up and stickers were issued with the national TIPS hotline phone number to be displayed on delivery vehicles. Bear in mind, this is all from a ‘Republican’ administration that is supposed to uphol d a conservative ideology of limited government and respect of personal priv acy. Republican or Democrat, the agenda and the policies are the same becaus e we have an illegitimate faction in control at the very top. TIPS drew distain from both the left and right afte r it was announced. John Whitehead of the Rutherford Institute was quoted in the Washington Times , “This is George Orwell's '1984.' It's an absolutely horrible and very dangerous idea. It's making Americans into government snoops. President Bu sh wants the average American to do what the FBI should be doing. In the end, though, nothing is going to prevent terrorists from crashing planes into buildings.” 42 A major reason behind the eventual death of TIPS was the fact that the postal service declined to take part after being approached by Homeland Security. House Majority Leader Dick Armey then in serted a clause within the bill that established Homeland Security stating that the program would not be included as part of the package. However, the Just ice Department only agreed to throw out the added inclusion of a centralized databas e. The program is on the backburner, waiting to be fully implemented after the next terror attack. In Australia an indistinguishable pr ogram has already been introduced. The Australian government launched a national ca mpaign entitled 'Let's Look Out For Australia'. Although the Australian public and Congress were firmly against supporting a war in Iraq, with Congre ss having given Prime Minister John Howard a vote of no confidence, they are united behind their leader in the name of fighting terrorism. The program is almost identical to the American TIPS program. It is important to stress t hat the state advisin g the citizens of a country to spy on each other is exactly what happened under the East German Stasi system. Erich Honecker, long the leader of East Germany, was not Hitle r. But his police state of 17 million people boasted 95,000 full-time Stasi agents, more than double the number of Gestapo agents in Nazi Germany. The Australian government sent out a bookle t on the program to every citizen in the country.

Australians who still maintained the ability to recognize despotism were unimpressed, Some critics have suggested that Howard is using the current fear of terrorism to mask a more personal and destructive political agenda. David Day, lecturer in history at Melbourne’s La Trobe University, said the new campaign was in the tradition of Australian wartime propaganda which vilified the Japanese, although now the enemy is unspecified. 43 But why bother presenting tyranny in the form of a government scheme when the tattletale society erected since Sept ember 11 has been successfully introduced by stealth anyway? Across America citizens are being encouraged to sign up for programs like Citizen Corps, Secure Corps and AmeriCorps. The Community Anti-Terrorism Training Initiative in Philadelphia had the government training people to spy on their neighbors, Across the region, regular folks -- from professionals to grandmot hers -- are being trained by the government to be lookouts in the fight against homeland terrorism. Those behind these training programs say they are taking pains to keep t hem from degenerating into neighborhood spy teams unduly influenced by presumptions and jingoism. \"Our motto is: Watch America with pride, not prejudice,\" said Michael Licata, who helped develop a widely used community antiterrorism curriculum Town watch groups, known as the \"eyes and ears \" of the police, have attracted new members since Sept. 11, according to the National Crime Prevention Council. Watch duties have expanded, too, with neighbors out to spot not only vandals and burglars but terrorist cells as well. 44 In this particular program, suspicious behavior included drawing doodles on restaurant napkins. Crime is being mer ged with terrorism and there are programs being introduced in both Britain and Americ a where people are paid to inform and spy on potential drunk-driv ers and speeders. In Nazi Germany, Hitler had his Hitler Youth. In Orwell’s 1984 there was the Youth league where children were trained to spy on their parents.

Maybe there really were dangerous mass killers ar ound every corner and the government really just wanted to protect us. Not quite . These arrests were subject to a blaze of publicity and headlined the ev ening news.

A plot to release cyanide in the London Underground was ‘foiled by MI5’ and splashed across t he front pages. The fact that no cyanide was ever found and most of the suspects were released within days was barely mentioned. Nine arrests were made under anti-terrorism laws and yet six of those detained we re released within hours. In late January 2003, 28 Pakistani men were arrested in a raid in the Italian city of Naples. The headlines shrieked that the men were plotting assassinations and bombings of NATO targets. They had m aps of London, the U. S. consulate and American naval bases. They were a definite ‘Al-Qaeda terrorist cell’ in possession of 800 grams of explosives, enou gh to blow up a three-story building. Despite all this unfolding in Italy, it made the top story on both American and British news for two days. Just two weeks later, the BBC quietly announced, An Italian judge has ordered the release of 28 Pakistani immigrants arrested on suspicion of planning terrorist attacks. The reasons for the order are unclear, but reports suggest little evidence was found against the men. 52 And so the story vanished. In London, a plethora of arrests were made after police supposedly discovered ingredients used to make the deadly ricin poison.

This argument is based on the assumption that there are actual terrorists worth worrying about and secondly that the measures being taken in our airports are aimed at stopping their activi ty. Both claims cannot be substantiated. Following in the footsteps of several U. S. counterparts, Sydney Airport recently announced its beta testing of face recogni tion biometric cameras, aimed at identifying ‘terrorists and other undesir able travelers’ according to the Sydney Morning Herald . 55 As with all biometric technologie s, the digital algorithms that make up your facial features are captured and compared with a computer database of criminals. If you resemble an enemy of the state then red flags are immediately coordinated to the operator and your dangerous terrorist activity is brought to a swift halt. Proponents of this system fail to take into account that terrorist masterminds are hardly likely to use notorious criminals to carry out operations where their movements will be filmed a hundred times over . If there were nineteen hijackers on September 11 roaming ar ound American airports, su rely there would be multiple video sequences of their activi ty? The FBI says so but all they have provided us with is a dodgy tape of Atta with two different time stamps on it. The rest is classified ‘due to the ongoing investigation’.

As we've reported numerous times in the past, it simply does not work as advertised, and it can't. 56 You see, not unlike a toaster that only has two settings – burnt and warm bread – facial recognition technology is either far too sensitive or positively laid back. Either Ahmed and his terrorist chums wa lk on by unhindered or a mother with a pram is likely to be subjected to an armed standoff. On the non-sensitive setting anyone who is aware of the technology c an avoid it by wearing a pair of sunglasses. So what other methods will Big Brother pr esent in order to ‘save us from the terrorists’? In the first stage of what will event ually morph into the behemoth ‘Total Information Awareness’ – the U.S. Justice Department has proposed anti- terrorism regulations that would entail ev eryone who wanted to fly in and out of the country would be forced to discl ose detailed personal information, Under the new proposal, Americans on commercial air and sea travel would be required to fill out forms detailing their comings and goings. Under t he new regulations, the information would be sent electronically to the government to be matched against security databases. 57 Even though the Immigration and Natura lization Service would implement the regulations, the law would apply to Americ an citizens. This at a time when both the northern and southern borders are more wide open than ever. The ACLU, more interested in making sure gay peopl e are allowed to cavort in street parades, have declared no opposition to the proposal. Some people, perhaps even most, would have no aversion to providing their name, date of birth, citizenship, sex, passport number, country of residence, U.S. visa number, and address while in the Un ited States. I would certainly support such measures for foreigners if I were under the delusion that our governments had any incentive to prevent terrorism. But w hat most don’t realize is that this is only the initial stage of a nice little horro r that the government has been planning for a year or more.

This, according to Joseph Del Balzo, formerly with the FAA, will enable the government to have, “a pretty good idea of what’s going on in a person’s mind.” Such minute details would characterize an individual’s ‘threat assessment’ – so if you willingly submit to letting the government know how many times you go to the toilet a day then you’ll get a green security grade, cheap ai rline tickets, fast airport security checks, convenience and consumer love. On the other hand, if you have any semblance of morality or memories of what it was like to live in a free country and refuse the ‘trusted traveler pass’ – you’ll get a red security grade and will be rightly hassled for the subversive that you are.

Look for the definition of terrorism in your dictionary and you’ll get some thing similar to, \"The unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence by a person or an organized group against people or property with the in tention of intimidating or coercing societies or governments, often for ideologic al or political reasons.” By this very definition, the only group gaining a political advantage from te rrorism or the thre at of terrorism is the White House!

The King Has No Clothes: But Saying So Might Land You In Prison The hallmark of an effective dictatorship, whether that be Stalinist Russia or Hitler’s Germany, is the wholesale silenci ng of the opposing vo ice. Criticism of the government must be e liminated because the foundati on of despots crumbles when their authority is questioned in a sober and educated manner . For those of us who don’t live in countries like Ch ina or Zimbabwe, a benchmark of how healthy our freedoms are is to judge how our government reacts to criticism. We should therefore be alarmed that a growing pretext is being set whereby it is either illegal or an act of political suicide to criticize President Bush. Prior to September 11, jokes about Geor ge W. Bush’s questiona ble intelligence were the highlight of any given evening at the comedy club. Bush’s own words provided enough material to build on. Consider the following, \"I've coined new words, like, misunderst anding and Hispanically.\"—Radio-Television Correspondents Association dinner, Washington, D.C., March 29, 2001 \"You teach a child to read, and he or her will be able to pass a literacy test.''—Townsend, Tenn., Feb. 21, 2001   60 ‘Coffee, Tea, or Should We Feel Your Pregnant Wife’s Br easts Before Throwing You in a Cell at the Airport and Then Lying About Why We Put You There?’ - Nicholas Monahan – December 21 2002 - http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig3/monahan1.html "},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":" \"Rarely is the question asked: is our chil dren learning.” - Florence, SC, Jan. 11, 2000 \"I think anybody who doesn't think I'm smart enough to handle the job is underestimating.\"—U.S. News & World Report, April 3, 2000 Since the terrorist attacks, any questioning of Bush’s mental capacity is viewed as subversive activity. If you’re a politici an, you must resign i mmediately. If you’re a member of the public, you may be subject to an FBI investigation. In September 2002, German Justice Mini ster Herta Daeubler-Gmelin suggested that Bush’s foreign policy was planned to distract from his domestic problems - a tactic used by Hitler. The media hija cked the comments and concocted headlines like ‘German Minister says Bush is new Hitler’. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, eager to childishly avenge Ge rman non-cooperation in the war with Iraq, responded by labeling the comments as \"outrageous and inexplicable.\" Despite a public apology, Daeubler-Gme lin was subsequently forced to resign from office. As an aside, in a decidedly unsophi sticated propaganda crus ade, the Bush administration compared Saddam Hussein to Hitler. Hitler’s projected 1,000-year Reich was to be built by invading countries and setting up a pan-European empire. Ask yourself, how many count ries has Bush threatened to invade compared to Saddam Hussein? Just a month after Daeubler-Gmelin resign ed, Francoise Ducros, a top aide to Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, referred to President Bush as “a moron” at the NATO summit in Prague. The co mment was made to a radio reporter and instantly became front-page news. In st ark contrast with their reaction to Daeubler-Gmelin, the White House trotted out Flesicher to dismiss the comment as “something from someone who doesn't speak for the Canadian government.'' They wanted to keep Canada sweet because at that stage their unbridled support for a war on Iraq was on the verge of being secured. Ducros apologized but was forced to resign shortly after. Just a day after Ducros quit, the Britis h satirical cartoon show, 2DTV, were informed by the Broadcast Advertising Clear ance Centre (BACC) that an ad for their Christmas video had been banned. The commercial featured a cackling Bush mistakenly putting the videotape in a toaster instead of a video player. The BACC ruled that the ad was offensive to Bush’s intelligence. This, despite the fact that the program itse lf ‘offends’ Bush’s intelligence on a weekly basis. 2DTV produced a milder second version of the ad but this too was banned because it portrayed the President in a negative li ght.

However, at least they have a media platform on which to defend themselves. This saga takes on a mo re sinister tone when individuals are persecuted for daring to stand up to Bush. A protest group called ‘Turn Your Back on Bush’ experienced the full force of the new post-9/11 dictatorship after they di scovered the President was to fulfill a speaking engagement at Ohio State University on June 14 2002. Lost in the muddy nostalgia of a pre-9/11 America, where groups had at least some rights to assemble, the protestors thought they could rekindle the days where a Bush appearance went hand in glove with a chorus of boos from a sizeable minority. Not so, Richard Hollingsworth, Associate Vice President of Student Affairs, warned the group that he was aware of their plans and that any protest would entail ejections and arrests being made. He also threatened undergraduates that their diploma would be stripped if they were to so much as make a sound. This had a massive chilling effect and only a handful of students and others actually did turn their back on Bush at the ceremony. One was ejected by police and his arrest was probably only avoided because he was carrying a three-year- old child. This enabled the Washington Post to state, \"If there was a protest in the stadium, it was not visi ble to reporters.\" The Post could then concentrate on the sycophantic response of the audience to Bush’s every sentence with glee. Richard Humphreys, a resident of Port land Oregon, was sentenced to three years in jail after he made a joke about President Bush during Bush’s March 2001 trip to Sioux Falls. The joke included the line \"I said God might speak to the world through a burning Bush,\" which was taken as meaning Humphreys wanted to douse Bush in flammable liquid and set him ablaze. A bartender overheard and immediately alerted the po lice to the activities of this dangerous terrorist. The actual arrest was obviously made befor e September 11 but the way that event changed the mindset of the American authorities no doubt contributed to the ridiculous three year prison term, whic h was handed out in June 2002. This story was originally reported by CNN , who mysteriously chose to remove the article from their website just a few weeks after its appearance. 61 If you think that was an overreaction, ju st consider the case of a student at Bellbrook High School in Ohio. The unnam ed teenager chose to wear a T-shirt with the words “not my pr esident” superimposed over a picture of President Bush. When a crosshair was added to t he design, two students came forward and complained to the school administrato rs. The Assistant Principal then made the decision to call the FBI because the high school kid could have been a terrorist planning to assassinate Bush. What ’s even more absurd is that the FBI actually treated the case with the utmost significance and the investigation was eventually turned over to the Secret Service!   61 ‘Burning Bush comment draws prison term – CNN – June 12 2002 – available at http://www.prisonplanet.com/n ews_alert_120602_illegalbush.html "},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"These are the real threats to America – not wide-open borders or Muslim fanatics – but high school children with political T-sh irts.

The Assistant Principal said they had complied with the demand of the government - that citizens stand together with Homeland Security and keep an eye out for potential terrorist activi ty, for this, he was proud of them. The liberties of Americans, as enshrined in the Constitution and Bill of Rights, were erected on the foundation of logic that the citizenry has to watch its government like a hawk. Any government that is allowed to roam freely without checks and balances becomes tyrannical. Hi story has proven this over and over again. In the new America, the government watches the citizens and in turn the citizens are told to watch each other.

Both India and Pakistan are nuclear armed. By late 2002 it was generally considered that disquiet between the two countries had dramatically calmed, a naïve misc onception when in hindsight, the same consensus prevailed at the end of 2001. It was at that point that terrorists stormed the Indian parliament in Delhi, killing twelve people and catapulting India and Pakistan to the brink of nuclear war. One single act of large-scale terrorism will re-fuel the possibility of imminent c onflict. As I will document, the likelihood of that happening is immense. Is there a hidden hand that s eeks to bring nuclear war to the region and if so for what purpose? How does this relate to the New World Order and can the conflict be classified as another example of the H egelian dialectic, the order out of chaos scenario? Who benefits and w here is the evidence? Before we answer these questions let’s take a brief look at the history of the region. A Legacy of Instability The mountainous region of Kashmir has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for more than 50 years. The terri tory has witnessed a number of violent incidents recently against the backgr ound of continuing tension between India and Pakistan. Forces from both countri es deployed along the frontline are regularly shelling each other, causing deaths and injuries to civilians in the area. There are fears that even a minor in cident along the border could trigger a conflagration between the two nucl ear-capable powers, and both President Musharraf and Prime Minister Vajpay ee are under considerable domestic pressure not to back down. The territory of Kashmir was hotly cont ested even before India and Pakistan won their independence from Britain in A ugust 1947. Under the partition plan provided by the Indian Independence Act of 1947, Kashmir was free to accede to India or Pakistan. The M aharaja, Hari Singh, want ed to stay independent but eventually decided to accede to India, signing over key pow ers to the Indian Government - in return for military aid and a promised referendum. Since then, the territory has been the flashpoint for tw o of the three India-Pakistan wars: the"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"first in 1947-8, the second in 1965. In 1999, India fought a brief but bitter c onflict with Pakistani-backed forces who had infiltrated Indian-controlled territory in the Kargil area. In addition to the rival claims of Delhi and Islamabad to the territory, there has been a growing and often violent separatist movement fighting ag ainst Indian rule in Kashmir since 1989. Islamabad says Kashmir should have become part of Pakistan in 1947, because Muslims are in t he majority in the region. Pakistan also argues that Kashmiris should be allo wed to vote in a referendum on their future, following numerous UN resolutions on the issue. Delhi, however, does not want international debate on the issue, arguing that the Siml a Agreement of 1972 provided for a resolution through bilateral ta lks. India points to the Instrument of Accession signed in October 1947 by the M aharaja, Hari Singh. Both India and Pakistan reject the so-called \"third option\" of Kashmiri independence. A demarcation line was origi nally established in January 1949 as a ceasefire line, following the end of the first Kashmir war. In July 1972, after a second conflict, the Line of Control (LoC) was re-established under the terms of the Simla Agreement, with minor variations on the earlier boundary. The LoC passes through a mountainous regi on about 5,000 meters high. The conditions are so extreme that the bitter cold claims more lives than the sporadic military skirmishes. North of the LoC, the ri val forces have been entrenched on the Siachen glacier (more than 6,000 me ters high) since 1984 - the highest battlefield on earth. The LoC divides Kashmir on an almost two-to-one basis: Indian-administered Kashmir to the east and south (population ab out nine million), which falls into the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir; and Pa kistani-administered Kashmir to the north and west (population about three million) , which is labeled by Pakistan as \"Azad\" (Free) Kashmir. China also c ontrols a small portion of Kashmir. Religion is an important aspect of the dispute. Partition in 1947 gave India's Muslims a state of their own: Pakistan. So a common faith underpins Pakistan's claims to Kashmir, where many areas are Muslim-dominated. The population of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir is over 60% Muslim, making it the only state within India where Mus lims are in the majority. There are several groups pursu ing the rival claims to Ka shmir. Not all are armed, but since Muslim insurgency began in 1989, the number of armed separatists has grown from hundreds to thousands. The most prominent are the pro- Pakistani Hizbul Mujahideen. Islamabad denies providing t hem and others with logistical and material support. The Ja mmu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) was the largest pro-independence group, but its influence is thought to have waned. Other groups have joined under the umbrella of the All-Party Hurriyat (Freedom) Conference, which campaigns peacefully for an end to India's"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"presence in Kashmir. Indian forces announced a unilateral c easefire against militant groups in November 2000, but violence continued. A ttempts to get talks going between the government and the separatist parties have foundered over separatist demands that Pakistan should be in cluded in any dialogue. India says there can be no discussion involving Pakistan because it sponsors violence in Kashmir. India and Pakistan failed to narrow their diffe rences over Kashmir at a summit in the Indian city of Agra in July 2001. Since then, they have continued to trade accusations and outside attempts to get t hem to resolve their differences have made no headway. Running parallel to this regional histor y is the disturbing evidence of how and why Globalist New World Order interests have instituted a specific program of fomenting this conflict and how this links in to the war on terrorism. Enter the Hidden Hand It's common knowledge in intelligence circle s that the Inter Services Intelligence Agency (Pakistan's secret service) runs the entire country in the shadow of dictator General Pervez Mus harraf. In turn, the CIA co-o rdinate the activities of the ISI. This alliance gave birth to Osama bin Laden, Al-Qaeda and the current war on terrorism. Osama bin Laden left Saudi Arabia in 1979 to fight the invading Soviets in Afghanistan. By 1984 he was r unning the front organization known as MAK, (Maktab al-Khidamar) which eventually mutated into Al-Qaeda, consisting of the more extreme me mbers of the former group. During the war MAK was nurtured by Pakistan's Inter-services Intelligence Agency, ISI. The ISI was the CIA's covert ally and conduit against Moscow's occupation. Via the ISI the kindergarten Al -Qaeda were trained, a rmed, funded and empowered by the CIA. The new covert U.S. assistance began with a dramatic increase in arms supplies -- a steady rise to 65,000 tons annually by 1987, as well as a \"ceaseless stream\" of CIA and Pentagon specialists who trav eled to the secr et headquarters of Pakistan's ISI on the main road near Rawalpindi, Pakistan. There the CIA specialists met with Pakistani intelligence officers to help plan operations for the Afghan rebels, bin Laden included. The Central Intelligence Agency, using Pakistan's ISI, played a key role in training the Mujahideen. The BBC reported that the ISI aided bin Laden's escape from Afghanistan at the end of 2001, Afghan interior minister Younis Qanooni has accuse d the Pakistani secret service of helping al- Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden flee Afghanistan.

As we touched upon earlier, in October 2001, reports surfaced in numerous outlets from the Times of India to CNN , detailing how ISI director-general Lt-Gen Mahmud Ahmad was forced to retire after it emerged that he had hotwired $100,000 to the 9/11 lead hi jacker, Mohammed Atta, While the Pakistani Inter Services Public Relation s claimed that former ISI director-general Lt- Gen Mahmud Ahmad sought retirement after being superseded on Monday, the truth is more shocking. Top sources confirmed here on Tuesday, that the general lost his job because of the \"evidence\" India produced to show his links to one of the suicide bombers that wrecked the World Trade Center. The US authorities sought his remo val after confirming the fact that $100,000 was wired to WTC hijacker Mohammed Atta from Pakistan by Ahmad Umar Sheikh at the instance of Gen Mahumd. Senior government sources have conf irmed that India contributed significantly to establishing the link between the money transfer and the role played by the dismissed ISI chief. While they did not provide details, they said that Indian inputs, including Sheikh’s mobile phone number, helped the FBI in tracing and establishing the link. 2 Pakistan’s direct links to Al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations are obviously extremely disturbing in light of the fact that everything the ISI does has to be approved by the CIA. Furthermore, by direct order of Presi dent Bush, an estimated 8,000 members of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban were rescued via ca rgo planes as Kunduz fell to the Northern Alliance in November 2001. Bush had ordered the United States Central Command to set up a special air corri dor to help insure the safety of the Pakistani rescue flights from Kunduz to t he northwest corner of Pakistan, about two hundred miles away. 3 This left both the Delta Force and Northern Alliance indignant. Northern Alliance soldier Mahm ud Shah was bewildered at the events stating, “We had decided to kill all of them, and we are not happy with America for letting the planes come.” 4 A senior U.S. defense advisor told the London Times , “Everyone brought their friends with them. You’re not going to leav e them behind to get their throats cut.” 5 There were two official explanations for the airlift.

The cost was the threat of internal insurgency and the overthrow of his regime. Musharraf bargained with Bush . If these Pakistani Army officers, intelligence advisers and volunteers could just be spared, his political survival would be almost ensured. Musharraf's message to the Americans had been that he didn't want to see body bags coming bac k to Pakistan. Bush agreed to protect the Pakistani leader, providing th e rescued Taliban elements would be accessible to American intelligence. Th is was not the case because after the airlift the Al-Qaeda and Taliban leaders went AWOL. [INSERT FIG 8.1 [CAPTION: Later estimates put the number at 8,000 Taliban and Al-Qaeda rescued as Kunduz fell and safely airlifted into Kashmir to enflame hostilities between India and Pakistan.] To emphasize, these 8,000 rescued indivi duals were high-level Taliban and al- Qaeda operatives fighting against the Unit ed States. These secret airlifts gave these terrorists refuge primarily in Kashmir, the disputed border. The first incident that could have led to a nuclear war between India and Pakistan occurred when, on December 13th 2001, a su icide squad of five heavily armed Muslim terrorists drove past a barrier at the Indian Parliament, in New Delhi, and rushed the main building. At one point, t he terrorists were only a few feet from the steps to the office of India's Vice -President, Krishan Kant. Nine people were killed in the shoot-out, in addition to the terrorists, and many others were injured. Indian intelligence quickly concluded that the attack had been organized by operatives from two long-standing Kashmiri terrorist organiza tions that were believed to be heavily supported by the IS I. Was this operation, which would have lead to full-scale war between the two powers had there been more casualties, a consequence of the planning of elite Pakistani and Taliban officials who were rescued on order of the U.S. 21 days earlier? Here we see the grand chessboard in ac tion, previously discussed by such luminaries of the global elit e as Zbygniew Brzezinsky. Let’s use the analogy of one person playi ng a sole game of chess, moving the pieces on both sides of the board, bla ck and white. Al-Qaeda and similar terrorist organizations are the pawns on the global chessboard.

This is the next stage in the New World Order out of chaos game plan - the blue touch-paper for world war three. On June 3rd, the Hindustan Times confirmed that dozens of surviving Al-Qaeda operatives had infiltrated into Pakistan a fter yet another incident where they were allowed to leave unharmed when they could have been apprehended. The event took place in Peshawar, where top Ta liban and Al-Qaeda leadership, including some of Osama bin Laden’s chief protectors such as the Taliban’s deputy foreign minister Abdul Rahman Zaid and top defens e ministry official Jalil Yousafzai, attended the funeral of a former anti-Sov iet guerrilla fighter. The ISI monitored them but still amazingl y allowed them to leave without arrest. 6 Again, the CIA controlled Pakistani authorities are protecting known terrorists, offering them safe passage to Kashmir w here a single suicide bomb or political assassination could inflame the entire r egion and throw it into the abyss of a nuclear war that would hav e worldwide implications. Red Dragon Rising China is an ally of Pakistan. Since the two countries do not share a common history, language, culture or religion and have followed diametrically opposite models of economic and political developm ent, it is clear that China is using Pakistan as a long-term geopolitical tool . Many prolific authors and geopolitical analysts such as Gordon Thomas have highlighted and documented the two- faced behavior of Jiang Zemin’s comm unist superpower. A long-term agenda to bring America to its knees by means of a su rprise attack is the ultimate goal. We should be reminded, in this context, of an August 1998 document from the Chinese Central Military Commission that was sent to all corps commanders of the Peoples Liberation Army. The leaked do cument details how the United States is increasingly vulnerable and could not withstand even a limited nuclear strike from China. Despite its military prom inence, America remains unwilling to sacrifice cities in a tit-for-tat war, w hereas the Chinese are fully prepared to do so. Therefore, Beijing could hold off Washington if hostilities erupted over Taiwan. While publicly offering meek support of the war on terrorism, voluminous evidence suggests that China have actually been supporting the Taliban and Osama bin Laden all along. Furthermore , the Bush administration have deliberately ignored the China threat and c ontinue to transfer sensitive computer technology to the Communists, the only pr actical purpose of which is to design   6 ‘Pakistan winks at Taliban reunion’ – Hindustan Times – June 3 2002"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"nuclear weapons. 7 On the morning of September 11th 2001, terrorists linked to the Al-Qaeda network that was being protected by the Taliban in Afghanistan slammed three planes into the World trade Center and the Pentagon. At the same time a Chinese delegation was in Kabul putting pen to paper on a lucrative economic support package with the Taliban. 8 This was by no means the beginning of friendly China-Taliban relations. As far back as 1998 the Iranian official press said there was a secret defense agreem ent between China and the Taliban. In 2000, two Chinese telecommunications firms, Huawei Technologies and ZTE, signed contracts to provide limited phone service for Kabul and Kandahar, with a specific focus on equipping Osama bin Lad en, who was based there at the time. In early 2001, a Taliban delegation visit ed Beijing to continue to foster good relations. China's ambassador to Pakistan has also made at least one recent trip to Kabul and met with Taliban official s in Pakistan's capital Islamabad. China continued to support bin Laden and t he Taliban as the war broke out in Afghanistan in October of 2001. Debka File intelligence report ed that, on October 5th, two days before American air stri kes began, a convoy of 15,000 Chinese Muslims were sent to reinforce the Taliban. 9 In a later report, Debka also disclosed that large quantities of Ch inese-manufactured ammunition were discovered in the Tora Bora cave hideo uts of Osama bin Laden. The arms cache included mortar shells, anti-tank rockets and ammunition for various types of automatic rifles and machine guns of Chinese manufacture, abandoned by fleeing Al-Qaeda men. 10 In early December 2001 U.S. Undersecr etary of State J ohn Bolton met with Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Wang Guangya, urging him to renew a demand that the Chinese curb missile cooperat ion with Pakistan that was encouraging the likelihood of terrorism and nuc lear conflict with India in the region of Kashmir. The sanctions were imposed on the Chi na Metallurgical Equipment Corp. for allegedly transferring ballistic missile tec hnology to Pakistan in violation of a November 2000 agreement with the Unit ed States. This technology was in danger of falling into the hands of extrem ists who could use nuclear, biological and chemical weapons to attack India.

China has also beefed up its presence in Myanmar’s Coco Islands on the Bay of Bengal and plans to move in two aircraft carriers that are under construction now to the area. “India cannot concent rate exclusively on the western theatre with Pakistan if China undertakes these measures along Arunachal and Sikkim.

Profits of Death A minimum of three million people w ould be killed and 1.5 million seriously injured if even a \"limited\" nuclear war broke out between India and Pakistan. The estimates are comprised of the immediat e casualty list from blast, fire and radiation if only a tenth of both countries' nuclear weapons were exploded above 10 of their largest cities.

Both world wars were caused by lesser events. Who is responsible for this holocaust scenario? Who is arming bot h Pakistan and India, heightening the possibility of war, and fo r what reason? Once again, familiar names emerge. Firstly, the Times of India reported in August of 2001 that the San Rafael California-based Berkeley Nucleonics Cor poration supplied at least five nuclear pulse generators to Indi a from 1998 onwards. Three of the devices were exported to the Bhabha Atomic Research Center and two to the Nuclear Power Corporation. Pulse gener ators are devices that can be used to calibrate instruments that measure atomic reactions. Berkeley Nucleonics, which was founded in 1963, is a highly regar ded manufacturer of electronics instrumentation, especially for nuclear re search industries. Representatives of the company were actually indicted for th is illegal transfer. However, the most interesting aspect of this transfer was t hat the president of the company claimed he was “cajoled” by unnamed government agents into making the shipment.

From this perspec tive we can see that the pieces on the global chessboard were being assembled we ll in advance of the re-emergence of India-Pakistan tensions in December 2001. In January of 2002, the Moscow Times reported that British Prime Minister Tony Blair made a visit to India and Pakistan in an attempt to calm ethnic tensions between the two. In reality he was pushing t he sale of a lucrative deal with arms merchant BAE Systems for 60 new jet fi ghters. The Russian newspaper stated, Blair's minions are putting the squeeze on India to accept a $1.4 billion deal with arms merchant BAE Systems for 60 new jet fighters. This will no doubt have a very \"calmi ng influence\" on the balance of power as the subcontinent teeters on the brink of nuclear war -- the same kind of calming influence gasoline has on fire. Of course , if Blair can get those billion warbucks into BAE's coffers, Master Georgie will be very pleased . For one of BAE's business partners is -- God, this is almost too easy! -- our old friends the Carlyle Group. Faithful readers know that Daddy Bush -- the former peddler of poison gas to Iraq -- has long been feeding at the Carlyle trough, working his contacts with Saudi royalty, the bi n Laden family, Asian dictators, South American junta honchos and other respectable characters to cement sweetheart deals for the Reagan-Bush retreads who skim the cream off Carlyle's $13 billion nest egg. 12 The BBC reported these BAE-India negotiations back in August 2001, stating, BAE Systems has insisted it is confident of se curing a £1bn Hawk jets deal with India despite reports the sale faces collapse. The company is in discussions with the Indian Government over the purchase of 66 advanced trainer jets. Reports in the media suggested that the air force is now poised to pull out of the plan and buy Russian Mi G jets instead. But management and unions at BAE Systems say they are confid ent an agreement will be struck. 13 The Carlyle Group is one of the biggest Ae rospace & Defense contractors in the world today. They manage approximately $14 billion in assets, without actually manufacturing anything. This is by no means their only sector of interest but it’s certainly their primary focu s of attention. The group is staffed by some of the most powerful individuals on the planet, including former U.S. President George Herbert Walker Bush and former British Prime Minister John Major. Obviously, since September 11th the explosion of t he arms market has seen their profits smash through the roof. However, Carl yle state, \"We're not too keen on discussing anything related to the politic al nature of the people at Carlyle.\" There’s a very good reason for this. Unt il October 2001, the bin Laden family had a stake in Carlyle. President Bush’s father met with the bin Laden family two months before the September 11 attacks. T he Wall Street Journal went so far as call outright for George Herbert Walker Bush to resign from the group. 14 The bin Laden family, publicly at least, withdrew from Carlyle. No doubt they received a healthy severance pay.   12 ‘Global Eye: Pretzel Logic’ – Chris Floyd – Moscow Times – January 18 2002 13 ‘BAE 'confident' of securing £1bn deal’ – BBC – August 9 2001 - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1481777.stm 14 ‘Bin Laden Family Could Profit From a Jump In Defense Spending Due to Ties to U.S. Bank’ – Wall Street Journal – 27 September 2001 - http://www.globalre search.ca/articles/WAL110A.html "},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":" [INSERT FIG 8.2 [CAPTION: Former President Geor ge Bush met with King Fahd, right, on a trip to Saudi Arabia on Carlyle Group business in May 2001.] Recall that UK based BAE Systems is armi ng India to the t une of $1.4 billion dollars. BAE and Carlyle have some very close connections. Several of the members of the House and Senate Inte lligence committees investigating September 11th such as Randy ‘Duke’ Cunningham have received thousands of dollars in campaign finance from Carlyle and BAE in conjunction. In April of 2001, Carlyle invested capital equity in BAE, adding to their $13 billion worth of assets. BAE announced this on thei r web site but strangely removed the press release three months later. 15 Just a week after I authored an article on Carlyle and BAE that featured on my web site, a plethora of reports emerged from British newspa pers outlining the same details. The most comprehensive report appeared in the Sunday Herald of Scotland. They mentioned t he $1.4 billion BAE-India dea l. They also stated, In 2000 Britain granted some 700 defence export licences to companies selling weapons to India worth around £64.5 million. These included compon ents for air-to-surfa ce missiles, aircraft machine guns, armoured personnel carriers, combat aircraft, to rpedoes and combat helicopters. The UK also sold India military aircraft engine s, military communications equipment, tear gas and other riot control equipment and air-to-surface miss iles. In the same year the UK sold £6m worth of weapons to Pakistan. This included component s for combat helicopters, frigates and naval vessels as well as military communications equi pment, military training aircraft and military utility vehicles. In 1999, the UK sold £57.5m worth of we apons to India and £11.5m to Pakistan. Britain, as the list shows, is happy to sell the same wea pons to two countries on the brink of all-out war. The government is flying right in the face of the EU code of conduct on weapons sales. 16 The Herald identified British MP’s such as Jack Straw and John Prescott as being complicit in undertaking clandestine tr ips to the two countries to push these sales under the guise of talks on sust ainable development. The paper labeled Tony Blair a warmonger and directly stat ed that this behavior could lead to the death of millions of innocent civilians. It was also report ed that 64 military commanders from Pakistan and India were trained in Britain last year. This surge of mainstream coverage high lighted the fact that deeper influences were behind the push towards nuclear war. It was at this point, in early June of 2002, that Donald Rumsfeld told his Bil derberg colleagues it was unlikely a war would now take place between Pakist an and India and hostilities between the two almost immediately subsided.

They need to manufacture enemies to i ndefinitely hoodwink t he real enemy, the people they govern. A young and weak empire needs the genui ne support of its people because the threat from real outsiders is immediate. A vast, sp rawling, decadent empire has swallowed up all its outsi de enemies and the only threat that remains is you and I. This isn’t a modern day conspiracy theory. It’s a clever and ruthless tactic used by those in power throughout history. Consider this quote from Hermann Goeri ng, president of t he Reichstag, Nazi Party, and Luftwaffe Commander in Chief, \"Naturally the common people don't want war: Neit her in Russia, nor in England, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, afte r all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple ma tter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parlia ment, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bi dding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.\" 1 The Hegelian Dialectic has never fail ed because to understand it requires the total breakdown and reconstruction of everyt hing you've ever known. This is a relatively simple process, although it doesn't sound it. It sounds terrifying. Especially when a person has invested t heir entire life and ev olution of thought into the 'stock' of reality. When you in form them that realit y isn't what they thought it was, you blowout their stock. It can render an i gnorant person's life meaningless. They have to disbelieve si mply to justify their own existence. The 'War on Terrorism' represents the ulti mate in thesis-antithesis-synthesis manipulation, but onl y on an earthly scale. Despite proclamations that this new war may last forever, it will eventually r un out of gas. They will re-invent the definition of terrorism over and over but still the paradigm has a finite life span. There is also a reasonable probability that a new superpower such as China will rise to challenge US/Globalist hegemony.

The technology to pull off this 'grand deception' has been in place since the 1950's in crude form, and today surpasses even the most spectacular scenes from Hollywood blockbusters. Henry Kissinger, a member of the Bilderberg Gr oup, CFR and Trilateral Commission, raised suspicions that the New World Order would play the fake 'alien card' in the future when he m ade the following stat ement at the 1991 Bilderberger conference hel d in Evians, France, \"Today, America would be outraged if U.N. tr oops entered Los Angeles to restore order.

The Federal Emergency Management Agen cy, FEMA, was conceived in the Nixon administration. The Carter administration furt her developed the program but it didn't really get teeth until R eagan stepped into office. From 1982-84 Colonel Oliver North assisted FEMA in drafting its civil defense preparations. Details of these plans emerged duri ng the 1987 Iran-Contra scandal. They included executive orders providing for suspension of the constitution, the imposition of martial law, internment camps, and the turning over of government to the president and FEMA in t he event of a national crisis. In April 1984, President Reagan signed Pr esidential Directive Number 54 that allowed FEMA to engage in a secret national \"readiness ex ercise\" under the code name of REX 84. The exercise was to test FEMA's readiness to assume military authority in the ev ent of a \"State of Do mestic National Emergency\" concurrent with the launching of a dire ct United States military operation in Central America. This much desired emergency never came, despite several provocations. Reagan was instrumental in creating the framework for a police state. However, one could never be realized without the added ingredient of a hostile universal threat. Reagan identified this potential threat on no less than four public occasions.

Greer describes the ultimate trump card - a hoaxed threat from space, Since 1992 I have seen this script unveiled to me by at least a dozen well-placed insiders. Of course, initially I laughed, thinking this just too absurd and far-fetched. Dr. Rosin gave her testimony to the Disclosure Project before 9/11. And yet others told me explicitly that things that looked like UFOs but that are built and under the c ontrol of deeply secretive 'black' projects, were being used to simulate - hoax - ET-appearing events, including some abductions and cattle mutilations, to sow the early seeds of cultural f ear regarding life in outer space.

The operation was to have an American Submarine surface inside Havana harbor at night and project a movie of a Jesus-like fi gure on the underside of the low-lying clouds that form ov er the harbor at night. A plane with muffled motors was to have circled just above the clouds while anothe r operative with a loudspeaker exhorted the Cubans below to overthrow \"Godless Communism.\" The plan was never put into action but wa s seriously considered and, as stated, remains in the Congressional Record to this day. 8 An almost exact replica of this pr oposal came to light in a June 2000 Sydney Morning Herald report. In 1991 during the Gulf War, top brass of the US Air Force drew up plans to project a giant holographic im age of Allah over Baghdad. The scale of the project required a mirror several kilometers acro ss to be positioned in space. However, a more practical method was suggested. When warm air lies on top of cold air, the difference in density is enough to bend ligh t. At higher altitudes, a mirage can make whole landscapes appear in the sky. An artificial mirage could in theory be made by heating the atmosphere with radi o waves or microwaves. The USAF then had the problem of making the image appear to speak. They postulated, A pulse stream, an internal acoustic fi eld of 5-15KHz can be created which is audible. Thus it may be possible to 'talk' to adversaries in a way which would be most disturbing to them. The plan was abandoned when it was realized t hat images of Allah are forbidden in Islam. The Iraqi's wouldn't know what they were looking at. Also, the practical difficulties in microwave transmission we re described as formidable. A consistent and believable method of voice projec tion was considered highly improbable.

If 'official sources' say t here is a threat and pr esent limited evidence, the people will still lap it up. If people are being killed t he masses will instinctively look to their leaders for pr otection and order. You'll ei ther be with the government or with the aliens.

ARM (Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Progr am) utilizes a sophisticated array of lasers and microwave devices, surrounded by so-called RASS units that will send sound waves booming skyward over huge outdoor loudspeakers for at least ten minutes every hour. A draft DOE Environmental Assessment, issued December 1996, conceded that the units could generate sound loud enough to be heard as far away as 2,000 meters (6 ,900 feet). Furthermore, ARM employs laser-radar units known as LIDAR. Steven Spielberg - the Bilderberg Group's Culture Change Agent Every year since 1954, the secretive B ilderberg Group (named after the hotel they first met in the Netherlands), co mprising elite powerbr okers from Europe and North America, has met to discuss and influence the changing global, political, economic and social landscape. Dotted amongst the usual suspects of Rockefeller, Kissinger and Soros etc. we see the presence of renowned Hollywood filmmaker Steven Spielberg. Spielberg attended the 1999 Bilderberg meeting held at Sintra, Portugal. 10 What business does Spielberg, a chieftain of the 'entertainment' indust ry have secretly mingling with international bankers, military intelligence and world political leaders?   9 ‘Good Lord!

Throughout hi s career we see an obsession with the alien/UFO/space theme. From the 1977 Close Encounters of the Third Kind to ET in 1982, to Deep Impact in 1998. All depict an in vasion from outer space. Even the movie Jaws is littered with shoot ing stars and strange lig hts in the sky. Spielberg was also executive pr oducer for the July 2002 release Men in Black 2 , a movie where a shadow government ‘prote cts’ the people of the world from an alien threat. In February 1997 a leading light in the Brit ish film industry l eaked the story that Spielberg and executives of his com pany DreamWorks had secretly met with senior Pentagon officials in Los Angeles. The officials told Spielberg to \"stop everything\" and produce a movie whose s ubject matter involved meteors and/or comets. 11 One year later Deep Impact was in the can. The film describes a comet hurtling towards earth and the fight for who has the privilege of access to an underground bunker. Who were these Pentagon officials and wh y were they so eager for Bilderberg asset Spielberg to produce a movi e about a threat from outer space? Commencing in December 2002, the SciFi Channel will screen Taken , Spielberg's 20-hour mini-series focusing on alien abduction. The cost of this production was a staggering $120 million - making it the most expensive mini- series in television history. You'd thin k Spielberg would by now have tired of the genre, but his elite controllers are really zealous to implant this alien paradigm in the minds of the public. Furthermore, Ray Santilli's infamous 1995 'Alien Autopsy' footage now widely accepted as a hoax can again be traced back to Spielberg. T he film became all the rage in the international UFO community, with half the specialized publications featuring Sant illi's alien corpse on their front covers. However, Santilli now appears to be just the front man for the real owner of the film. Santilli admitted in a BBC interview that the money behind the film came from Germany. French network TF1 subsequently reported that the film originated from an individual by the name of 'Herr Volker Spielberg.' TF1 tried to track this man down but he proved elusive.

Recent Roper polls tell us that 80% of the American population believes in UFO's. In conclusion, consider the comments of UFO researcher Jacques Vallee, \"When I met Stephen Spielberg, I argued with him that the subject [of UFOs] was even more interesting if it wasn't extraterrestrials. If it was real, physical, but not ET. So he said, 'You're probably right, but that's not what the public is expecting - this is Hollywood and I want to give people something that's close to what they expect’.” 12 Why are the Rockefellers Funding the UFO Movement? The Rockefeller family played a pivotal ro le in establishing the quasi-secret Globalist Bilderberg, CFR, and Trilateral Commission groups. They represent the apex of global monopoly capitalism. The Rockefellers have a penchant for controlling so-called radical 'anti-estab lishment' minorities. This is a common tactic and enables the elite to exalt itself by demonizing a shill opposition. The public would prefer to listen to a clean-cut man in a ni ce suit rather than a dirty hippy with dreadlocks. The leftist underbel ly is bankrolled by the establishment. Thirty years ago when the radical student movement was gaining momentum in North America, the Rockefeller dynasty was surprisingly quick to offer funds. A student leader, James Simon Ku nen, in his book entitled The Strawberry Statement, tells us about the 1968 Students for a Democratic Society convention in which, Men from Business International Roundtables... tried to buy up a few radicals. These men are the world's industrialists and they convene to decide how our lives are going to go. They offered to finance our demonstrations in Chicago. We were also o ffered ESSO (Rockefeller) money. 13 The Black Panther leader Eldridge Cleav er emphasized how the rich control their so-called adversaries when he wrote, There is a danger to the healthy development of the American Revolution in the fact that often revolutions are manipulated by the ruling class to appear to be a bigger threat than they really are. 14 Frank Capell in the U.S. Review of the News shared similar sentiments, Of course, we know that these radical students are not going to take over the government. What they are going to do is provide the excuse for the government to take over the people, by passing more and more repressive laws to 'keep things under control'. 15   12 New Dawn Magazine – May/June 1996 13 James Simon Kunen - The Strawberry Statement: Notes of a College Revolutionary - Random House - 1968 14 ‘The Rockefeller-UFO Connection: Shades of an Alien Conspiracy?’ - Dr.M.Sabeheddin - New Dawn Magazine - March/April 1996 - http://www.newdawnmagazine.com/Articles /Shades%20of%20an%20Alien%20Conspiracy.html 15 Ibid"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":" So we can ascertain that the Rockefellers and their ilk are playing a rigged game. They need a covert stranglehold on every significant minority movement and the UFO/ET faction is no different. In March 1993 Laurance Rockefeller, assi sted by former naval intelligence officer Cdr Scott Jones, met with then President Bill Clinton's Science Adviser Dr. John Gibbons and presented an ominous sounding 'Matrix of UFO Belief' study. On the weekend of 19-20th August 1995 Rockefeller met with Clinton himself at his Wyoming Ranch to further discuss the UFO issue. On December 18th, 1995, the New York Daily News reported that billionaire Laurance Rockefeller was funding a 150 page UFO report entitled 'The Best Available Evidence' which would subsequ ently be sent to Bill Clinton and other world leaders. 16 The report was distributed widely, but Rockefeller received no response. The reasons are two-fold. Either Rockefeller wasn't in the loop about the fact that the UFO issue had been co- opted as a manipulation tool or the report was actually a cover for a sensit ive briefing on the development of an outer space synthesis as a psychological operation. Rockefeller has also channeled money into the research of Dr. John Mack, the Harvard psychiatrist who has written se veral books claiming the validity of the alien abduction phenomenon. Fr om 1993-95 Rockefeller's 'donation' to Mack’s Center for Psychology and Social Change in Massachusetts was estimated to be $500,000 in total. Rockefeller paid for at least two meeting sessions of the Star light Coalition, a group said to be made up of former in telligence officers and military men interested in UFOs. At one time Rockefeller funded a plan to establish contact with aliens, not using the SETI method (by radio telescope), but by signaling them with banks of powerful hal ogen lamps. In May 1999 the BBC reported that Rockefeller was funding the UK's largest ever scientific study of crop circles, often linked to UFO activity by researchers. 17 Rockefeller has also funded numerous new age groups seeking to usher in a 'spiritual transformation' and new ways of thinking. His money also percolates through the environmental movement, which is controlled at the t op and used by the elite to foster neo- feudalism and continental land grabs. A litmus test for the hoaxed cosmic deception was Orson Welles' staged and updated dramatization of H.G. Wells’ The War of the Worlds . H.G. Wells was himself an early initiate of the Illuminat i secret societies and wrote several books detailing the goal of the global elite, including The New World Order .   16 ‘Far Out!’ - George Rush and Joanna Molloy - New York Daily News - December 18 1995 – available at http://www.qtm.net/~geibdan/rockman3.html 17 ‘US billionaire funds crop circle research’ - BBC - May 19 1999 - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/347439.stm "},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":" On October 30, 1938 CBS Radio was broadcasting the music of Ramon Raquello and his orchestra live from the Me ridian Room at the Park Plaza in New York City. Suddenly a reporte r from ‘Intercontinental R adio News’ interrupted the broadcast to deliver an important announc ement. Astronomers had just detected enormous blue flames shooting up from the surface of Mars. The broadcast returned to the music of Ramon Raquello, but soon it was interrupted again with more news. Now a strange meteor had fallen to earth, impacting violently on a farm near Grover s Mill, New Jersey. A reporter was soon on hand to describe the eerie scene around the meteor crater, and the broadcast now switched over to continuous cover age of this rapidly unfolding event. To the dismay of the terrified audience listening to the broadcast, the events around the Grovers Mill meteor crater rapidly escalat ed from the merely strange to the positively ominous. It turned out t hat the meteor was not a meteor. It was, in fact, some kind of spaceship from which a tentacled cr eature, presumably a Martian, soon emerged and blasted the on-lookers with a deadly heat-ray. The invaders began to land in other US cities and then around the world. In an eerily accurate forecast of th e events of September 11, one character describes the shock of the enemy advancing at speed ac ross the Hudson River as smoke fills the air of Lower Manhattan.

[INSERT FIG 9.3 [CAPTION: Orson Welles’ 1938 Wa r of the Worlds broadcast was unwittingly used by the social programmers as a beta-test for how a population would react to a massive external enemy.] Original estimates depicted a reaction of total panic amongst one million of the six million listeners. Although this was later scaled down, hundreds of thousands of people thought the play was real despite announcements before, during and after the show indicating that it was just a dramatization. People stocked up cars, stashed food and drove hundreds of miles to loved ones. Obviously people are (a little) more s ophisticated today. However, so is the military intelligence and technology to be lievably hoax a hostile alien threat. The War of the Worlds broadcast was unlikely to have been a vast conspiracy to test the psychosomatic reaction of the Amer ican people to a hoaxed extraterrestrial invasion.

The documentary featured another elite operative, CEO Michael Eisner, and announced that intelligent contact with alien beings had occurred. The show presented a history of UFO sightings and crashed saucers. Eisner u ttered the telling line, “For governments determined to maintain their authority, extr a-terrestrial contact is pure dynamite.” The broadcast went out in five states, Connecticut, Tennessee, Alabama, Florida and California. It was unannounced and was patent ly a test as to how the public would react to the declarati on of an off-planet threat. Asteroids and Nuclear War We should by no means just focus on a hoax ed alien threat. The possibility of an asteroid, whether real or promulgated, causing a chain reaction of chaos on earth, is another consideration. Experts have warned that a small asteroid could accidentally trigger a nuclear war if mistaken for a missile strike. In July 2002 an Israeli pilot flying an air liner over the Ukra ine reported seeing a blue flash in the sky similar to the type of blast caused by a surface-to-air missile, despite Ukrainian authorities saying no su ch missile had been fired. It is likely that the pilot saw an explosion caused by an asteroid entering the Earth's atmosphere at high speed. The India-Pakistan cold war almost bec ame hot when a meteor with the same energy as the Hiroshima bomb exploded in the Earth’s atmosphere. Luckily, it was over the Mediterranean Sea at the ti me. If it had exploded over India or Pakistan the resulting panic could have seen nukes deployed by both sides. Scientists and military chiefs have ca lled for a global warning system to be implemented to identify Near Earth Object s that could launch an accidental war in any country that doesn’t have the s ophisticated sensory equipment to track them. Of course when you’re mani pulating the world accidents don’t happen. Take the case of Planet X, supposedly a monster planet, known to the ancients but as yet undiscovered by modern man, which will pass very near the earth as part of its normal 3600-year orbit around t he sun with a possibility of actually striking the Earth in 2003. I doubt the New World Orde r will introduce the off- planet threat so early in the script but it’s very interesting to note how the media are hyping this issue. Report From Iron Mountain In 1967 Dial Press , a division of Simon & Schuster , published a book called Report from Iron Mountain: The Possi bility and Desirability of Peace . The Iron Mountain Special Stud y Group had met four years pr eviously near Hudson, New York. The fifteen attendees included J ohn Kenneth Galbraith, a professor and member of JFK's \"Brain Trust,\" Dean Ru sk, Secretary of State, Robert Strange"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"McNamara, Secretary of Defense (later to become president of the World Bank), E.L. Doctorow, Victor Navasky, and G eorge McBundy. Although the meeting has been dismissed as a hoax by those in t he mainstream, the recommendations of the final report have been followed so stri ctly that even if the meeting was a hoax, the report is still worthy of study. People who dismiss the report altogether are often the type who think that by callin g anyone who seeks the truth a ‘loon’ or a ‘conspiracy nut’ that makes t hem part of the sneering elit e. They fail to consider the fact that Iron Mountain makes perfe ct sense for those wishing to dominate the world. If the report was a hoax then why were U.S. embassies around the world urged to play down public discussion of the r eport? Why did President Lyndon Johnson ‘hit the roof’ when he read it? Why is any publisher that threatens to re-release the report threatened with legal action? In 1972 Leonard C. Lewin claimed authorship of the report and debunked it as a hoax in the New York Times . The New York Times is one of the biggest mouth or gans of the New World Order and is largely owned by the Sulzberger family, which has interlocking ties with the CIA. Consider the comment s of monopoly capitalist David Rockefeller at the 1991 Bilderberg conference, “We are grateful to the Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those years.” 19 Even while pushing the hoax angle, Vict or Navasky, editor of the political magazine Monocle , who encouraged Lewin to write the report, stated that the report had been intended to, \"provoke thinking about the unthinkable—the conversion to a peacetime economy and the absurdity of the arms race.\" So even from this perspective we can judge t hat the report reflec ted the attitude of the same elite that later decried it as a hoax. Over its three years of consultation the Iron Mountain group agreed that war was the single greatest tool ever devised to ensure total fealty and obedience from any given population. If a population is provided with a common external enemy it will instinctively shift into groupt hink and rally round any figurehead that promises to fight the evil enemy. Loyalty is returned to the State and dissenters are crushed by the will of the rampaging ma jority. This majority are told that patriotism means supporting t he government when in fact the earliest forms of nationalism and patriotism in both Eu rope and America meant the exact opposite. Patriotism is a love of y our country and a safeguard against both foreign and domestic enemies, not blind obedience to government. Additionally, war can be used for a multitude of other obje ctives, such as reviving or crashing an economy or changing the geopolitical land scape to suit the internationalist agenda.   19 David Rockefeller – 1991 Bilderberg Conference, Baden Baden, Germany"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":" The problem was that, by its very composition, war needed nations and to differentiate between separate nations and sovereign borders was of detriment to Globalism. Nationalism, even when forc ed upon a people by empty government rhetoric, is still a polar oppos ite to the Global Village model of thinking desired by the New World Order crowd. Consider the very definition of nationalism, The belief that nations will benefit from acting in dependently rather than collectively, emphasizing national rather than international goals. 20 So the Iron Mountain group set out to find an alternative to war that would have the same benefit of enslaving the people. They couldn’t do it, the report noted, War has provided both ancient and modern societ ies with a dependable system for stabilizing and controlling national economies. No alternat e method of control has yet been tested in a complex modern economy that has shown itself remotely comparable in scope or effectiveness...’war' is virtually synonymous with nationhood. The elimination of war implies the inevitable elimination of national sovereignty and the traditional nation-state. 21 Now it was accepted that war was irrepl aceable, it was decided that the very nature of war itself had to be altered to reflect the new global system. One way this is done today is by having the Un ited Nations authorize every major war and having NATO fight it, thereby convinci ng the people that nations have united under Globalism to fight the evil little sove reign country, be that Iraq, Serbia – fill in the blank. However, the group conceive d of another possibility that could be used to corral the nations and people of the entire globe behind war. They could create a pervasive external alien threat by, “uniting mankind against the danger of destruction by \"creatures\" from other pl anets or from outer space.” The report states further, Experiments have been proposed to te st the credibility of an \"out of our world\" invasion threat. It is possible that a fear of the more difficult to ex plain flying saucer incidents of recent years were in fact, early government experiments of this kind. 22 Reports of flying saucers do little harm to black budget programs developing the latest technological breakthroughs in av iation. Recall that the Stealth Bomber and SR-71 Blackbird were bot h UFO’s before they were officially acknowledged. Today, the top-secret ‘Aurora’ spy plane is a classified project that utilizes handy camouflage from tantalizing reports of ex traterrestrial craft. Reports of flying black triangles are now commonplace.

This was di smissed because there was no external enemy involved, Credibility, in fact, lies at the heart of the problem of developing a political substitute for war. This is where the space-race proposals, in many ways so well suited as economic substitutes for war, fall short. The most ambitious and unrealistic spac e project cannot of itself generate a believable external menace. 23 And yet despite this a global space race did develop and accelerate in the immediate aftermath of the report. Despite the group’s conclusion that a hoaxed alien threat would be “unpromising” to deceive the masses, we cannot rule out that the proposal was put on the backburner for future use. Technology since the 1960’s, both public and covert, has accelerated to the point where a st aged ‘alien invasion’ is entirely possible. Star Wars Just take a look at history. The most successful way of legitimizing what would otherwise be a clear abuse of power is to create monsters in the minds of the public. They will always choose the lesser of two evils. There is clearly a program afoot to present a hoaxed and hostile alien or Near Earth Object presence as real. We continue to be conditioned. It's no strang e coincidence that top lieutenants of the Trilateral Commission like Laurance Ro ckefeller and Bilderberg placemen like Steven Spielberg are f unding and fomenting this al ien paradigm. That is not to say the entire UFO research field is c ontrolled, but the str anglehold at the top represents elite manipulation and social st eering. The technology to pull off this hoax is in place.

Control of natural resources is vital to the Globalists but not becaus e it makes them money. The prime reason for imposing a monopoly on commodities such as oil, diamond and precious metals is to prevent other people from am assing capital. This is important to emphasize because the elite largely call th emselves capitalists, thereby giving the system of capitalism a bad reputati on, when in fact they are monopoly hoarders. Free-market capitalism is t he fairest and most successful form of government ever invented and if we were really living under this system then our society would be prosperous and happy. In reality we are living under a system where our governments are in staggering amounts of debt to private, run for prof it banks. Both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England create money out of nothing and then charge interest on it. They are owned by private individuals most of whom are from Illuminati bloodlines. They are corporations and ar e subject to no government oversight because they bankroll the government. Th is fake money system enables banks to loan out ten times the amount of money it holds at any one time by simply typing it into a computer screen out of thin air. Therefore, when the private owners of the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England want to create an economic crash, they simply call all the loans in that they created out of nothing. During an economic crash, the wealth does not just ‘disappear’ – it is collected by the bankers. Collected too is your home and business when you go bankrupt. You took out a loan that was created fr om nothing and yet you have to pay it back with your physical assets. This is the scam that we live under and yet the vast majority slide their credi t card in the convenient littl e slot day-to-day blissfully unaware of how they have sold their life into slavery.

The e lite then fund the communist movement and t he media tell everyone that big business capitalism (monopoly hoarding) is the only system ava ilable to us apart from communism.

Again, It is not the scope of this book to take on such a mammoth subject, but it has been proven by authors such as Anthony Sutton that the Bolshevik revolution and other major movements and events in the history of communism, were funded by so-called capitalist banker s and industrialists from New York and Washington. I suggest you read his book, whic h is available for free online, for more information. 1 The New World Order system is a fusi on of both communism and fascism, since both are essentially the same. The comm unist system under Stalin was defined as a secret police, brutal murder and incarceration of political dissidents and other undesirables, and centralized control. The fascist system under Hitler was defined as a secret police, brutal murder and incarceration of political dissidents and other undesirables, and centralized control. Communism was called ‘left- wing’ and fascism was called ‘right-wing’ and yet the two are the exact mirror of each other. In the climate of the moder n world the politics of so ciety are being increasingly liberalized, no matter which party is in power. Liberals call for big government and this has helped the emergence of both the United Nations and the European Union as bodies of global government. M any leftists are deluded in thinking that, for example, the United Nations acts as a barrier against imperial U.S. aggression when it sanctions every U.S. wa r because it is controlled by the same people that control the U.S. government, in this case the Council on Foreign Relations. Similarly, the European Union is subservient to the Bilderberg group. When you try to educate someone about the New World Order, they immediately think that you must either belong to the extreme left or right wing simply because you are well-versed in what is actually going on in the world. They assume, because they have been conditioned to do so, that you must have your own political agenda. The truth is , we just want to be left alone by the Globalists. We want to live our lives in a free co untry where government is once again accountable. It’s not a lot to ask. But the media have systematically erected the perception whereby, if you talk about a Ne w World Order, you must be a right- wing racist extremist. Or if you talk about out of control U.S. imperialism you must be a card carrying communist. These perceptions have been introduced by the Globalists to protect their ident ity - that much is obvious.

In years past, peopl e who discussed a New World Order agenda were considered to be nutcase conspiracy freaks because that is how the media stereotyped it. However, as the New World Or der developed and expanded it inevitably had to become more visible and so the media began to admit that a New World Order existed but they then put the spin on it that it was good. Now anyone that talked negatively about the New World Order was stereotyped as an extremist, a reactionary and a racist. The New World Order is for global harmony they sa y. Isn’t world government a natural progression into 21st century new age oneness? You’re not for the terro rists are you? Now that the New World Order was admitt ed, the media and its controllers had to frame the debate. And so the debate became not whether we should have a world government or not, but whether we should have a left-wing world government or a right-wing world governm ent. Again the left/right paradigm was introduced to make us think we had fr eedom of choice, thus creating the perception that world gover nment was a natural political development. The build- up to the proposed war on Iraq was part of a process of empowering the United Nations as the global authority, the left- wing world government. It was played off against the USA-British-Israeli axis, the right-wing world government. The New York Times encapsulated this paradigm management when it reported on a European Union meeting concerning t he possibility of war in Iraq, In fact, the entire emergency conference of European leaders, held to hammer out a common position on Iraq, was saturated with a commitment to what may be viewed as a form of world government, the supervision of countries by an international civil service bureaucracy whose headquarters is the United Nations. This is a not ion that has long been viewed with suspicion and sometimes outright hostilit y by the United States. 2 I would like to emphasize the importance of th is article. No more is the concept of an agenda to create a system of global government viewed as a conspiracy theory. The New York Times will tell you there is such an agenda.

Tony Blair is a key figure because he is the linkman between the European ‘left- wing’ bloc and the American ‘rig ht-wing’ bloc of the Globa lists. In late April 2003 Blair publicly called for ‘one polar power’ to be forged between Europe and the United States to ‘prevent another cold wa r’ – again using the threat of chaos to push global centralization of power.

The more vainglorious passage s spoke of alliances to solve the wider world's problems, wars in the Congo, global poverty and famine and, of course, the installation of a Government in Afghanistan acceptable to a world opinion - that is, acceptable to the international jurists favoured by Mr Bl air. The outrages in Yugoslavia and those of September 11 in New York have confirmed in the mind of Mr Blair the need not merely to submerge the UK into a Euro-state but to create a wider world authority. Whether his allies in Washington and Brussels fully share his ambition is another matter.\" 3 The trick is that they do share his ambition and the only squabbling occurs when disagreements arise as to how best hoodwink the masses in to accepting global government. At this point some of you ma y be thinking that it is impossible to coordinate such a large-scale agenda wit hout someone finding out about it. Well we have found out about it and we’ve been trying to tell you for years but you didn’t listen!

This is encapsulated in t he following passage from an article that appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald , Today a liberal dissenter such as Gore Vidal, w ho called his most recent collection of essays on the US The Last Empire, finds an ally in the likes of conservati ve columnist Charles Krauthammer, who earlier this year told The New York Times, \"People are coming out of the closet on the word 'empire'.\" He argued that Amer icans should admit the truth and face up to their responsibilities as the undisputed masters of the world. And it wasn't any old empire he had in mind. \"The fact is, no country has been as dominant culturally, economically, technologically and militarily in the history of th e world since the Roman empire.\" 4 Again, the fact that we’re seeing the birt h of a new empire is conceded but the real string-pullers behind the cu rtain are never mentioned. A telling example of how the left are m anipulated to view United Nations run world government (socialist dictatorship) as the solution to American military aggression are the following comments by Australian journalist Margo Kingston, There will be a world government, but not one even pretending to be comprised of representatives of its nation stat es through the United Nations. The United States will rule, and not according to painstakingly developed internat ional law and norms, but by what is in its interests. Australia's choice is to become a non- enfranchised satellite state of the United States - and thus responsible for its aggression and a legitimate target for those fighting to win back countries the Americans take by force, or to fi ght like hell to save the United Nation's dream of world government by negotiation. 5 Notice the writer condemns a United Stat es run world government but then says it can be countered by a liberal United Na tions run world government. The writer doesn’t understand that the UN and the U.S. are controlled by the same elite. We don’t want a world government, period! Getting the message through to liberals that the only bulwark against the New Worl d Order is national sovereignty is one of our major tasks. The lefties still wish to believe that the United Nations is a force for good even though it has killed millions in places like Rwanda through brutal ‘peacekeeping’ missions. The United Nations also runs the international sex slave networks. This again sounds bizarre and I haven’t got time to detail it in this chapter. There is an entir e archive of mainstream articles confirming this at the Prison Planet website. 6 There can no longer be any doubt. A New World Order has arrived. The media are tacitly admitting it by mislabeling it ‘the new Roman Empire’. Both the left and right wings of this global government are controlled. They merely represent the two arms of the monster. This New Wo rld Order can be blamed for almost all examples of human suffering and repression in the world today and over the last 75 years at least.

War on Iraq Saddam Hussein may well have had small stocks of chemical and biological weapons in his arsenal because we know from confirmed Senate reports that Donald Rumsfeld was dispatched as Ronald Reagan’s envoy in 1983 to sell them to him. I have already covered how the U.S. government provided Saddam with the weapons they then used as a r eason for wanting rid of him. My argument is not centered on whether Iraq had weapons of mass destruction because the war on Iraq was not about weapons of mass destruction and this is admitted by the government itself in its own policy documents. In the spring of 2002 many experts conc luded that the war on Iraq would take place in the summer or at the latest t he autumn of t hat year. Myself and others disputed this in stating that the war had been delayed until at least early 2003. How did we know? There is an internal fissure within the New World Order between what is known as the Anglo-American es tablishment and the European bl oc. It is a contrast in ideology but not purpose – the ulti mate agenda is exactly the same. The European power bloc which is dominated by France and Germany holds that a global government system can only be es tablished without popular uprising in a piecemeal fashion. Policies and manufac tured crises need to be broken down into bite-sized chunks over a long period of time so as to gently acclimatize and lull people into accepting the New World Order. This is bes t represented by the European Union, which began as ‘just a free trade zone’ and over the course of time has slowly evolved into a giant centralized and un-elected federal superstate. On the other hand you have the Anglo- American establishm ent dominated by Britain and America that seeks to forc efully impose the agenda swiftly and with an iron fist. They prefer to blow th ings up and immediately propose openly fascistic legislation crushing basic rights and liberties. The Europeans dislike this approach because they see it as rash and being more likely to stir up an awakening and a resistance to the agenda. The Europeans favor Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World approach to conquering humanity, namely by conditioning the progr am into them. The Anglo-Americans favor the George Orwell 1984 approach, fear and terror to brutalize humanity into compliance.

This is why there is often bi tter infighting between the two factions and this inevitably spills out into the public arena. But that infighting is then spun by the media - leading people to believe t he ‘accidental’ view of history over the ‘conspiratorial’ view of history. The point to stress is that, despite ther e being two different strategy formats, the final goal is essentially the same. In the case of Iraq we had the Germans and the French supposedly ‘opposi ng’ the invasion of Iraq and standing in the way of an American led attack. And yet if you t ook the time to re ad what the Germans and French were proposing, it was essentia lly the same as what the Americans and British were ultimately proposi ng, namely full scale United Nations occupation of the country. The Americans and British w anted make a huge profit from sales of military hardware and equi pment via Brown and Root, a subsidiary of Dick Cheney’s Haliburton and of course they wanted full control of the oil fields. The Bush administration is awash with oilmen. This split within the New World Or der was evident at the May/June 2002 Bilderberg meeting. Veteran corresponde nt Jim Tucker of the American Free Press, utilized his informants within Bilderbe rg to ascertain that the war on Iraq had been postponed because it was considered to be too much of an impulsive maneuver, The issue of America going to war in Iraq has been delayed, with the White House agreeing to wait at least until next year, instead of late summer or early fall, but many issues simmer at this year’s secret Bilderberg meeting. 7 Bear in mind, this was at a time when the media were beati ng the war drums for a summer invasion. The amount of times t hese ‘conspiracy theories’ turn out to be accurate geopolitical forecasts is simply amazing!

Low and behold, the war was delayed until mid-March 2003. The decision to attack Iraq for the se cond time was made in September 2000; even before the Bush administration came to power. This decision emerged from a report by t he Project For a New American Century. The PNAC describes itself as, “a non-prof it educational organization dedicated to a few fundamental propositions: that American leadership is good both for America and for the world; that such leadership requires military strength, diplomatic energy and commitment to mora l principle; and that too few political leaders today are making the case for global leadership.” After reading its proposals, I think they should carry a subt itle of, ‘we have no more enemies so to justify massively increased defense spending let’s invent some’. The organization and its goals are a precise example of the thinking behind the Anglo-American establishment bloc. The document is entitled ‘Rebuilding Amer ica’s Defenses: Strategy, Forces and Resources For a New Century’ and was written for Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz. The partici pants of the projec t include Harvard University, John Hopkins University, the RAND Corporat ion and the Carnegie Corporation along with several military fi gures from the U.S. Naval War College. According to British Labour MP Tim Dalyell, “This is a blueprint for US world domination -- a new world order of their making. These are the thought processes of fantasist Americans who want to control the world. I am appalled that a British Labour Prime Minister should have got into bed with a crew which has this moral standing.” 9 The report reads like a laundry list of im perial conquest. It calls for conquest of Iran, conquest of Syria, conquest of Libya, conquest of North Korea, militarization of space, ‘regime change in China’, dev elopment of biological weapons to be used in war and a host of other colonial adventures which are summed up in their jargon as being ‘simultaneous major theatre wars'.

The report was picked up by the Sunday Herald and a handful of other news outlets but for some strange reason has receiv ed no attention in the mainstream American press apart fr om one watered down ABC News report. Issues of geopolitical primacy and the occupation of Iraq go hand in hand with American oil interests in the region. Le ftists have used the phrase “it’s all about the oil” so many times t hat they have worn it out. They rarely present much evidence to verify this claim and this is why the phrase has become a cliché in the media. I do have the evidence to make this claim without it being just an empty maxim. The era of cheap and abundant oil is coming to a close. Many experts predict that demand will outrun supply in 10 years time. Therefore it is inevitable that world oil prices will dramatically rise. T he benefit of controlling the world’s biggest oil supplies will be greater than it has ever been. Iraq contains the second largest oil supply on earth, at least 112 billion barrels of proven reserves, one tenth of the world’s supply, with some even sugges ting it is even more plentiful than number one in the world, Saudi Arabia. The script is set for America to turn on its ally in a matter of years because the Saudis have threatened to raise their oil prices and so an extra source of oil is a necessity for America to retain its superpower status. A puppet regime in Ir aq would pump three times the amount of oil than current levels, as reported by Newsweek . 11 The fall in supply from Venezuela has also hit hard, which is why the CIA have attempted on more than one occasion to overthrow Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez. In April 2001, a report by the Baker Institute for Public Policy revealed the Bush administration’s desperate urge to remo ve Saddam Hussein from the scene to protect their oil interests. The report was commissioned by U.S. vice-president Dick Cheney. It read, The United States remains a prisoner of it s energy dilemma. Iraq remains a destabilising influence to ... the flow of oil to international markets from the Middle East. Saddam Hussein has also demonstrated a willingness to threaten to use the oil weapon and to use his own export programme to manipulate oil markets. Therefor e the US should conduct an immediate policy review toward Iraq including military, energy, ec onomic and political/ diplomatic assessments. The United States should then dev elop an integrated strategy with key allies in Europe and Asia, and with key countries in the Middle East, to restate goals with respect to Iraqi policy and to   10 ‘Rebuilding America's Defenses: Strategy , Forces and Resources for a New Cent ury - The Project for a New American Century - September 2000 – available at http://w ww.prisonplanet.com/Rebuild ingAmericasDefenses.pdf 11 ‘Iraq: It’s the Oil, Stupid’ - Temma Ehrenfeld – Newsweek – September 30 2002 – available at http://www.prisonplanet.com/news_alert_093002_oil.html "},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"restore a cohesive coalition of key allies. 12 The Baker Institute was set up by forme r secretary of state under daddy Bush, James Baker, another key man in the armi ng of Iraq and numerous other criminal activities. The advisors for the report included Kenneth Lay, the disgraced former chief executive of Enron, and a host of top oil company executives. The Council on Foreign Relations was also involved in the proposals. The document presents a strategy to depl oy United Nations weapons inspectors to disarm Iraq of any remaining arms and th en to move in and take control of the oil within three to five years. This is the exact course of events we saw unfold in late 2002 and into 2003. Remember, the dossier was released in April 2001 and so this clearly indicates that Septem ber 11 and the much repeated ‘it’s a more dangerous world so we must take out Saddam’ mantra is an outright lie. The Sunday Herald commented that the document, “fundamentally questions the motives behind the Bush administration's desire to take out Saddam Hussein and go to war with Iraq.” 13 The Sydney Morning Herald of Australia made a similar conclusion, While the US now presses for \"regime change\" in Iraq, more than 18 months ago the report repeatedly emphasised its importance as an oil pr oducer and the need to expand Iraqi production as soon as possible to meet projected oil shor tages - shortages it said could be avoided only through increased production or conservation in the near-term. 14 The Baker report is a smoking gun and tells us that the agenda to commandeer the Iraqi oil fields was decided upon two or more year s before the proposed invasion itself. However, the White Hous e still insisted it had not even considered what the consequences in the oil market would be from a war even as they were massing troops. Mainstream Indian analysts also went publ ic to point out the oil agenda of the invasion of Iraq in September 2002, Sources said control over Iraq and its oil wealth would allow American firms to manipulate global market prices by deciding on production levels and to keep out countries like India, which is engaged in developing oil fields in that country. 15 Even as people like Tony Blair were ca lling the ‘alleged’ oil agenda a conspiracy theory, the biggest newspapers in the world were reporting, A U.S.-led ouster of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein could open a bonanza for American oil   12 ‘Official: US oil at the heart of Iraq crisis’ – Neil McKay – Sunday Herald – June 10 2002 - http://www.sundayherald.com/28285 13 ‘The West's battle for oil’ – Neil McKay – Sunday Herald – June 10 2002 - http://www.sundayherald.com/28224 14 ‘Oil has always been top of Bush's fo reign-policy agenda’ – Ritt Goldstein – Sydney Morning Herald – July 10 2002 - http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/10/06/1033538848021.html 15 ‘U.S. plans war to control Iraq's oil wealth: experts’ - P.

Woolsey went on the record as saying that the oil windfall would be divvied up fairly between the nations that agreed to support the war. And so it was no surprise that the fi rst priority after the invasion of Iraq was to secure the oil fields. Talks on this began in secret because, according to the London Guardian , The companies are reluctant to mention oil in public , fearing it will feed Arab suspicion that it is the main factor in the confrontation with Iraq According to the officials, Mr Cheney's staff held a meeting in October with Exxon Mobil Corporation, ChevronTexaco Co rporation, ConcocoPhilips, Halliburton, but both the US administration and the companies deny it. 17 Of course when the plan became public the m edia put out the blatantly ridiculous spin that control of the Ir aqi oil fields was for the benef it of the Iraqi people. Just like the U.N. oil for food program has been to the benefit of t he Iraqi people too, killing 500,000 of them. Colin Powell was the main proponent of this supposition and yet when asked if U.S. oil compani es would get the contracts for the operation of the oilfields he said, “I don't have an answer to that question.” 18 At the conclusion of the war the Bush administration blocked anyone else from bidding other than oil companies friendly to them. Most of the contracts were handed out to Dick Cheney’s Haliburton. S ubsequently, all the establishment talk show hosts began saying, ‘well what if it was about oil? Who cares?’ On the eve of the war the U.S. cited fabricated and unr eliable evidence to try and justify a war in the face of mounting anti-war demonstrations. Colin Powell’s speech to the U.N. on February 5 2003 was described as a watershed because it firmly divided the worl d into pro and anti-war camps. At this point blatantly demonization-driven stor ies were emerging suggesting that Saddam Hussein’s spies were running an d organizing anti-war protests across the world. Hussein could barely control his small region of dominance and so how his agents were able to leave t he country and infiltrate the anti-war movement is baffling.

During his presentation, Po well also held up a British intelligence dossier that claimed to detail Iraq’s links to terr orist organizations. Powell stated, “I would call my colleagues' a ttention to the fine paper that the United Kingdom distributed... which describes in exquisite detail Iraqi deception activities.” 20 The dossier, entitled ‘Iraq - its infras tructure of concealment, deception and intimidation’ was revealed just a day afte r Powell’s speech as a compilation of 6- year-old magazine articles and a graduate student thesis which cited information that was 12-years-old.

Number 10 says the Mukhabarat - the main intelligence agency - is \"spying on foreign embassies in Iraq\".

Immediately after this story began to circ ulate and build in intensity, the U.S. upped the terror alert level to orange and Tony Blair stationed troops and tanks at Heathrow airport. The government again terrorized the people into becoming distracted by fear and the story of the fraudul ent Iraq dossier never resurfaced again. Compare this to the case of ‘Cher iegate’ where Blair’s wife was revealed to have some second hand links to a conman. This was nothing compared to the dossier story and yet it dragged on for weeks and months. There were also numerous attempts to link Osama bin Laden to Saddam Hussein. There is a link between the two and that link is that both of these monsters were initially funded, armed and empowered by the CIA. Apart from that, the two are arch enemies. Hussein is a womanizing hedonist Socialist while bin Laden is a devout fundament alist. Why would Hussein want to give weapons of mass destruction to te rrorist groups that would use them against him? Like other Middle Eastern rulers, Saddam Huss ein has long recognized that Al Qaeda and like- minded Islamists represent a threat to his regi me. Consequently, he has shown no interest in working with them against their common enemy, the United States. This was the understanding of American intelligence in the 1990's. In 1998, the National Security Council assigned staff to determine whether that conclusion was justified. A fter reviewing all the available intelligence that could have pointed to a connection between Al Qaeda and Iraq, the group found no evidence of a noteworthy relationship. 24 And yet we were subjected again and agai n to people like Tony Blair, George Bush and Jack Straw telling us ther e were clear links between Al-Qaeda and Hussein but, unsurprisingly, they ‘couldn ’t tell us the nature of those links’   22 ‘UK defends 'copied' Iraq dossier’ – BBC – February 7 2003 - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2735031.stm 23 ‘Veteran Labor lawmakers walks out of Commons after a ccusing government of misleading public with Iraq dossier’ – Ed Johnson – Associated Press – February 10 2003 - http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u =/ap/20030210/ap_wo_en_po/eu_gen_britain_iraq_dossier_3 24 ‘Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda Are Not Allies’ – Daniel Benjamin – New York Times – September 30 2002 - http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/30/opinion/30BENJ.html "},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"because of national security concerns.

As"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"in the Roman Empire, the bread and circus of entertainment, sports and other such distractions are at the highest level of intensity we have ever known. This has been done for a reason and the reason is to control our attention and then limit our attention span to suit only mindless and often primitive models of stimulus. People can talk for hours about the latest episode of the soap opera but seem to go blank when you mention the slightly troublin g fact that our governments are killing us off. People pa int their faces up, scream violently at football games, cry when their team loses and then go and protest about how bad the team is. If they ca red about freedom as much as they do about football, we’d change the world in 24 hours! This is the insanity of our society! I’m not saying that you can’t watch soap operas and shout at foot ball games and also fight the New World Order but the fact is that you won’t really see the point once you learn to get your priorities in order . These mass opiates are steam valves for the human spirit; they act as a switchboar d to deflect our natural human lust for truth and justice into harmless and baseless directions. We are being turned into animals. Just go out to any popular ni ghtspot and witness the utter degeneracy that the human race has descend ed into. Hedonism, promiscuity and mindlessness are now seen as natural behavior. If you don’t run around screaming, shouting and having rampant sex then you must be repressed, according to the new definition of freedom. Freedom is not defined as the freedom to act stupid. Fr eedom is understanding our every right and being able to pre-empt the warning signs that our society is about to fall into the pit of Babylon. “It is proof of a base and low mind for one to wish to think with the masses or majority, merely because the majority is the majority. Truth does not change because it is, or is not, believed by a majority of the people.” - Giordano Bruno We need to keep our minds healthy. A key to real health of mind is to turn off the television. I’m not saying that watching a few hours a week is going to destroy you, in fact it can be quite useful to spy on enemy propaganda. It may seem pretty insignificant, and you may think you c an just turn it off at any time and live without it, but do you? No. The majority of Americans watch over four hours of television a day. When you are watchi ng TV, you are in an alpha state of consciousness. This makes you twenty- five times more suggestible to brainwashing or 'profiling' as elite mind control experts euphemistically label it. When in this process, you are only using your lower brain. This means that you can't distinguish between fact and fict ion and long-term your upper brain goes into atrophy and leads to mental lethar gy and illness. The latest research in neurology has proven that t he brain disorder that identifies psychopaths relates to the region that coordinates reac tion to shocking stimulus. A psychopath doesn’t react to shocking images and is able to kill people without remorse because his brain is wired differently to the rest of us. Just think how much more violence and decadence is on television co mpared to just ten years ago. It is clear that they are trying to turn us a ll into psychopaths by lowering our natural distain to disgusting imagery. Our brai ns are being re-wired. Television is a"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"deadly weapon in the war on your mind and it is always beneficial to know that a gun is being pointed at your head rather than just sitting there smiling at it, blissfully unaware that t he trigger is being pulled. It's there for a purpose, just as most other forms of ente rtainment are. They exist to convince you that you are merely a spec tator and not a participant in life. Once you take a look behind the curtain, you will realize how to harness your own power and actually fill the void of wort hlessness in your life. All the petty concerns that troubled you beforehand will melt away as you realize it's all bread and circus intended to keep you firmly within the consensus prison and the slave mentality. Another weapon in the hands of our controllers is the fear we have of what other people think. We have been conditioned to as pire to live ‘normal’ lives and be as regimented as possible. No w I’m not saying that wantin g to live a comfortable life with a nice house, two cars and a loving family is wrong – a strong middle class is necessary for any freedom-loving societ y. What I mean by ‘normal’ is normality of thinking and normality of thinking as def ined by society today is thinking what the majority of others think. The majori ty parrots the establishment line and then call it their ‘opinion’. Even at this level their opinion isn’t even their own because it comes from years of unbroken condition ing. When you counter their argument with truth backed up by evidence, they call it your ‘opinion’ and so we’re swimming in a cesspit of opinions wit h no agreement on fact. This attack on common sense has come as a direct resu lt of rampant liber alization of our society. But the main point I’d like to make is that mass consciousness has replaced individual discernment due to a bas ic manipulation of f ear. Fear of what other people think, both those close to us and complete strangers is rampant in today’s world. Approval and respect of our fellow man is a natural innate urge and so they have turned our ‘fellow man’ into a drooling brain-dead incoherent slave. It is actually considered ‘cool’ to sit around drinking beer all day talking about different parts of a woman’s anatomy. It is actually considered ‘cool’ to wear your jeans half way down your legs (jail code for a male prostitute), walk with your shoulders hunched and spit on the street every thirty seconds. If you’re female, it is considered ‘cool’ to sit ar ound all day preening your self talking about fashion labels. This is what most peopl e do and so if you don’t do it you must be different, you must be strange. You ta lk about politics and the government that actually runs the country you live in whose decisions affect your life to the core? Are you some kind of freak? You care about something other than the Yankees or when the next series of Friends is going to start? You must be nuts! How dare you use your brain? We must throw off the fear of what other people think and realize that if other people refuse to think then they have no respect for themselves and we should just avoid them. Have no fear exc ept the fear of being on your deathbed and realizing that your entire life has been an exercise in conformity. “Enlighten the people generally, and tyranny and oppr essions of body and mind will vanish like"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"spirits at the dawn of day.” - Thomas Jefferson The first stage is to educate yourself. You must choose whether to approach the issue generally or focus in on one specif ic topic. You could learn about the emerging police state, or world gover nment, or the cashless society, or government sponsored terrorism. You could defend property rights, gun ownership or the preserva tion of national sovereignt y. They all overlap but choosing to tackle just one will mean you c an devote all your time and resources to it. This book is mainly focused on government-sponsored terrorism but I take a general approach in my wider research be cause my brain tends to jump around from one thing to the next. Try to judge your own character and then base your decision on it. We all absorb information at different speeds but within a year you should develop detailed knowle dge of the trends of the New World Order and how it affects our day-to-day life. One th ing is for sure; you’ll never watch the evening news in the same way again. The Internet is a vital component to your learning process. If you don’t have a computer your local library invariably wi ll. Now that the not ion of an independent press is laughable, the Internet is the last outreach for tr uth, which is why it is portrayed as being choc-a-bloc with gar bage by the mainstream. Furthermore, there are literally hundreds of thousands of reports every week that are put out by Associated Press , Reuters and all the big newspapers that never make it to the evening news or radio. Some don’t even make it in the paper. They are usually the biggest smoking guns to prov e this New World Order which is why scanning the news wires is a necessary daily task for me and should be for you too. Then of course there is the great net work of alternative media websites that pick up on these little noticed news reports and indeed produce reports of their own. Be careful because obviously so me are less reliable than others – become proficient in being able to j udge reliability of source ma terial. At my website, http://www.propagandamatrix.com , and Alex Jones’ http://www.prisonplanet.com , I fuse together the mainstream and al ternative to produce a comprehensive coverage that you really need to check out daily. When you have educated yourself to a level where you feel comfortable in talking about the subject at length, it is time to educate ot hers. When trying to wake people up always start with the most importa nt information and then work in more background detail. Always emphasize that this has all come out in the mainstream media and isn’t a ‘conspiracy theory’. You’ll normally get four different responses. The first, and this is increasingly rare, is that the person will laugh at you or try to rationalize what y ou are saying. They do this either because they think you are trying to insult them by talking about things of which they have no knowledge, or because if what you were saying were true, t hey would have to actually do something about it and they don’ t want to. People are mentally lazy. Another response is that the person will admi t that what you’re saying is probably true but then add ‘but I have a job and a fa mily to feed – I have my own life to"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"lead’. You need to emphasize that they are in fact not even leading their own life because they are unaware of the matrix that controls it and as Thomas Jefferson said, “If ignorance is bliss, why aren't more people happy?” A third response, and I have found this to be the most common, is that people will listen intently for a relatively long per iod of time, ask sensible questions and largely agree with your points, but will t hen go and talk to the next person about celebrity gossip or whatever. However, we must take comfort that we have planted a seed within these people which will eventually gr ow when they are forced to come face to face with the New World Order and it affects them directly. We have done our job in giving these people the opportunity to escape the psychological gulag and it is ultimate ly their choice on whether to do so. A fourth response, the rarest , is that the person gets angr y at the fact that they have been manipulated and immediately asks how to join the cause. If you achieve this response then that’s magnifice nt but be aware that this person could be the type who burns themselves out on something and then becomes disinterested in it entirel y within a short period of ti me. Most people instinctively know that something is wrong in the world because they are generally good people and all the people they k now are generally good peopl e. So if the world is composed of generally good people why is the world in a pe rmanent state of suffering and oppression unless there has been some outside manipulation? This rationale resonates deep within the souls of all. Some choose to cower, others seek answers. Be calm and rational in your presentati on of the evidence. Do not under any circumstances shout at the person you are trying to inform, especially if they are getting angry too. It is a basic rule that if someone is losing an argument they start to shout and become illogical – far fr om realizing this, the other person will usually start to express t he same impulse. This then ha nds the argument to the person who initially raised their voice, because they have succeeded in getting you to react to idiocy, therefore ma king you an idiot and losing your own argument for you. Negative emotional r eactions are commonplace in our society and they won’t do you any favors whats oever. Erect a mirror of grace and the boisterous imbecile will only see his own reflection. Control your demeanor and people will respect what you are saying. It is important to underst and that the only people who have ever significantly influenced the world were small groups to tally dedicated to their cause. The biggest factor in enabling a person to make a difference is the simple belief that they can make a difference. It is drilled in to us from cradle to grave that we are just ‘ordinary people’ to the point wher e people dare not step outside the comfort zone of being an ‘ordinary person’. We are l ed to believe that we are completely powerless and cannot change a thing. This is demonstrably ridiculous. Just take one day from your life and analyze it. Thin k of every little decision you made during that day and how that decisi on affected the next one and the one after"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"that. Think how each decision you m ade affected the people around you, which then made them make different decision s and how their decisions affected the people around them. We change our lives and other people’s lives every minute of the day and we’re supposed to be powerle ss? All we need to do is wake up to the fact that we are influential. The alternative media stopped Pakistan and India from going to nuclear war. Just think about what we can get done in this world if we only applied ourselves. “It is not love of self but hatred of self which is at the root of the troubles that afflict our world.” - Eric Hoffer The battle begins at home. Unhappy peopl e cannot even change their own life, so they have no hope of changing the worl d. Depression is the self-indulgent process that convinces you of your ow n worthlessness. If you are depressed then you have to change what’s within you before you can apply it to the outside world. A lot of people suffer short-term depression if an event takes place to cause it and the vast majority overcome i t. But if your state of melancholy cannot be explained by any single event, it is likel y the result of countless years of this matrix false-reality pounding on your soul. Most people are immune because they don’t realize they have a soul and go on to live lives of painful insignificance. The fact that we are the only living bei ng throughout history with the ability to hate ourselves is proof that we have a soul. But for those who do realize that something is wrong but can’t define it, t he only outlet is often depression. So in this sense depression itself is a manufactured attack to divert those who do begin to wake up. Obtain the desire to improv e yourself, and I don’t mean by sticking signs up on your wall that say ‘every day and in every way I am getting better and better’. Develop respect for your own ab ility to grab your life by the scruff of the neck and reject all the outside emoti onal manipulation. Clinical depression has risen by over 50% in the last thir ty years. Recent studies revealed that people who were given a placebo recover ed from depression in greater numbers than those taking Prozac. This tells us t hat it is the simple belief that one will recover that is crucial, not drugs which only make you worse in the long run. The increasing liberalization of our society has taught us to ‘show our emotion’ and ‘not be afraid to display weakness’ – this is in fact encouraging us to be weak- minded. It’s an attack on your strength of mind and psychological well being. Your brain is the most powerful muscle in your body, it controls all the others. Reclaim it as your own and you will be in awe of its amazing power. “Brainpower is the scarcest commodity and the only one of real value.” - Robert Heinlein We have been presented with our final oppo rtunity to defeat the New World Order. If we fail to act then our children will look back at this moment in history as one in which humanity cowered in t he face of evil and signed its own death warrant. \"All that it takes for the triumph of evil is that good men and women do nothing.\""},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"- Edmund Burke If our torment is to end, if liberty is to be restored, we must gr asp the nettle, even though it makes our hands bleed.
