The MIT plasma and fusion lab had shown them how to rig planes and targets for remote detonation through global satellite networks; how to fuel shockwave tube bombs with solid or liquid propellants from Delta or Zenit rocket engines burning half as hot as the surface of the sun and how to solve an assassin's perennial problem by shocking the bodies of victims and liquefying – even vaporizing – evidence of murder, arson and fraud. Their supersmart mathematicians with superfast computers, networked to a ‘ Center for Coordination Science ’ , were primed to pounce on price differentials when trade on the NYSE stopped but the Chicago Mercantile Exchange stayed open for profit and business. But MIT ’ s professor of linguistics, the anarcho-syndicalist Noam Chomsky, and fellow intellectuals were not so interested in the money – even if the murder of a few firefighters would pad their pensions – they wanted a clear view of the “ first live-broadcast mass snuff film in history ” when a manufactured shock and al-Qaeda myths ended American capitalism for ever and NATO paramilitaries were sworn in to enforce a fascist peace. But MIT ’ s effete, elite professor and his mathematical, engineering and scientific fellow travelers, had little experience at generating the panic the world ’ s most powerful bankers needed to target and terrify local victims and have them begging for peace at any price. So back in 1989, the bankers began to assemble elite special weapons and tactics teams, coordinated online through the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, so that ‘ al-Qaeda ’ assets could move undetected on global networks controlled by radical intellectuals, NATO paramilitary commanders and those organized crime and labor bosses who reported to the Bonanno headquarters, well out of reach of the FBI, in Montreal, Quebec. Oh yes, I almost forgot, thanks to a secure satellite communications and electronic credit network, our teachers were able to invest in staged ‘ al-Qaeda ’ panics via a private bank in Switzerland and share their profits with the extended, racketeering families of Osama bin Laden - former CIA agent in Afghanistan - and Saddam Hussein, the butcher of Baghdad. And that oh-so simple trick; conceal civilian box cutters in military baggage for simulated hijacking attacks then switch cockpit controls to concealed military gyroscopes in civilian Boeings and fly http://www.valis.cjb.cc/HawksCAFE/070106.html (1 of 8) [1/18/2007 9:57:39 AM]"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"HawksCAFE @ ARG along \"Final Approach\" corridors into targeted U.S. command centers. This then is their story; told not for the fearful - of which there was a troubling many - but for the victims, whose souls beg to leave those September scenes but only if justice is done. Seconds, Hours, Months and Years through 9/11 Our story has four acts with different timelines, spanning twelve seconds to kill and vaporize targets and twelve years to develop war game and weapons for 9/11. The first two timelines – one in seconds, one in hours - will be developed with online co-researchers using virtual reality and computer simulation tools; partly to better visualize the physics of a shockwave murder and partly because the self-styled ‘ Global Guardians ’ would have used these same tools to plan and execute the attacks. With the encouragement of my co-researchers, I will be inviting the people below to help us (a) reconstruct the 9/11 physics of observed and measured effects, (b) identify the special weapons and tactics ( ‘ SWAT ’ ) teams which appear to match, (c) identify the paymasters or the custodians of such teams, and finally (d) identify motives which might have justified the Global Guardians ’ use of ‘ shock, bait and liquidate ’ weapons on 9/11. Some Characters in “ Manufactured Shock ” M.I.T. professor of linguistics and de facto leader of anarcho-syndicalists in the Industrial Workers of the World – also known as “ The Wobblies ” – Noam Chomsky knew how to manufacture consent with propaganda, but he didn ’ t know how to organize unskilled workers into one world union as custodians of the global commons to destroy capitalism by abolition of the wage system and aboriginal and legal property rights. Former general president of the Laborer's International Union of North America, Arthur Coia knew how to recruit laborers, train them as blast technicians and manipulate hiring halls to sabotage construction, upgrade or demolition contracts, but he didn ’ t know how to duck the draft racketeering complaint from the U.S. Justice Department accusing LIUNA and mob affiliates of extortion, crushing dissenters and pilfering union funds. Former impeached U.S. President Bill Clinton knew how to triangulate voters into thinking he was to the left of the right, to the right of the left and above them both, but he didn ’ t know how to get himself or the Democrats elected without accepting money from mobbed-up unions or Chinese agents wanting to buy arms technology to attack America. Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Boeing director on 9/11, John Shalikashvili, knew how to conceal the treasonous transfer of U.S. weapons technology and a coup d ’ etat inside President Clinton ’ s bogus NATO Partnership-for-Peace program but didn ’ t know how to conceal his admiration for his father ’ s role as a major in the Nazi Waffen SS. Former No 2 in US Air Force procurement, former chairman of board of directors of NATO ’ s AWACS program and a future vice-president of Boeing, Darleen Druyun, knew how to conceal illegal modifications to Boeing passenger or refueling aircraft in Canada so the planes could be flown as hijacked decoys or bomb-laden drones to sabotage NORAD ’ s war games on 9/11, but she didn ’ t know how to stay out of jail. Former director of Lafarge and the former president and de facto leader of “ Les Militants Syndicalistes ” at the French American Foundation, Hillary Clinton knew how to use law firms to conceal CIA special weapons and tactics ( ‘ SWAT ’ ) teams and intelligence networks linking New York, Montreal, London and Paris to clients, including Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein in Iraq, but she didn ’ t know how to make herself likeable enough to ever be elected as the president of the United States. Former deputy chief of staff to the Clinton administration and co-leader of the Shadow Party with George Soros and Hillary Clinton, Harold Ickes knew how to protect Coia and LIUNA from RICO lawsuits with a Democrat in the White House but he didn ’ t know how to do the same under the http://www.valis.cjb.cc/HawksCAFE/070106.html (2 of 8) [1/18/2007 9:57:39 AM]"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"HawksCAFE @ ARG administration of U.S. president, George Bush. Controlling investor in Waste Management Inc, convicted for insider trading in the Société Générale scam and co-leader of the Shadow Party with Hillary Clinton and Harold Ickes, George Soros knew how to mislead investors and stock market analysts, defraud union pension funds and hire workers to move and destroy evidence of murder, arson and fraud at Ground Zero in Manhattan, but he didn ’ t know how to buy the election of Democrat presidential candidates in November 2000 (Al Gore) or 2004 (John Kerry). Convicted former Bonanno crime family boss, ‘ Big Joey ’ Massino knew how to run a RICO enterprise, shock targets, bait traps and kill the people who fell into them, but he didn ’ t know how to liquidate or vaporize human bodies and destroy evidence of murder. Alleged shooter in 1981 Bonanno hit and reputed Montreal Mafia don, Vito Rizzuto knew how to use Canadian lawyers to protect meetings from police scrutiny and take the Montreal family to a leadership role in organized crime in North America, but he didn ’ t know how to wipe out the New York families for his allies in Montreal and Chicago. Disgraced former CIA director, Dr. John Deutch, knew how to generate shock waves to liquefy solids but he didn ’ t know how to conceal a rocket-fuel bomb inside modified Boeing aircraft or the upgraded buildings at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. UN Oil-for-Food scam godfather, Maurice Strong knew how to launder money and collect kickbacks for “ world bankers and intellectual elites ” from the likes of Teachers* and Teamsters pension funds, but didn ’ t know how to run a murder or drug-and-weapons smuggling network through the Montreal, New York and Chicago labor unions. ‘ Teamsters ’ is the International Brotherhood of Teamsters; ‘ Teachers* ’ is the name given to New York ’ s Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities Fund – TIAA-CREF – representing $340 billion retirement benefits of university faculty, the part owner of insured mortgages on the World Trade Center buildings though its private equity arm ‘ CAI ’ and an alleged source of venture capital for organized crime. CAI is the Teachers ’ private equity group of 50 prominent individuals who meet the call of David Rockefeller – on the international advisory council of JP Morgan Chase – for an “ intellectual elite and world bankers ” to take custody of the global commons. Alleged bogus litigant against Macdonald Dettwiler and Associates, Mohammad al-Zaibak knew how to bypass coastguards using Canada ’ s digital hydrographic charts and how to take hijacked passenger aircraft off enroute airways and fly them into targets, but he didn ’ t know how to stand down the U.S. Air Force so that the hijackers could pass. JP Morgan Chase international advisory council member, William Daley successor to a U.S. secretary of commerce whose military Boeing C37 plane was allegedly blown up with a ‘ thermite ’ bomb, with his brother, Richard Daley, mayor of Chicago, knew how to manipulate the FAA and Boeing into sabotaging the Pentagon ’ s response to 9/11, but they didn ’ t know how to liquidate Cantor Fitzgerald in One World Trade Center and switch the world ’ s largest broker in sovereign debt to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Outline Chronology In 1981, Massino invited three Bonanno capos to peace talks at a Brooklyn social club. The baited capos were killed by a Montreal hit team which went back home leaving local mobsters to dispose of the evidence, perhaps using those Bonanno double-decker coffins where a loved one positioned on top would conceal the murder victim ’ s body underneath. Massino then began \"a quarter-century of murder, racketeering, arson, extortion, loan-sharking, and gambling\" and built a criminal empire linking the Fulton Fish Market to the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island and the World Trade Centers where mob brokers gamed with pension funds of labor unions including operating engineers (IUOE), laborers (LIUNA), the Teamsters garbage-disposal locals and New York City ’ s public employees. http://www.valis.cjb.cc/HawksCAFE/070106.html (3 of 8) [1/18/2007 9:57:39 AM]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"HawksCAFE @ ARG In 1988, Rudolph Giuliani, U.S. Attorney in New York, filed a federal lawsuit demanding the Teamsters union be put into trusteeship by the government to clean out corruption. In 1989, the Bonannos bankers hired CAI - a Teachers private equity group in New York and Montreal - to take custody of the Teamsters funds out of the reach of the U.S. Attorney, Rudi Giuliani, and the 41 st President of the United States, George Walker Bush. From 1993 to early 2001, U.S. president Bill Clinton, strengthened the Teachers control of the Teamsters and SWAT teams; he put Darleen Druyun as head of U.S. Air Force procurement to lease fuel bombs and shock weapons from Boeing, backed the election of Teamsters president, Jimmy Hoffa Junior, defended Labourers ’ president, Arthur Coia, against Department of Justice ’ s racketeering charges and pardoned Dr. John Deutch. In 2000, Dr. Deutch invited Mayor Rudi Giuliani to sponsor an Office for Emergency Management where the CIA shared access to a shock-resistant bunker in 7 World Trade Center. Four years earlier, Deutch, an MIT professor of chemistry, had stolen top-secret information and database ( ‘ al-Qaeda ’ ) on CIA SWAT teams, including the apparent use of rocket fuel bombs to generate shock waves and liquefy solids – evidence. When George Bush Jr. was sworn in as 43 rd president of the United States in January 2001, a Republican White House linked up to Rudi Giuliani, now a reforming mayor of the City of New York. By 2001, Giuliani had forced the Bonannos out of the Fulton Fish market and begun an attempt to clean up New York ’ s construction, demolition and garbage-disposal unions. The Teachers and Teamsters' private-equity managers, including World Bank advisors, Maurice Strong and Dr. John McArthur, felt threatened by the renewal of a Giuliani-Bush reform agenda and the stage was set for the shock and bait of RICO 9/11. During the June 1-2, 2001 ‘ Amalgam Virgo ’ war game, Teachers and Boeing insiders, including a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, used instrument approach procedures to fly hijacked planes with the U.S. Air Force ordered to stand down. When Dr. Deutch launched the privately sponsored war game ‘ Global Guardian ’ on 9/11, he chose to simulate ‘ al-Qaeda ’ hijacking attacks with red team flying Boeing aircraft, modified with embedded fuel bombs, into buildings rigged with embedded fuel bombs. Deutch ’ s games were staged with Boeing and NATO AWACS aircraft, illegally-leased by Darleen Druyun, Clinton ’ s corrupt head of procurement for the U.S. Air Force. New York firefighters responded to the shock of the 9/11 attack by entering the North and South Towers to help victims escape and put out low-intensity fires. Their analog Motorola radio systems appear to have been jammed; they did not receive the order to evacuate and over 300 firefighter bodies were liquidated when the buildings were demolished by what appears to be a shockwave from fuel bombs in the towers. On 9/11, with the pulverized cement dust still settling in Manhattan, Teamsters ’ Local 831 members from the New York City Department of Sanitation began hosing down the streets, flushing evidence of murder and ultra-high temperature arson into the sewers. On 9/11, the contractor working on 7 World Trade Center diesel systems was ordered to pull the building by the owners of the mortgage (the Teachers ’ private equity group) and to start planning shipments of debris from Ground Zero to Staten Island where terrified investigators would sort through ‘ fines ’ , including incinerated bits of firefighters ’ bodies. On 9/11 at 5:20 p.m., WTC #7 – a building never hit by a plane – was ‘ pulled ’ by the Teachers ’ mortgage company in a fire so hot it vaporized steel and evidence of fraud. On 9/11, the problem of liquidating bodies of murder victims was solved not by the Bonannos - North America ’ s most powerful crime family - nor by Teamsters - the ‘ World ’ s Most Powerful Union ’ - but by people more powerful than either who double crossed them both. http://www.valis.cjb.cc/HawksCAFE/070106.html (4 of 8) [1/18/2007 9:57:39 AM]"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"HawksCAFE @ ARG A Challenge Some have proposed that battles between nations should be fought with a champion selected by each side fighting in man-to-man combat to save casualties. Dr. Deutch is a member of the Teachers ’ elite, a director of Citigroup, Raytheon and Schlumberger, and an expert in solution chemistry, molecular thermodynamics and kinetics. David Hawkins is a full member of the Scholars for 9/11 Truth, the former coordinator of Artificial Intelligence and geoscience research at Schlumberger, the inventor in 1989 of a toolkit for virtual-reality prototyping and a world authority on the use of applied mathematics, thermodynamics and deductive logic to analyze violent crimes and identify the weapons, opportunities and motives of the perpetrators. I will be challenging Dr. Deutch to a virtual reality war game in the four acts of this story; we can work together or against each other to develop the true interpretation of the events during twelve seconds of 9/11 physics, twelve hours of the ‘ Global Guardian ’ war games, twelve months of the CIA or al-Qaeda ’ s special weapons and tactics teams and twelve years of Teachers ’ securities, insurance and mortgage fraud. Dr. Deutch ’ s red team played 9/11 with 3 million – mostly unwitting – members in the $340 billion teachers ’ national pension fund and 1.4 million – mostly unwitting – members of the teamsters in the United States and Canada working as law enforcement officers, technical employees in both the public and private sectors and public defenders. On 9/11, a red-team hijacker said, “ We have some planes ” ; today I can respond with “ We have some truths ” and invite readers to participate in four acts ... Acts 1, 2 and 3 will explore the physics of virtual shock and visual awe in the murder of selected victims and how ‘ al-Qaeda ’ special weapons and tactics teams were recruited, equipped and trained to kill them. Act 4 will be difficult for me and the blue team to write; focused as it must be on the intangible motives or mens rea of the ‘ Teachers ’ , the self-appointed ‘ Global Guardians ’ , the 50 or so people who have the power to recruit paramilitary SWAT teams through American or Canadian governments for private use; the people who write military and business hedge-fund scenarios for ‘ spinning ’ war games against trusting allies; the people who share David Rockefeller ’ s view that the world is “ now more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government ” ; the people convinced by Canada ’ s Maurice Strong that the United Nations should have custody over the global commons, including the air we breathe, the water we drink and the land on which we walk; the people who feel different from you or me, superior to janitors in high rises, indifferent to firefighters in New York, hatred for Wall Street types and rage at U.S. naval officers or marines who go with fierce pride into harms way, and, ultimately and tragically, the people whom we trusted to remind us before 9/11 that the price of freedom was always eternal vigilance. If I err in my allegations, I will correct the offending statement or stand ready to defend them in a court of law, but the red-team people know who they are so this is the challenge and let the war games begin.
