[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"What is Bilderberg? And Why Does It Matter? If you've never heard the word \"Bilderberg,\" don't feel as though you are uninformed. Some of the best-read, most -widely-traveled fo lks on the planet have no knowledge of this organization— formally known by its leadership and members as \"The Bilderberg Meetings.\" For more than 50 years, acting as a global ruling elite, Bilderberg's very name and activities remain largely hidden in the shadows, despite its immense clout in dire cting world affairs. Although, in 1992, Larry Pope, the executive editor of the Asheville, North Carolina Citizen Times newspaper told one of his readers in a letter that \"to my knowledge, such an organization does not exist and a media conspiracy to keep its existence a secret would be ludicrous,\" the evidence shows otherwise. Now with the release of Bilderberg Diary by veteran journalist James P. Tucker Jr., those who've never known of Bilderberg will get a first-hand account of its history (and its misdee ds) from the one journalist who has doggedly tailed the Bilderbe rgers all over the United States and Europe for the last quarter century. Although the mass media in the United States—both print and broad- cast—has determinedly suppressed news and information about—and the very existence of—Bilder berg, Tucker has estab- lished himself as the world' s foremost authority on Bilderberg, reporting on their intrigues in the pages of D.C.-based American Free Press. In Bilderberg Diary Jim Tucker lays out—for the first time—his entire remarkable history of covering Bilderberg, his infiltration of Bilderberg meetings, the procurement of their private documents, and the shining of the spotlight of public scrutiny on Bilderberg's shadowy affairs. Tucker's colorful prose will introduce you to the little-known arena of the Bilderberg elite, a memorable and panoramic jour ney that lays bare the realities behind modern-day international power politics in a way never seen before.

Although I had heard about Bilderberg, I knew very li ttle about this secret gathering. I had read Jim's earlier reports, but I wondered how such high-profile figures could meet with no mention in the mainstream press. And that's how I found myself, for th e next four years, attending the annual gathering of Bilderberg, phot ographing those el ite politicians, power brokers and bankers, who gathered every year to talk candidly about the most important issues—m atters that affect all of our lives—behind locked and heavily guarded doors. Upon arriving in Switzerland on May 31, 2000, I took Jim's advice and followed his usual routine. The day before th e group was scheduled to arrive, I traveled to Genval, near Brussels, Belgium, and checked into the site of that year's meeting at the Chateau du Lac. However, I was told I could only stay for one night as this multi-million-dollar resort had been completely booked for the weekend by a group of important people."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"ii Bilderberg Diary I poked around the gro unds and hallways to see if there was anything that might confirm Tucker's information that this was actually the place that Bilderberg would c onvene. Though hotel staff claimed not to know anything about the gro up, which would be taking over the hotel for the next four days, I could see that conference rooms were busily being prepared and I sensed that the empl oyees had been lectured to keep their mouths shut about the caliber of individuals who would be attending that coming weekend. As I've learned, this is always the case. It was not until early the next mo rning, however, that I began to notice the extent to which this enigmatic group goes to lock down the site. I looked out the window and saw a team of sp ecial security agents walking around the front of the hotel. It certainly looked like something very important was about to take place. After breakfast, I checked out of the hotel. Taking my camera bag, I went for a stroll along the lake. There was a road that passed directly in front of the hotel and beyond th e road was a small park and lake. There were several benches conveniently located in front of the hotel. In the beginning I was by myself, but as the morning progressed more and more people began to stroll past the hotel. It was Thursday, June 1, 2000, and because it was a bank holiday in Belgium many local people had the day off. As I was perched with my cameras in front of the hotel, passers by would ask me if I knew what was going on. A Belgian journalist thought that a famous footba ll team was stayi ng at the hotel. I had some copies of Spo tlight material about the Bilderberg group with me and explained that it was a very different kind of team that was expected at the hotel. I told him that this team included people like Queen Beatrix of Holland, Henry Ki ssinger, David Rockefeller, and perhaps even President Bill Clinto n. He came back later and actually wrote a story about Bilderberg .

Some American women who had memberships at the hotel's fitnes s club looked at the Bilderberg material and recognized Vernon E.

Whenever a car would drive up, I would try to positio n myself for a photo with my telephoto lens. People would come to me and ask, \"Who was that?\" Often, they would tell me who they thought they had seen. While the local people enjoyed the party atmosphere, I could see that Bilderberg security was becoming very uneasy with the scene in front of the hotel. The unexpected crowd had completely ruined their plans for the Bilderberg guests to slip into th e hotel unnoticed. With dozens of people crowded around the fr ont of the hotel there was very little Bilderberg security could do without drawing even more attention to the secretive group. A few Bilderberg hounds, like Tony Gosling from England, were on ha nd and a young boy with a camera was even waiting by the front door trying to take photos of the rich and famous guests. The next day, things we re different. I arrived at the hotel early to find that two tents had been set up by the front door of the hotel. When a car arrived it would drive into one tent so that the passengers could pass into the hotel without be ing seen. With President Clinton scheduled to receive th e Charlemagne Prize in Aachen, on the Belgian- German border, there was anticipati on he would suddenly show up to meet with the Bilderberg group. At midday, the Bilderbe rg attendees began to come out for a break in the fresh air. John M. Deutch, the Belgia n-born former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, came out with two Americans and walked right into range of my camera. I wa s busy running aro und trying to get photos of the individuals and groups as they walked near the lake. As long as I didn't get in anybody's wa y, there was very little Bilderberg security could do; the roadway was public property. Then two individuals came out from the tented doorway. There were security men all around these two. They walked quickly toward the side of the hotel. I immediately recognized these two Bilderberg men: the infamous currency"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Foreword v speculator George Soros and Carl Bild t, the former prime minister of Sweden and the UN Special Envoy to the Balkans. I spoke politely to Bildt as the two made their way to the side yard of the hotel. Not wanting to offend, I didn't ask Bildt the question that I should have: \"Mr. Bildt, what do you know about the smuggling of Soviet weapons on the Estonia ferry?\" That question would have certainly shocked Bildt, who was Sweden's prime minister when the ferry sank with the loss of 852 lives on Sept. 28, 1994. Soros was visibly uneasy about being photographed with Bildt, who was serving as special envoy for the UN secretary general in the former Yugoslavia. Bildt was se rving UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, who is married to Nane, a Wallenberg and niece of the disappeared Raoul Wallenberg. The photographs 1 took of Bildt a nd Soros are my favorite photos from four years of covering Bilderberg conferences. They were also the last photos I was able to take that year. The conference had just begun, but Bilderberg security decided that I had to go. In front of the hotel—on public pr operty—the security chief came up to me and stood directly in front of me with two of his thugs on each side of me. \"If you don't stop running behind people and taking pictures,\" he said, \"I'm going to jump all over you.\" I took my camera bag and went to the nearby restaurant, which I knew was not owned by the man w ho owned the hotel. I called Jim from the restaurant and told him what had happened and he advised me to leave. On the street, two Be lgian security thugs were watching me. I called a taxi and waited for what seemed like ages. Finally the taxi arrived and took me to the Brussels train station. I remember having to run across the tracks in front of the locomotive and jumping on a train at the very last minute. The conductor quickly came to see if I was alright. I breathed a sigh of"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"vi Bilderberg Diary relief as the train pulled away from Brussels. When the pictures were printed, Jim and I went through them to try to identify the people in the phot os. Although I had only taken photos for a day and a half, I had gotten a lot of g ood shots of who was attending Bilderberg 2000. 1 also came away with a much better understanding of what Bilderberg is. At the next year's meeting, in June 2001, we found ourselves on Sweden's west coast when Bilder berg gathered at a hotel near Stenungsund, near Gothenburg. Bilderberg had le arned from the exposure at Brussels and probably chose the Quality Hotel Stenungsbaden because it had a perimeter fence. On the first day, while I was taki ng pictures from private property adjacent to the hotel with the permission of the owner, Swedish police seized me and drov e me six miles into the wilderness and left me on the side of the road amidst farmer s' fields. I could see that with a large number of Swedish police helping Bilderberg, this was not going to be any easier than Belgium. On the other hand, thanks to our efforts, in Sweden there was more media coverage of the secretive group's meetin g than in any other country I have seen. We found articles about Bild erberg in the Swedish press unlike any we had seen before. When Jim and I arrived at our hotel in Gothenburg there was a welcoming committee from several independent magazines. At the hotel gate through which the Bilderberg cars had to pass there was a group of witnesses from a variety of organizations. Patriotic Swedes were aware that Bilderberg was meeting and were very intere sted to know who was attending and what was being discussed. I spent the next three days high up in a tree or on a breezy bridge overlooking the hotel waiting for a Bi lderberger to come into view. When the group went for an afternoon cruise I got some excellent photos of the assembled group of Bilderberg 2001.

Compared to the event in Swed en, Bilderberg 2002, held at a Marriott hotel in Chantilly, Va., was a very lonely event. Just a few miles from Washington, there wa s not a soul to be se en. It was completely different than in Europe. The Westfields Marriott is surro unded by trees, but Bilderberg 2002 didn't need much security because, apart from us, nobody seemed to care that the most powerful people in the western world were meeting in secret for three days at the hotel. We met only one young man who had taken a bus from Phoenix, Ariz., to witness the Bilderberg meeting in Chantilly. As a long-time reader of American Free Press and Spotlight he was very aware of the importance of what was happening in the Marriott hotel that weekend. As usual there was no coverage in the U.S. media except for Jim's stories which were published in American Free Press. But we know the U.S. press kn ew about the meetings. I personally photographed NBC News chief forei gn affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell dropping off her husband, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, at that year's meeting. The last Bilderberg conference I covered with Jim was the 2003 event held at the Trianon Palace Hotel at Versailles, near Paris, France. While the French press was a no show , two Norwegian journalists from the business daily Dagens Naeringsliv covered the event. On the edge of the grounds of the famous palace of Versailles, I was able to get photos of the assembled Bilderberg group when they went for an afternoon tour of the palace.

The Bilderberg group is an organization of political leaders and international financiers that meets se cretly every spring to make global policy. There are about 110 regula rs—Rockefellers, Rothschilds, bankers, heads of international corporations and high government officials from Europe an d North America. Each year, a few new people are invited and, if found useful, they return to future meetings. If not, they are discarded. Decisions reached at these secret meetings affect every American and much of the world. This book examines the history and actions of the se cret group that calls itself Bilderberg and the efforts of one courageous reporter— James P. Tucker Jr., who has been trailing Bilderberg for nearly 40 years—to focus the spotlight on the acti ons of what many have called \"the world's shadow government.\" This is his story. Bilderberg: Its Long & Secret History The roots of Bilderberg go back centuries, when international moneychangers would secretly ma nipulate the eco nomy to enrich themselves and enslave ordinary people. The Rothschilds of Britain and Euro pe have met secr etly with other financiers for centuri es, as did the Rockefellers of America."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"2 Bilderberg Diary In the beginning, the Rothschilds were \"Red Shields\" because of the ornament on their door and the Rock efellers of Germany were \"Rye Fields\" because of their crops. One of the most significant such meetings took place in the spring of 1908, led by Sen. Nelson Aldrich of R hode Island, whose family married into the Rockefeller clan , accounting for the late Gov. Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller's given name. It was held on Jekyll Island off the Georgia coast. The late B.C. Forbes, editor of Forbes magazine, reported what transpired at this meeti ng of the world's wealthy. With Aldrich were Henry Davidson, of J.R Morgan and Co.; Frank Vanderlip, pr esident of the National City Bank; Paul Warburg, of Kuhn Loeb and Co., and A. Piatt Andrew, assistant secret ary of the treasury. They emerged from this secret meeting with a plan for \"a scientific currency system for the United States.\" They had the power to pressure Congress into establishing the Federa l Reserve Board, a private group of bankers who meet to sh ape the money supply. But in 1954, the intern ational financiers deci ded that the world had become so small, and their interests intersected so often, that they must have regular, annual meetings. That year, they met at the Bilderberg Hotel in Holland, and took the name \"Bilderberg\" for themselves. They have met behind sealed-off walls and armed guards at plush resorts ever since. Secrecy prevailed briefly, until the late journalist, Westbrook Pegler, exposed Bilderberg in 1957. However, Chatham House rules have remained in effect, wher eby meetings are held privately and attendees are prohibited from ta lking on the record about what transpired. Pegler devoted two of his na tionally syndicated columns to Bilderberg in April 19 57, although he did not know the group's name.

Since, the publisher and associate editor of The Washington Post, Donald Graham and Jimmy Lee Hoagland, respectively, have been regular participants. All network news channels have attended these meetings. All promise to abide by the rule of secrecy. Bilderberg, which typically meets at a luxury resort near a small town, provides a short \"pre ss release\" to the local paper—preferably a weekly.

When giant newspapers and broadcast outlets say they do not want the word \"Bilderberg\" to appear, the pressure on Associated Press is obvious; they are the biggest customers, paying far more than a small- circulation local paper. Small-city papers depend on AP for all out-of-town news, even for their state legislative cove rage. They run hard to stay ahead of the city council and high school football team . Unless informed directly, they have no knowledge that Bilderberg exists. While Bilderberg denies its meetings are significant, the record proves otherwise. The now defunct Spotlight wrote advance stories on the end of the Cold War, the downfall of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister of Britain and of President George Bush the Elder's breaking of his pledge to not raise taxes based on what transpired among Bilderbergers. More recently, while the mainstream media in 2002 was asserting that the invasion of Iraq would come by late summer or early fall, American Free Press reported that there would be no aggression until 2003. The war began in March 2003. Learning what transpires at Bilderbe rg can provide a glimpse of what the future holds. Bilderberg: Conspiracy 'Theory' or Fact? When international financiers, he ads of state and high government officials are exposed conducting public bu siness in secret, they whimper about \"conspiracy theories.\" But I will soon provide you with names and telephone numbers you can check yourself.

They will report nothing. Collaborating newspapers, including The Washington Post, The New York Times and Los Angeles Times, will report nothing. They keep their vows of silence so fervently they allow th eir own newspapers to be factually wrong rather than risk exposing Bild erberg. Participants will deny that Bilderberg even exists. You will almost never read the word \"Bilderberg\" in these newspapers or hear it on national network news, which have all participated in vows of secrecy. (Because of extensive coverage in Europe in recent years, The Ne w York Times published a \"humor\" commentary after the 2004 meeti ng in Stresa, Italy, denouncing \"conspiracy\" theories.) Chasing Bilderberg for 28 years has been the most exciting assignment of my lifetime newspaper career, the first 20 years of which were in the mainstream press. I had held some high positions—night editor of the now defunct Washin gton Daily News, editor of the Martinsville (VA) Bulletin, copy edit or at the Richmond (VA) Times- Dispatch and, finally, assistant news editor of the Akron (Ohio) Beacon- Journal. So a moment that came in the sp ring of 1975 is forever photographed in my mind. I was being interviewed by Willis Carto for the job of starting a newspaper to be called The Spotlight. Carto was officially \"treasurer\" of Liberty Lobby but he was more than that. He was Liberty Lobby, having founded the populist institution in 1955. He asked me what I thought of Bilderberg.

The materials contained not only the institution's newsletters—Liberty Letter monthly and"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"6 Bilderberg Diary Liberty Lowdown —but al so copies of the columns of the late, great newspaperman, Westbrook Pegler , who had first observed these mysterious meetings from afar a nd written about them in the 1950s. I was dumbfounded. How could I have spent my adult life with Associated Press, United Press Inte rnational and other newswires ticking at my ear, and serve on newspapers with far-flung staffs across the globe and not know of these characters? The Daily News had been a Scripps- Howard newspaper; its headquarters on the same third floor as the News's staff. Scripps-Howard covere d the world. I edited its copy for the News and had much communication with the Washington staff of Scripps-Howard. And that was the year —1975—that started my career as the only reporter who, for three decades now, has worked earnes tly to hound this secret meeting of the world's most powerful bus inessmen, powerbrokers and politicians and expose it to the light of public scrutiny. I soon learned that Bilderberg had recruited the media moguls into its secret conspiracy and dictated an absolute bl ackout in the United States. There was much Spotlight-generated and now American Free Press- generated Bilderberg publicity in Europe, but the near total blackout in the United States persists. Bilderberg is a powerful assembly of the world's leading financiers, industrialists and pol itical operatives. It includes such internationalists as banker David Rockefeller, heads of state in Europe and high offici als of the U.S. government— White House, Defense, State, Congress and others. Past U.S. presidents—Bill Clint on and Gerald Fo rd—have attended Bilderberg. But a sitting president cannot because White House paperboys are given his complete sc hedule each day—the size of a paperback novel, accounting for every minute. Even his schedule on \"working vacations\"—the only kind a president takes—is provided. There is no way a president can disappear for thr ee days without accounting for himself and if a sitting president"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Preface: What Is Bilderberg? 7 attended Bilderberg, even the contro lled media would be hard-pressed to explain away the president's absence from the limelight, hidden behind the locked gates of th e Bilderberg meeting. High officials of The Washington Po st, The New York Times, and Los Angeles Times and of all three major networks have attended Bilderberg many times, on the promise of secrecy , to report nothing and to not use the word \"Bilderberg.\" Except for some minor, inconsequential accidents in which the word \"Bilderberg\" has sudd enly appeared in print—after all, you can't call a staff meeting and tell all 900 New York Times news staffers about the blackout—the promise has been kept. The only time \"Bilderbe rg\" ever appeared in The New York Times came when one of the luminaries died at a meeting and the obituary writer, and his editors, innocently le t the word slip through. And, as mentioned earlier, The New York Ti mes responded to a blizzard of publicity and criticism in Europe with a \"humor\" story in 2004 reassuring the world there is no \"conspiracy.\" Four times the word slipped into The Washington Post—which has been represented by suc cessive publishers since Bilderberg's first meeting under that name in 1954. One came in a worshipful profile of Bilderberg luminary Vernon Jordan. In another instance, in a multi-part profile of then-Vice President Dan Quayle, the fact that Quayle had attended a Bilderberg meeting was mentioned in passing, buried deep in one of the articles in the series. (Not incidentally, the Post mentioned that David Rockefeller himself had been quite impressed with Quayle at that meeting.) Another came in an inside-page st ory celebrating how Austria was being economically penali zed for holding a fair election in which Joerg Haider's Nationalist Party enjoyed significant gains. In a laundry list of important meetings that had been scheduled fo r Austria, but changed, the Post mentioned Bilderberg—but said it had been moved to France when it actually would take place in Belgium, outside Brussels."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"8 Bilderberg Diary Then, in a Dec. 3, 2004, obituar y for Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, The Post said: \"He is also credited with establishing the Bilderberg Group—a secretive annu al discussion forum for prominent politicians, thinkers and businessmen, which he chaired from 1954 to 1976.\" The Post made no mention of its own longstanding involvement in the secretive international body. And in 2005, Virginia Gov. Mark Warn er's attendance at the Bilderberg meeting in Germany was written up in a series of reports across Virginia. Warner is a Democratic governor in a state that has gone Republican since 1952, with the exception of 1964 when Lyndon Johnson trounced Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.). His presence signals that the global elite considers him to be a potential president. Bilderberg and its brother group, th e Trilateral Comm ission, are good at picking future presidents. Actuall y, they like to own both horses in a two-horse race. Here is the line-up: Jerry Ford, Bilderberg; Jimmy Carter, Trilateral; President Bush the Elder; Trilateral and Bill Clinton, Bilderberg. Warner, respecting the rules of secr ecy, kept the trip off his public calendar. When an Associated Pr ess reporter heard an off-guard comment, Warner admitted attending but refused to divulge information. AP was given the American Free Pre ss edition that carried Bilderberg details and the list of participants. How can such a near-total blackout be imposed on what were, not so many years ago, 1,800 daily newspapers (now down to 1,200) in the United States, all of which thump their chests as protectors and practitioners of freedom of speech? When the major newspapers are intimidated, it affects all papers and the wire services. Mo st of the nation's news papers depend entirely on the wire services fo r news outside their own cities—state, national and world. If Bilderberg is not on the wires, the local editors are as ignorant as I was for 20 year s. They work hard to stay ahead of the city council, high school football team and all local news. Similarly, small broadcast outlets depend on"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Preface: What Is Bilderberg? 9 their wire services and network affili ates which, in turn, also depend largely on wire services. Wire services operate like farmers' co-ops. Big-city newspapers pay many times as much for the services as small-town papers. When they tell the wire services to keep silent on Bilderberg, the pressure is obvious. Newspaper participants go to any length to keep their vows of silence. It's a heady experience for these journalists to clink cocktail glasses with the rich and famous. They do so at the price of the credibility of their own newspapers. A recent example came at the Bild erberg meeting in the spring of 2002 at Chantilly, Va. At that time, The Washington Post and the entire mainstream media were predicting th at the U.S. invasion of Iraq would come \"in the late summer or early fall.\" But, to appease Europeans who opposed the invasion, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld assured Bilderberg that the invasion would not come until the next year— 2003. Jimmy Lee Hoagland, associate edito r and columnist at the Post, has escorted his publisher to B ilderberg for years. He had to hear Rumsfeld's assurances. But he let his own newspaper continue with the \"late summer or early fall\" prediction, knowing it was wrong. He would not even steer his paper stra ight on the pretense of getting the information elsewhere—too much risk. But covering Bilderberg is more than a spring adventure—it is a year- round operation. Two of the most significant Bilderberg exposes occurred during the \"off-season\" and in unlikely ways. In March 1985, The Washington Post ca rried a few lines of type in its society section, noting that David Rockefeller and Henry Kissinger had a meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev, head of the then-Soviet Union. The Post described the meeting as productive, and that was all. A check of the Soviet-controlled media revealed enormous details. Rockefeller and Kissinger had told Gorbachev they were sympathetic with the economic stress suffered by the Soviet Union and"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"10 Bilderberg Diary could arrange for U.S. financial aid to its puppet state of Poland if Americans could observe a \"free elec tion.\" So it was arranged that Poland would have a \"freely elected\" national legislature with only one- third of the seats reserved for the entrenched Communist Party. Could you imagine a U.S. election where one-third of Congress is reserved for only Democrats or Republicans? Another one-third of the seats were reserved fo r the Peasant Party, a wing of the Communist Pa rty that had voted in lockstep with the Kremlin's dictates for 40 years. But when the \"election\" was over, young Turks in the Peasant Party seized the moment and voted with members who were truly freely elected to form the government, ousting the communist regime. The fires of freedom then swept Eastern Europe, bringing an end to the Cold War. Based on this information, the still-flourishing Spotlight did an advance story on the downfall of comm unism in Europe, long before the mainstream media had a hint. Another significant event occurred when NATO celebrated its 50th anniversary in Washington in Ap ril 1999. Kenneth Clark, former chancellor of the exchequer in Br itain and a longtime Bilderberg luminary, agreed to what he thought wo uld be a \"sweetheart session\" with a small group of reporters at the Na tional Press Club.' I asked the first question, pointing out that he would be attending the Bilderberg meeting in Sintra, Portugal, and inquired about the agenda. The question stunned him.

All of this, he said, would come \"sooner, rather than later.\" Every year, as Spotlight and now AFP have pursued Bilderberg, readers have learned what to expect in adva nce of the mainstream media because those who know are under a vow of silence and the others are ignorant. It was Spotlight readers who turned the beam of publicity on Bilderberg in the European media. That year, 1994 , we learned early that Bilderberg would be meeting near Helsinki, Finland. European readers inquired if they should alert the me dia and the answer was a quick \"yes.\" The result was extensive press and broadcast coverage that stunned Bilderberg luminaries. Bilderberg has suffered extensive coverage in Europe since. However, media and s ecurity control is so tight in the United States that readers have had only limited success in exposing Bilderberg here. Having built a track record of history confir ming our reports, the Washington press corps has become intensely interested in what it cannot report. After each Bilderberg m eeting, 1 carry a load of copies of American Free Press containing Bilderberg reportage with me to hand out to reporters who can' t report. Many tell me directly that they consider the mainstream cover-up a scandal. I normally dislike it when a questi on is answered with a question. But I have found it effective, over the year s, to respond to reporters who say Bilderberg is just a golf outing with: \"If 120 film stars, or 120 professi onal football play ers, gathered secretly each year, in a sealed-off resort patrolled by armed guards, you would bust your [expletive deleted] to learn what transpired.

It was not until 1983 th at I began personally covering Bilderberg and it has been a lot of fun ever since. Over the course of those seven years, I accumu- lated reams of information from multiple sources, of which I have compiled in this first chapter. The Trilateral Commission was created in July 1973 at the suggestion of Rockefeller during \"an earlier Bilderberg meeting,\" Forrest Murden, a spokesman for the organization, admitted in a telephone interview with me on Dec. 14. Murden, who headed a public relations firm Forrest Murden Co., said he handles \"administrative duties\" for the Bilderberg organization in the United States on an \"at-cost\" basis. Its offices occupied the fifth floor of a building at 39 East 51st St reet in Manhattan, New York. Jimmy Carter was recruited for the Trilateral Commission immediately in 1973 because the new organization viewed the obscure Georgia governor as a rising star, Murden said. The Trilateral Commission is an Asian-oriented counterpart to"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"14 Bilderberg Diary the Bilderberg organization (which has been oriented toward the interests of the nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) and there is a heavy cross-membership among those two groups and the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). The CFR is broadly viewed as the U.S. auxiliary to the Bilderberg group. Murden mentioned the overlapping memberships in the three groups while agreeing that characterizing the Trilateral Commission as \"an Asian Bilderberg group\" was \"analogous\" because the Japanese are included. Murden's link with Bilderberg was first uncovered by investigators from the now defunct Spotlight in New York. In two telephone interviews, Murden acknowledged hi s role, which incl uded handling the arrangements when Bilderberg meet s in this country, although the group meets annually in different countries. Murden said, in both interviews, that \"Jack Heinz,\" head of the Bilderberg Steering Committee, was pr esent in his office. Murden was referring to the now-deceased Henry J. Heinz II, head of the Heinz pickle-and-ketchup fortune, who had attended Bilderberg meetings for 21 years. Murden first suggested that Heinz participate in the interview. In the second interview, Murden said Heinz was \"in conference.\" Heinz's son Henry John Heinz III was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976 after spending $2.9 million—a record— of his own money. Sen. Heinz later died in a plan e crash, and his widow, Theresa, married Heinz's Senate colleague who ultimately became the 2004 Democratic nominee for president, Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts. Murden said the next Bilderberg meeting was to be \"next spring in England\" but the exact site a nd date were not yet fixed. Murden acknowledged that the Bild erbergers discuss policy matters affecting the entire world.

But Murden said he \"can't document\" the direct results because of the secrecy agreement under which"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Bilderberg: The Early Years 15 the Bilderbergers meet. Murden took the official line in his unusually candid interview when pressed on whether policy discussions, which included heads of state, such as U.S. Secretary of St ate Henry Kissinger and other high government officials, violated Loga n Act prohibitions against private citizens trying to influence foreign policy. Murden insisted that such \"discussions\" are co mmon and legal. The most significant comments by Murden were his confirmation that Carter was sought out by the Tril ateral Commission as a potential political star and that Rockef eller was the power behind the establishment of the Trilateral Commission. Observers of the world intrigues have long speculated that the Bilderberg organization was the umbr ella with the CFR and Trilateral Commission as ribs, citing the heavy cross-membership referred to by Murden. Rockefeller was first named as a major force behind the Bilderberg organization by Liberty Lobby in its publication, Liberty Lowdown, in 1971 and again in 1975. He was pub licly suspected of extending his world manipulations through the Trilateral Commissi on. Murden's comments are the first known public confirmation of this by the Bilderbergers. When Carter first rose from obscu rity, the preliminary observation by opposing Democrats in the early primaries was that he never ran low on funds. It soon became known that he was an early recruit of the Trilateral Commission. There was no plausible explanation for the high-powered Trilateral Commission to recruit the unknown Georgia governor. In 1973, Carter was totally unknown outs ide Georgia, and the state was far more widely recognized as the home grounds of former Gov. Lester Maddox and the late Sen. Richard Russell. Thus, Murden's confirmation has weight that Carter was recruited as a \"rising political star\" (the se words were suggested by The Spotlight and accepted by Murden) and not because of some desire to expand the input of the commission.

This would explain Carter's ever-flowing fountain of funds. Murden himself suggested, during the second interview, that the Dec. 20 edition of Time magazine be examined for a \"better understanding\" of the Trilateral Commission. Henry Grunwald, then Time managing editor, was a Bilderberger. He consistently collaborated with Bi lderberg and never broke faith with the group's instructions to suppress information about its meetings. He refused an invitation from Liberty Lobby to be interviewed about his Bilderberg activities. The Time story of Dec. 20 is a sympathetic account of Carter's drawing on both the Brookings Institution and the Trilateral Commission for talent in the new administration. Time reported: \"Historian Arthur M.

It would cost Irvine his $37,000 yearly salary from the Fed if he upset the Bilderberg cover-up, and to some extent, his work ing for the Fed made him part of it.

But Irvine would follow orders: a plum of $37,000 annually was a tidy income for a part-time or no-time job in 1975, in addition to his AIM salary.

The practice of holding \"press conf erences\" was introduced in April 1975 when the Bilderbergers met in Cesme, Turkey. It came only after relentless reporting by Liberty Lobb y's Liberty Letter had prompted respectful stories by United Press International, Associated Press and the Washington Post-L.A. Times wires.

Eliot made the next mistake. Objecting to characteriz ing Bilderberg meetings as \"secret,\" while denying that this meeting had anything to do with the April meeting of the Trilateral Commission in Rome or the upcoming economic summit scheduled for May 28-30 in Williamsburg, Va., Eliot insisted on the term \"private,\" rather than \"secret.\" Many meetings are being held \"privately\" on the subject of world economics, he said, but the Bilderbergers tell everybody about their meetings and do not deserve the \"secret\" label.

But their strategy on behalf of the international bankers was well coordinated with that of their brother group, the Trilateral Commission. As in the Trilateral meeting held in Washington, D.C., on March 31- April 3, 1984, the United States was blamed for the staggering debts of Third World and communist countries on grounds that the budget deficits generate inflation. Enough pressure was exerted at both meetings to block a proposal to put a \"cap\" on interest ra tes on Third World debts, which then totaled $810 billion. Every time the privately owned and controlled Federal Reserve Board hikes the prime interest rate, it adds billions of dollars to the Third World's interest obligati ons. The Fed had hiked the rate by tightening the money supply since the Trilateral meeting in 1984, adding billions to the interest paymen ts the debtor nati ons had to make to the big banks. The proposal to ease th e burden on the debtor nations by putting a limit on the interest charged was quickly rejected by Jacques de Larosiere, managing director of th e International Monetary Fund (IMF), when IMF member-nations met in Ph iladelphia June 4 of that year. \"Capping [interest rates] would detr act from the ability of central banks to facilitate\" repayment of th e debts, Larosiere said during the IMF's meeting. According to three sources inside th e Bilderberg meetings, the idea of limiting interest rates was effectivel y blocked while guilt was heaped on the United States as the culprit of the Th ird World's economic woes to set the mood for pressuring the United States for another bailout by the taxpayers. \"High interest rates in the United States lead to high interest rates around the world and greatly aggravate the precarious international debt situation,\" one paper delivered at the Bilderberg meeting said. \"As interest rates rise, Third World countries find it increasingly difficult to meet the interest payments on their debt.\" All blamed the interest rates on the U.S. budget deficits, setting"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Saltsjobaden, Sweden 1984 29 the tone calling for higher U.S. taxes. \"It's a sham,\" I later told friends. \"They demand higher taxes on Americans so funds will be available for the next bank bail-out while they influence the Fed to boost the prime rate—and their own profits by the corresponding billions—at a time when inflation is low.\" During President Carter's time, bankers blamed high interest rates on double-digit inflation. When inflation was running at 14 percent annually, they pointed out that if they loaned $100 at 14 percent, they would lose because the $114 paid back after a year would be worth only $100. Yet, with inflation down to a 3 to 5 percent annual rate, interest rates were kept high by the Fed. This made it more profitable to make loans to Third World and communist countries that are bad risks rather than to American farmers who offer thei r land and crops as collateral. American taxpayers, in e ffect, guaranteed the banks against losses to the Third World and communist countries. Meanwhile, thousands of American farmers lost their land every year because of the credit crunch.

The fact that it had emerged behind the locked doors of the Bilderberg meeting was not mentioned. \"The proposals for domestic spendi ng and tax chan ges are in two stages,\" Miss Rivlin had told the approving Bilderbergers. \"A short-run freeze on domestic spending to save money quickly would be followed by more basic restructuring of domes tic programs. Similarly, tax changes designed to raise more revenue quick ly through broadening the tax base and a surtax would be followed by a thorough reform of the federal system.\" While the precise percentage of the proposed surtax was not mentioned, it would have to be enough to generate $23 billion more in revenues the first year and increase annually until it produced $108 billion more in 1989."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" Perle of a Man... 1985—Richard Perle, here ap pearing young, full of hair and not so corpulent as he is today, has regularly attended Bilderberg meetings since he first rose to power in the Reagan administration.

My peripheral vision showed that the Secret Service men had taken their eyes off me and were gazing in their assigned directions at the entrance to the lobby. \"Yes, yes, of course,\" I responded to her greeting. \"But first,\" I said, showing great stress, \"where 's the men's room?

My eye fell upon a par ticular nameplate: \"PERLE.\" That would be for Richard Perle, assistant secretary of defense for international security policy. An old colleague, Andrew St. George, had long ago exposed Perle for advocating th e interests of Israel over those of the United States, and his shocking stories were confirmed by the National Association of Arab Americans (N AAA), which used the Freedom of Information Act for much of the de vastating evidence that the NAAA was pursuing in court. So that would be one memento: the \"PERLE\" nameplate went into my pocket. I found that the way to dismiss a challenge is with a question during my strolls; \"The steering committee meeting is tonight, isn't it?\" I had been surreptitiously eyeballing a lineup of brown, stuffed portfolios in the lobby, presided over by two women and watched over by three Secret Service men. Of course , I wanted one, but it would be a chancy thing and timing would be essential. If I were caught, the notes I had taken, and the Perle nameplate, would be lost. I would probably go to jail.

I let two minutes expire, then a pproached the table loaded with portfolios. \"Do you have a portfolio for Sen.

At the time, I was an anti-establishment free-lance writer based in Washington. I had used the pen named \"Harrison Home\" in order to confuse both the Bilderbergers and th eir brother group, the Trilateral Commission, about my identity. Word that I had been found out and that my credentials as a member of the congressional press galleries would be revoked came in an angry phone call from Roy L. McGhee, superi ntendent of the Senate periodical press gallery on June 4 of that year. McGhee said he was acting on a co mplaint by Charles Muller of New York, who heads the Bilderberg staff in the United States. \"They [Bilderbergers] have a right to a private meeting,\" McGhee had screamed. \"None of the other papers carried anything.\" \"This was not a 'private meeting',\" I countered. \"It involves elected officials and other high officials of the State Department and other agencies.\" \"You took Sen.

The congressional press galleries give creden tials to publications, not individuals, so a writer serv ing several will be technically representing one.

Sometimes witness lists an d texts are in limited supply and provided only to those with credentials. Sometimes you sit on the floor instead of at a table if you are uncredentialed. But the press galle ries also amount to a hu ge taxpayer subsidy for many Washington journalists who are car eful to avoid offending senators or congressmen. For many reporters, the galleries are a free office with telephone and various and sundry office supplies. Compare that to renting a small office for more than $1,000 m onthly at the National Press Club, paying for telephones, furniture and supplies. The subs idy amounts to a huge payoff. Journalists, explained a sympathetic colleague in the press galleries, are permitted credentials \"at the sufferance of Congress.\" The same colleague, who remains anonymous to protect his own green, plastic I.D. card, advised surrendering the card to avoid an intimidating, harassing investigation. \"They have an investigative staff with little to do, and they're eager to have somebody to investigate,\" he said.

The encounter with the guard had made him a believer in the conspi racy of international elitists.

All staffers had been admonished by the ho tel management to remain silent on anything that transpired during the Bilderberg meeting. They would be summarily fired for the slightest violation. One informer lived in the small villa ge of Telfs at the bottom of the mountain. The other \"commuted\" th e few miles from Innsbruck and was interviewed there.

We drove to the gate, handed the guard a note written on the same Bilderberg memo paper, and fled down the mountain. The note was addressed to Muller, who ha ndles Bilderberg's administrative affairs in the United States from his New York office. Muller had worked feverishly to keep the meeting time and location secret.

The major newspapers in the United States have, over the years, had executives attend the secret sessions with the promise that nothing would be published. Sources inside the secret society of international financiers and political leaders said their clandestine meeting this year emphasized the need to bring down Mrs. Thatcher because of her refusal to yield British sovereignty to the European superstate that was to emerge in 1992. Mrs. Thatcher was denounced for her \"provincialism\" and \"nationalism\" for insisting that Britain would retain control over who enters the country instead of accep ting passports of the super-state and not surrendering sovereignty over monetary policy and other issues to the super-government. Political leaders in Br itain who partic ipated in the Bilderberg meeting were instructed to attack Mrs. Thatcher politically in an effort to bend the \"Iron Lady's\" will. It was sugges ted that enough public pressure could be generated to force her to yield her nation's sovereignty to save her own government. The plan for a European super-state with no trade or travel barriers among the nations of Western Europe and Britain, and, ultimately, a common currency—the euro—had been on the Bilderberg agenda for years. It was viewed as a major step toward their goal of a world government and creates a favorabl e climate for the huge banks to consume the small ones and for huge, international conglomerates to absorb small firms. Otherwise, the Bilderberg meeting followed, as is customary, the policies that were hammered out by the Trilateral Commission at its April meeting in Paris.

They also talked of how the Unite d States would be \"chastised\" at the economic summit of the seven l eading industrialized nations in June of that year. There, all global economic problems were to be blamed on the U.S. budget deficit; a nd tax-hike calls were to be the centerpiece of international demands on the United States.

In their 1983 meeting near Mont real, Bilderbergers extracted a pledge of $50 billion from the Reagan administration to be paid out over his presumed eight years in office. This was confirmed to me by Pierre Trudeau, then prime minister of Canada, at the subsequent economic summit in Williams burg, Va. As the years passed, Reagan more than made good on his commitment. The IMF's quota increase meant the United States would pay 20 percent, or $12 billion. The 151 ot her member nations would make up the rest, spending pennies for every American dollar. Bilderberg's discovery of the environment came as no surprise. The Trilateral Commission had issued the report mentioned earlier for members to use in pressuring their governments to spend huge allocations of taxpayers' funds on environmental projects worldwide. These projects would be profitable to the brokers, bankers and other financial manipulators who happen to compose the bulk of the secret groups' membership. The Trilateral report called for members to use a wartime analogy in urging quick billions to be spen t. When a nation's security is threatened militarily, it said, nations instantly marshal all their resources. The same should be done in a global fight to save the environment, according to the report.

Despite the apparent obstin ence of Bush and Sununu, the Bilderberg men remained complacent—even smug—in their confidence that the U.S. governm ent would follow their dictates. \"I tell you, we do not have to worry about George, either on the environmental project or on the tax i ssue: he will do all he can in his own way,\" said a slightly built Am erican, overheard while reassuring a man seated next to him during one of the meetings on May 12. The American told his European colleague that \"domestic politics\" require Bush to do \"certain things but \"it will come out all right—you'll see.\" The American made several references to \"problems with the American right,\" a subject that was much on Bilderbergers' minds that year. The presence of the vice president at the meeting was bad news for those who had been urging Bush to dump Quayle from the 1992 ticket. It meant that the international elite took seriously Bush's pledge to keep him on the ticket an d the prospect th at Quayle might be elected president in 1996. Meanwhile, the global agenda of the Bilderberg group and the Trilateral Commission was clear. Taxes, in some or many forms, were to be increased for Americans.

What the Bilderberg group intend ed was a global army at the disposal of the United Nations. In ad dition, it has been a longstanding goal of Bilderberg for the UN to become the world government to which all nations will be subservient. Crucial to making the UN a strong world government, by \"osmosis,\" in the words of some Bilderberg pa rticipants, was to bestow it with \"enforcement powers.\" \"A UN army must be able to act im mediately, anywhere in the world, without the delays involved in each country making its own decision whether to participate, based on parochial considerations,\" said Kissinger during one of the forums. Kissinger and others expressed pl easure over the conduct of the Persian Gulf war, stressing that it ha d been sanctioned by the UN, at the request of Bush, before the issue was laid in front of Congress. The fact that the president made his case to the UN first, when the Constitution empowers only Congress to declare war, was viewed as a significant step in \"leading Am ericans away from nationalism.\" If Americans can be persuaded to surrender war-making decisions to the UN, and let their young men die wearing a UN uniform, fighting under a UN flag, \"parochial nationalism\" in Britain, France and elsewhere would disappear, Bilder berg speakers said. \"The Persian Gulf venture has advanced the cause by years,\" one speaker said. Americans, so reluctan t to commit their flag to foreign battlefields after 58,000 perished in the ill-fated Vietnam War, have had their attitude \"completely turned around,\" he said.

In their circumspect wa y the Bilderberg partic ipants claimed credit for influencing the president to go to war. And, they promised each other there will be \"more incidents\" for the UN to deal with in the years ahead. The Bilderberg group and the Trilateral Commission can set up \"incidents\" on schedule, they said, but in less direct words. The words \"within five years\" were heard repeatedly. Another important step toward a strong, recognized and accepted world government is taxing power. The UN has always operated on \"assessments\" paid by each country. But that didn't stop the internationalists from proposing multiple schemes to tax Americans. At its April 1991 meeting in Tokyo, the Trilateralists called for a UN levy of 10 cents per barrel of oil coming from the Persian Gulf. It was to be sold as \"temporary,\" lasting only long enough to rebuild Kuwait and feed the Kurds until they are back on their feet. The Bilderbergers approved of the move by their brother group. They knew that once people get used to a tax, it never is repealed. Ten cents a barrel would have a negligible effect on sales at the pump, and it could be extended worldwide \"with appropriate increases\" in the years ahead. Part of the philosophy of a \"direc t\" tax by the UN was already in effect, they had noted with sati sfaction. At the time, the UN was demanding 30 percent of Iraq's oil pr ofits from \"reparations,\" and the United States had obligingly taken the position that it would be increased to 50 percent. From the sum total of all things said, the Bilderberg strategy emerged: Start the tax by imposing it on a newly established \"bad guy\" who must suffer, and use the revenue for such humanitarian"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"74 Bilderberg Diary purposes as feeding the Kurds. Keep the initial tax so low that the public is unaware that it is levied. Then kick it up. Under the secret Bilderberg plan discussed at this meeting, as the UN acquired its own global army and direct taxes as another source of revenue, the world could be di vided into major \"regions\" for convenience of administration. Already Western Europe was preparing to be \"without borders\" in 1993. By 1996, it was to have a single currency. Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union would eventually be included. The Soviet Union was to remain intact and the Captive Nations were to remain forever subjugated. Dealing with 15 more small states w ould be too complicated. Bilderberg pressure on Congress to pass the free trade treaty with Mexico was another step towa rd establishing the Western Hemisphere as one of the \"regions .\" Free trade with Canada was the first step and Mexico the second. Thereafter, all Latin American nations were to be included. In the years ahead, a one-currency movement for the Western Hemisphere was planned, identical to that of the European Economic Community and, ultimately, a world government with world currency. Also, on the global economic front at the time, Bilderberg pres- sure on the Uruguay Round of talk s on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was bein g felt. Even as Bilderberg was meeting with 120 of the world's leading financiers and political leaders, GATT negotiators announced a \"new spirit of cooperation\" and determination to reach an agreement. Rockefeller and Kissinger prai sed actions by Gorbachev in 1991, whom they coached closely and to whom they had easy access. In that year, Gorbachev had announced that he needed a $100 billion gift from the West—mostly from the United States—to sur- vive.

A \"loan guarantee\" was almost synonymous with \"gift.\" Frank Murray, a journalist of stature long known to me from his years with the defunct Washington Evening Star, wrote in The Washington Times that it was the first \"of what is e xpected to be a series of steps [to] ease trade and give economic aid to Moscow.\" The White House also reiterated its opposition to move s in Congress to send any aid directly to the rep ublics of the Captive Nations, thereby strengthening their bid for freedom without shoring up the crumbling walls of communism within the Soviet Union. Billions of American tax dollars would be used, in the year ahead, to ensure the survival of the Soviet Union, with its domination of the Captive Nations perpetuated. On June 8, 1991, the second day of the three-da y Bilderberg meeting, Secretary of State Baker was in Geneva, promising American dollars to Gorbachev and reaffirming U.S. abandonment of the Captive Nations. But while it was known that high of ficials of the State and Defense departments and the White House attended Bilderberg, it could not be learned if Baker was among the few arriving late, hidden behind a screen of guards. The guards and other staff all had the same response to shouted inquiries about anyone's presence: \"I don't know.\" Gorbachev, of course, wanted to keep the Captive Nations enslaved as part of the Soviet Union. The United States was enabling him by taking the position that anticipated future billions of American tax dollars must go, through the World Bank and IMF, to the Kremlin to avoid the \"complications\" of dealing with 15 states that had regained their sovereignty."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"76 Bilderberg Diary The Bilderbergers endors ed this sellout just days before the United States' annual Captive Nations Week, once the occasion for tolling church bells and prayers for freedom of enslaved peoples.

Among my collaborators were Dr. Hans-Ulrich Grimm, a reporter for Der Spiegel, and Jorge Briller, head of a five-man television team from Baden-Baden. There were many more, but getting their names was difficult as they were busy exchanging information in limited English. One whose name I never got served as a translator. He said he had worked for a German-language newspaper in Chicago for two years. There were only two approaches to the Badischer Hof, at each end of a horseshoe driveway. Television crews guarded each entrance as Grimm and I patrolled both. Both entrances were guarded from mid- morning to 9 p.m. We took turns retiring to the brasserie to rest our feet, buy each other coffee and compare notes.

Of course, on this first full day in Baden-Baden, and with the Bilderberg meeting starting early the next day, the guards who had stopped me inside the preceding day were outside, in large numbers, augmented by German police.

Kissinger reported on a shocking speech made by the UN secretary general that year, Boutros-Boutros Ghali, to the American Association of Newspaper Publishers at UN headquarters in New York in early May. The publishers' newspapers covered up the story. The UN Security Council must have a permanent force that can be deployed anywhere in the world, inst antly, to \"protect the peace\" and \"ensure human rights,\" the secretary general told the newspaper publishers. This force must be al lowed to intervene \"at the local and community levels,\" the UN leader told the American publishers. What is \"especially gratifying,\" Kiss inger said, is that the publishers showed no reservations about the pros pects of UN forces landing in the United States and im posing the UN's will. Members of the American Association of Newspaper Publishers are publishers of America's appr oximately 1,600 daily newspapers. (Today, there are only 1,200 daily pape rs.)

He also revealed another previously unknown and startling development: At a meeting called the Stockholm Initiativ e in April 1991, 36 global leaders called for a \"wor ld summit on global governance ... similar to the meetings in San Francisco [establishing the UN] and at Bretton Woods.\" Half the signers were \"incumbents, including prime ministers from Chile, Norway, Sweden and Jamaic a,\" he said. Among the signers, he said, was former U.S. President Jimmy Carter.

The concept of a world government is widely accepted in Eu rope, so winning the su pport of Americans is high on the Bilderberg agenda.

The American military must be available to the UN \"on call,\" he said, and subject to the direction of the world government, rejecting the explicit constitutional provision that the president of the United States is commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Washington Post columnist Jimmy Lee Hoagland's attendance at Trilateral meetings was kept secret, as are the many years of Bilderberg participation by the Wash ington Post Co. chairman at the time, Katharine Graham. Hoagland was praised for his efforts to persuade Americans to surrender national sovereignty to a world government. Hoagland assailed \"a pr evailing view of national sovereignty\" in The Washington Post on April 23, 1992. \"The United States today suppor ts . . . the duty of the United Nations to intervene in what were once considered the internal affairs of member nations,\" Hoagland wrot e approvingly. Hoagland praised Bush for his \"willingness to help define an international right to intervene\" in the affairs of a sovereign nation. The fact that Sir Brian Urquhart, former UN undersecretary for \"peacekeeping,\" was quoted in The New York Times calling for a new UN \"police force\" with no objections by American leaders was also noted. \"The unraveling of national sovereig nty seems to be a feature of the post-Cold War period,\" Urquhart said approvingly.

Ex-USSR Republics Welcome The Cold War was barely over in 1992 when Bilderberg boys planned to exploit the rich natural resources, cheap land, property and labor in the former Soviet Union. For the first time, forces of the former Soviet Union had a major presence as the Bilderberg organization gathered in Evian for its annual secret meeting on global strategy. The larger than usual number of attendees had caused the Bilderbergers to spill over into two hotels, the Royal and the Ermitage in this resort area. It also prom pted the tightest security of any meeting so far. There was some speculation Go rbachev, the former Soviet president, would make an appearan ce, although there were difficult logistic problems in secretly whis king him in and out without the world knowing. In any event, the complicity of Gorbachev and other leaders of the former Soviet Union, and those fro m the former East Bloc nations, loomed large in Bilderberg's secret plans. The international financiers and po litical leaders gathered in Evian to exploit the immense natural resour ces of the former communist bloc, which is why they were brought into the World Bank and IMF. The World Bank and IMF not only send American tax dollars overseas to provide money for the fo rmer communist countries to buy goods produced by Western capitali sts exploiting cheap labor there, but also are the means of cont rolling their new economies and old natural resources.

Behind the guarded walls of the elite Nafsika Astir Palace Hotel, situated high on a hill a few miles south of Athens, the secret Bilderberg group once again plotted to exploit the rich natural resources of the former Soviet Union and Indochina. Also high on the Bilderberg agenda was establishment of a new, huge United Nations bureaucracy on the envir onment, so the industrialists can reap immense profits from new technology to clean the world's air and water. Bilderbergers also celebrated the co llaboration of one of their own, President Bill Clinton. \"It's really a direct message to us through the newspapers,\" said Bilderberger Dwayne Andreas, the ch airman of billion-dollar agri-giant Archer-Daniels-Midland Company at th e time, referring to reports that Clinton promised to sign the Rio Treaty, which calls for billions of American tax dollars to be circulated around the world in the name of a \"clean environment.\" \"Yes, and he's doing it early in his first term,\" said Andreas's companion. \"George [Bush] wanted to wait until his second term to make a few changes to pacify the American right.

Bush had been a longti me member of the Trila teral Commission, which has interlocking leadership with Bilderberg. Clinton had been a Trilateralist for seven y ears and was promoted to the Bilderberg in 1991. Thus, the world sha dow government owned both presidential candidates in a typi cal win-win race. \"If George [had had] a second term , he [might] have moved on health care and new taxes, since he would not have been worried about reelection. And he certainly would have signed the Rio Treaty, possibly with a little political posturing by insisting on nitpicking changes,\" Andreas said. \"But we would not have fast action, as with Clinton,\" said the other. The Rio Treaty calls for establishing a UN commission on the environment. Americans will pay most of a multibillion-dollar program to clean the air and water, preserve topsoil and prev ent erosion in undeveloped countries. The rationale is that Americans consume and pollute more than th e rest of the world. Adding a new UN agency to police the environment among once- sovereign nations also ad vances the Bilderberg go al of turning the UN into a de facto world government. Thus , Bilderberg also celebrated public acceptance of a permanent UN army, in which Americans would fight under a foreign commander who would be accountable only to the Security Council, not the presid ent or Congress. They found it significant that Americans remaining in Somalia were serving under a Turkish general under UN command. Contrary to the Constitution, the president was not their commander in chief.

This too was important to the Bilderberg goal of a world government. A third \"regional government\" is to be formed in the Pacific Rim, and the UN is to be the seat of the world government. To exploit the natural resources of the former Sovi et Union and in Indochina, Bilderberg agreed to establish a \"High Council\" of 12 members. A committee was named to select the 12. Members must be \"of such status that they have instant access to heads of state and parliamentary leaders throughout the world,\" a Bilderberg speaker said. The 12 will pressure Western nations to send more and more billions to the former Soviet Union. They will claim credit for this help in talking with the leaders of the former Soviet republics. The 12 will then demand of the republics the right, at an absurdly low price, to extract oil, gold and othe r precious metals. \"The gold in the ground, the oil undrilled, do you no good,\" the 12 will argue. \"Cooperating on this will mean that we continue to use our influence to get more financial assistance from the West.\" It was a typical Bilderberg project: Use public funds—the lion's share coming from American taxpayers—to \"p ay\" for the right to extract oil and precious metals from the former Soviet Union and reap immense profits.

A look back: Clinton, Trilateral an d Bilderberg; Bush, Trilateral; Reagan, received the Trilateralists at the White House and had his vice president (Bush) address their meeti ng; Carter and his vice president, Walter Mondale, both Trilateralists; Jerry Ford and his vice president, Nelson Rockefeller, both Bilderberg; and Richard Nixon, banished from the White House for bucking Bilderberg. So while the Bilderberg-Trilateral arms of the world government are used to owning both horses in a two-horse race, the presidential election of 1996 had them nervous. If Clinton were nominated—and they were working feverishly to make sure he was unchallenged within his own party (even though Sen. Bill Bradley [D-N.J.] belonged to Bi lderberg, too)—they will own one candidate. But would they own the Republican ? The leading contenders, Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), had never been known to participate in Trilateral or Bilderberg. World Leaders Follow Orde rs; Bow to Bilderberg Two goals of the Bilderberg group, decided at the internationalists' latest meeting in Burgenstock, Switzerland, were: • Establishment of a world supe rfund to remove economic risks"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Burgenstock, Switzerland 1995 105 to international financie rs who invest in poor c ountries to profit from slave wages, the absence of government-imposed fringe benefits and cheap real estate; and • Getting British Prime Mi nister John Major out of office or back in line—fully supporting complete political integration of Europe. World leaders at the economic summ it of the seven industrialized nations, or G-7, were responding directly to instructions from Bilderberg when the group called—in a communique written before the leaders even gathered in Halifax, Canada—f or an \"emergency financing mechanism.\" The \"mechanism\" would double poor nations' borrowing power from the IMF to $50 billion. The collapse of the Mexican peso in 1994 was the oft- cited reason for the interna tional bankruptcy fund. Bilderberg's demands, as called fo r in the G-7 communique, were officially adopted when the IM F's 178 member states met in Washington in September. Clinton insisted to the U.S. pub lic that the action would not touch American taxpayers. But the United St ates guarantees 20 percent of what member states take out in \"special drawing rights\" and the other 177 nations put up the rest. Using the IMF has an historic ring. In May 198 3, meeting in Montebello, Quebec, Bilderberg extract ed a secret pledge from Reagan for $50 billion to be sent to Third World and communist c ountries over eight years. That pledge was more than kept. It became known to the public as the \"Brady Plan.\" Then, as now, the IMF was the conduit for shipping American tax dollars to uncreditworthy nations to protect the immensely profitable risk-free investments of international financiers. The Bilderberg problem with Major had not only an historical ring but a paradox. Bilderberg engineered th e downfall of Thatcher in 1989 because she resisted totally surrendering British sovereignty to the European Union. In 1995, Major was in the gun sights for the same reason."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" June 26, 1995—Press Club Private Meeting: Lady Margaret Thatcher, known to some as the \"Iron Lady,\" said she considered it a \"t ribute\" to be denounced by Bilderberg at the 1989 meeting in Spain, assailing those who would surrender national sovereignty to international institutions. Bilderberg engineered her downfall when she resisted the euro as the common currency for Great Britain and bucked other European Union demands. She was replaced by her own Conservative Party with a political trapeze artist, John Major. 106 Bilderberg Diary"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Burgenstock, Switzerland 1995 107 Up until that point, Major performe d as a Bilderberg lapdog. He couldn't move Britain into the Eu ropean Union far enough and fast enough. Establishing a European Union, American Union (NAFTA) and an Asian-Pacific Union is critical to the Bilderberg goal of dividing the world into three great regions. But the rising tide of nationalism in the United States had crossed the Atlantic and patriots in Britain opposed further entanglement with the European Union, specifica lly, the proposed common currency. Backbenchers shouted their disapproval. Under this pressure, Major, chosen by Bilderberg to champion the surrender of Britain into the superstate, backed up. He said Brit ain may never agree to a common currency, which would surrender an important symbol of sovereignty. So the Bilderberg that made Major became the Bilderberg that unmade him. History often repeats itsel f, but mankind rarely learns from it. Thatcher Trashes Bilderberg: 'Global Plantation Will Fail' Lady Thatcher both denounced and ri diculed Bilderberg in a private talk with me at the end of June in 1995. \"It is an honor to be denounced by Bilderberg,\" Lady Thatcher said. \"Anyone who would surrender the sovereignty of their country ...\" her voice trailed off as she shook her head in disgust. \"They are a stuck-up set,\" Lady Thatcher added. She appeared optimistic, however, that Bilderberg would fail in its goal of establishing a world government by 2002. \"They said 'nationhood should be suppressed, ' but there will never be a new world order,\" Lady Thatcher said. Lady Thatcher's comments were ma de privately to me and another guest at a reception prior to a speech to a full house at the National Press Club in Washington on June 26, 1995. In her formal address, Lady Thatcher denounced the European Union (EU) as a \"superstate.\""},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"108 Bilderberg Diary \"I reject the notion that we sh ould effectively cease to govern ourselves,\" Lady Thatcher said. She denounced the proposed common cu rrency even as EU leaders were meeting in Cannes, France, to set up a 1999 deadlin e for monetary integration. In Cannes, they decided that each nation would call the new currency by its traditional name with the prefix \"euro\"—europound, eurofranc, etc. Lady Thatcher warned against \"passing on more powers to a Brussels bureaucracy\" and a European court that \"can overrule our country\" and those who would \"destroy nationho od and national sovereignty.\" It is wrong to \"create one nation from 15 countries speaking 13 languages,\" Lady Thatcher said. \"The Euro pean superstate is an empire, and empires collapse.\" Unforgiving Internationalists Show Clout When Major resigned as head of the Conservative Party, placing himself in position to be ousted as prime minister of Britain on July 4, 1995, it stunned the world but came as no surprise to Bilderber g—or me. Bilderberg had called for Major' s political scalp less than two weeks earlier in Burgenstock, Switzerland, because he appeared to be growing soft in his commitment to surrendering all British sovereignty to the European Union. Paradoxically, Major had succeeded Lady Thatcher when Bilderberg called for her ouster as prime minister for the same reason: Resisting subjugation into the European Union. For years, Major was Bilderberg's tool and fool. Britain coul d not be swallowed into the European Union fast enough. But the new wave of nationalism that swept the United States in this past year crossed the Atlantic, and many in parliament became \"Euro-rebels.\" Under pressure from British patriots, including many in parliament and Lady Thatcher, Major tried to wa lk a tightrope—satisfying Bilderberg while pacifying supporters who wanted to retain sover-"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Burgenstock, Switzerland 1995 109 eignty. The rope broke. Even as Bilderberg was gathering atop Burgenstock Mountain, Major was saying that Britain was unprepared to join in the European common currency by the year 2000 and that \"the time may never be right.\" This position brought some applause by \"Euro-rebels,\" because abandoning national currency in exchange for a new European Union currency is one of the last great acts of surrendering national sovereignty. That was enough for Bilderberg. The world shadow government cut his political tightrope, and Major was tumbling down. Major tried to grab the dangling rope and climb back into Bilderberg's arms when Lady Thatcher and other Conservative Party \"Euro-rebels\" pressured him for a declaration th at Britain would never adopt the common currency. He refused. Bilderberg threw the rope back, and Major was bound for oblivion. Bilderberg made him and, despite hi s years as a faithful lap dog, Bilderberg unmade him. But the world shadow government wa s forced to forgive him, given the other choice to lead the party. Th e only challenger to emerge had been John Redwood, a Thatcherite who bitterly o pposed surrendering British sovereignty to the European Union. Consequently, the Bilderberg group was forced to embrace its Prodigal Son again. There was still more bad news for Bilderberg: Redwood's 89 votes, and 12 ballots, caused more trouble for Bilderberg. Major's 218 votes fell far short of the 230 British politicians he needed to be secure at 10 Downing Street. One-third of his own Tory members of Parliament opposed him and a merger with the European Union.

Bilderberg can't win a battle of ideas by democratic means. But in that same year, another Bi lderberg goal was achieved when Vice President Al Gore and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin signed a $15 billion oil expl oration deal in Moscow. Oil fields will be developed off Sakh alin Island, which had been stolen from the Japanese following World Wa r II, in Russia's Far East. Exxon invested as much as $15 billion and Japanese firms also shared in the deal.

Creative Editing by CBS on Trilats I never expected CBS to give me 20 minutes—about th e length of the interview—on its nightly network newscast on May 2, 1995, but I had hoped for more than one sentence: \"The conspiracy is to have a global government in which the elite will control the entire world and the unwashed multitudes will have a higher loyalty to the world government than to their own provinces such as the United States.\" CBS's Anthony Mason had asked about the Trilateral Commission. But all of that fell on the cutting r oom floor. This was not live, but taped in advance. Might CBS have chosen some more interesting sentences? Mason had seemed particularly interested in the interlocking leadership of the Trilateralists and Bilderbergers, which I doubt he had ever heard about. The role of Rockef eller, Kissinger and others in both groups was explained. The participation of the major newspapers—Washington Post, New York Times, Los Angeles Times and others—in both groups, on vows of secrecy, was explained. I referred Mason to Graham, boss of The Washington Post, who participates in both groups, for further"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Burgenstock, Switzerland 1995 111 information. From the Trilateralists' own report s, I read Mason quotes in which the United States is denounced as an \"individualistic\" soci ety where it is difficult to \"groom the elite\" for leadership roles. While the Trilateralists seem worried about their \"elite's \" ability to be elected in the new mood of populism in America, I pointed out to Mason that they have had success with their own members in the past. Presidents Carter, Bush and Clinton were all Trilateralists and members also fill high posts in every administration regardless of party, Mason was told. But all of that remained on the cutting room floor. Big Wig of Bilderberg Left Speechless Outsiders are not supposed to know what gets said at secret Bilderberg meetings, as this June 1995 confrontation I had with Kissinger shows. \"Dr. Kissinger, I attended the last Bilderberg meeting when a white- haired European told you, forcefully, that Americans must understand that foreign aid was in th eir own interest,\" I said. Kissinger almost dropped his scotch and wate r, and his mouth fell open, speechless probably fo r the first time in his life. Other journalists, who had covered Kissinger over the years, later said they had never before seen him lose his poise. Kissinger, who came to this count ry as a young boy but has always affected a heavy German accent, finally found his voice, but he momentarily forgot his accent. In plain English, Kissinger said: \"I'm not saying it didn't happen; so much is said at these meetings. . . .\" His voice trailed off, and apprehension filled his eyes. I gave him more information about what had transpired within the Bilderberg meeting as Kissinger sq uirmed uncomfortably, his eyes alternately bulging and contracting."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"112 Bilderberg Diary \"Actually, Bilderberg is not as gracious to me as they are to you, Dr. Kissinger,\" I said. \"They don't invite me and sometimes they are somewhat inhospitable.\" \"I know,\" Kissinger murmured, having recovered his German accent but still looking furtive. \"I will be with you at Bilderberg again this year, as usual,\" I said. \"I know,\" Kissinger murmured. But he seemed less than enthusiastic. Truth Eludes Major Media Over the years, the mainstream media's cover-up of Bilderberg has always had me asking: Are th e members of the Establishment media simply stupid and incompetent, or are they part of the con- spiracy? On Monday, May 2 2, 1995, I sent a news release to all of the major media in the United States informi ng them of one of the most impor- tant meetings of the year—the se cret annual Bilderberg session. Not that they didn't know about it already. In 1995, the Bilderberg group met at Burgenstock, Switzerland, June 8-11. Among the attendees were representatives of the Establishment media. Said media did not report on what was said in the secret session. That year, as in years past, one of America's most powerful media moguls—Katharine Gr aham of the Washington Post Co.—attended. So did I. Mrs. Gr aham was invited; I was not. So along with the press release sent to The Washington Post, I asked Mrs. Graham to consent to an interview on the subject of the Bilderberg group. The following is the text of my letter. May 22, 1995 Katharine Graham Chairman, Executive Committee The Washington Post Co.

Having spent 20 years with daily newspapers—the Washington Daily News, Richmond Times-Dispatch and Akron Beacon Journal, among others—I cannot reconcile the Post's cover-up of the Bilderberg group by any standards of journalism I ever learned at the slot-man's knee. Can the fact that you, and high offici als of The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, the news magazines an d others in journalism, attend the meetings on a vow of sile nce—a pledge to reveal nothing—be defined as anything but a conspiracy?

Hunkering down in an unwelcome b lizzard of public ity, Bilderberg developed a new strategy for ac hieving its goal of a world government. Behind lines of mostly invisible security at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Leadership Center, Bilderberg set forth its plans dur ing its annual gathering from May 30 to June 1 in 1996. For openers, the Global Planta tion wanted to employ new prop- aganda techniques to counter su rging patriotism in the West. New \"scientific studies\" warned of impending world disasters: Refugees fleeing farms for lack of \"sustainable gr owth\" would lead to famine in cities. Also, hysteria over water and air pollution was to be generated. One speaker said: \"People of the world, but especi ally stubborn Americans, who want to cling to every last shred of sovereignty, must be made to understand that we all breathe th e polluted air and drink the foul water; the air and waterways know no borders and have no loyalties. \"To say that a supranational ag ency under the UN must address this problem is stating the obvious,\" he added. \"It is equally obvious that the UN must have final arbi tration over immigration issues"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"120 Bilderberg Diary as the refugees grow in number.\" And another: \"Since we last met [in Burgenstock, Switzerland] we have seen the problem of nationalism increase, not abat e, in Europe but more so in the United States. If reforms are to succeed, we must convince the middle class that supporting new powers for th e UN is a patriotic duty, to save his country from na tural disasters.\" Also listening and promising to report nothing were these journalistic prostitutes: Conrad Black, who owns more than half of Canada's newspapers; conservative leader William F. Buckley, Jr., editor-at-large of National Review; Paul Gigot, The Wall Street Journal; Margarida Marante, identified as a \"TV journalist\"; Peter Job of Britain, who heads Reuters; Andrew Knight of Britain, who heads Zionist billionaire Rupert Murdoch's media conglomer ate, News Corporation; Norman Podhoretz, editor of Commentary, the \"neo-conse rvative\" voice of the New York chapter of the American Jewish Committee; Toger Seidenfaden of Denmark, editor of Politiken A/S; and Walter Veltroni of Ireland, editor of L'Unita. The presence of two leading \"conser vative\" voices within the ranks of the plutocracy, the aforementioned Buckley and Podhoretz, indicates that Bilderberg intends to continue flexing its influence over the \"loyal opposition\" in the ranks of the so-called \"Republican right\" and the \"conservative movement.\" Buckley and Podhoretz are charged with suppressing populist and nati onalist grass-roots rebe llion within the GOP as represented by Buchanan's maverick presidential candidacy. At last year's Bilderberg confab in Burgenst ock, Switzerland, the official \"guest conservative\" was Buchanan's leadi ng critic, William Kristol, publisher of Murdoch's Weekly Standard. The gathering of the international elite heard more: \"Make [the masses] understand that, if we fail to have a strong global government, empowered to act effectively, quickly and decisively, the disaster that will eventually strike this Earth will impact them, too, and waving a flag will be meani ngless.

Establishment Acts on Bilderberg Orders A few days after the 1996 Bilderbe rg meeting ended in Canada, one- worlders quickly put toge ther plans to strengthen the Global Plantation. What a coincidence. Moving swiftly to advance the Bild erberg agenda unve iled in King City, Ontario, international manipulato rs moved to make housing and food an \"international right\" and expand NATO as the UN's standing army. Ultimately, these two m oves were to merge in to a situation where the UN would have final authority—enforced by a world army—which would allow it to enter the United States or any nation, and whereby it could arbitrarily ship taxpayer funds from the Western nations to poor countries. These mutual missions have the we ight of the White House behind them. Clinton had sent his senior advisor George Stephanopoulos to the secret meeting in Cana da to receive his orders. Even as the UN-sponsored Habitat II conference in Istanbul, Turkey, was deciding that housing is a \"right\" for all people, UN functionaries were calling for a \"food summit\" in Rome in November 1995 to proclaim a full stomach a world \"right.\" Once it was decided that adequa te housing and food are the"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"124 Bilderberg Diary rights of every world citizen, it woul d become the proclaimed \"duty\" of the United States and other in dustrialized nations to implement these \"rights.\" While these dual campaigns would advance the visionaries' dream of a world government, there were immediate and immense profits in store for the Rockefellers, Rothschilds and other international financiers involved in these secret sessions. While American taxpayers and th ose of other Western nations provide housing and food, these international en trepreneurs would be hailed as statesmen for \"helping\" the poor countries as they build factories and other enterprises. As your tax dollars provide food and shelter, the rich get richer by paying slave wages in poor countri es that are unencumbered by such \"fringes\" as pensions, paid vacations and health insurance provided by many domestic companies. The Food and Agricultural Orga nization, a UN agency, would work toward achieving a \"food for all\" goal in November, it said in a statement. \"Support from the United States has been extremely important\" for both food and housing \"rights,\" said Hilmi Toros, who was par- ticipating in the Istanbul summit. \"They have given us their full support.\" Agreement on the housing \"right\" in Istanbul was applauded by the United States. \"For the first time [the agreement] translates [housing rights] to the common leve l,\" said Michael Stegman, assis- tant secretary of Housing and Urba n Development and alternate head of the U.S. delegation.

This was achieved when American troops wore blue helmets in Bosnia, serving under a European commander who reported to the UN Security Council, with the Congres s and president having no voice.

Clinton also talked of a form al congressional \"apology\" for slavery as Bilderberg was meeting. At the Bilderberg conference, a speaker who was an American with dark hair and complexion, and who app eared to be in his 50s, likewise hailed the new world order: \"In th e years ahead as white Americans, African-Americans and Asian-Ameri cans marry and bear children, racial and cultural distinctions will blissfully blur,\" he predicted. \"As this biologica l process proceeds , the public will come to more and more accept a world without borders, a world where the nation- state is a relic of history,\" he said. These words keyed into the subject of worl d ecology, a popular cause in recent years with Bilderberg and the Trilateral Commission. Dirty water and dirty air know no borders, and people everywhere are growing to accept the fact that a supranational agency under the UN is \"a necessary tool to pres erve spaceship Earth,\" he said. Another speaker, a Eu ropean in his 60s, al so took up the racial banner, citing a recent Gallup Poll showing a high acceptance of integration in the United States . The poll found 61 percent of white Americans favor intermarriage with blacks. In 1958, only 4 percent of whites favored intermarriage with blacks, and the figure grew to 45 percent in 1994.

Despite voicing this in the poll, many middle class white Americans would most likely neithe r marry a black person nor vote for a black man for president, another speculated during a discussion period. \"But it is tremendous pr ogress that so many whites feel compelled to say so, anyway, and Am erican public opinion is moving swiftly away from the nationalist mentality,\" he said. \"Let them spend their lives watching television and eating French fries—we'll make them visionaries in spite of themselves,\" said another, to approving laughs and smirks. To help promote the dual goal s of internationalism and the establishment of NATO as the UN's wo rld army to be deployed anywhere on Earth, Gen. Colin Powell, the only bl ack man to serve as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was recruited into Bilderberg ranks at this meeting and attended as a \"star guest\" at the Renaissance Pine Isle Resort. Thanks to constant major media promotion and attention, Powell's popularity among Americans has remained in the astounding 90 percent range since he became a pub lic figure during the Persian Gulf War. \"The [first] Gulf War was worthwhile just to create Powell,\" a Bilderberg participant said. Powell's marriage to Bilderberg is a natural. Years ago, when he was still chairman of the Joint Chiefs, I had confronted Powell on the issue of American soldiers serving under foreign commanders. Powell also describes himself as a \"Rockefell er Republican.\" He defended the unconstitutional practice. Powell told his new Bilderberg coll eagues that he would strive for world \"harmony\" and \"a strong UN and NATO.\" \"Colin Powell will be of great value in helping 'fringe' Americans overcome their obse ssion with national sovere ignty and to accept the world as it is going to be,\" said Stephanopoulos, who was attending a Bilderberg meeting for the second time."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"130 Bilderberg Diary Some concerns were expressed ab out supporters of America-first advocate Pat Buchanan and France-firs t champion Jean-Marie Le Pen in France. The presence of Spotlight re aders and \"right-wing extremists\" picketing outside the gates of their gathering place also unnerved the Bilderbergers. \"These pockets of resistance to social justice are a problem and must be dealt with seriously,\" said one, who spoke in a low voice believed by inside sources to belong to Rockefelle r. \"But they can be isolated and contained; a whole new generation is emerging that is immersed in the vision of a world with pea ce and prosperity for all.\" Historically, the generations of Ro ckefeller and his nephew Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.), who also attended, have a special definition of \"prosperity for all.\" It means lowering the American standa rd of living while lifting that of poor nations until the world economy is leveled off—while increasing Rockefeller power and fortune. Others stressed the need for more immigration to the United States from poor Latin nations to both relieve their economic pressures while supplying cheap labor to American industry. For this, NAFTA was toasted and the call of their Trilateral brothers for a UN agency to arbitrate immigration issues was endorsed. Under such a \"supranational\" agency, America could be compelled to accept an undesirable immigrant. \"Some of us will be surprised at further progress we find next year,\" an American said.

Because \"poor nations\" were exempted from the immensely expensive burden of reducing emissions by 15 percent by 2010, economists warned, many thousands of American jobs would disappear as industries fled the country to avoid the costs. In an unlikely alliance, the Natio nal Association of Manufacturers (NAM) and the AFL-CIO warned th at exempting China, Korea and other \"developing nations\" would lead to a flight of U.S. jobs. Many NAM members are small businessmen, not to be confused with international corporations represen ted in Bilderberg. \"Millions of Americans would lose their jobs and American manufacturers would take a severe hit in the world marketplace,\" NAM President Jerry Jasinowski told a Senate Finance subcommittee June 26. Clinton had promised the UN a specific commitment in time for a December 1997 meeting on global warming in Kyoto, Japan. The president also embraced the guilt complex imposed on the United States by the UN, acknowledgi ng that this country has 4 percent of the world's population but produces more than one-fifth of all greenhouse gases. Using an unprecedented scare tactic, the president argued that if the United States fails to act, 9,000 squa re miles of Florida and Louisiana will disappear, agricultur e will be crippled, mult itudes will die of heat stress and infectious diseas es will ravage the land. \"That was a blatant attempt to s care Americans into surrendering their national sovereignty,\" an anonymous State Department official told this reporter later that year.

I would take an elevator to the fifth floor where the Murden Co. of New York is situated (they handle Bilderberg logistics when it meets in North America) and where they had qu arters for the advance staff. I had made many \"fly-bys\" in the search for information. Knowing Shadow would be up on the next elevat or, instead of getting off, I would go back down to the lobby, wait a moment and make another fifth- floor fly-by without Shadow. I couldn't help teasing Shadow. While having lunch, or coffee, I would stick my nose in my bag as if I were making a phone call. I knew Shadow was listening. \"Listen carefully, Shadow,\" I would say, \"in a moment, I'm going to say something profound and you don't want to miss it.\" This always brought a frozen moment .

In separate conversations, three told me they had been forced to sign waivers and undergo background checks. They also told me that any employee with less than a full year's service could not work during the Bilderberg days.

Whether he knew it or not, Shadow and his accomplices we re successful in scaring away some—but not all—Bilderberg sources. Bilderberg took the direct a pproach on the same evening. \"Mr. Tucker, may I have a word with you?\" We sat together on a bench outside the resort's main restaurant. \"My name is Jim Penn, head of hotel security,\" said the man, who was of average build with dark hair and appeared to be in his 30s. \"I'm sure you are doing a good job,\" I said affably. \"Bilderberg is very unhappy that you are here,\" Penn said. \"That's no surprise,\" I replied. \"I've chased these kids all over Europe and North America for many years and they never warmly welcome me.\" \"I understand your mission, but my employees are very upset that you ask them to observe Bilderberg and pick up papers sometimes out of a trash can,\" Penn said. \"And you promise them rewards for spying.\" \"Look, Mr. Penn,\" I said. \"I would ne ver forgive myself if I were the reason Bilderberg ruined an employee.

Penn seemed edgy and glad to conclude the conversation. \"Thank you, Mr . Tucker.\" \"Good night, Mr. Penn.\" In reviewing events in my mind there was only one of the numerous employees I had tried to develop as sources where I had suggested checking papers in a trash can. With others, I mentio ned that papers may be left on tables or on a bar. I knew who had tipped off Penn. I briefly thought of retribution by prof usely thanking the employee for his promises of help within earshot of Shadow, but quickly abandoned the idea as not Christian. The next day, I let Shadow report that I was being good by talking to employees, nodding my head and jo tting a note. When Shadow would trot up to them, they could accurately say that I was asking directions to here or there, not discussing Bilderberg. It was nice to let Shadow feel that he had finally won a few. In the meantime, I developed two more sources. I psyched myself to awaken about 3 a.m. on the fourth day, the day the remnants of the unwashed multitudes (us non-Bilderbergers) had to be out of the hotel by noon. I dared not leave a wake-up call for fear of awakening Shadow, too. I had left a wake-up call for 5 a.m. as usual. I left my room in shirtsleeves and open collar, as one unable to fall asleep.

I encountered Shadow No. 2 on leavi ng my room about 6, to go to the bottom floor gift shop for The Atlanta Constitution, the only paper on sale. The new Shadow made little attempt at discre tion; he trailed me to the gift shop and back to the elev ator, hitting the but ton for the fifth floor—Bilderberg's floor. I hit No. 3 for the lobby and restaurant floor. Shadow 2 followed me into the restaurant and was seated several tables away, joined by a man in a dark suit whom I had casually talked to the day before. \"Good morning, Mr. Tucker,\" said the man in the dark suit. \"Good morning,\" I responded. Doubl e confirmation for Shadow 2: Shadow 2 was on the elevator as I retu rned to my room, getting off at the same floor. A few moments late r, I swung my door open and saw Shadow 2 leaning against the wall, 30 feet to my left. \"Am I paranoid or could you be following me?\" I inquired. \"Yes,\" he answered. \"I'm checking out soon, and as you know, I'll be checking into the Hilton,\" I said. \"Will you be joining me there?\" \"I might.\" \"Well, bear with me a few minutes,\" I told Shadow 2. \"As soon as I pack, we'll go to the fr ont desk and check out.\" Shadow 2 looked a bit confused, but nodded. \"Come on,\" I told Shadow 2 as I emerged with suitcase and typewriter. \"No thanks,\" I told him, \"I 'll carry my own stuff because an old man like you must be tired from al l your standing.\" That was, of course, a response to an offer that Shadow 2 never made, but it was fun to keep him edgy."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Lake Lanier, Georgia 1997 137 \"Those Bilderberg kids take themse lves seriously,\" I said, continuing the affable tone.

Bellhops arranged free transportation to the Hilton, a mile away. I sat down on the bench outside, awaiting the shuttle. \"Won't you sit down here, Shadow?\" I asked. \"Surely an old man like you is tired from all that standing .\" Shadow, still looking bewildered, shook his head. \"Christians are always concerne d about people's well-being,\" I explained in a tender, lo ving voice, \"even scum.\" \"Good bye and get some rest,\" I said, boarding the shuttle.

Clinton Acts Quickly on Bilderberg Agenda Following that year's Bilderberg meetings, I wondered if Clinton's rush to carry out the agenda of the shadowy globalist group was just coincidence—or was it a conspiracy? In 1997, the Clin ton administration had acte d speedily on the dual goals outlined at the la test Bilderberg meeting: eliminating racial and ethnic distinctions and letting NATO forces patrol the world as the UN army. Just days after a Bilderberg participant said intermarrying means \"racial and cultural dist inctions will blissfully blur\"—leading Americans to accept a \"world without borders,\" Clinton picked up the theme from the oval office. \"We want to beco me a multiracial, multiethnic society,\" Clinton told a group of black journalists. \"This will arguably be the thir d great revolution—to prove we literally can live withou t having a dominant European culture,\" Clinton said. Clinton then went to California to celebrate because the state was about to lose its ma jority-white status. \"Within the next three years here in California, no single race or ethnic group will make up a majority of th e state's population,\" Clinton said. \"A half century from now, there will be no majority race in America.\" Bilderberg orders to Clinton had been transmitted officially by Samuel Berger, the assistant to the president for national security affairs at the time, who represented the White House at the secret meeting of the world's elite. Clinton was also given un official fill-ins by hi s wife Hillary, the only first lady to ever attend a Bilder berg meeting, and Stephanopoulos."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Lake Lanier, Georgia 1997 139 Mrs. Clinton's presence was kept off even Bilderberg's own \"confidential, not for circulation\" list of participants. But her presence was confirmed by me at the Lake Lanier Islands, Ga., meeting site. In Washington, the White House relu ctantly confirmed her presence, although the mainstream press obeyed orders not to report the fact. While no previous president has u ttered such radical comments, the campaign to deny America her heritage and culture is well entrenched in the educational system. Under threat of withholding federal tax dollars, states had been bullied through \"Goals 2000\" and other programs to adopt textbooks and courses that denounce American settlers for \"genocide\" against Indians and in many ways demean the Founders. Clinton had named a panel of left-w ingers to a race \"commission\" even as Bilderberg was meeting. Its chairman, historian John Hope Franklin, since spoke to st udents at Duke University. Similarly, the secretary of state at the time, Madeleine Albright, was quick to begin conditioning the public mind to accept the Bilderberg claim that, under agreements allo wing its expansion, NATO was no longer confined to defending Europe but could patrol the Earth as the UN's standing army. In a guest \"global viewpoint\" comm entary for the Los Angeles Times Syndicate (whose executives particip ate in and cover up Bilderberg), the secretary of state wrote of NATO's \"quest for stability in Europe— and beyond.\" That one little word \"b eyond\" has great signi ficance for the United States and the world."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":" Rothschilds Attend ... 1998—Turnberry, Scotland: Evelyn de Rothschild, chairman of NM Rothschild and Sons, attended that year's meeting.

Although moderately di stracted by the new nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan, Bilder berg concentrated on meeting goals it set on the road to world government: • Establishing a global court that would be superior to the U.S. Supreme Court and to the t op courts of all nations; • Pressing British Prime Minister To ny Blair to have the political courage to drag his country into the European common currency, the euro; • Pressuring Congress into approving $18 billion to make interest payments to international ba nks that made bad loans to uncreditworthy countries on the a ssurance that taxpayers would make them good. At this year's Bilderberg meetings, the British prime minister had been summoned to shuttle back and forth from the summit of the eight industrialized countries held 450 miles away in Birmingham, England, at the same time—by design. Blair was hardly treated as a head of state. He was lectured severely for failing to bring Britain into the common currency, which was phased in beginning Jan. 1 of th at year. Blair assured Bilderberg that Britain would join, but he had to revolve \"political"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"142 Bilderberg Diary problems\" because \"there is a surge of nationalism at home.\" \"You're a Maggie Thatcher in long pants,\" a German told Blair. This was a crude reminder that Lady Thatcher had been dumped as head of state by her own Conservative Party—on Bilderberg orders—and replaced with trapeze artis t John Major, for the same reas on. \"Helmut Kohl [the German head of state at the time] never flinched\" in pressing his country to join the common currency, the German told Blair. \"He may lose this election b ecause of this. You know Germany has a problem with nationalism. But Helmut stood firm.\" Blair turned and walked away. There was much discussion a nd optimism among Bilderberg participants about a June meeting of the UN in Rome, to draft a treaty establishing a permanent Internationa l Criminal Court (ICC). Unlike the present World Court, the ICC would have enforcement power and could impose its decisions globally. \"Will America's nationalists give us trouble about the court treaty?\" asked one. \"I think not,\" replied an American believed to be—but not positively identified as—Casimer Yost, director of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, School of Foreign Service, at Georgetown University in Washington. The American pointed out that in 19 94, the U.S. Senate voted 55-45 to encourage establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC) under the UN. The Senate did so, he said, w ith the full knowledge that the global court, with judges from communist China or other rogue nations, may pass judgment on the United States and individual citizens. \"There was some objection by the Am erican public, but not much,\" the American said. \"Most of them know nothing about it and probably won't.\" \"Unless one of them is sent to jail by the ICC,\" interjected another."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Turnberry, Scotland 1998 143 \"Yeah, then they will notice,\" the American said. The latter exchange wa s jocular and scornful. On expanding NATO, Bilderberg participants were impatient. \"The shortest path to permanent peace is to bring everybody in— including Russia—as fast as practical,\" said one speaker whose comment met with general approval. A question was raised about costs. \"Costs, you ask?\" the speaker res ponded. \"How much did two world wars, Korea, Vietnam and the [firs t] Gulf War cost Americans? Peace is far less expensive.\" To ensure \"permanent peace throughout the world requires a strong enforcement mechanism, which means keeping the expanding NATO intact but under UN direction, for whic h there is a precedent to which none except rabid nationalists objected,\" the speaker said. The \"precedent\" referred to was UN forces in Bosnia, where American soldiers were issued the UN uniform and served under a foreign commander who reported dire ctly to the Security Council. Bilderberg participants were again stating that the UN was to emerge as a world government with its own army patrolling the globe, enforcing its will. Bilderberg luminaries expresse d outrage that Congress did not approve the $18 billion for the IMF to bail out the big banks a year a go. \"How could you let your Congress get so out of control?\" asked a Frenchman of an American during informal glass-tinkling. \"It was never a problem before.\" \"Our Congress has a problem we call voters,\" came the answer. \"That's because we have less direct communication,\" the Frenchman said. \"Leaders of your Congress no longer accept our invitations to attend Bilderberg.\" \"Again, the problem is voters,\" th e American explained. \"For years and years, we enjoyed almost total privacy.

Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and a House member—but only after each had announced his retirement. \"We need them back, as the IMF problem shows,\" the Frenchman said. \"But how?\" asked the American. \"Congressmen now consider attending Bilderberg to be political suicide.\" Bilderberg regulars were all accounted for, including Rockefeller, Kissinger and Evelyn de Rothschild, chairman of N.M.

Clinton had sent his usual assortment of administration officials: Marc Grossman, assistant secretary of state; Vernon Jordan Jr., a top unpaid advisor who will report Bilderberg demands directly to the president; Lawrence Summers, deputy secretary of Treasury; and Christine Todd Whitman (R), governor of New Jersey. This was Mrs. Whitman's first Bilderberg meeting, which meant they had plans for her.

A volunteer, who can be no further identified for the sake of his physical and economic safety, had driven me to the rear of this palatial resort at 2 a.m. on May 15. I had scouted out the rear end of Turnberry on th e previous day. The hotel is hundreds of yards away from the back entrance, with a straight road leading to the gate . But it had a waist-high hedgerow parallel to the road. At the time, I decided that my mission should be to use this hedgerow as cover to approach Turnberry. My driver parked about 100 yards up the road with lights out. I got over the wall apparently unobserved. But by the time I had hunkered my way 50 yards up a path, li ghts began to flash and motors roared. I made no further attempts at concealment and ran for the wall. My driver, still with headlights out, quietly pulled the car up to me, and I leaped in. Still without headlights, he took off. His li ghts came on after we were out of sight. By pre-arrangement, we entered a small restaurant and bar, a long walk but short ride from Turnberry. Knowing this was where the Turnberry staff took refuge, I had spent considerable time there earlier that week, developing sources.

On the same day that the president of Yugoslavia at the time, Slobodan Milosevic, accepted NATO's surrende r demand to prevent more spilled blood, including hundre ds of civilians bombed in shopping malls and hospitals, NATO continued its air campaign. Calls were placed from the Bild erberg resort to Moscow and Belgrade. Bilderberg had won the war it had started through its proxies, the UN and its world army, NATO. The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said the war in the Balkans was drawn up by Bilderberg in 1996 and upda ted and finalized last year when it met in Scotland. It cited the Yugoslav edition of the newspaper Vojska. Vojska said an \"independent\" American journalist had exposed the group and identified its leaders. Under Bilderberg's original war plan, it said, the first move was to arrest \"war criminals from among the Serbs,\" provoking a strong reaction that would be used to justify going to war. Unable to provoke a hostile reaction, NATO attacked anyway. Kenneth Clarke, a member of the Br itish parliament (MP) and former chancellor for the exchequer, had call ed for a new \"international financial architecture\" at the 1999 meeting of Bilderberg. The world should have three major regional currencies, Clarke told his Bilderberg colleagues. The first is already on the world scene: The European euro. And Britain will join in the European common currency, he said. Clarke said he would like to see the pound grow weaker to facilitate Britain's entry into the common currency. Clarke is a Conservative opposition member of Pa rliament who joined the Labor Party's Tony Blair, prime minister and fellow Bilderberg member, in calling for the further surrender of British sovereignty to the European Union.

Argentina and Brazil are considering a unilateral adoption of the dollar currency, although there are talks with the Federal Reserve Board. At the time, Clarke said he believed the common currency of the Western Hemisphere would become a reality \"soon.\" He added that a common currency for the Asian-Pacific region must emerge. Clarke told Bilderberg that a ge neration from now people will find it hard believe that the world once had so many currencies, with each nation being identified by its own. Part of Clarke's \"new architecture\" involved establishing \"supra- national agencies\" to handle the ebb-and-flow of the three major currencies of the world. He called for a sort of \"world finance minister\" at the UN. Bilderberg colleagues agreed that the emerging regional currencies, which will be identified with no specific country, will do much to eliminate \"nationalism\" and the \"ant iquated notions of sovereignty.\" Much of this talk came during agenda discussions of \"the New Economy\" and \"Emerging Markets\" at the meetings. Other formal agenda items included the \"Atlantic Relatio nship During a Time of Change,\" \"European Politics\" and \"U.S. Politics.\" For the first time, Russia had two representatives: Lilia Sheviso and Dmitri Trenin, both of the Carnegie Foundation' s Moscow Center. The U.S.-based Carnegie Foundation and o ffshoots have long been an arm of Bilderberg. Jessica Mathews, president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, returned to this Bilderberg meeting. The Russians were assured that more (mostly American) dollars would flow into their wrecked economy th rough such conduits as the IMF and the World Bank.

In the presence of five reporters in Washington, Clarke was sur- prisingly forthright in speaking of th e secret Bilderberg group just before the group met behind closed doors and armed guards in Sintra. Bilderberg drew \"political and business leaders\" for \"informal, off-the- record talks,\" Clarke said. \"There is much talk ab out improving the world's financial architecture.\" One topic, which Clarke said would be discussed, is \"dollariza-tion,\" whereby Argentina and other South American countries would abandon their own currencies in favor of the American dollar.

It appeared in the daily newspapers for all to read, but too many sleep. Until Clinton, pu blic leaders were circumspect in calling for world government. But, mostly unchallenged, the president spoke boldly. In Europe, shortly after the latest Bilderberg meeting, Clinton had addressed a NATO meeting on June 22, 1999. \"Whether you live in Africa, or Central Europe, or any place, if somebody comes after i nnocent citizens and tries to kill them en masse because of their race, their ethnic background or their religion, and if it's within our power to stop it, we will stop it,\" he promised. This follows the public pattern es tablished at the NATO summit in Washington in April 1999 and pursued when Bilderberg met in Sintra, Portugal, in June of that year. NATO celebrated the fact that it defied its own stated mission as a defensive organi zation and, in its only act of war during 50 years, invaded the sovereign nation of Yugoslavia, which posed no threat. At that major summit meeting, NATO leaders said they were now empowered to patrol the world—but only on directions of the UN Security Council.

Early in 2000, Hoagland's staff had said he would not be attending Bilderberg that year. But on May 21, according to Bilderberg sources, the reason became known in a column publis hed in the Post. Bilderberg had long called for Congr ess to approve permanent normal trading relations (PNTR) with communist China, as an important step toward its entry into the WTO and in the creation of a world government. But, on May 21, when he already knew he would not be attending Bilderberg this year, Ho agland broke ranks and questioned whether Congress should approve PNTR now or wait a bit. Bilderberg did not want to wait. Hoagland first made the point that PNTR \"is not a vote about how China's government treats its own citizens.\" This defies the argument by globalists that trade with China will somehow make its government kinder to its people and that another nation's domestic policies are somehow the business of the United States. Hoagland also bucked global elit ist ideology by being concerned that China is a military menace determ ined \"to maintain Beijing's ability to hit American cities with nuclear missiles.\" The Bilderberg-globalist doctrine is to pretend China is no threat and to have no concern about international corporations selling co mputers and other devices that have military applications to the communists. \"Using the national security stan dard, the House sh ould force the administration to pull this legislati on back to avoid defeat and to work to get the strategic context right, as well as the trade details,\" Hoagland wrote.

European Banks Leap to Bilderberg Bidding Just days after Bilderberg ordered interest rates increased worldwide in 2000, the European Central Bank (ECB) responded like a dog to the whistle. The ECB increased its benchmar k rate by half a point on June 8, 2000, in what the Bilderberg-contr olled Washington Post approvingly described as \"an unexpectedly bold move .\" It had been ordered just five days earlier by Bilderberg. Analysts sa id the increase to 4.25 percent on interest on loans to commercial ba nks was unexpectedly high but might help the sagging European currency, the euro. Bilderberg demanded the increase to enhance profits for financial institutions and to increase unemployment by reducing job-creating capital ventures. Higher unempl oyment means lower wages. Announcement of the rate increase came with a technical change in how the ECB conducts business. Inst ead of fixing the rate it charges member banks to borrow, the ECB will set a minimum rate and loan to banks that pay the highest rate. In announcing the rate increase and minimum-rate policy, ECB President Willem Duisenberg ca lled the actions \"accommodative,\" which, in bank double-speak, indicates more rate increases, according to analysts. But, in saying that the technical change \"clears the horizon,\" Duisenberg was indicating that if member banks offered to pay enough above the new minimum, future formal increases could be avoided, analysts said. Either way, bank profits would go up as employment went down. Thomas Mayer of the Goldman Sachs Group in Frankfurt, Germany, hailed the ECB action as \"a bold move.\" Goldman Sachs is always repres ented at Bilderberg.

The ECB routinely recei ves bids from banks for more than 100 times the amount of money it wants to disperse into the system as a means of controlli ng interest rates. Under the new system, more like the Federal Reserve System, they said, successful bidders will have to pay more than the 4.25 percent minimum, forcing the costs of borrowing still higher for businesses and consumers. \"This will permit Bilderberg, through its control of the ECB and ability to manipulate interest rates, to di ctate economic conditions in Europe— whether there shall be high employ ment and prosperity, or economic slow downs and resulting unemployment—whatever suits the selfish motives of international financiers,\" said a high official of the State Department and long-time reliable source.

Bilderberg Loses Blackout Battle Despite choosing a site where the st ate subsidizes the press; where reporters and the public are intimida ted; and where a massive campaign of disinformation was eas ily conducted, we made a significant dent in Bilderberg's blackout attempts in 2000.

Miss Somers and her colleague, Walter DeBock, called their newspaper and remained at the chateau, working on the Bilderberg story. Their work appeared the following day. Meanwhile, other reporters from Britain, who had collaborated with me at earlier Bilderberg sessions, appeared again in Brussels, assuring further exposure. But it was the toughest fight ever as Bilderberg went even beyond its usual extreme efforts at secrecy. It began in Washington as Bilderberg tried to divert reporters to the wrong country. The Washington Post reported the meeting would be in France. Post Publisher Graham knew this was a lie because he attended the meeting near Brussels. Bilderberg knew The Spotlight woul d be on hand when facts about the meeting were released on May 18 , said an angry policeman who was harassing and searching Herbots Didier, who was caught passing out issues of The Spotlight to an eager public. Knowing that they had been uncove red, Bilderberg tried to divert all reporters and supporters to the NATO headquarters in downtown Brussels. They came dangero usly close to succeeding.

Another attempt to hide was by no t taking over the hotel as an organization called \"Bilderberg.\" When I called to make reservations and was told the chateau was completely filled up, I said that I was to attend a meeting of a group called Bilderberg. No such gr oup had made reservations, the hotel said. Later, when Bilderberg shut the place down, they called themselves Bilderberg. And when I—posing as a friendly trooper—asked if the place had been secured for Bilderberg, plainclothesmen said, \"yes.\" My first visit to the Chateau du Lac was as a casual but thirsty tourist. There, an employee explained that sh e would have to stop working after Wednesday but those who remained on the job were required to wear photo-ID badges.

Earlier in the day, Mears had been threatened with arrest by the police if he did not leave even though he was on public property. He didn't and they didn't. But Bollyn had a close call.

The \"lead stalker\" was later identified as Christophe Voet, the hotel's banquet and conference manager. Another was Alain Vanbinst, the food and beverage manager. Later, it was Vanbinst who helped Bilderberg security harass Bollyn on the morning he was checking out. The hotel had angered the few remaining guests, who loudly protested as they checked out that the noisy Bilderberg security setup had kept them up all night. One man refused to pay his bill for lodging because he was unable to sleep. As Bollyn roamed the hotel on the morning he was to check out, he was constantly shadowed.

When checking out as his deadline approached, Bollyn strongly protested his treatment. Hotel person nel apologized profusely. By that time, they were much ex perienced at apologizing.

From inside the resort, a source was finally able to provide me with a hand-copied list of names and the agenda—at great personal risk. Notably absent was Carl Bildt that year, United Nations envoy to the Balkans and host country Sweden's former prime minister. A long-time Bilderberg luminary, Bildt was attend ing a meeting of the Aspen Society— an arm of Bilderberg—in Brussels. Notably present was Mohammed Nashas hibi, finance minister in Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Au thority. He was identified by Roland Rossier of l'Hebdo magazine. Following the meetings, Rossier did an in-depth story of Liberty Lobby and The Spot lights pursuit of Bilderberg over the years. In 2001, Bilderberg was fearful th at the European Union might be coming apart. They had expected Britain to be a full partner and embrace the euro by 2001. A new leader in Italy who planned dramatic tax cuts that would confo und the euro tr oubled them. Further depressing Bilderberg was fear that \"right-wing nationalists\" in the United States would, with help fr om such countries as Brazil, block President Bush's Free Trade Area of the Americas from emerging as scheduled in 2005. In a panic, Bilderberg orde red Europhiles in Britain's Conservative Party to bring particip ation in the common currency to the top of the list of priorities as soon as the expected Labor Party victory in the June 7 elections is official .

While Bilderberg was hiding here, Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, was sp eaking to a Conservative Party rally. \"The greatest issue in th is election, indeed the greatest issue before our country, is whether Britain is to remain a free, independent nation state or whether we are to be dissol ved into a federal Europe. There are no half-measures, no third ways and no second chances,\" Thatcher said at that year's rally. The Conservative Party and its candi date for prime minister, William Hague, had made a deal with the Labor Party to keep the issue of joining the common currency out of the campai gn debate. However, at the time, the Conservatives would publicly rule out the euro only for the duration of the next Parliament. This was acce ptable for the Labor Party and Europhiles in the Conservative Party who were committed to a federal Europe because polls then showed that two-thirds of the British people were opposed to giving up the pound or surrende ring more sovereignty to the EU. The internationalists wanted more time to condition the British mind to accept the superstate and the euro. Lady Thatcher's outspok en opposition, in spite of her own party's admonition, forced Bilderberg to is sue orders for Conservative and Labor Party leaders to bring the euro to the top of the priority list immediately after the elec tion. They didn't want to press the issue early in the face of popular opposition but felt their hand was forced. Bilderberg referred to Lady Thatcher's intervention as \"Maggie's revenge\" because the world's shadow government had manipulated her downfall as prime minister. She had opposed surrendering sovereignty to the EU and joining the common currency. However, the effects of Lady Th atcher's strong, unscripted speech took a comical turn.

The Tory leader said the EU planne d to \"harmonize\" taxes such as VAT, (value-added tax) and broaden it to include books, transport and clothing. \"More and more of the rights and powers of the British people are being signed away,\" Hague said at campaign rallies. Labor and Liberal Part y functionaries rush ed out to denounce Hague's \"scare mongering\" and deny there was a plan to harmonize taxes. EU officials also issued denials. Hague produced a \"leaked document\" from the EU that The Guardian of London described as \"a document on tax priorities which did, as the Tories alleged, envisage harmonization of some taxes, including those governing transferable pensions and environmental taxes.\" In 2001, Bilderberg was fearful that Italy would rip another seam in the EU because of the election of Silvio Berlusconi and his conservative coalition. The Bilderberg-con trolled Washington Post called him \"the biggest challenge yet to the young eu ro currency\" on May 18, 2001. Post Publisher Graham had again attended the Bilderberg meeting that year. Berlusconi, though a multi-millionaire, is far removed from Bilderberg and its agenda. He has pledged dramatic tax cuts which, Bilderberg participants said , undermine the euro.

President Bush was given high mark s for promoting the FTAA, but all speakers expressed disappointment that he rejected the Kyoto Treaty, one of the building blocks of Bilderberg's world government campaign. They also expressed confidence that Bush could be pressed into backing some kind of \"global warm ing\" pact that would enhance UN control of the world. Richard Perle, assistant secretary of defense, then led a discussion called \"European Security Defense Identity and Transatlantic Security.\" Perle had attended Bilderberg meetings on behalf of President Reagan in the 1980s. In 2001, there was debate, but no consensus, on President Bush's plan for a missile shield. Bilderberg participants then boar ded the cruise sh ip Erik— which had a big \"B\" painted on a smokestac k—for lunch and non-agenda deal- making.

Bilderberg Takes to the Sea for Security Fearful that someone would somehow slip through the barricades and peek up their ideological skirts and view their dirty underpinnings, Bilderberg took to the high seas at noon on Saturday, May 26, 2001. As each member of Bilderberg and staff boarded the ship, name tags were observed by security men—one photo badge in one color for actual Bilderberg participants, anothe r color background photo badge for Bilderberg staff and stil l another for employees of the island resort, Quality Hotel Stenungsbaden.

Bilderberg men, including Clarke, hope and expect the Conservatives to lose in a landslide to Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party in the June 7 elections.

While all major polls point to a bi g victory for Labor, many in Britain are angry at losing sovereignty to the EU and the euro is in peril when put to a popular vote. That's why Bilderberg gave orders to Clarke, which he was glad to receive: visit Blair and urge him to bring the issue up immediately, promising strong support from C onservative Party Europhiles. Two years previously, the British were outraged to learn that the European Court had nullified two acts of Parliament. This year, they were outraged when small merchants were tried, fined and threatened with prison for selling produ cts using Britain's tr aditional weights and measures instead of the EU-im posed imposed metric system. Even as Bilderberg was gathering in Sweden, Lady Thatcher was speaking against embracing the euro and the European Union, warning that it cost Britain the sovereignty they had \"fought and died for.\" Blair felt compelled to respond to Lady Thatcher by proclaiming that it is patriotic to embrace the euro and \"s hare sovereignty\" with the EU.

This time it was less of a love-fest, with deep divisions among Americans and the European elite. The issue of American aggression against Iraq was delayed, with the White House agreeing to wait at le ast until 2003, instead of late summer or early fall of 2002, but many issues simmered at this year's secret Bilderberg meeting held at the luxurious Westfields Marriott from May 30 to June 2. President Bush lied when he said there were no plans for war on Iraq or anywhere else \"on his desk\" in 2002—the plans were piled high. But military brass in the Pentagon warned the president that th e United States is unprepared for war. European leaders were opposed. Only civilians at Defense and State wanted war. The role of peacemaker is new to Europe. At the Bilderberg meeting in Baden-Baden, Germany, in June 1991, the Persian Gulf war was celebrated and enthusiastic calls fo r more military action \"in five years\" were heard. It was at Baden-Baden that Clinton attended his first Bilderberg meeting. The next year, he was elected president and the United States went to war in 16 countries, euphemistically termed United Nations \"peace-keeping missions.\" But the warmongers fought to the end.

This war cry came just one day before Bilderberg formally gathered for its annual secret session. With the war issue momentarily dela yed, other fights were emerging in probably the most divisive Bild erberg meeting ever. On the basic agenda, the unity that has prevailed for nearly half a century remains intact: Creating a world government in which this international elite will dominate. Bilderberg boys from the European Union were outraged that Bush protected the domestic steel industry from overseas dumping. They are equally angry over the farm bills, which significantly increased agricultural subsidies. \"Family farm ers\" who benefit in clude Bilderberg luminaries David Rockefeller and Dwayne Andreas of Archer Daniels Midland. European Bilderberg members—w ith many \"Americans\" agreeing— want the United States to change her tax laws to suit their pocketbooks. They call it \"tax equity.\" Bilderbe rg also clings to its long-held commitment to create a global tax paya ble by \"world citizens\" directly to the United Nations. The paradoxes would be amusing if no t so damaging to U.S. interests. Farm subsidies are necessary for real family farmers—not to be confused with Bilderberg boys, TV mogul Ted Turner or millionaire basketball players—because of what Bilderberg hath wrought: NAFTA and other \"free trade laws\" as oppos ed to \"fair trade.\" The European Union countries also subsidize agriculture and other exports but object to America's protecting her domestic economy.

Another point of sharp disagreement is U.S. Middl e East policy. Many Europeans object to America's abject pro-Israel policy. This is in large part because the European media has far more balanc ed coverage of the turmoil there than the one-sided U.S. press.

Bilderberg Bashes U.S. on Middle East, War Bilderberg luminaries battered their American counterparts over U.S Middle East policy. They blamed Americans' one-sided support of Israel for causing the need for a \"war on terrorism\" which could lead to bloody military misadventures. However, most Bilderberg boys from both sides of the Atlantic were, for some reason, confident there would be no war between Pakistan and India. At that moment, both nations were on the brink of a nuclear holocaust. It could have had something to do with the appearance of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfe ld, who was hastily summoned to appear on Saturday, June 1.

He was pressed, but refused to say, that the United States had no plans for future wars. Whether Rumsfeld also helped reassu re Bilderberg there would be no war between Pakistan and India could not be determined. But, even as Rumsfeld was assuring Bilderberg of at least a momentary delay in launching a new war, President Bush was rattling sabers in a commencement address at West Point. \"Pre-emptive strikes\" will be used against nations or groups that threaten the United States, Bush told the newly minted Army officers. He vowed to \"take the battle to the en emy, disrupt its pl ans and confront the worst threats befo re they emerge.\" Besides Rumsfeld, Deputy Treasury Secretary Kenneth Dam had long been scheduled to attend—and did. But unity was expressed with ki nd words, smiles, handshakes and embraces on Bilderberg's long-term agenda: • Empowering the United Nations until it becomes a de jure, as well as de facto, world government. • Advancing this goal by creating a dir ect UN tax on \"world citizens,\" expanding NAFTA throughout the Weste rn Hemisphere as a prelude to creating an \"American Union\" sim ilar to the European Union and empowering international bodies to further erode the sovereignty of nations. Further establ ishing NATO as the UN's world army was also discussed. There was much hand-wringing over \"rising nationalism\" in Europe, as demonstrated by the electoral successes of Jean-Marie Le Pen in France and by a populist \"resurgence\" in The Netherlands and Denmark. Americans agreed to pursue a \"world without borders.\" But on the issues of war and Amer ica's Middle East policy, Americans faced three days of chas tisement, both in formal sessions and during glass-tinkling between sessions. A grim-faced Kissinger and others had to take it as European s denounced U.S. policy."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"184 Bilderberg Diary It reached the point that Europeans were praising their detested press, which has showered them with unwanted publicity in recent years. This is a close paraphrase of the an gry words Americans heard: \"In Europe, you would be unable to conduct such a one-sided policy in the Middle East. Europeans know, because of heavy press coverage, of Israel's wars of expansion and brutal occupation of Palestinian lands. They are aware of the cruelty inflic ted on civilians, including women and children, for no military objective at all. \"Europeans know that Israel's military machine is financed by the United States. They know that the planes, tanks and weapons attacking innocent citizens are provided by the United States. While there is no justification for the atta cks in New York and Wa shington on Sept. 11, Europeans know that Palestinians will resist in any way they can. \"Because of the unfair Middle East policy of the United States, we Europeans now must be your alli es in your war on terrorism.\" Americans responded to this w ith grim faces and shrugs. The administration had antic ipated this barrage an d tried to soften it with a peace plan that included an inde pendent Palestinian state. This goes beyond previous U.S. positions, Americans reassured the Europeans, which merely called for Palestinian statehood. The plan was still being drafted as Bilderberg met but they were assured it would be publicly unveiled in July. Bilderberg celebrated the fact that a global UN tax is \"part of the public dialogue\" without a public outcry by \"nationalists.\" I had first reported this years ago. Alan Keyes, as President Ronald Reagan's UN ambassador, denounced th e proposed tax and it has been widely discussed since. Bilderberg has offered several variat ions of the world tax. First, it suggested a 10-cent tax on oil at the barrel head, meaning citizens would pay a direct tax to the UN when gassi ng up their cars or using oil in any way. A surcharge on international travel by air or sea and"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Chantilly, Virginia 2002 185 a tax on international financial transfers were also proposed. Like the federal income tax, a UN levy would be so small at the outset the consumer would hardly notice. But establishing the principle that the UN can directly tax citizens of the world is important to Bilderberg. It is another giant step toward world governm ent. It is openly discussed with little public notice or objection \"except for the Ron Pauls in Congress\" and in \"nationalist\" publ ications, Bilderberg bo ys assured themselves. The references were to populist Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tex.) and American Free Press, which began publication in 2001 after The Spotlight and its publisher, Liberty Lobby, were judicially assassinated There were also demands for \"tax equity\"—meaning that the United States must revise her tax laws to more evenly reflect the high-tax, socialistic societies of Europe. It was called \"unfair trade\" for the United States to be so—by comparison—\"tax friendly\" to individuals and businesses. Europeans continued to complain about the new farm subsidy legislation and the imposi tion of tariffs on steel imports to protect the domestic industry against dumping and were distraught that the Senate version of Fast Track would allow Congress to block any trade deals that negate laws protectin g domestic industries. There was continued sniping at the United States because Bush \"unsigned\" the Kyoto global warming treaty that, economists warned, would generate sky-high inflati on while requiring nothing of most nations. Spitefully, the 15-nation Eur opean Union ratified the treaty on June 1 as Bilderberg was meeting. This prompted a graying Bilderberg luminary to moan that George Bush is \"the worst president sin ce [Richard] Nixon.\" Never has Bush received a higher tribute.

Bilderberg Documents Confirm AFP Reports Under threat of extensive media attention in Europe to its refusal to provide the agenda and list of part icipants at its secret meeting in Chantilly, Va., Bilderberg surrendered.

His web site, www.bilderberg.org, provides extensive coverage. Bilderberg had hoped to keep all it s secrets because the major media in the United States collaborated in the blackout. When meeting in Europe, Bilderberg now confronts a lo t of coverage in the major media initially prompted by The Spotlight. When compelled to make its list public, Bilderberg always adds a \"press release.\" The press release is the same each year, rationalizing its conducting public business in private, with the exception of a first- paragraph update. It reads: \"The 50th Bilderberg meeting will be held in Chantilly, Va. Among other subjects the conference will discuss terroris m, trade, post-crisis reconstruction, Middle East, civil liber ties, U.S. foreign policy, extreme right, world economy, corporate governance.\" These topics were reported regularly to AFP by a Bilderberg source inside Westfields. The list forced out of Bilderberg is incomplete, as always. Every time the list has been obtained by what ever means, there are people who attended but are not men tioned. For example, this year, AFP was able to get a call through to Andrew Parisiliti at Westfields during the meeting but he is not on Bilderberg's list. Parisiliti is foreign affairs advisor to Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.), a Bilderberg regular who was attending an Asian peace summit at the time. Parisiliti was representing Hagel at Bilderberg. Bilderberg has, at one time or another, had representatives of all major U.S. newspapers and network news outlets attend. They do so on their promise to report nothing. This is how Bilderberg keeps its news blackout virtually complete in the United States. This year's crop included The Wash ington Posts Hoagland (a regular) and Charles Krauthammer, both colu mnists for The Washington Post, Jean de Belot of France , editor of le Figaro; John Bernder of Norway, director-general of Norwegian Broadcasting Corp.; Paul Gigot, editorial page editor of the \"conservative\" Wall"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Chantilly, Virginia 2002 191 Street Journal; Charlie Rose, produ cer of Rose Communications who appears on public radio; Toger Seiden faden of Denmark, editor-in-chief of Politiken and Kenneth Whyte of Cana da, editor of The National Post.

Roughly 100 are re gulars who have attended for many years. Fringe people are invited becau se Bilderberg thin ks they may be useful tools. If not, they are cast aside. When Douglas Wilder was serving hi s term as governor of Virginia, he was summoned by Bilderberg because he was the first black ever elected a governor in the United Stat es. However, Wilder's presumed presidential ambitions never were fulfilled, despite his initial entree into Bilderberg circles. Wilder ran in the Democratic pres idential primary in 1984 but got less than one percent of the vote in lily-white New Hampshire and was cast aside by Bilderberg. Similarly, Christine Todd Whitman, as governor of New Hampshire was in vited and later cast aside. The absence of Hagel does not mean he was cast aside because his representative attended and the se nator had hoped to. But he was carrying on Bilderberg business at the Asian defense meeting and remains in good standing. So these newcomers may be emerging Bilderberg stars or future castoffs, depending on events: Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.) and Rep. John LaFalce (D-N.Y.). But for the first time, the chairmen of the two major parties were summoned to Bilderberg. Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee and Ma rk Racicot, chairman of the Republican National Committee, both attended Bilderberg.

However, we were there to greet them, unveiling to the world what goes on behind closed doors when the world's most powerful meet to discuss pressing issues of the day. The rift between American and Europ ean Bilderberg participants grew greater over both the U.S. invasion of Iraq and blind, blank check support of Israeli aggression against Palest inians. These were hotly debated topics as Bilderberg luminaries began filling the posh Trianon Palace Hotel in Versailles, France, on May 14 for its May 15-18 meeti ng. Another issue high on the Bilder berg agenda was the proposed European Union army independent of NATO. Unlike the other two major issues, this is not a c onfrontation between Ameri cans and Europeans. All Americans oppose the EU army, but so do many Europeans. Leading the anti-army European faction is \"Lord\" George Robertson, secretary- general of NATO. French President Chirac, as head of the host state, delivered a welcoming speech during Bilderberg's first full working day on Thursday, May 15.

Bilderberg's annual secret meeting that year was de layed for hours by people they scorn as the unwashed multitudes—workers in France. Their strike on May 13 allowed only one in fi ve planes to land at Charles de Gaulle International Airport and at the older Orly Field in Paris. Versailles is a short distance from Paris. The \"one da y strike\" was so successful—with millions of supporters filling the streets of Paris and other cities—that it was extended through Thursday, May 15. Bilderberg staff had started slipping inconspicuously into the Trianon on May 13, preparing for the planne d shutdown about noon the following day. On Thursday morning, May 15, the last of the Bilderberg luminaries arrived in long, black limos, behind police escorts and shrieking sirens. Bilderberg had planned to shut down the Trianon Palace at noon on May 13, as usual, so th eir functionaries could arrive absent the masses. Instead, the Trianon was open to the public until late Wednesday evening and the shutdown occurred early Thursday morning. Then Bilderberg commenced its work. Three sources within the Trianon Pa lace provided detailed information about what transpired behind the guarded, sealed-off resort. Bilderberg remained united on the common goal of establishing a world government under the United Na tions while retaining control over the wealth of the Eart h and all i nhabitants. But anger over the U.S. war ran high. Europe opposed U.S. war plans a year ago, extracting a promise from Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld not to invade Iraq in 2002.

In The Jerusalem Post, Sharon ridicu led any idea that U.S. aid may be reduced. He said no U.S. administration had ever supported settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel occupied after launching the Six-Day War in 1967. Referring to Sharon's arrogance toward the country that has given Israel countless billions of dollars over the past half century while asking nothing in return, a European Bilder berg luminary told a grim-faced American: \"you are too stupid to know when you've been insulted by a moral midget.\" Adding to the embarrassme nt of Americans at Bilderberg was the fact that the peace plan thrown back in to Powell's face asked only modest moves by Israel. It only asks that Israel abandon settlements built on Palestinian lands since Ma rch 2001. Israel, in this in itial \"peace move,\" is not required to give up the land it seized in doubling its size in the 1967 war. The idea of an independent EU army arose from Europe's resentment over U.S. domination of NATO. Some su ggest it be a separate force but party of, and controlled by, NATO. Bu t opponents in Europe as well as the United States argued that a separate EU force would make NATO's role as the UN's world army incoherent.

Bilderberg Presses Sharon Into Oral Flip-Flop In a rare moment in its half-century of secret meetings to plan the world, Bilderberg has accomplished some good: by pressuring the Israeli government to at least publicly back off its policy of expanding Israel and oppressing Palestinians. Even as Bilderberg was meeting inside the Trianon Palace, the Israeli prime minister was rejecting the \"r oad map\" to peace with contempt. Sharon told The Jerusalem Post and ot her Israeli media th at Israel would never return any of the Palestinian lands seized in the past half-century. Sharon laughed at suggestions that U.S. aid may be reduced or eliminated unless his policy of expanding the occupation ended. He boasted that all U.S. administrati ons have opposed Israeli settlements while blank-check ai d never stopped. European Bilderberg participants were outraged at Sharon's attitude and complained vociferously to American participants. Europeans placed angry calls to their own gove rnment officials and to Israel. A week later, on May 26, Sharon re versed himself—at least publicly. He told his stunned countrymen that he was determined to"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Versailles, Prance 2003 201 reach a peace agreement and end the \"occupation\" of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It was the first time Sharon had publicly uttered the word \"occu- pation\"—which is anathema to many Israelis who claim the land as their own for religious reasons. \"To keep 3.5 million people under occu pation is bad for us and them,\" Sharon told outraged members of hi s Likud Party in comments broadcast on Israeli radio. \"This can't continue endlessly. Do you want to remain forever in Ramallah, Jenin, Nablus?\" he asked, naming towns in the West Bank. Sharon's startling revers al of rhetoric was in direct response to European Bilderberg luminaries beca use he feared the U.S. government could be pressured into punishing Israel's oc cupation by reducing or ending the annual foreign aid. While Sharon's comments were widely viewed with cynicism by those who expect him to find some way to escape the \"r oad map\" he has officially embraced, some held out hope that the Israeli leader might be sincere. \"Sharon is a pragmatist,\" said Efraim Inbar, director of the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar Ilan University in Tel Aviv. \"He is capable of change when circumstances require.\" But Yossi Sarid, a member of the Israeli Knesset (parliament), was more cynical, saying Sharon wanted th e U.S. government to assume that he was committed to the peace plan while his hawkish allies could assume he was just making a tactic al move to appease the Europeans and Americans. \"Ariel Sharon likes to walk in the fog, because then no one knows where he is headed,\" Sarid wrote in the Yediot Ahronot newspaper."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":" Bilderberg Blackout... 2004—Stresa, Italy: Washington Post publisher Donald Graham (center above) was photographed by AFP cameramen at the 2004 meeting in Stresa.

At the 2004 secret Bilderberg meet ing at the Grand Hotel des Iles Borromees near Stresa, Italy, some of the world's most powerful elite focused on U.S. taxes and foreign giveaways, as well as the increasingly violent Iraq occupation and the role the United Nations should play in all future outbreaks of violence. The gathering took place at the posh resort overlooking Lake Maggiore June 3-6. Prior to the meeting, a Bilderberg memo promised that its members would deal mainly with European-Ameri can relations and in that context, with U.S politics, Iraq, the Middle East, European geopolitics, NATO, China, energy and economic problems. During the conference, Britain cam e in for harsh criticism for supporting the invasion of Iraq. It was also lambasted for failing to embrace the euro, despite Prime Minister Tony Blair's promise to do so at a Bilderberg meeting some years ago in the Scottish resort of Turnberry. Bilderberg members also expressed frustration with the rising clamor in Britain to quit the European Union. As expected, the United States wa s heavily criticized for the fact"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"204 Bilderberg Diary that its foreign aid was a smaller percen tage of gross domestic product than that of other nations. That marked the third straight meeting at which Bilderbergers' decades of almost to tal congeniality was marred by hostility among the Americans, Britons and continental Europeans. The first evidence of division in th e ranks was apparent in 2002 when Bilderbergers met at Chantilly, Va., near Washington. Then, Europeans were angry that the United States was preparing for an invasion of Iraq. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld tried to placate th em with a promise not to invade \"this year.\" Instead, the war began in March 2003. Bilderbergers, however, remained united in their long-term goal to strengthen the role the UN plays in regulating global relations. Aside from that objective, other matters on this year's conference agenda included the following: • British elites are to press on with membership in the European Union despite growing domestic opposition. • The Free Trade Area of the Americ as (FTAA) should be enacted and include the entire Western Hemisphere except for Cuba until Fidel Castro is gone. It should then evolve into the \"American Union\" as a carbon copy of the European Union. • An \"Asian-Pacific Union\" is to emerge as the th ird great super state, neatly dividing the world into three great regions for the administrative convenience of banking and corporate el ites. The United States and other international financial institutions should facilitate and administrate these global trade pacts. Another much-discussed subject at this year's conference was the concept of imposing a direct UN tax on people worldwide. In order to achieve it, some Bilderbergers presen ted two proposals: a tax on oil at the wellhead and a tax on interna tional financial transactions. Bilderberg leaders tilted strongly toward the oil tax because everyone who drives a car, rides public transportation or flies in a plane will end up paying the tax. That will represent more people"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Stresa, Italy 2004 205 than those engaged in international financial transactions across the globe. On the issue of Iraq, European Bilder bergers were more upset that the United States invaded without the UN' s blessing than the fact that many thousands of American soldiers and Iraqis have been killed. Word reached the conference from Ru msfeld, who was unable to attend this year's meeting, that the U. S. military would assume a more defensive stance in Iraq, rather than the more provocative operations of door-to-door searches and widespread detention. Rumsfeld was, however, represented in Stresa by Douglas Feith, his undersecretary for po licy, and Willia m Luti, deputy undersecretary for Near Eastern and South Asian a ffairs. Former Pe ntagon advisor Richard Perle, one of the major arch itects of the war in Iraq, was also present. It had be en Perle, Feith and Paul Wolfowitz who, from the mid 1990s, had fashioned the Middle East policy later adopted by Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld. European Bilderbergers also proteste d the fact that the Pentagon was considering reducing troop levels in Ge rmany and tried hard to convince their American counterparts to resist the move. They argued it would \"undermine unity\" and, irrespective of the military implications, the German economy benefited annually from the millions of dollars spent by U.S. servicemen there. Resistance in Britain to the euro, and to membership in the European Union, caused much concern and was deemed an obstacle to the solidification of the super state. Bilderberg participants ended their secret se ssions on an upbeat note with a ferry ride to a luxury is land on Lake Maggiore, where John Elkman, the latest vice president of the Fiat motor company, married his new bride in September.

Mainstream Still Covering After more than a half-century of silence, The New York Times carried a story on the secret Bilderberg Gr oup July 11—but it was inaccurate and failed to disclose its own long- term collaboration. The Times has had officials at many Bilderberg meetings over the years and, until now, has kept its vow of silence. While the Times had accidentally ment ioned Bilderberg in a news story about a participant who died at a meet ing years ago, it was the first time the newspaper had actually written about the secretive gr oup of international financiers and political leaders. The Times quoted the woman who helps coordinate Bilderberg meetings in Europe, Maja Banck-Polderman of Leiden, Netherlands. Over the years, Banck-Polderman has routinely resisted efforts to provide details about Bilderberg meetings. \"They do not have to sign anythin g, but they understand that they do not talk,\" she was quoted regarding Bilderberg's secrecy, or \"Chatham House,\" rule.

Bilderberg hunkered down May 5-8 to decide how the world should deal with European-American relati ons, the Middle East powder keg, the Iraq war, the global economy and potential war in Iran. The first appearance of Virginia Gov. Mark Warner (D) indicated Bilderberg considered him a presidential contender. The absence of former Sen. J ohn Edwards (N.C.), John Kerry's presidential running mate in 2004, indicated the Sun has set on his political career. Last year was Edwards's first appearance and, like most of the \"fringe\" invitees, he had been cast aside like an old shoe. European hostility toward American s for the invasion of Iraq was rekindled by reports in the European press that British Prime Minister Blair had secretly agreed with President Bush to go to war months in advance of the U.S. invasion. The Guardian of London, among other newspapers, carried detailed accounts of a transcript of conversat ions between Blair and President Bush three months before the March 2002 invasion. The transcript clearly showed. Blair promising, in advance, to join the United States in the war on Iraq. This prompted hostile comments wh ile Kissinger was presiding over a panel discussion on the meaning of \"peace.\" Europeans demanded to know if \"Iran is next,\" and \"when does it end?\" America was repeatedly warned not to \"rush to war with Iran.\" But history demonstrates that Amer icans are no more the \"war party\" than the European Bilderbergers. Europeans joined in supporting the 1991 invasion of Iraq by Bush the Elder, celebrating the end of \"America's Vietnam syndrome.\" Europeans also supported former President Clinton's invasion of Yugoslavia, bringing NATO into the operation.

The British election results in 2005 pleased Europeans, who grudgingly supported Blair because of his commitment to the European Constitution (EC). Britons were to vote in 2006 on ratifying the EC. But they were happy that Blair's Labor Party's majority in Parliament shrank from 160 to 60 and there was speculation that he would be replaced as prime minister within two years.

Abu-Amr is a member of the Palestin ian Legislative Council, president of the Palestinian Council on Foreign Relation and professor of political science at Birzeit University. This year, Bilderberg ordered Israel to keep its promise to withdraw from some settlements in the West Ba nk and Gaza. Also, they noted that Palestinians must be grateful for th e portion of their te rritory they get back and not insist on pre-1967 borders. \"We must get along, despite our ha rsh differences, because we now live in an interdependent, global economy,\" said a lanky, gray-haired European in a discussion of \"tra ns-Atlantic Relations.\" Poverty in Africa or South America \"or wherever\" is a \"threat to all of us, anywhere in the world,\" he said. Again, the United States was denounced for \"not providing a fair share\" of economic aid to poor countries. Again, Kissinger and Rockefeller, among other Americans, beamed and nodded approval. Bilderberg argued that, as a percentage of gross national product, Americans were \"stingy.\" Again, there was discussion of timi ng for a vote in the United Nations on establishing a direct global tax by imposing a 10-cents-a-barrel levy on oil at the well-head. This was important to the Bilderberg goal of establishing the UN as a formal world government. Such a direct tax on individuals is symbolically important. Bilderberg's global tax proposal had been pending before the UN for three years but the issue had be en blacked out by the Bilderberg- controlled U.S. media.

Carto, who hired me as editor of The Spotlight and then put me on the track of B ilderberg, I would probably—almost assuredly—never have hear d the word \"Bilderberg.\" Having had the opportunit y, through Carto's good o ffices as founder of Liberty Lobby, publishe r of The Spotlight, to begi n what ultimately proved to be a generation of world-wide Bilderberg-hunting, I was able to bring news about Bilderberg to literally millions of folks who would like myself have oth- erwise remained in the dark about these globalist schemers. In consideration of Willis Carto's central part in unmasking Bilderberg, it seems appropriate to close this volume with a commentary from Willis him- self: his reflections upon what Bilderberg means to all who care about our world's future. With all humility, conscious of the wa rm praise Willis imparts for my efforts, I thus turn these pages over to Mr. Carto for a final word. What you have suspected for years—that a conspiracy of international plutocrats is out to get y ou—is proven by this book. Jim Tucker deserves the highest praise for his amazing persistence, year after year, in tracking down this coven of carnivores, reporting on their secret activities in the only newspapers in America with the guts to use his dispatches, first The Spotlight and then in American Free Press. And in part due to The Spotlight's ef fort to expose Bilderberg that our newspaper was illegally shut down by a corrupt federal judge acting on behalf of conspirators with ties to th e internationalist elite. But American Free Press has picked up and kept Jim Tucker's Bilderberg reportage alive. From the unique and hitherto-hidden facts presented in Jim's book we learn:"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Afterword 219 • There is in fact a highly organized conspiracy between influential politicians and bankers to give each mo re of what they crave, power and money; • That both of these have to be contributed by you and millions of other deluded taxpayers and voters; • That the conspiracy includes br inging down all national governments, and, by fraud and bribery, substituting a world government; • That the consumers, taxpayers and voters are victimized by their so- called \"free press,\" which is literally part of the conspiracy; • That wars are started to advance th e interests of these acolytes of evil who routinely send thousands of deceived young men to die while they pocket the wages of sin; • That they write the history books to justify their crimes and to pave the way for future profitable wars and an ultimate world government. This last point is also the reason for the birth of Revisionist (authentic) history after World War I. Dedicated historians all—these men and others dared to look into the real facts about the events that led to that war: • Dr. Harry Elmer Barnes • Prof. Charles A. Beard, • Prof. Sidney B. Fay • C. Hartley Grattan, • Henry Wickham Steed • Sisley Huddleston, • Edwin D. Schoonmaker • H.C. Peterson, • William Seaver Woods • Francis Nielson And this list is hardly complete. However, after World War II, many of these distinguished names continued in their work which was supplemented by the efforts of many other Revisionists, including: • Dr. James J. Martin • John Toland, • Benjamin Colby • Prof. Charles Callan Tansill, • Dr. David Hoggan • Dr. Arthur Butz, • George N. Crocker • Capt. Russell Grenfell, • Gen. Albert C. Wedemeyer • Dr. Austin J.

Now, you ask—and rightly so—why I've burdened you with this list of distinguished historians, many of whos e names you may not know. It is for this reason: When the complete and authentic history of the 20th century is finally written, no serious scholar can recount that panorama without referring to the remarkable work of one man, the courageous journalist, Jim Tucker, who was on the scene to record, first-hand, the secret dealings of those behind-the-scenes intriguers—who call themselves \"Bilderberg\"— who were ultimately responsible for making history—hidden history— happen as it did during the 20th century, and beyond. No sane person with the national inte rests of the United States and the personal welfare of every man woman and child in mind can fail to see at this time—the year 2005—that American intervention into the two European wars of 1914 and 1939 have been unmitigated disasters, setting this country on a downward spiral in every aspect: economic, monetary, cultural, moral, racial a nd political. The ongoing debacle in Iraq is just part and parcel of the tragedy. Thus, readers will judge Jim Tucker 's work against this sordid backdrop, as the outline of the criminal conspiracy which has guided America's foreign and domestic policies becomes tragically clear. —W ILLIS A.

With all due respect we find it strange that you refuse to disclose any in formation concerning your trip to the Bilderberg meeting in Megeve, France, April 19-21, 1974. We did notice the letter you sent to the Washington Post in which you claim to have promised you would keep the meeting contents confidential. But any questions sent you by Maryland constituents are totally ignored if they involve the Bilderberg meeting and we find that strange and disturbing. Don't you feel that as a United States Senator you have an obligation to disclose fully your activities to Maryland voters? Do you really believe that you can attend a m eeting also attended by principals of foreign governments and consider yourself a \"priva te citizen\" and speak \"off th e record\"! You have indicated the State Department paid your fare to France. Who paid for your return trip? Is it possible for us, your constituents, to know what subjects were discussed at the Hotel Mont d'Arbois, where the secret conferences were held? Were any conclusions r eached at the meeting? Isn't it logical for us to assume conclusions were reached and if we knew what those conclusions were we would not approve? Why else the secrecy? We know that more than 100 of the world's richest and most powerful men attended this meeting. You are not an oil man, nor a banker, nor are you a billionaire. Most of those attending were. Obviously you were invited because you are a Unite d States Senator. As a Senator your loyalty lies with your constituents, not to international bankers. Or, do you feel your Senatorial oath of office is s uperseded by your oath to the Bilderbergers? As your constituents, we want th e answers to these questions. Concerned Maryland Voters In this letter, concerned citizens in Maryland demanded to know why taxpayers had paid for Sen. Charles Mathias to attend a private, secret meeting of global elites.

The source has yet to be determined. It matters not who 1 am or where I might \"fit\" into your limited and distorted view of the world scheme of things, but it can be said that I was among the few to have again received THE INVITATION to attend a certain conference on world affairs, which we (as a private group) chose to hold this year in Scotland, and which was necessarily restricted to those who had ear ned THE RIGHT or THE PRIVILEGE to be there—your imbecilic \"reporter\" notwithstanding. The odious little man you repeatedly send every year to try and crash our very private proceedings has none oi the above) You should remember that. James P. Tucker is typi cal of all too many who ar e part of the present- day \"Fourth Estate\"—lower class \"wannabees\" with li ttle or no real edu- cation, whose literacy level border s on the ludicrous —who use the dubi- ous profession of journalism to stalk the corridors of pow er (where they do not belong), and rub s houlders with the elite. He is way out of his class. And when we block Tucker in his puerile effort s to poke his nose into where it isn't wanted , and where he hasn't been invited, he vents his frustration in your newspaper. Is this the best you can do? For one thing, don't expect us to admit someone that anyone can see is obviously not from a private school, and from the upper classes, or a member of the power elite. Such me n and women have strived hard to achieve their status in life, and there is that intangible air of authority about them, if not a certain char isma, that commands entrance to a Group such as ours. But to send us your smelly little nail biting leper of a chain-smoking \"journalist,\" attired in his usual ill-fitting baggy suit, his body covered with eczema and dermatitis, is asking too much of any- body (no matter what class!) to \"war m\" up to him, let alone shake his scabby, nicotine-stained hands!

But all the while it has been on my mind to write to you and express my extreme disgust at your efforts to make public what our Group want s to remain secret, si mply becaus e there are few in the world who have the know ledge required to understand why we exist, and what our true aims are. Who and what our small Group rep- resents is far from being what your correspondent makes us out to be. This letter is not a \"red herring\" de signed to throw you off the track, nor is it a disguised vehicle for deliber ate mis-information. I am just vent- ing my personal frustration (on behalf of the Group) at the Press in gen- eral, your newspaper in passing, an d your employee in particular. But there is a limit to our gentlemanly tolerance of an immature journalist who has deluded himself and others into thinking he's a latter day James Bond, as he plays his li ttle secret agent games, peering through the key- holes of life, listening outside our conference room doors, and doing whatever he can to corrupt the inte grity and honor of those who have been sworn to absolute secrecy—nev er to divulge any aspect of our annual Group Conference, who came, who went, who spoke, what they said, or what we discussed in private. Now tell me, can we not as a Group keep our deliberations secret if we want to, even though we mi ght not need to? If you really needed to know, we might even consider telling you, bu t I can assure you that your read- ers would not find what we talk about more intere sting than your invent- ed suppositions. What we do and what our Group represents is inter- esting to us and us alone. It was at our Athens Co nference in 1995 that I first saw this infamous \"Mr. Tucker of The Spo tlight\" [now American Free Press], whom our secu- rity staff had been talk ing about. I am told that we succeeded admirably in stopping him cold for the next two years, but after his abominable behaviour at our 1996 Group Conference in Canada, we decided to teach the little man a lesson and show him that the big boys knew how to play"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Appendix 3 245 games too.

Because of Mr. James Tucker and a couple of others on your staff, your newspaper has unfortunately succeeding in convincing many of your readers that our Group is conn ected with David Rockefeller's Trilateral Commission. It isn't! That's all a bout money; our Group is concerned about othe r things. Neither are we c onnected in a ny way with the Council on Foreign Relations or the Brookin gs Institution, although a very small number of our Group belong to both and sometimes attend their meetings.

The Zionists are doing a very good job in that department, thank you, while you and your corresponden ts play into the hands of Israel by conveniently diverting the public's attention to us and other insignificant global brouhahas. We are an organization that is devo ted to the good of the world, in the same way as is the even more shadowy world organization of The Round Table, a small but powerful group that is on a level with—if not higher than—the exclusive \"Order of The Garter.\" If you want exclusivity, you w ill find that they far outclass our Group. They are more devoted to secrecy than even your NSA at Fort Meade, Maryland! I would not be surprised if you have yet to hear of this immensely powerful group, but I can tell you that, like us, The Round Table have no \"Head Office\" as such, but they have chapters in selected countries of the world. Their membership is smaller than ours by far, and not one will admit to even knowing about such an organization even existing. The Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles, Ian Douglas- Hamilton (the Premier Duke of Sc otland), Baroness Thatcher, Lord Vincent, and the former Bishop of Wi nchester are said to be members and, to the best of my knowledge, so was Sir Winston before his death in 1965. Your former U.S. President, Ronald Reagan was also an active member, until Alzheimer's Diseas e prevented him from traveling overseas, and so was John Menzies of Australia"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"246 Bilderberg Diary before he retired. In closing, I will also tell you this. The Round Table met very secretly for the first time this year not too far from you, in a large private home close to Washington DC, in the green fields of northern Virginia, from March 25-27, 1998! I am in no way whatsoever advocating that you do so, but if you want to find out who (or what) is the primary and most promising force to counteract the world evil of a godless conglomerate endeavouring to gain co ntrol of everything you and I hold dear—then you can assuredly let your readers know that there is a Greater Force PRESENT in the world than the pett y politics and world threat you have shamelessly branded our honourable Gr oup to be. Therefore, may I sug- gest again that you renew your hope in the future, your faith in what you know to be true, and your trust in what I have ju st told you. More than that I am not prepared to tell you at this time. But... As a recognised [sic], obedient—a nd sometimes most often—a very public servant of The Realm, am bound by honour and obedience to remain faithfully yours, (Signature indecipherable) Jim Tucker Responds (Open Letter) Dear Bilderberg Pretender: I believe you are a phon y, but respon d in case you are a Rockefeller chambermaid acting on his orders. As evil as Bilderberg participants ar e; they are not illi terate, hysterical fools, which are charact eristics you so thoroughly demonstrate in your literary attempt. You suggest Bilderberg has a right to a privat e meeting. I have heard Bilderberg boys and their apologists in the kept press make this stupid argument for 20 years. There is no ri ght to a private meeting when pub- lic officials, whose expenses and sala ries are paid by ta xpayers, partici- pate, as many do. Their salaries are immodest and they don't fly coach or stay at Holiday Inn. Even if all privately funded, I would challenge the right of public offi- cials to conduct public business behind closed d oors. Destroying a head of state and killing our young men in manufacture d wars is definitely public business. Your disdain for those born poor wh o worked for their education is"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":" Above, the envelope in which the \"Turnberry Letter\" was mailed, bearing the postmark of the Royal Mail, London. interesting and probably typical of the Bilderberg mentality. How many nights did you sit up deciding not to be born Chinese? Or in Abraham Lincoln's log cabin? Or a manger? Thanks for your solici tude over my health. After baffling dermatolo- gists for years, my skin has been greatly improved by a wholistic med- ication. On your advice, I have fired my tailor an d will henceforth have my suits designed by Omar the Tentmaker. I want to look my best when I atte nd the Bilderberg meeting next year. While the Bilderberg brass gives me less than a warm welcome, 1 have attended more of their meetings than some of th e Bilderbergs. You seem badly confus ed over the common goals of Bilderberg, the Trilateral Commission and their pr opaganda ministry, the Council on Foreign Relations, and ot her offshoots. It can be difficult to follow the game when one is handicapped by a low IQ. So you can understand Bilderberg be tter, may I recommend subscrib- ing to The Spotlight? Have a friend read it to you—very slowly—and light will dawn even in the darkest, emptiest cellars of Earth. Thank you for your gracious letter. Cordially, James P.
