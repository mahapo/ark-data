If there is such a public opinion, I would disagree with it.” – Russian President Vladimir Putin, June 4, 2007. This book exposes Obama, but it does so from a standpoint that is fundamentally different from almost all other critical studies seen so far. This book exposes and refutes Obama from the left . In this book, the vague and vapid messianic and utopian platitudes, the lemming legions, the personality cult, the narcissism, the megalomania, the fake polling, the media and intelligence agency manipulation which are the essence of Obama and his campaign of mass manipulation are criticized thoroughly, but always from a standpoint which reaches back to the Franklin D. Roosevelt New Deal, in many ways the best government that America has ever known. The basic thesis shared by the authors of this book is that Obama is a right-winger, an elitist, a creature of Wall Street, and a deeply troubled personality, running far to the right of his main opponent, Sen. Clinton, on all major issues, including the two critical areas of economics and foreign policy. Obama’s ultra-left components, concentrated in social and energy policy, are an ideological camouflage which only accentuates, and does not alter, his overall pro-Wall Street profile. Obama is a right-winger, and this book criticizes him from the left. This, it turns out, is by far his most vulnerable flank in today’s crisis of simultaneous wars and economic depression."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Preface 5 Other studies of Obama can be divided into three main groups. First are those which approach their subject with transparent adulation and hero worship. This is the majority of the treatments of Obama coming out of the liberal and left liberal community, and these studies are so biased as to be basically worthless. The authors are often the limousine liberals and wealthy elitists and their publicists, and these persons tend to make up Obama’s most devoted base. Next are those, like Shelby Steele or Bill Sammon, who approach Obama from a right-wing or neocon point of view. Sometimes, if the author is an intelligent reactionary (a rarity), these studies can offer useful perceptions. But generally they fall far short of comprehending their subject because of the distortions inherent in right-wing or neocon ideology itself. Sometimes the results are almost comical: right-wing critics try to portray Obama as a communist, when his pedigree is that of a controlled asset of the Ford Foundation and the Trilateral Commission, both important centers of coordination for the Anglo-American finance oligarchy. And the list is even longer: not just Ford and Trilateral, but also Bilderberger, Council on Foreign Relations, Skull and Bones, RAND Corporation, Chicago School, Woodrow Wilson Center – all of them are backing Obama. The rightists speculate that Obama will surrender to the supposed global jihad, whereas his true goal is to launch his own apocalyptic global hyper-jihad against Pakistan, China, and Russia, in conformity with the prescriptions of his guru and svengali, the marplot Zbigniew Brzezinski. Obama is the darling of the failed and bankrupt elites: Brzezinski, Jay Rockefeller, George Soros, Paul Adolph Volcker, General Merrill “Bomb Now, Die Later” McPeak, Joseph Nye of the Trilateral-Bilderberger complex, and the notorious ruling class cover- up artist Lee Hamilton are all in Obama’s amen corner. The right- wingers then try to portray Obama as a Moslem, whereas he obviously worships at the Ford Foundation Church of the Counterinsurgency, where the racist provocateur Jeremiah Wright purveys a Gnostic synthetic religion totally distinct from both Christianity and Islam. They try to portray Obama as a left liberal, whereas he exhibits in fact many of the features of what is being increasingly recognized as postmodern fascism. All of these right- wing and neocon attempts to understand the Obama phenomenon are thus crippled by an attempt to make this candidate and his supporters fit into ideological schemes left over from the Cold War, or else from the post-9/11 era. But the Cold War is long gone, and the post-9/11 era is rapidly fading into yesterday’s headlines, even as the Brzezinski"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 6 faction gears up for the global showdown with Moscow, Beijing, and the other capitals of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). The net result of all the right-wing and neocon studies of Obama is to vastly underestimate the danger that he poses, both in terms of world-wide thermonuclear confrontation (the likely outcome of Brzezinski’s endgame), as well as in terms of the transformation of the US society and economy towards postmodern fascism. The postmodern fascist danger is not confined to Obama: the radical environmental charlatan Al Gore has just announced his intention to spend $300 million to create a private army of 10 million – Malthusian fanatics who will coerce politicians and society in general into implementing global warming countermeasures. These will obviously include reductions in the standard of living, and speculative bonanzas for Gore and his clique of elitists. Gore’s Green Army will be available for strikebreaking. It might also undertake a March on Washington in the spirit of Benito Mussolini’s October 1922 March on Rome. Will Gore’s environmental storm troopers wear green shirts? If they do, they will join the tradition of the green-shirted Romanian Iron Guards of Codreanu, an imitator of Il Duce . Not surprisingly, Obama has announced that Gore will be prominent and influential in the future regime of the Illinois messiah. A third class of critical analysis regarding Obama comes from writers who can generally be reckoned to the center-left of the Democratic Party. These are often individuals of courage and character who have distinguished themselves in the battles of the past decade against the monstrous excesses of the Republicans and the Bush regime. Ambassador Joseph Wilson, the husband of Valerie Plame, one of the leading public adversaries of the Bush regime, has written eloquently of the support he and his wife received from the Clintons during their battles with the Bush neocons, at a time when the struggle-averse Obama was AWOL, as he always has been in moments when decisive action was required. Professor Paul Krugman of Princeton has fought many a skirmish with Bush & Co. over recent years, and has now developed in his New York Times columns an in- depth critique of Obama’s health care plan, highlighting Obama’s refusal to support universal health care. Krugman is obviously horrified by Obama’s pseudo-movement of militant Kool-Aid drinkers, and has focused attention on the venomous, personality cult aspects of the Obamakins. Professor Sean Wilentz, who defied the reactionary Republican clique during the Clinton impeachment hearings ten years ago, has established beyond any doubt that it is"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Preface 7 Obama, not the Clintons, who must bear responsibility for introducing racial polarization into this year’s presidential campaign. We must also mention Keidi Obi Awadu of the LIB Radio Network in Los Angeles and Glen Ford of the Black Agenda Report, two authentic, intelligent and critical black voices who have not hesitated to offer criticism of Obama. These studies by people who have really been fighting Bush, Cheney, and the neocons convey deserved contempt for Obama’s hollow claim that he is an agent of change. In addition to these valuable critiques, however, the authors of this book are convinced that there is also much to be gained from an analysis which proceeds from a New Deal (or American System traditionalist) perspective. A central thesis of this book is that the Obama agitation should not be seen as a political campaign of the customary type, but rather as a strange hybrid between a political campaign and a relatively new type of covert operation of the intelligence agencies. The initial thrust of the Obama campaign was the attempt to achieve nomination by acclamation through a surprise people power coup or color revolution employing the same repertoire of techniques which the CIA, the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), the Soros foundations, the Brzezinski clique, and Gene Sharp’s Albert Einstein Institute have carried out recently in such places as Belgrade, Serbia; Tiflis, Georgia; and Kiev, Ukraine. Something similar is afoot in Tibet and in the rest of China. These color revolutions have exhibited common features like a telegenic demagogue, generous CIA-NED support in cash and narcotics, the cynical gaming of existing political customs and party rules, savvy exploitation of the internet, fake polling, media hysteria, catchy slogans and colors to establish branding, and the widespread use of rent-a-mobs and dupe-a-mobs of swarming adolescents. For the first time in many years, the left wing of the CIA-NED-Soros- Ford complex is assuming center stage inside this country. The last time the left-liberal wing of the intelligence agencies assumed similar importance in domestic affairs was the catastrophic and abortive Carter administration of 1977-1981, which was controlled and ruined by some of the same people, notably Brzezinski, who are running Obama today. In fact, we can extrapolate from the disasters of the Carter years to develop estimates of the far worse horrors which a future Obama regime would surely bring."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 8 As of this writing, it would appear that a congeries of defeated and discredited Democratic politicians and party bureaucrats (Dean, Brazil, Leahy, and others) are more than willing to split the Democratic Party by convoking an illegal rump mini-convention sometime in June or July in order to short-circuit the stipulated party calendar and deliver the Democratic nomination into the hands of Obama, an intrinsically weak candidate who has never won public office in a seriously contested election, and who has now been mortally wounded by his 20-year devotion to the racist firebrand Jeremiah Wright. If the Dean-Brazil-Leahy clique should persist in their design, they will join the tradition of those infamous Confederates and Copperheads who bolted from the legitimate Democratic National Convention in Baltimore in June 1860 after the nomination had been fairly won by Stephen A. Douglas, and formed their own rump convention at the Maryland Institute, where they nominated the pro-slavery John C. Breckinridge. The main saboteur of party unity was Caleb Cushing, the King of the Doughfaces, who sabotaged the legal convention and then defected to preside over the rump, illegal one. The Doughfaces in those days were northern men with pro-slavery principles; Dean qualifies as a self-styled Democrat with Republican principles, so maybe Doughface will prove to be a good term for people like him. Howard Dean, Chairman Ho-Ho, thus takes his place as the new Caleb Cushing, the new top Doughface of our time. That 1860 Democratic Party split was a prelude to all the greatest of all horrors, civil war. What will a Democratic Party split bring this time around? Rather than wait to find out, it is time to oust Dean, Brazil, and their DNC retinue. Let Obama and Dean found their own ultra- left financier-backed Elitist Party, which could then take its chances against a reinvigorated blue-collar, New Deal Democratic Party attuned to the needs of working people. In today’s Bush economic depression, the outcome could hardly be in doubt. Looking further forward to the Democratic National Convention in Denver (August 25-28, 2008), we can already see the left CIA-NED and their domestic tentacles planning to stage an outburst of mob activism and ochlocracy in favor of Obama’s increasingly embattled candidacy. Rent-a-mobs and dupe-a-mobs of swarming adolescents will be projected across the television screens of the nation and the world in an attempt to establish the idea that the Illinois elitist is the true choice of the people. Persons of good will are hereby warned not to capitulate to such an exercise in mass brainwashing by means of"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Preface 9 cynically created illusions, and not to be stampeded by the planned demagogic media spectacle. Over the years, I have built up considerable experience in identifying and analyzing the covert operations of the Anglo- American intelligence community. My first major work in the field in 1978 was a study of the kidnap-murder of former Italian Prime Minister Aldo Moro, which was published in Italian in Rome. In 1987 I contributed to a report on the Iran-contra gun-running and drug- running operations directed by George H.W. Bush from the Reagan White House; excerpts of this study are included in this book because they show that the Brzezinski-Huntington Trilateral Commission circles were already planning in the early 1980s (in the immediate aftermath of the fall of their puppet Carter) to abort and destroy the next US political mass upsurge, which they then expected to emerge around 2010, that is to say, in our own current historical time. All indications are that Obama is one of the options artificially prepared by the Trilaterals starting at about that time. This book can therefore be regarded as an exposé of Trilateral machinations which has been in preparation for more than twenty years. In 1992, I published the first and only unauthorized biography of George Bush, which included a more definitive account of Iran-contra and related intelligence community operations. After the provocations of September 11, 2001, I turned to an examination of false flag terrorism, which appeared in 2005 as 9/11 Synthetic Terror: Made in USA , and since has appeared in French, Italian and Spanish editions. In this book I advanced the notion that, especially in our times, historical reality cannot be considered as axiomatically spontaneous, but must rather be seen as heavily manipulated by the multi-billion dollar intelligence agencies. I proposed the term super-determination or surdetermination to express this notion. Obama can be seen as in the context of this surdetermination. During 2007, I was active in exposing the efforts of the Cheney- neocon faction to expand the Middle East war via aggression against Iran; this included an exposé of Operation Bite, planned for Good Friday 2007, and the Kennebunkport Warning of late August 2007. The Kennebunkport Warning represented a remarkable achievement of intelligence analysis, since it provided an accurate and timely warning of the Cheney group’s effort to orchestrate an attack on Iran under the cover of a new false flag attack, and appeared just a few days before the rogue B-52 incident, in which a long-range strategic"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 10 bomber carrying six nuclear-armed cruise missiles was in effect hijacked by pro-Cheney rogue network elements and flown from North Dakota to Louisiana, in preparation for a flight to the Gulf – where the cruise missiles might well have been deployed in conjunction with the Israeli attack on Syria at the end of the first week of September, 2007. This incident has never been investigated by Congress, even though one of the nuclear missiles is reportedly still missing. I therefore bring to the study of Obama a formidable experience of analyzing, exposing, and denouncing intelligence operations, ranging from the central European geopolitical terrorism in the 1970s to Project Democracy’s Iran-contra, to the 9/11 era. If it can be said that any person is qualified to identify a covert operation of the intelligence community, then I hope that this may be said of me. Speaking with such authority as may be acquired from a lifetime of experience, I now assert that we are entering a new and more dangerous era of new-look subversion, for which Obama is intended to be the unifying figurehead, spokesman, and salesman. Obama thus represents the most ambitious and dangerous covert operation by the combined forces of the intelligence community since 9/11. The emerging predominance of the left CIA and its left liberal clients was signaled by the Baker-Hamilton Iraq Study Group of late 2006, which called for a diplomatic offensive to recruit more regional proxies (that is to say, kamikaze stooges and dupes) to save the Wall Street-City of London world position. Not by accident, Lee Hamilton, the Democratic co-chair of that effort, is now on board for Obama. Further progress towards left CIA ascendancy was indicated by the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) of December 2007, which opined that Iran no longer had an active nuclear weapons program, and thus marked an important moment of transition in terms of US- UK world strategy. This NIE, which undercut the anti-Iran thrust of the Bush-Cheney- neocon group, will probably appear in retrospect as the great watershed between an era of neocon strategy and the new epoch of world subversion by the Brzezinski group. The ouster of Tony Blair and his replacement by Gordon Brown was another sign that the Iraq war cabal of 2003 was on its way out, and that a demagogic left turn was in the offing. The thesis embodied in this book is that the likelihood of a direct US attack on Iran is declining, even as the danger of a direct US attack on Pakistan is rising at an alarming rate."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Preface 11 Instead of further mucking around in the Middle East, Brzezinski is seeking to marshal all remaining US-UK resources for a final onslaught on Moscow, Beijing, and the other countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the main focal point of world resistance to London and Washington. This is Brzezinski’s new Operation Barbarossa. The financiers who control Brzezinski are now fielding Obama as the plausible public face for a new era of brutal and bellicose imperialist subversion and geopolitics which will be advertised on the basis of multiculturalism and dignity through self- determination attained through the subversion, balkanization, partition and subdivision of existing states, instead of the narrow and venomous Islamophobia which has been the constant and strident note of the Bush-Cheney neocons. This brings us again to the fact that Obama’s agitation is not a traditional political campaign, but far more essentially represents a carefully planned domestic covert operation of the intelligence community. Obama is a one-way ticket to conflicts infinitely more horrendous than those created by the neocons, conflicts that will require a national mobilization for total war, with privations and grinding sacrifice that the neocons never dreamed of. Obama will add to the top-down oppression of Bush’s authoritarian state a new dimension of totalitarian control enforced by his fanatical followers, his lemming legions. Once Obama has state power in his hands, these trends may become irreversible. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Bruce Marshall and Jonathan Mowat for the articles they have contributed to this book. In this new and appalling situation, I can only offer the watchword which I learned years ago from a Spanish trade unionist from the coal mines of Asturias: in the modern world, we have two choices: be active, or be radio-active. The imperative to get active is more valid today than ever before. Webster Griffin Tarpley Washington, DC March 2008"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Introduction: Obama: a CIA People Power Coup, USA, 2008 Youth, youth, springtime of beauty. — “Giovinezza,” It alian fascist song, 1921 The need for this book became evident to me between Sunday January 6 and Monday January 7, 2008, that is to say, during the interval between this year’s January 3 Iowa caucus and the January 8 New Hampshire primary. From my vantage point in Washington, I was in communication with a group of friends who were making a programmatic intervention into the New Hampshire political and media circus around the idea of a five-year compulsory freeze on foreclosures of primary residences, farms, hospitals, public utilities, transportation companies, and factories. These friends were holding a press conference in Manchester, while actively buttonholing and lobbying the staffs of the various presidential campaigns then active in New Hampshire, urging them to adopt and support the five-year ban on foreclosures as the centerpiece of their own approach for dealing with the current George Bush economic depression. At the same time, I was in frequent contact with my old friend Franco Macchi, who has for many decades maintained an unparalleled overview of the world strategic situation, supplemented by extensive on the ground experience in Central Europe, in the Balkans, and in regard to Russia. My friends in New Hampshire told me of the stunned disorientation, demoralization, and drift among members of the Hillary Clinton campaign as it straggled in from New Hampshire on Friday, January 4 and attempted to pivot into the urgent tasks of the New Hampshire primary. My friends learned that the internal polling of the Clinton campaign in Iowa had indicated that Hillary was on her way to winning the caucuses, and that this erroneous finding had been aggressively asserted by the marplot Mark Penn down to the moment when it was overwhelmed by caucus returns showing that Senator"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 13 Clinton had in fact been defeated not just by Obama, but by Senator Edwards as well. As the weekend progressed, I supplemented these reports by monitoring CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News Channel. It quickly became evident that all the networks were in the grip of the most intense outburst of media hysteria observed since the aftermath of September 11, 2001. The target of their vituperation was Mrs. Clinton, whom they demanded must immediately cease her campaign and drop out of contention for the presidency. Hour by hour, Mrs. Clinton was submerged by a rising tide of the vilest verbal abuse. The object of their adulation was the leptic figure of a certain Barack Obama, a little-known Senator from Illinois with no known accomplishments or loyalties who was beginning to make a reputation for himself as a mob orator. For Obama, the television commentators were forecasting immediate transfiguration, ascension, and apotheosis. For Senator Edwards, the strongest economic populist in the Democratic field, the media had only indifference and oblivion. I had tried to get Congressman Kucinich to address issues of 9/11 truth, as well as the colossal scandal of the rogue B-52, which had flown from North Dakota to Louisiana at the end of August with six nuclear cruise missiles on board, outside of the normal legal channels of the US Air Force. Congressman Kucinich and Senator Gravel had been unable or unwilling to address the issue of the rogue B-52 in a series of Democratic candidates’ debates carried on nationwide cable television, with the national press present and paying attention. I had gone from attempting to push Kucinich into some kind of meaningful action related to emerging events on the Iran war front, to attempting to push Edwards, at least on paper the best economic populist left in the race, into a more aggressive stance on stopping foreclosures as a prelude to other New Deal measures to address the economic crisis, which was becoming acute towards the end of 2007. ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKI AND OBAMA At the same time, I was talking to Franco Macchi about what appeared to us to be the most dangerous foreign policy tendency common to the Democratic candidates, namely their tendency to adopt a line of militant confrontation with Russia and with Russian President Vladimir Putin in particular. In this context, my friend drew my attention to the fact that Zbigniew Brzezinski, the notorious Dr. Strangelove hawk and warmonger of the Cold War and an inveterate Russia hater, had a few months before openly assumed a position of dominance inside the Obama campaign by accepting the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 14 role of Obama’s chief foreign policy adviser. Brzezinski, of course, had long been infamous for his demonic role in the tragic foreign policy betrayals of the Carter administration between 1977 and 1981. A quick check revealed that Zbigniew Brzezinski and his son Mark Brzezinski were shaping Obama’s entire public profile along the lines suggested by Zbigniew’s most recent books. Zbig’s daughter Mika Brzezinski was churning out the Obama line every morning on MSNBC. A pattern was emerging. However, I still believed that Sen. Clinton was the flagship candidate of the Wall Street finance establishment. That notion was about to be violently swept aside by emerging events. By midday of Monday, January 7, the media pressure for Mrs. Clinton to terminate her campaign and abort the entire multi-month primary process of the Democratic Party had reached grotesque dimensions. The television networks were reporting public opinion polls that indicated that Obama was on his way to crushing Senator Clinton and Senator Edwards in an epic landslide in the New Hampshire primary scheduled for the following day, thus rendering their continuance in the campaign a futile gesture. At the same time, the networks were also filling their screens with the images of the large crowds waiting outside Obama’s campaign rallies all over New Hampshire. The corporate media were hyping Obama’s slogans of “hope” and of “change we can believe in.” The most obscene media swoon of recent decades was reaching the point of paroxysm. Given the realities of the US oligarchical system as I had studied them in connection with the events of September 11, 2001, it was clear that one of the great intelligence community mobilizations of the decade was in progress. What was being shown on television was no longer the standard coverage of a normal political campaign, but rather a propaganda exercise within the framework of a CIA covert operation. The controlled corporate media wanted Obama nominated by accolade, by acclamation, by the mob of swarming adolescents. He was being offered not a public office but a crown – better yet, an apotheosis. For the media whores, the reign of the new Messiah was beginning. POSTMODERN COUP D’ETAT À LA KIEV 2004 A coup d’état, in short, was in progress. But it was not the coup d’état of the Greek colonels, nor of Pinochet in Chile. It was not a right-wing coup at all, and it was not violent — at least, not initially."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 15 This was a coup d’état with leftist and progressive overtones, carried out not by a junta of elderly reactionary generals, but rather by a slick young demagogue of the center-left who advanced surrounded by swarms of youthful and enthusiastic devotees. It resembled nothing so much as the so-called Orange Revolution which had taken place in Kiev, in the Ukraine, in the late fall and early winter of 2004. That Orange Revolution, as informed observers knew very well, had been the result of a cynical destabilization of Ukraine by US and British intelligence — especially by the National Endowment for Democracy, the various Soros foundations, Gene Sharp’s Albert Einstein Institute, and other entities that we may refer to for the sake of brevity and clarity as the privatized or quasi-governmental left wing of the US intelligence community or left CIA in the post-1982 era of President Reagan’s Executive Order 12333. The 2004 Orange Revolution was not a unique event, but had been preceded by similar exercises in destabilization and subversion, especially in the former Warsaw Pact and Soviet spaces. These have included the successful so-called Bulldozer Revolution in Belgrade, Serbia in 2000 and the Roses revolution in Tiflis, Georgia in 2003. There had been an attempt at a Cedars Revolution in Lebanon in 2006, but it had been blocked by the organized mass mobilization capacity of Hezbollah. Another attempted coup in Belarus in 2001 had also been defeated by that nation’s government. All of these coups had several features in common. They were always built around a telegenic demagogue. They always featured fake public opinion polling, often combined with outright vote fraud. They required huge sums of money and abundant supplies of narcotics to fuel them. They featured large mobs, composed especially of politically naïve and suggestible young people, who would demonstrate and camp out in public squares to support the demands of the coup. They presupposed a significant control over television, radio, key Internet sites, and other media, which were used to project and portray the youthful mob of swarming adolescents as the authentic expression of the will of the whole people. They all arrived after a period of suffocating repression, which they opportunistically exploited to introduce a new order which was not much better, and which generally became radically worse, than the pre-coup status quo. They had trademarks, logos, slogans, and jingles straight from Madison Avenue: “It’s enough!” chanted one. “He’s finished!” screamed another. One was called Resistance. One was Orange. One was a red, red rose. Obama’s color was blue, no doubt to"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 1 6 reflect his cool detachment from the partisan fray. Another had the green of the cedar tree. All of them somehow ended up by installing into power NATO agents and greedy kleptocrats in the service of banks located in Wall Street and the City of London. POSTMODERN FASCISM: THE SHOCK OF RECOGNITION, JANUARY 7, 2008 All of these thoughts came together in my mind as I viewed the images of an Obama rally on MSNBC. It was the early afternoon of Monday, January 7, 2008. “My God!” I exclaimed. “It’s a color revolution in the US!” It was indeed an attempted color revolution, organized in the form of a surprise attack. At this point, my entire political orientation began to change rapidly. As 2007 had come to an end, I had repeatedly told my weekly radio audiences on the Genesis Communications Network that the two most important goals in the upcoming primary season were first of all to defeat Mayor Giuliani as the most dangerous Republican candidate, surrounded as he was by the entire gaggle of discredited and demented neocon warmongers. My second goal had been to deny Mrs. Clinton the Democratic presidential nomination, based on her stubborn support for the lunatic military adventure in Iraq, and her hostile attitude towards Iran. She further appeared to be the consensus candidate of the Wall Street banking establishment. The evidence available just after midday on January 7, 2008 clearly showed that this second point, however plausible it might have seemed during the course of 2007, was no longer applicable. It was now evident that Mrs. Clinton had become the object of the universal execration and obloquy of the controlled corporate media. The press whores were attempting to tear her to pieces. A massive mobilization of intelligence community assets against Mrs. Clinton was in progress. At the same time, it was now clear that the candidate of Wall Street and of the intelligence community was none other than the unknown outsider Obama, who was suddenly revealed as a typical photogenic demagogue from Brzezinski’s central casting department. The mass hysteria generated by Obama’s joint appearances with the New Age billionairess celebrity Oprah Winfrey now revealed its sinister purpose: it was in every way a coup d’état. All of this required me to reverse my political field immediately. My priorities had to be reordered, and radically. I needed to shift"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 1 7 target at once. I needed to focus on the most dangerous oligarchical and imperialist threat. In a naval battle, it makes no sense to scatter one’s fire haphazardly among the ships of the opposing fleet. It is far better to concentrate one’s attacks on the enemy’s flagship. There was now no doubt who this was. OBAMA’S HANDLERS: THE BRZEZINSKI CLIQUE I had been studying Obama’s advisers, handlers, and controllers. In about 20 minutes I was able to assemble a rogue’s gallery of these figures with a brief note about their main strategic obsession. First on the list was of course the unreconstructed cold warrior Zbigniew Brzezinski, with his fanatical commitment to promote confrontation with Russia, the greatest of all possible lunacies, worse than the neocon plans for mucking around in the Middle East. Then came Mark Brzezinski, in pursuit of the same goal. Then came Susan Rice, infamous for wanting to bomb Sudan. Then came Richard Clarke, the originator of the absurd myth of 9/11. Then came Dennis Ross, more effective in undermining the Arab world because of the vague left cover he enjoyed. People had seen George W. Bush burst onto the scene in 2000 with his mantra of being a uniter and not a divider, a compassionate conservative, and a supporter of a foreign policy based on humility. The horrors of Bush had been on display for almost 8 years. The lesson of 2000 had been that the reassuring promises of a candidate with no track record and no accomplishments were far less important than the careful study of the handlers, advisors, controllers, and backers, since these were destined to become the White House palace guard of the new regime. Surely the people who had been so cruelly deceived by Bush would have the sense to look beyond Obama’s messianic and utopian verbiage to see the reality of the revanchist Brzezinski clique pu lling the candidate’s strings. The resulting instant leaflet was distributed to the entire Edwards campaign bus, to some of Senator Clinton’s most important advisors, and to a number of journalists and television commentators. That was the beginning of a campaign of mass political education about the urgent danger posed by the Obama campaign – an educational campaign which this book hopes to continue.

It is no coincidence that massive efforts are being undertaken in the current time to obfuscate and confuse popular understanding of what fascism was. One of the most absurd of these attempts is the book Liberal Fascism by the reactionary Republican and neocon Jonah Goldberg, the son of the old reactionary battle axe Lucianne Goldberg, the sponsor of military intelligence figure Linda Tripp during the impeachment campaign against Bill Clinton. Goldberg’s doltish thesis is that whenever government intervenes in the economy, fascism results. This idiotic viewpoint would make both Alexander Hamilton and Abraham Lincoln into dyed in the wool goose-steppers. For Goldberg, the essence of fascism in our own time is naturally to be sought in the Franklin D. Roosevelt New Deal — this despite the fact that the New Deal was a vital factor in the defeat of fascism back here in the real world. Goldberg’s book is so grotesque a tissue of distortions that one is forced to conclude that such a hack job must have been ordered up by the intelligence community for the express purpose of disorienting public opinion on this very important question, precisely at the moment when Obama’s ascendancy would begin to force many serious and intelligent people to begin rethinking the question of fascism. For our purposes here, we need to look at fascism most of all as a political phenomenon, and this means fascism as a mass movement. The average American thinks of fascism as bureaucratic-authoritarian form of police state dictatorship which becomes more and more oppressive and stifling until it reaches the point where it can be called fascist. The resulting notion of fascism as the extreme form of oppressive top-down dictatorship is a complete and total misconception of how fascism comes about, and one of the most dangerous delusions possible in the current situation. If fascism meant nothing more than tyranny, oppression, dictatorship, and police state, it would never have been necessary to introduce a special new term of fascism in the years following World War I. Terms like police state dictatorship would have been more than enough. But fascism was something very different. FASCISM AS A GRASS ROOTS MASS MOVEMENT RUN BY BANKERS Fascism was not what most readers think. In its origins, fascism takes the form of a mass movement. Fascism started as a political protest movement at the grassroots level, an anti-establishment, anti-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 19 authoritarian, and anti-parliamentary movement with radical cover and indeed with left cover. It started in the streets, or better yet, in the gutter. It did not start with bureaucrats issuing arrest warrants from government offices. It started with fervently idealistic young students, and then brutal thugs carrying truncheons, clubs, and firearms on their way to do battle with their political enemies, and quite often with the police. Fascism was an affair of hooligans, goons, gangsters, and fanatics. It was the specialty of ragtag storm troopers. It was the political theater of Mussolini’s march on Rome in 1922. The bulk of fascism’s forces came from parts of the middle class who had been driven insane by economic crisis and by military defeat, and many were disgruntled war veterans. The rebellious despair of these social groups was the soil from which fascism grew. Of course, after fascism took power it became more and more evident that this radical, grassroots, anti-establishment, anti-politician protest movement had not been spontaneous at all, but had been carefully and artificially orchestrated by the most prominent bankers and their political operatives. Fascism established itself by attacking, harassing, and crushing the main political institutions of society which opposed it, most especially the left wing political parties, trade unions, independent newspapers, and independent organizations of all types. After it had seized power, fascism tended to eliminate its own radical and mass movement dimensions, sometimes with direct murderous violence, and then to solidify and consolidate itself into a top-down police state dictatorship. But it must not be forgotten that such a relatively stable police state dictatorship could never have been created without the ability of a fascist mass movement first to systematically destroy all forms of organized political resistance inside the society in a way that the police and the secret police simply could not do, in which the army could never have been trusted to undertake. But while many scholars focus their attention on the ossified end product of fascism as an accomplished police state dictatorship, for us today it is imperative to understand it in statu nascenti, as the beginnings of fascism as a bottom up mass movement fomented by bankers for the purpose of mobilizing society for economic sacrifice, for fanaticism, and for war. FASCISM HAD LEFT RADICAL ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT COVER The radical, anti-establishment, and leftist overtones of fascism may be the hardest for the present day American to grasp. Mussolini,"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 20 Hitler, Franco, and their ilk appear in retrospect as right wing extremists of the most exasperated type. But it should be recalled that Mussolini in his early career as a socialist, and that even Hitler insisted on calling his movement national socialism. There was a reason for this, and it was to recruit any and all disaffected anti- establishment and anti-politician forces into the new movement, including those coming from leftist backgrounds, no matter how antithetical and contradictory they might be among themselves. Mussolini and Hitler both claimed to be the real revolution, not the fake revolution that had been manifested as betrayal of the workers by corrupt socialist party and union bosses. The question of the fascist mass movement is the essential one. Anybody can become an individual fascist anytime they decide to do so. It is fair to say that Bush and Cheney have the mentality of fascists and are fascists, but this should not obscure the fact that they do not have a fascist mass movement and could almost never be capable of creating one. Fascist leaders have to be charismatic, energetic, feral, cunning, brutal, and eloquent. Bush is a class A war criminal, but he could hardly make it as the leader of a fascist mass movement. His shortcomings as an orator are alone sufficient to rule him out. So when Keith Olberman chose to denounce Bush as a fascist just as a number of commentators were beginning to notice the parallels between an Obama rally and a Mussolini balcony speech, we must suspect that this star of the Brzezinski network MSNBC was acting in bad faith, seeking not to educate his viewers about the essence of fascism, but rather seeking to confuse them on this score. The point is that Obama brings together more of the characteristic features of fascism than any other political figure on the current US scene either now or in living memory. This need not mean that Obama represents the culmination or endpoint of fascist development in this country today. Obama may well be the John the Baptist of postmodern fascism, destined to fall by the wayside and be supplanted by a larger figure who may well build on the rage and bitterness of Obama’s disappointed followers. It does mean that the Obama candidacy already represents a significant step in the direction of postmodern fascism. Consider this series of names: Nitti, Giolitti, Bonomi, and Facta. If you do not know who they are, then you should admit to yourself that you know almost nothing about the genesis of Italian fascism in the years following World War I. These are the names of the Italian prime ministers who were in power in the years of economic crisis"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 21 and national convulsion preceding Mussolini’s march on Rome in October 1922. Some of them, most notably Facta, were parliamentary cretins and nonentities. Giolitti, by contrast, was a politician of real substance and merit who had helped Italy develop modern railroads, modern industries, and a modern merchant marine, and who had fought to save his country from the incalculable folly of intervening in World War I on the side of the British and French. Whatever his faults, Giolitti can be considered at the very least as the lesser evil of the Old Order in Italy at that time, in something of the same way that the Clintons would have to be considered as a lesser evil in comparison with Bush the elder, Bob Dole, and Bush the younger. Several years went by after 1922 before most Italians realized that all the governments up to and including Facta had represented one thing, but that the country had gone off a cliff with Mussolini as far as political life and the rule of law were concerned. It was the fascist seizure of power of October 1922 which marked the great point of no return, the great watershed, even though this had not been obvious to many in real time. BRÜNING, VON PAPEN, VON SCHLEICHER... Here is another series of names: Brüning, von Papen, von Schleicher. If you do not know who these people are, then you know absolutely nothing about the origins of the more extreme German form of fascism which built on the experience of the Italian original, and which is called Nazism. These are the names of the German chancellors in the period of acute economic depression in Germany leading up to Hitler’s seizure of power in January 1933. Brüning ruled the longest, holding on to power for about two years, ruling by emergency decree with the help of President Hindenburg, and imposing a series of brutal austerity measures against the wages, the unemployment benefits, and the standard of living of Germany’s working people. By now, people had been watching events in Italy long enough to know that there was such a thing as fascism, and many of Brüning’s enemies claimed that his government was already fascism. It quickly became clear that this had been a very foolish exaggeration indeed. After Brüning came von Papen, a reactionary scoundrel who helped open the door to Hitler. The best of the lot was von Schleicher, a maverick general with progressive ideas who wanted to start an ambitious program of public works and infrastructure building to fight the depression and put people back to work. But von Schleicher"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 22 was ousted before his programs could take hold, and was later murdered by Hitler. It was only after Hitler’s seizure of power that the German political world recognized that he represented a dramatic, acute, and qualitative deterioration of the political life of the country. A reign of terror began immediately. All opposition and worker’s parties were outlawed, and members of the parliament belonging to them were expelled. Trade unions were also outlawed, and their offices and property seized or destroyed. The offices and printing plants of opposition newspapers were attacked and burned down, often by mobs of storm troopers acting outside of the law. Many of those who had been preaching that Brüning already represented fascism were now looking back fondly on Brüning’s time in office as the good old days. Brüning appeared in retrospect as an authoritarian who had been overthrown by a fascist. These were not the same thing, and there was no doubt which was worse. Some observers realized after the fact that there was indeed an immense qualitative difference between just another bourgeois regime, no matter how bellicose, no matter how reactionary, no matter how oppressive, no matter how corrupt, and a fascist regime that could act outside the law and use its mass movement to mobilize active enthusiastic public support, and which could deploy its brown- shirted goons and fanatics, to crush opposition without worrying about arrest warrants and death sentences. The point of this brief overview is to show that for many of its victims, the real nature of fascism revealed itself as a very unpleasant surprise, and that this revelation occurred only after fascism had taken power. In its beginning phases, fascism often appeared to naïve observers as a movement promising idealism, national unity, an end to political squabbling, parliamentary haggling, and class struggle, plus reform, moral renewal, and a decisive break with the corrupt and discredited practices of the existing political order. To some, it even appeared as a liberating force which appealed to young people and the best and most active parts of the nation. In a somewhat later phase, when the fascist dictators had fully consolidated their power and they decided to take the path of military aggression, it was found that the institutions which might have served as focal points for resistance simply did not exist any more, because those old institutions have been demolished by the fascists, who had not allowed any forms of independent organization to survive in society. If a President Obama calls the American people to war with"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 23 Pakistan, with China, with Russia, we may see his hysterical lemming legions mobilize to beat up congressmen and crush antiwar demonstrators who dare to oppose the decrees of the Perfect Master. Those who have followed this far can perhaps see that distinct analogies are emerging between post-World War I Italy and the United States of today. These go beyond real or imagined military defeat and severe economic crisis and also include political phenomena, most notably Obamism. For the more than two thirds of the American people who have spent a considerable part of the past eight years hating, disliking, or resenting Bush and Cheney, it may sound heretical digest that there could be anything worse than this bankrupt regime. But we can assure you that there are alternatives that are much worse, infinitely worse. THE BUSH NEOCONS: BEYOND THE POINT OF DIMINISHING RETURNS The current setup featuring Bush, Cheney, and their gaggle of neocons has pretty much come to the end of the road as far as functioning as an effective organizing center for Anglo-American imperialism is concerned. The neocon method has long since passed the point of diminishing returns. Their arguments and tricks are stale and predictable. The US and British economies are collapsing. Their armies are defeated and demoralized. They are increasingly isolated in international affairs. They are objects of widespread hatred and suspicion in the world, and such allies as they have are thoroughly disaffected. Their vassals and satraps are in various stages of rebellion. Their adversaries are becoming more organized every day, most notably in such world alliances as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. The most immediate issue for the City of London and for Wall Street is to maintain Anglo-American world domination in the face of numerous challenges. They must maintain their monetary and financial hegemony, restore their diplomatic credibility, regroup and rebuild their military forces, refurbish their alliances, intimidate their satraps and vassals back into obedience, and prepare for a showdown with such recalcitrant superpowers as Russia and China. With Bush- Cheney or McCain, they have only a very limited chance of accomplishing any of this."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 24 OBAMA AS A FACELIFT FOR A COLLAPSING EMPIRE An Obama presidency, by contrast, would give Anglo-American imperialism a breathing spell, a second wind, a facelift, and a new lease on life. If Obama were not available, the elitist bankers would have had to invent him. And in fact, they did invent him, probably starting as much as a quarter of a century ago when Obama and Zbigniew Brzezinski were both on the campus of Columbia University in New York City in 1981-1983. Consider for a moment what might happen if a reinvigorated labor movement were to stage a series of militant strikes designed to win real increases in wages, benefits, and working conditions in a high profile confrontation with management where success would soon prompt all kinds of working people to demand similar improvements in their situations as well. How effective could George Bush be as a strike breaker, given the fact that he is actively despised by a large minority and disliked by about two thirds of the US population? It is quite possible that any strikebreaking efforts on the part of Bush would lead to an explosive general strike that would be totally beyond the control of the current hegemonic US institutions. The moribund US labor movement might well rise up and reassert itself after more than three decades of defeat and retreat. Contrast this with the ability of a possible Obama presidency to turn the majority of the population against the strikers by appealing to the higher need to bring all Americans together. It is clear that Obama would have a far greater chance of functioning as an effective strike breaker. Or, take the case of the new false flag terror attack which the Anglo-American ruling elite wishes to blame on Russia, China, or some other formidable foreign power against whom they wish to inflame and incite the English-speaking world. Imagine a solemn television address to the nation delivered by Bush. It is likely that more than half of the US population would not believe Bush’s arguments and might reject his calls for mobilization and sacrifice, while a sizable minority would immediately and openly accuse Bush of being involved in the preparation and execution of the false flag attack. Since the fall of the neofascist Aznar regime in Spain in March of 2004, the Anglo-American ruling class has lived in fear of a potent Spanish-style reaction to their next false flag stunt, in which the target population, instead of blaming the scapegoats and bogeymen identified by the regime, prefer to concentrate their wrath on the incompetent politicians who have allowed the terrorism to take"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 25 place, and who may even have artificially created it. Consider then, by contrast a similar televised address to the nation carried out by Obama in the wake of the same false flag attack. It is clear that Obama would succeed in duping a far higher percentage of the US population than the despised discredited Bush. These are the sorts of considerations which have impelled the Anglo-American ruling class to consider turning over a new leaf, in the form of a new demagogic profile for their entire worldwide political operations — a policy shift aimed not at peace or real cooperation, but rather at the more effective waging of war, including economic and cultural warfare. When an imperialist system faces an array of crises like the one which is presently enveloping the Anglo-American world system, even the short term survival of that imperialism will tend to require forms of totalitarian mobilization which are exceedingly difficult to implement by means of top-down coercion alone, and which are much more efficient if they can be based on the voluntary assent and willing or even enthusiastic mobilization of the masses. This is the area where fascist methods provide a very obvious and substantial advantage in comparison with the crude dragooning which a mere top-down dictatorial police state can provide. Under fascism, an ideologized and self-mobilized population can be made to police itself, at least for a time. This begins perhaps to explain why a figure such as Obama can exercise such an appeal to a ruling elite in crisis like the Anglo-American bankers of today. No ruling class begins to consider a fascist transformation except in moments of grave crisis. The ruling class must be desperate enough so as to be willing to jettison many of the traditional forms of their political domination and create something that will at least look like a mass movement, which always implies some risk that the mass movement will get out of hand. In addition, the ruling class will have to grant a measure of apparent political power to persons whom they consider gutter elements and whose presence they would tend not to tolerate except for counterinsurgency purposes in extremis. The level of understanding concerning the real nature of fascism on the part of the American public today is abysmally low, tending toward zero. Accordingly, it will be useful at this point to sample some recent scholarly writings which point out some of the features of historical fascist mass movements, especially during their initial, radical, anti-establishment mass movement phase."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 2 6 FASCISM: THE LEADER AS THE GENERAL WILL In his essay entitled “Towards a General Theory of Fascism,” George L. Mosse noted that both communism and fascism “were based on the ideal, however distorted, of popular sovereignty. This meant rejection of parliamentary government and representative institutions on behalf of the democracy of the masses in which the people directly governed themselves. The leaders symbolized the people, he expressed the ‘general will’ — but such a democracy meant that, instead of representative assemblies, a new secular religion mediated between people and leaders, providing, at the same time, an instrument of social control over the masses. It was expressed on the public level through official ceremonies, festivals, and not least, imagery, and other private level control over all aspects of life by the dictates of the single political party.” [Mosse in Roger Griffin, ed., International Fascism: Theories, Causes and the New Consensus (London: Arnold, 1998), 138] Fascism exalted the spirit of wartime camaraderie which had reigned among the troops in the trenches of World War I, where class divisions in class conflicts with supposedly submerged in dedication to the survival of the nation and its defense. Whatever their material circumstances, the brutalized victims of the war desperately sought for comradeship and leadership, “also to counteract their sense of isolation within a nation which had not lived up to their expectations.” (Mosse in Griffin 142) Mosse’s writings on Nazism focus on fascism’s attempt to prolong the wartime idea communitarianism based on affinity rather than external coercion. This is the kind of togetherness which we hear so much of today on the part of a candidate whose central pledge is to bring the people together. THE DIALECTIC OF HOPE AND DESPAIR IN FASCISM If Obama talks of hope, we must assume that the Trilateral-Ford Foundation focus groups have shown the prevalence of despair among the American people, a despair that must be related to feelings of loneliness and isolation on the part of many Americans. Fascism may be thought of as an expression of pervasive cultural-historical as well as personal despair, with the individual deciding to seek a way out of the despair by a flight forward into fanatical and mindless activism."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 2 7 Fascism also placed much stress on “the national past and the mystical community of the nation, emphasis upon that middle-class respectability which proved essential for political success. The ‘cult element’ ... gave direction by channeling attention towards the eternal verities which must never be forgotten. Activism there must be, activism was essential, but it had to focus upon the leader who would direct it into the proper ‘eternal’ channels. The liturgical element must be mentioned... for the ‘eternal verities’ were purveyed and reinforced through the endless repetition of slogans, choruses, symbols and participation in mass ceremony. These are the techniques which went into the taming of the revolution and which made Fascism a new religion with rites long familiar through centuries of religious observance. Fascist mass meetings seemed something new, but in reality contained predominantly traditional elements in technique as well as in ideology.” Fascism boasted that by using these means, it was waging a “war on alienation.” (Mosse in Griffin 142) Alienation can be thought of as the widespread sense that one’s life is so dominated, controlled, and manipulated by outside forces that it is no longer one’s own. The irony of fascism’s claims to assuage this sense of alienation is that when a person joins a political movement for the purpose of attaining immediate emotional relief and satisfaction, the level of subjective alienation experienced may indeed become less painful – but at the same time, the objective alienation of the person is maximized, since he or she is now a dupe and pawn, mere cannon fodder, for the fascist demagogue and above all for the cynical financiers who have concocted the fascist movement in the first place. As Mosse wrote in his book on Nazism, all fascism promised an end to alienation and indeed “Hitler had a very startling passage in Mein Kampf where he says that when a man comes out of his factory and into a mass movement he becomes a part of a community and ends his alienation.” (Tarchi in Griffin 267-268) Members of fascist mass movements are seeking emotional satisfactions in the midst of a bleak, desperate, and collapsing world. Can 2008 be compared with 1931 in this regard? “Fascism was everywhere an ‘attitude towards life,’ based upon the national mystique which might vary from nation to nation.... It [sought] to escape concrete economic and social change by a retreat into ideology: the ‘revolution of the spirit’ of which Mussolini spoke.... it encouraged activism, the fight against the existing order of things.” (Mosse in Griffin 145)"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 28 FASCISM AND THE YEARNING FOR COMMUNITY AND TOGETHERNESS Over all of its constituent elements fascism threw “the mantle of a community conceived as sharing a national past, present, and future — a community which was not enforced but ‘natural,’ ‘genuine,’ and with its own organic strength and life, analogous to nature. The tree became the favorite symbol, but the native landscape or the ruins of the past were also singled out as exemplifying on one level the national community, a human collectivity represented by the Fascist party.” (Mosse in Griffin 145) The supporters of fascist movements wanted someone who could bring them together, and that turned out to be Mussolini and his imitators. Other commentators have seen in fascism an attempted answer to a crisis in the mechanisms by which society imbues and endows life and its components with meaning. Gerald Platt writes: “...the most significant analytic point presented here is that through an empirical investigation of ideology we may develop a set of language rules that act as orienting principles for ideological adherents in constructing a viable world in the face of a sense-making crisis.” (Platt in Griffin 212) Klaus Theweleit discusses “the basis on which the typically fascist relation between desire and politics arises: politics is made subject to direct libidinal investment, with no detours, no imprints of mama- papa, no encodings through conventions, institutions, or the historical situation. Under fascism the most common form of the ‘I’ is as a component within a larger totality-ego — the ‘I’ as ‘we,’ pitted in opposition to the rest of the world, the whole starry galaxy.... This, then, is ‘megalomania’ — the desire of men to shake off what they consider to be meaningless parental origins – ‘history will absolve me.’ These men desire to execute a hidden design of history from a position of dominance within the largest of all imaginable symbiotic unities: ‘I /We’ and History. ‘Freedom.’” (Theweleit in Griffin 223- 224) Dr. Justin Fran correctly diagnosed Bush as a megalomaniac, but Bush has no monopoly on this disorder. What are the implications of a mass movement infected with collective megalomania which succeeds in taking power? Gene Sharp, Soros, and Brzezinski have organized people power coups tinted in orange, red, and many other colors, but the original fascists were way ahead of them. After World War I, there existed Mussolini’s blackshirts, the German brownshirts, the Romanian green"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 29 shirts, and the Irish blue shirts, not to mention the Silver shirts here in the US. In an essay entitled “Between Festival and Revolution,” the Italian Marco Tarchi, a writer initially sympathetic to fascism, writes: “The profound sense of spiritual, human community fostered by the experiences of camaraderie pervades the anti-Marxist and anti- democratic movements of the immediate postwar [i.e., post-1918] period to the point of forming a distinctive feature of the ideology, one expressed in a whole series of external signs which bring the militants together, unify their style, and try to win the attention, and than the active support, of sympathizers. The whole symbology which typifies Fascism conforms to this logic. The shirts of various colors which movements, akin but originating in different national and cultural contexts, adopt as an external uniform epitomize this discourse.... the problem of alienation caused by the uprooting of individuals and families from their natural, traditional environment, the consequence of a progressive process of urbanization, commercialization, and industrialization, is resolved in the new community, no longer taken for granted as something hereditary, but achieved through an act of the will.” (Tarchi in Griffin 268) “The fascination of the ideal community envisaged by the nascent fascist movements is twofold: on the one hand, it presents itself as the agent of dissolution for social bonds judged to be anachronistic, such as those of profession or ‘class;’ on the other, it is to act as a binding force in the name of reality which is no longer and not only material. The result of this mixture the shattering.... the fascist parties, typical movement-parties, thus came into being as... ‘community parties,’ in other words parties whose membership was not motivated by material interests, but by spiritual motives, my instinctive impulses, by demands of idealism.” The community which the fascists sought was “generated by the irrational, non-utilitarian, organic will, the motor of every act and source of every creation.... The modern world, by stressing its own technical and utilitarian character, tends to reduce the sphere of the organic, qualitative, spontaneous, pluralist, ‘natural’ will ....” (Tarchi in Griffin 269-270) Obama supporters constantly cite their desire to restore admiration and respect for the United States in the eyes of the world community. Such concern for restoring the fullest possible great power status for one’s own country is a typical, primordial theme of Italian and German fascism. These older fascisms were responding to military defeat, the denied fruits of victory, and generally to the poor treatment they felt their countries had received at the great world summit"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 30 conference of the age, the Versailles Peace Conference of 1919. Today’s Obama supporters seem to regard restoring the US position in the world as a purely cosmetic exercise in foreign relations; they do not for example propose to abandon the practice of constant meddling and interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states which has characterized Bush-Cheney-neocon practice. If anything, the Obamakins want to increase such meddling. Obama’s base enthusiastically supports US aggression against Sudan, under the pretext of protecting the southern Sudanese from alleged Chinese “ethnocide.” In reality, such an attack would aim at cutting off Chinese access to Sudanese oil in the framework of Brzezinski’s strategy of isolating and encircling the Middle Kingdom. Obama’s base strongly supports the Tibetan insurrection of the feudal monster and CIA/MI-6/NATO provocateur calling himself the Dalai Lama. Once again, the issue is alleged ethnocide by tampering with traditional Tibetan feudalism, which kept 90% of the population as serfs, 5% as slaves, and 4% as parasitical monks who did not teach or maintain hospitals but who demanded economic and sexual feudal dues from the serfs. We should also take into account Obama’s successful demand for US state sponsored terrorism in the form of unilateral killing of Pakistanis in the northwest frontier area, where CIA Predator drones have now declared open season on the local population, killing dozens in January, February, and March 2008 without permission from the government in Islamabad. Obama’s striking ability to transform anti-war left liberals into ferocious backers of war with Sudan, with Pakistan, and with China gives some idea of why Obama has been chosen by the Trilaterals to mobilize the United States for total war. FROM SCHOPENHAUER TO NIETZSCHE It may also be useful to illustrate the difference between authoritarian dictatorship on the one hand and Fascism on the other using examples from philosophy, specifically the transition from Schopenhauer (1788-1860) to Nietzsche (1844-1900). These are two German philosophers of the 19th century. One of the best discussions of this transition is the one offered more than half a century ago by the Hungarian Marxist Georg Lukacs. Lukacs sees both Schopenhauer and Nietzsche as right-wing extremists, reactionaries, and enemies of human progress in general. But there is a difference in the way that these two philosophers act out their right wing extremist sentiments. Schopenhauer is a pessimist and a cynic who"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 31 expresses reactionary opinions and supports reactionary causes, but does this most of the time from the comfort of his easy chair. His support for right-wing extremist thinking is expressed in his writings and speeches, but he tended not to espouse specific causes and stayed aloof from party politics. Lukacs views this as a passive acceptance of reactionary rule. Nietzsche, by contrast, is much more interested in motivating his readers to actively support the cause of reaction. He wants to mobilize them for militant action, for energetic participation, and finally for the wars which he felt were looming on the horizon of his time. Today, Schopenhauer is relatively obscure, but Nietzsche remains popular and influential, at least among intellectuals. It is also important to note that the Nazi regime in Germany claimed Nietzsche as one of its ideological precursors, and this claim is solidly justified. Concerning Schopenhauer, Lukacs writes: “We have thus reached the philosophical heart of Schopenhauer’s philosophy — pessimism. It is through pessimism that Schopenhauer became the leading philosopher of the second half of the 19th century. Through pessimism, Schopenhauer was able to found a new type of apologetics. He was the founder, but nothing more. We will see later, especially in our treatment of Nietzsche, that Schopenhauer’s form of indirect apologetics represents only the initial stage of this philosophical genre. The reason for this is that Schopenhauer’s approach, which involves the renunciation of all social action since social action is viewed as futile, and which implies even more the abandonment of any attempt to change society, is only sufficient for the needs of the bourgeoisie of the pre-imperialist period. This was a time of general economic expansion, in which the rejection of political action corresponded to the level of class struggle and to the needs of the ruling class. In the imperialist epoch, although this tendency by no means completely disappears, the social task of reactionary philosophy goes much further: now philosophy must mobilize people for the active support of imperialism it is in this sense that Nietzsche surpasses Schopenhauer, even though Nietzsche, in his role as indirect apologist of a more developed stage, never stops being Schopenhauer’s student and disciple. Thus, pessimism means in the first place the philosophical assertion of the meaninglessness of all political action; that is indeed the social function of this level of indirect apologetics.” (Lukacs, The Destruction of Reason [Neuwied am Rhein: Luchterhand, 1962], p. 182)"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 32 With Nietzsche, we come to forms of pessimism and despair so profound that they kick over from passive cynicism into frenetic nihilistic activism: “Schopenhauer’s struggle against the progressive thought of his time could be summed up in the idea that all action is to be slandered as intellectually and morally valueless. In contrast to this comment, Nietzsche calls for active support for reactionary imperialism. From this follows that Nietzsche must set aside Schopenhauer’s entire dualism of imagination and will, and must replace the Buddhist myth of the will with the myth of the will to power. It also follows that Nietzsche can have no use for Schopenhauer’s abstract and general rejection of history. Naturally, neither Nietzsche nor Schopenhauer has any idea of what real history is. However, Nietzsche’s apologetics for a more aggressive stage of imperialism take the form of a mythologizing of history. Finally, since we can only briefly mention the most essential elements here, Schopenhauer’s apologetics are indirect in form, but he openly expresses his socially reactionary sympathies. In the case of Nietzsche, the principle of the indirect apologetic penetrates the method of presentation itself: his aggressively reactionary stance in favor of imperialism is expressed in the form of a hyper-revolutionary posturing. The struggle against democracy and socialism, the myth of imperialism, the call to a barbaric activism have to be presented as an unprecedented upheaval, as a revaluation of all values, as a twilight of the idols: it is the indirect apologetic of imperialism expressed as a demagogically effective pseudo-revolution.” (Lukacs, 280) Lukacs formulated the following warning to future generations which is highly relevant to ourselves at this juncture: “Every individual person and every people ought to try to learn something for their own survival out of the lesson which Hitler gave the world. And this responsibility is especially incumbent upon the philosophers, who are supposed to be committed to act as sentinels in regard to the existence and development of reason according to its real role in social development.... The philosophers have failed to fulfill this role both inside and outside of Germany. It may be true that up until now the words of [Goethe’s] Mephistopheles about the despairing Faust have not yet become true everywhere: Just hold reason and science in contempt, Those highest powers of humanity, And I will have you wholly in my power."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 33 But this still means that, if no transformation should intervene, that there is not the slightest guarantee for any other country in the imperialist economy, for any bourgeois intellectual culture under the dominance of irrationalism, that they will not be subjected tomorrow to some fascist devil, in comparison to whom even Hitler will look like a mere bungling beginner.” (Lukacs 83) Today universities are reputed to be centers of Obama’s support in the same way that universities were in fact centers of fascist agitation in the 1920s and 1930s – to remove some illusions in this regard, it is enough to recall Heidegger’s 1933 pro-Nazi inaugural address as Rector of the University of Freiburg im Breisgau, where he asserted that the die had been cast in favor of fascism in Germany since “the decision has already been made by the youngest part of the German nation.” Fascism is always likely to take the form of a youth movement, and so it is especially important that university intellectuals take an uncompromising antifascist stand today. SAMANTHA POWER: AMERICANS WANT TOTAL WAR To transport the Schopenhauer-Nietzsche comparison into our own time, we could say without too much distortion that the imperialist strategy of Bush and the neocons has much in common with the method of Schopenhauer, whereas Obama leans much more in the direction of Nietzsche and activism. From this point of view, we can see that the reactionary politics and bureaucratic-authoritarian repression of the Bush era demands little more from the vast majority of the subject population than a passive and resigned acceptance of the regime’s policies of foreign war and domestic police-state surveillance. From Bush and Cheney came no impassioned call for blood, sweat, and tears. They did not demand war time austerity, rationing, scrap metal drives, or strikebreaking specifically in the name of the war effort. They rejected proposals for a reinstitution of the military draft. Their notion of national mobilization for war was to appeal to the population to maintain high levels of consumer spending to keep the economy vibrant. They even offered tax cuts to the most opulent and parasitical elements of society. Bush and Cheney have always been criticized for their failure to exploit the events of September 11, 2001 to impose an economic regime of austerity, economic sacrifice, wage cuts, and the dramatic curtailment of the standard of living. This mentality is strongly represented in the Obama campaign. As part of her “monster” tirade to a British journalist, Obama’s foreign policy governess Samantha"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 34 Power delivered the following rant: “‘The Bush years have left the American people looking for visible change. There was this post- September 11th yearning, people were waiting for a call to do good - instead of getting the call we were told to go shopping. What the Obama movement has shown is that that yearning still exists in people.’ Despite wins in Ohio and Texas, she thinks Hillary Clinton lacks the idealism to inspire.” ( Daily Telegraph , March 8, 2008) Obama and Power evidently feel that the American people want total war, not just half-hearted little adventures. Implicit here is the notion that the Obama campaign holds Bush in contempt because of his failure to exploit the September 11 crisis in order to insist on a community of shared sacrifice and rigorous austerity, quite possibly including forms of compulsory national service, meaning in plain English forced labor, or even military conscription. Bush was like Schopenhauer; he was content to leave his supporters in this state of cynical passivity and consumerism, as long as they assented to his policies. Obama by contrast arrives on the scene with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan already irrevocably lost, with the United States in a position of strategic weakness and isolation, and above all with the economic and financial crisis of banking panic, hyperinflation, and the death agony of the United States dollar as a world reserve currency already the dominant realities of an imperialism which is incomparably worse off than it was in 2001. Obama therefore must demand something that goes far beyond the cynical and passive assent that was enough for Bush. OBAMA: ACTIVE MASS MOBILIZATION FOR IMPERIALISM The Obama campaign demands an active mobilization for international aggression, imperialist domination, and the drastic reduction of standards of living, including in the “homeland” itself. It is no longer enough to support the economy by going to the shopping mall in making purchases. It is now required that the US population actively embrace a stunning reduction of their standard of living and the further immiseration of whole sectors of US society. Carbon taxes will be imposed and cap and trade systems will be financed at public expense, all allegedly to save the planet from the horrors of global warming, even though any warming is overwhelmingly due to changes in solar activity. Compulsory national service and related forced labor schemes like the Green Corps will be set up to give concrete expression to the delirious youthful enthusiasm for Obama. Other taxes will be increased, even as hyperinflation devours more"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 35 and more of the average worker’s paycheck. Sacrifices will also be explained as necessary to tackle the problems of economic under development in the Third World. Naturally, all of the resources thus extracted and extorted from the US population will flow into the coffers of David Rockefeller, J.P. Morgan Chase, and the other Wall Street banking interests. In foreign affairs, it will no longer be enough for the US population to watch the bombing of Iraq or Afghanistan on television as if it were a video game. Larger and larger numbers of Americans will have to be mobilized for direct and active participation in the barbaric new campaigns now being planned on a scale surpassing the imagination of the neocons of 2001 to 2003. Bush offered shopping malls. Obama will demand a levée en masse, and mass mobilization for aggression, naturally under the cover of the loftiest ideals. Bush offered war profiteering and videogames. Obama will demand total war in the fullest sense of the term. FASCIST IDEOLOGUE MICHELLE OBAMA: “OUR SOULS ARE BROKEN” It is frequently Michelle Obama who hints in a cryptic and sinister undertone at the real goals of the Obama campaign. Since her own mind is a rage-filled postmodern multicultural ragbag of inchoate thoughts, she sometimes blurts out the program of the exercise of which she is a part. “Our souls are broken,” she said on one occasion. “And right now we need some inspiration. Inspiration and hope are not words. Everything begins and ends with hope. And the only person in this race who has a chance of getting us where we need to be is Barack Obama.” Where is it then that we need to be? On another occasion, she revealed that her husband was demanding that Americans not merely vote for him, but that they also reformed their lives according to his dictates: “We need a leader who’s going to touch our souls because you see, our souls are broken,” Michelle Obama said. “The change Barack is talking about is hard, so don’t get too excited because Barack is going to demand that you too be different.” How then should we be different? In yet another speech, Mrs. Obama specified that we would all have to give up something: “We need a different leadership because our souls are broken. We need to be inspired...to make the sacrifices that are needed to push us to a different place,” she said."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 3 6 To learn more about the sacrifices, we need only read the policy papers of the Warren Rudman’s Concord Coalition, Felix Rohatyn’s infrastructure program, and the calls for the drastic curtailment of entitlements coming from the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, the American Enterprise Institute, the Lehrman Institute, and the Manhattan Institute. Obama, with his 2004 call for the bombing of Iran and Pakistan, his refusal to vote for the Kerry amendment calling for an immediate departure of US forces from Iraq, and his July 2007 call for the bombing of Pakistan, has represented by far the most aggressive, bellicose, and adventurous voice in the entire Democratic field, although his deluded followers appear ironically incapable of grasping this plain fact. Indeed, Obama has shown himself to be more aggressive and adventurous than Bush himself. In military affairs, Obama in no way criticizes Bush from a pacifist or antiwar point of view. Quite the contrary: Obama attacks Bush from the right, from a more militant and activist standpoint of imperialist barbarity. Obama attacks Bush as Nietzsche might criticize Schopenhauer — as a fanatical fascist idealist might attack a cynical right wing reactionary war profiteer. The social world of today’s decadent and moribund Anglo- American imperialism is full of individuals who are increasingly being propelled by the Obama hysteria out of their previous state of cynical passivity and into an active mobilization in the service militant imperialist barbarism – in the direction of what we can call postmodern fascism. It would of course be absurd to expect that the fascist-demagogic synthesis engineered behind the scenes by the financiers and their think tanks and institutes to best manipulate the intellectual and moral vulnerabilities of Americans at the beginning of the 21st century would represent merely a slavish copy of the fascist movements in Central Europe between the two world wars. As we have seen, the similarities and direct parallels are striking enough. But there are also important differences. A postmodern Fascism adequate for the United States in the 21st century must diverge from the array of European fascist prototypes on any number of points. OBAMA, THE UNITER WHO DIVIDES AND SPLITS The prevalence of multiculturalism means for example that the race theories and racial and national animosities that loomed so large in earlier fascisms must now be recast. Modern multiculturalism agrees"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 3 7 with the race science of the early 20th century in viewing the races and their cultures, and not the creative individual, as the main actors of human history. To that degree multiculturalism is a collectivist theory of history – the individual plays only a very minor role. For modern multiculturalism, races and their cultures remain the primary building blocks, but they are now subjected to a radical relativism nation which makes them all a priori equal, in sharpest contrast to the racial hierarchies and master race theories which obsessed the earlier fascists. Obama’s own attitude towards race represents a chaotic mass of contradictory attitudes. First he is obsessed with race, attempting to find his own ethnocultural roots in Kenya. His underlying view is thus strongly Afrocentric. But as a candidate, he portrays himself as resolutely transracial, not at all as a candidate representing the needs of the black community, but as the spokesman for the mystical unity of all Americans. In this regard, he appears as a more exalted political version of the golf player Tiger Woods, whose indifference to the problems of the black inner-city poor has been widely remarked. But, even though Obama claims to have transcended all racial divides, his campaign remains intensely preoccupied with identifying and denouncing alleged racial slurs on the part of his opponents, who are systematically and routinely accused of being racist. It is thus Obama who plays the race card, and not his opponents, as the controlled corporate media would have the public believe. (Professor Sean Wilentz of Princeton University has contributed a very perceptive essay on this phenomenon which is discussed elsewhere in this book.) The logic seems to be that, given Obama’s demagogic claim to being trans-racial, post-racial, a-racial, and anti-racist, anyone who opposes him must automatically be considered a racist on the level of Bull Connor. Despite Obama’s claims about bringing the American people together, there can be no doubt that the net effect of his presidential campaign has been to inflame racial prejudices and animosities among whites, blacks, Latinos, and Asians far more than any other candidate in recent memory. In this regard, Obama can be seen as a highly sophisticated application of the foundational counterinsurgency principle of divide and conquer. Bush claimed to be a uniter but turned out to be a divider. Obama does the same thing at an even grander scale, but does it in a way that liberals and leftists are unable to fathom, because of their ideological blinders."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 38 POSTMODERN FASCISM Underneath the entire discussion of race there is one decisive governing principle: Fascism was invented as a last-ditch strategy to preserve the power of the financier oligarchy, and whatever Fascism says about race one way or another is dictated by the prevailing idea of how best to perpetuate the rule of the financiers over society. For the financier sponsors of Fascism, race is a matter of relative indifference. After World War I, fascists proclaimed theories of racial supremacy and racial inferiority as a means of defending the financier class. Postmodern Fascism would necessarily start with a multicultural veneer, since that is currently judged to be the best way to perpetuate the rule of the finance oligarchs. Race itself is never primary; but the fascist demagogue knows very well that his sponsors are bankers and financiers — the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Rand Corporation, the Chicago School, Skull and Bones – who sponsor Fascism not as a means for acting out their racial prejudices or lack thereof, but for the purpose of maintaining power. Postmodern Fascism builds on the Malthusian-Luddite historical pessimism and cultural pessimism which pervades the late Anglo- American Empire. Earlier fascists, by contrast, proclaimed the need for industrial modernization and technological discovery, especially in the area of secret weapons and the like. But the pro-industrialism of earlier fascists concerned with increasing output for war purposes always coexisted with the glorification of traditional peasant life as the backbone of the nation, and with labor-intensive methods in public works which finally reached their extreme form in the concentration camps. OBAMA ADDICTION: MILITANT RADICAL SUBJECTIVISTS ON THE MARCH An Internet essay by columnist Michael Bader provides us with an important document for illustrating one person’s psychic transition from passive cynicism and pessimism into more militant forums of activism under the impact of the Obama agitation. Here we are moving from historical, philosophical, and sociological questions to psychological ones: what is it about the Obama political pseudo- movement which is so attractive to large numbers of liberals and left liberals? What of the psychological needs which they are seeking to satisfy by associating themselves with Obama? Bader starts off by"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 39 telling his readers that he is in love with Obama. Not only is he smitten — for the first time in many, many years, he is considering taking part in a militant protest action. He wants to go to the Democratic National Convention to force the party to accept Obama as its nominee. At the same time, he is well aware that Obama is a hollow candidate when it comes to his concrete program of campaign promises. He evidently feels attracted to Obama by psychological forces which have little to do with the kinds of reforms Obama might actually introduce if he ever took office. Bader, in other words, is a radical subjectivist who has started to be politically active to obtain certain emotional satisfactions which he cannot find any longer in his alienated (or petty bourgeois) everyday life. The movement, the experience and the process are everything; how Obama might govern is a matter of indifference. Bader tells us: I love Barack Obama. I love to listen to him talk. His victory speeches after Iowa and South Carolina gave me chills. I haven’t felt that way about a politician since I worked for Bobby Kennedy in 1968. I haven’t felt that way about someone’s oratory since hearing Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. I found myself thinking: “If they try to steal his nomination at the convention, I’m flying to Denver to demonstrate.” I haven’t felt that way in decades either. I should have felt that way when they stole the election from Gore in 2000, but I didn’t. And I don’t even think Obama’s positions are that great. He’s weak on health care, panders on Israel, and usually sounds like the type of mainstream liberal that I hate. I don’t care, though. He speaks to my heart and I feel inspired and moved by his emphasis on community, meaning, and responsibility. Here we can clearly see the longing for community and camaraderie which so many contemporary observers detected among the disgruntled veterans of World War I in Central Europe, albeit decked out with modern jargon and in a modern frame of reference. Bader also looks to Obama to fill the void of meaning in his life; this recalls Nietzsche’s approach of arbitrarily choosing any myth to believe in rather than facing the void of a universe without absolute values. At the same time, Bader is aware of journalistic accounts which have criticized and ridiculed Obama’s supporters as lemmings, zombies, Hare Krishna, cultists, Charles Manson freaks, groupies, and the like. Exhibiting the well-known weakness of the American"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 40 character, Bader is other-directed (in Riesman’s terminology) and thus intensely concerned with the shifting opinions of his shifting peer group of friends: ‘But I’m aware of something else, too. I’m a bit embarrassed by loving Obama — unless, of course, I couch my support in hard-nosed political calculations, e.g. he’s better equipped to beat McCain, he can bring people into the political process and energize our movement, or he can create a political space where progressives can organize. But these are objective calculations and analyses about others and don’t reflect my emotional identification with and response to Obama. These latter feelings make me uncomfortable. I feel like one of the herd. I think I’ll be viewed as naïve. I worry that my progressive friends will see me as hero- worshiping and, for some reason, that seems immature and slightly neurotic. And all of this is in addition to being bombarded with media coverage frequently raising critiques of Obama as superficial and his followers so smitten they swoon like girls getting their first look at the Beatles.’ Bader would like to commit himself to open and militant activism in favor of Obama, but he is still held back by his own inner fears and reticence. FROM CYNICISM TO MOBILIZATION FOR THE SAKE OF OBAMA Bader traces his problems back to his distant and alcoholic father, who mocked togetherness and family closeness. Bader writes: ‘What’s the source of my discomfort adoring Barack Obama? When I was young, ...[and] uncomfortable with open-hearted expressions of love, I became clever and sarcastic and felt a private disdain for those who were too open about it. I became cynical. It’s easy to see here that my cynicism was a defense, one with which psychotherapists are very familiar. As a child, when one’s desire or need for something is rejected, one develops the unconscious belief that he or she is not supposed to desire or need it.’ It has been widely noted that the closing decades of the 20th century in the United States were characterized by a culture of overwhelming passivity, as people sat watching shadows flickering across the screens of television sets, movie theaters, and computers. For those born between 1963 and 1982, it was also a time of unstable families, drug use, child abandonment, and divorce by the parents. There were acrimonious arguments at the dinner table that Generation X wants to forget – thus the appeal of Obama’s anti-partisan rhetoric. Out of this cultural world there emerged a psychological type that saw"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 41 aloofness, detachment, and a lack of concern as some of the greatest of virtues — all summed up in the ubiquitous positive signifier “cool.” Bader documents the pain of breaking with his persona of coolness on his way to the rendezvous with destiny promised by Obama to his activists: Safety — psychic safety — was to be found in cynicism. The same dynamics were true when it came to hero-worship....One shouldn’t be taken with fame, right? It’s a bit demeaning. Ultimately, I became cynical about that, too. If I was with a famous person I’d try to either ignore him or her or interact in a way that didn’t reflect a shred of awe or admiration. It was important to seem cool. Except cool in the present political context really means cynical. Cool means that we’re not in love with Obama; we just think he’s a strong candidate. Cool means that we’re not like my childhood neighbors who love to connect with one another; we’re just excited by the fact that Obama is bringing disenchanted voters back into the system on election day. Cool means that we don’t ourselves relate to him as a rock star; we’re just impressed that he can generate that type of enthusiasm in others. Bader now feels that it is his moral duty to sacrifice his coolness, his cynicism, and his other mental defenses in order to better serve his new leader and object of psychological cathexis, Obama. Bader continues his self-criticism by talking about the painful reaction formations that he has created in his own mind to prevent himself from giving his heart away to a political candidate: That we’re cynical about Obama because we’re afraid of being disappointed is certainly no news flash. But cynicism of this sort is deeper than that. We have come to identify our own longings as dangerous, our own longings for someone to inspire us, to bring us together, our own longings to be part of a community of meaning again in politics, our own wish to be connected to something bigger than ourselves, a “something” that Barack Obama embodies, the “something” that gives us a chill when we hear him speak. We have been disappointed in our lives in both personal and public spheres. We dread being embarrassed again by loving someone or wanting something that we can’t and aren’t supposed to have. We feel a tremendous pressure, internally and externally, to be “realistic” and to accept what is as what is supposed to be. To not be realistic is to risk"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 42 humiliation and rejection. And this danger lies in wait behind our relationship to Obama. OBAMA AS EXISTENTIALIST MYTH Reaching the conclusion of his monologue, Bader commits himself to active efforts as an organizer on behalf of the new leader. He does this even though he is well aware that the concrete politician Obama is in all likelihood a charlatan using people like him as useful dupes and calls on his path to power. Even so, he gets the emotional reward of joining the pseudo-movement for Obama. Bader’s choice of pro- Obama activism is an act of pure irrational existentialist caprice, justified only by the radically subjective satisfaction that he derives from his new life as an Obama activist: Obama may yet disappoint us. In fact, he likely will. And yet, somehow he has put the issues of hope, possibility, meaning and community back into public life. He has reminded many of us of who we are and who we want to be. We should celebrate this. We should celebrate it and take it seriously as evidence of what is possible. We should acknowledge and embrace our own feelings and, through such self-awareness, recognize that the feelings that Obama triggers lie at the heart of every person that we’re trying to organize, and it’s our challenge to figure out how to elicit these feelings. The Right does it through appeals to patriotism, family, and community, although for them it’s a jingoistic patriotism, a conventional heterosexual fa mily, and a predominantly white community. The new mega-churches do it through addressing the needs of their parishioners at all levels and dimensions of their lives, including their needs for meaning, recognition, connectedness, and agency. (Michael Bader, “I’m Tired of Being Cool — Understanding My Love Affair With Barack Obama,” AlterNet, March 6, 2008) MEIN KÄMPFCHEN : THE PATHOS OF THE OBAMAKINS The world, Bader seems to imply, is inherently meaningless and can only be endowed with meaning by an arbitrary choice, no matter how irrational and self-destructive a choice might be. This outlook has much in common with Nietzsche. It should be obvious that mass movements made up irrationalists who believe these things can rapidly become incompatible with the future of representative government in the United States. How, for example, can such an"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 43 individual be shown at his devotion to Obama represents a threat to himself and to society in general? As long as the immediate satisfaction of one’s own interior and psychological needs is the be- all and end-all of political life, we might as well be dealing with drug addicts. If a majority of individuals in any given society reach the mental state exemplified by Bader in his article, a point of no return may well be passed beyond which democratic institutions give way to mob rule (ochlocracy) by swarms of militant radical subjectivists intent and the satisfaction of their own irrational psychological needs, and thus become completely unworkable. All this takes us back to what happened in Central Europe between the two world wars of the last century. SATISFACTIONS OF THE MOB OR FUSED GROUP The most obvious form of psychological satisfaction sought by the devotees of Obama is the indescribable elation of being part of a mob. Apart from the fading memories of an occasional spring riot when they were in college, the Obamaphiles have often never tasted this feeling before in their lives. The inebriation of the mob has been described by sociologists as the process of losing one’s own individual existence in a fused group. The mob or fused group offers immediate forums of community, belonging, and togetherness. The mob holds out the promise of washing away the painful sense of alienation as discrete individuals which many Obama supporters have felt all their lives. Obama speaks of hope, of bringing people together, and of overcoming the bitter divisions of partisan politics, but the immediate emotional satisfaction which he offers comes in the form of a personal victory over alienation by submerging oneself in the fused group. This is the real magic of the Messiah. OBAMA AND GENERATION X: THE FASCIST POTENTIAL Obama’s demagogic attack in his notorious and megalomaniacal Joshua speech on the so-called baby boom age cohort born in the two decades after the end of World War II reflects what appears to be the generational composition of his own support. Obama’s birthday of August 4, 1961 places him at the tail end of the postwar baby boom, which can be thought of as coming to an end with the assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas in November 1963. But naturally such an indication can only be approximate. But Obama’s background of abandonment by his father, followed by a time spent separated from his mother when he lived with his grandparents, all complicated by"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 44 extensive teenage drug use including marijuana, cocaine, and possibly more — all this gives Obama strong affinities with the so-called generation X, an age cohort composed to a considerable extent of the hapless victims of the breakdown and chaos of American society doing two decades after the Kennedy assassination. The Xers were born into homes ravaged by drug use, promiscuity, alcoholism, crime, cultural degradation, and divorce, as living standards collapsed, and opportunities for productive employment and upward social mobility became harder and harder to find. For the Xers, there seemed to be no social safety net, and an alarming proportion of the children born during these years were simply abandoned by one or both of their own parents. For the Xers, there have been few of the scholarships, fellowships, low-interest loans, or other forms of assistance which were available in the late New Deal. Because of the terrible cruelty of the social conditions which they have known them many Xers have concluded that society is indeed a jungle where charity and human solidarity do not exist, and where brutality and heartlessness rule. Many Xers feel that if there was no social safety net for them when they needed it, no one else should be treated any differently, and it is from this group that Ron Paul was able to draw such support as he garnered for a Herbert Hoover style presidential campaign based on the platform which implied the abolition of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, unemployment insurance, Head Start, and WIC, submitting the American people to the full fury of the cartel- dominated “market” in the midst of a world economic depression. The Xers were the age cohort which has most consistently supported the bombing of Iraq during the first Gulf War, the bombing of Serbia in 1999, and the current war in Iraq. THE LOST GENERATION: MUSSOLINI AND HITLER The recent generation which exhibits the greatest similarity with Generation X is the so-called lost generation, born between about 1885 and 1905, in which is associated in the popular mind with the American expatriate circles of the hapless alcoholic F. Scott Fitzgerald and the worshiper of brutality and cruelty Ernest Hemingway in Paris in the 1920s. But the lost generation was also the age cohort which included the greatest proportion of front-line troops who saw action in the trenches of World War I, and which produced such political leaders as Mussolini, Hitler, and Stalin. The lost generation was the generation of fascism, and it has long been evident that generation X might pose a problem of similar nature. It"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 45 is this fascist potential of Generation X which Obama is attempting to realize. His Joshua sp eech, discussed in detail elsewhere in this book, is an attempt to appeal to the resentments of the Xers over the deprivations and humiliations which they have suffered, in their view at the hands of more affluent and older yuppies from the postwar age cohort. This appeal by Obama is, as always, purely demagogical. One of the greatest negative impacts on the life of generation X came with the collapse of the US industrial economy during the Carter administration, a regime dominated by David Rockefeller, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Paul Volcker, and other members and friends of the Trilateral Commission who are today s upporting Obama. MILLENNIALS BETWEEN FASCISM AND ANTI-FASCISM The other generation which Obama is seeking to recruit of the so- called Millennials, those born between about 1982 and 2001. This generation is on the whole far more optimistic than the Xers. In contrast to the angry and tormented loners who are heavily represented in the ranks of Generation X, the Millennials exhibit a pattern of happy collectivism and positive thinking. The propaganda of the controlled corporate media is making a tremendous effort to convince the Millennials that Obama is indeed their man, but this argument is based on tainted polls which are extremely unreliable and highly suspect. Anecdotal evidence suggests that there is far more indifference for Obama on college campuses than there is enthusiasm. Since all high school and college students today belong to the Millennials, he would be urgent to offer them a guaranteed free college education for all those graduating from high school. It would also be urgent to propose an ambitious national and international program for the exploration and permanent colonization of the moon, Mars, and other nearby celestial objects. Far more than the Xers, the Millennials have an immense innate capacity for scientific optimism and technological rationality, and it is imperative to tap these resources for the future progress of humanity. Otherwise, the danger is that the Millennials could be recruited more or less en bloc, given their collectivist tendencies, for the Obama crusade. Although it is sometimes possible to make meaningful generalizations about the political and social characteristics of generational groups, it is above all important to remember this: human affairs are ruled by free will, not by determinism of any kind. Great leaders and great minds are the ones who have fought against the majority views of their contemporaries, no matter what generation"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 4 6 they belonged to. Generational origins may impel, but they can never compel, and everybody is always free to reject the consensus opinions of their peers. Nobody should ever believe that the accident of being born in a certain year forces them to believe or to do anything. 2008: A PARTY RE-ALIGNMENT FOR THE NEXT FORTY YEARS This book is offered in the hopes of prodding the American public and Democratic primary voters and activists in particular to pause and reflect on the huge stakes involved in the 2008 presidential contest. This year’s election marks a party realignment, an event which has occurred before in American history after the 1788 adoption of the Federal Constitution, only four times so far — in 1828, 1860, 1932, and 1968. The events of 2008 are likely destined to found a new party system which will endure for the next three to four decades, decisively impacting the lives of everyone living on Earth today. Decisions of such vast implications are obviously far too important to undertake under the influence of media manipulation, or in some burst of enthusiasm about a seemingly attractive new candidate about whom we know virtually nothing. The great test today is to found a national progressive coalition capable of replicating the achievement of the common front which supported Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal, starting in 1932. In that year, Roosevelt was able to unite the big city Democratic machines, resurgent organized labor, the solid South, and progressive intellectuals. A decisive addition came in the form of black voters, who had previously been loyal to the Republican Party of Abraham Lincoln, but who now made a permanent choice in favor of the Democrats. The resulting coalition dominated American politics until it was destroyed by the folly of Lyndon B. Johnson, who insisted on pursuing the senseless and criminal war in Vietnam. In 2008, it is st ill possible that a new progressive coalition could be built around the existing Democratic Party, although this is by no means guaranteed. The great issue of our time is to incorporate new groups of voters into the progressive front. Chief among these are the Hispanics or Latinos, who are now the largest single minority in this country. Another indispensable group are the Asian Americans, who are of decisive importance in the number of states. If the Hispanics and the Asian Americans could be permanently incorporated into the existing (flawed) progressive coalition, the resulting force could be enough to dominate the Electoral College, and lead this country out of"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 4 7 the current total crisis. If Hispanics and Latinos permanently join the Democratic Party, California will remain locked up for the Democrats with the foreseeable historical future. Florida would no longer be a swing state or battleground state, but would be solidly incorporated into the Democratic column. The vital state of Texas, instead of being an automatic win for the Republicans, would become a battleground state, forcing the expenditure of large amounts of money and energy by the national Republican party. States like Arizona, New Mexico, and others in the intermountain West and high plains, would also gravitate towards the Democratic column. THE REAGAN DEMOCRATS The other requirement is to re-incorporate the Reagan Democrats into the Democratic Party. These are middle aged and older blue- collar, ethnic, and Catholic voters heavily concentrated in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania. They were driven out of the Democratic Party by the ultra-left excesses of the McGovernites, and then by the Carter- Rockefeller-Brzezinski-Volcker catastrophe, which destroyed the economic viability of their communities and cost many of them their jobs. A Democratic Party characterized by elitist, ultra-left, and Malthusian social and educational policies and right-wing economic policies of the type represented by Obama will never recapture the Reagan Democrats. By contrast, this is a demographic which has no difficulty in supporting Sen. Clinton. All this would mean that, with Sen. Clinton as the Democratic nominee in 2008, the Southern strategy or Reagan coalition which has dominated between 1968 and 2006, would be supplanted by something new and much more promising. It would not be the messianic-utopian promise of singing tomorrows. It would merely represent a new playing field, slightly skewed in favor of New Deal solutions. None of this would be much comfort for anyone if we were proposing merely to assign a more or less permanent absolute majority in the Electoral College to the politically correct liberal totalitarian oligarchs of the Nancy Pelosi-Jane Harmon school, who are now so visible in the ranks of the Democratic leadership. This, of course, is not what we intend. The liberal totalitarians are largely the residue of decades of defeat, demoralization, disillusionment, disorientation, and corruption that go all the way back to the Nixon era. As of the time that this is being written in late March 2008, it would appear that a Democratic landslide may be in the offing for the November 2008 congressional elections. If we can use the 1976 post-"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 48 Watergate elections as a rule of thumb, it is likely that the Democratic Party will enjoy a two to one majority in the next House of Representatives, and a substantial supermajority in the Senate. This would mean the largest infusion of new members of Congress in many decades, helping to bring the real day-to-day concerns of working families into halls so long dominated by corporate lobbyists and Malthusian ideologues. The main excuse offered by corrupt and incompetent Democratic Party leaders has been their anemic majorities in both houses of Congress; the November 2008 elections may well destroy that alibi and open the door to decisive action. This, at least, is the potential inherent of the ongoing party realignment which is unfolding around us. In the middle of all these developments, there has emerged that candidacy for president of a certain Barack Obama. Obama appears as a naturally talented orator for an upscale mob, mellifluously purveying an edifying rhetoric of national healing, bringing people together, reaching across the aisle, quelling partisan passions, and fostering national reconciliation. Although some concrete policy proposals are actually offered, the overwhelming impression is one of vagueness, recalling the lack of specificity or “fuzziness” issue which was mentioned during the Jimmy Carter campaign of 1976. For many of his enthusiastic followers, Obama plays the role of a blank slate upon which all their fondest hopes, dreams, and aspirations may be projected in hopes of fulfillment. He is a kind of political Rorschach test, where each person tends to see whatever he or she finds most congenial. Obama has unquestionably been the beneficiary of the biggest sustained effort of mass media manipulation since the events of September 11, 2001. Notably, while Obama promises unity, his campaign has in practice shattered the US electorate along every possible line – white vs. black vs. Latino, old vs. young, men vs. women, and even among the main religious groups. LOOK AT THE HANDLERS, ADVISERS, CONTROLLERS, BACKERS Politicians generally lie, so we need to develop a methodology that will permit the average voter, the ordinary American, to detect such lies in aspiring political leaders. One obvious way to do this is to carefully examine the public statements of the candidate. Even the cleverest demagogue is seldom so well disciplined as to hide the real agenda in 100% of all public appearances. Sooner or later, something"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 49 of substance will be blurted out. In the case of Obama, many might be surprised to find that he is the most extreme warmonger of the entire Democratic Party field, based on his own statements during the televised presidential debates. In the Chicago debate of July 2007, Obama announced his intention to bomb Pakistan without consulting the government of that nation in order to eliminate what he called terrorist targets. This was a highly provocative and adventurous statement, and Mrs. Clinton criticized it as irresponsible. Senator McCain found that it underlined how inexperienced Obama actually was. Even the tenant of the White House, long considered nec plus ultra in militaristic adventurism, stressed that he would never intervene in Pakistan without securing the cooperation of President Musharraf. This exchange firmly established Obama as the most trigger-happy of all the Democratic contenders. Then there was the matter of economics. Here Obama rejected Senator Clinton’s call for a freeze on home foreclosures, and instead offered counselors to provide emotional support for desperate homeowners as they were thrown out onto the streets. Obama was opposed to including money for winter fuel assistance to poor families (LIHEAP) as part of the so-called stimulus package passed by Congress in February 2008. In other words, Obama was running clearly to the right of Senator Clinton on economic issues of critical importance to working families — to say nothing of the fact that he had been running far to the right of Senator Edwards until the latter dropped out of the race. So here we already find evidence that Obama’s messianic and utopian rhetoric does not appear to be backed up by policies that would actually benefit hard- pressed working families in this country. BUSH AND THE NEOCON VULCANS Even more important than the close textual analysis of the candidate’s speeches is an examination of the candidate’s advisors, handlers, backers, contributors, and controllers. Here voters should ask themselves what, if anything, they have actually learned from the widespread buyers’ remorse suffered in regard to George Bush and his 2000 campaign. During that campaign, the current tenant of the White House argued that he was a uniter, and not a divider. He famously described himself as a compassionate conservative. He promised the foreign policy based on humility. He promised to reach across the aisle in quest of compromise. How could the average voter have determined at that time that Bush was lying? The most obvious"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 50 method would have been to look at Bush’s handlers, backers, and controllers. A cursory examination would have revealed the presence of a group calling itself the Vulcans, composed of figures like Paul Wolfowitz, Douglas Feith, Condoleezza Rice, and other aggressive neocon ideologues with strongly militaristic tendencies. It was clearly from this pool of neocon warmongers, all bitterly nostalgic for the confrontational atmosphere of the Cold War, that Bush’s White House staff, cabinet and subcabinet would obviously be drawn. The Bush campaign even tacitly acknowledged that their candidate knew nothing of foreign policy, but intended to surround himself with the best available foreign policy talent who would prepare his options and guide him towards the correct decision in case of crisis. Any president without a visible track record in the foreign policy must automatically be evaluated in these terms, since it is the advisors and handlers who will take over the National Security Council, the State Department, and the intelligence agencies, and impose the policies with which they are publicly identified. That is simply a truism of the weakened post-Truman, post-Watergate presidency. In the case of Obama, this level of analysis leads us directly to the extended family of Zbigniew Brzezinski, the Trilateral Commission co-founder and infamous warmonger who did so much to destroy the Carter presidency thirty years ago, and who is now eager for a last hurrah using the vehicle provided by Obama. THE PUPPET PRESIDENCY: THE CARTER TRILATERAL PARADIGM Another relevant case is that of Jimmy Carter, the little-known governor of Georgia who came out of nowhere in 1975 and 1976 to prevail in the Democratic primaries and go on to defeat President Ford. Carter was also prodigal in his utopian promises: a classic was his famous pledge, “I’ll never lie to you.” He promised the American people a government as good and as decent as they were. “Why not the best?” was another of his favorite refrains. How would it have been possible for American voters in 1976 to foresee the catastrophic nature of the coming Carter administration? The most obvious fact was that Carter’s principal foreign policy adviser was none other than Zbigniew Brzezinski, cofounder with David Rockefeller of the Trilateral Commission, a cabal of international bankers from Europe, the United States, and Japan, all assembled under the leadership of David Rockefeller of the Chase Manhattan Bank. Brzezinski had been known as an extreme anti-Soviet and anti-Russian hawk from"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 51 the 1950s on. Brzezinski then became the director of Carter’s National Security Council, where he oversaw the overthrow of the Shah of Iran, and the installation of the Khomeini dictatorship. Brzezinski may be justly regarded as the father of modern Islamic fundamentalism. His role was not a blunder but the result of studied geopolitical calculation: Brzezinski argued that Islamic fundamentalism was the main bulwark against Soviet communism; Brzezinski thus qualifies as the progenitor of Al Qaeda. He provoked the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, supported Pol Pot in Cambodia, and wrecked US relations with the French and German governments of that time. More than once during these years, the world teetered on the edge of a superpower thermonuclear confrontation provoked by Brzezinski. Brzezinski’s ruling passion was and is his burning hatred of Russia, and it was immaterial to him how much damage his tactics did to the United States or to his nominal boss, Jimmy Carter. Russian leaders are well aware of Brzezinski’s role and intentions. Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov commented in the summer of 2008: Ideology, when confused with practical policies, obscures one’s vision and reason. This may be illustrated by the words of Zbigniew Brzezinski, who claimed that it had been the US that provoked the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. This suggests that the US played a greater role than usually thought in giving birth to Al-Qaeda. The law of “unintended consequences” more often than not works in situations where ideology-inspired enthusiasm comes into play. (“Containing Russia: back to the future?” August 15, 2007) Americans should ponder the wisdom of putting the White House under the control of Brzezinski, whose very presence is already a major irritant in relations with Russia, a country that owns the largest nuclear stockpile on earth. “BRZEZINSKI IS TRYING TO CONCEAL HIS INVOLVEMENT WITH BARACK OBAMA’S TEAM” Brzezinski has successfully duped large numbers of left liberals about his own role by the simple expedient of coming out against Bush’s conduct of the Iraq war. Russians are much smarter and have not been fooled, since they know that the war Brzezinski wants is directed against them. Moscow News noted that “Zbigniew Brzezinski... is trying to conceal his involvement with Barack Obama’s team.” ( Moscow News , April 3, 2008)"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 52 When the Moscow business daily Kommersant wanted to know about Obama’s intentions, they went to Brzezinski, since they knew he would be running the show. The acrimony and clarity of the interview makes it well worth citing at some length: Brzezinski, in spite of his age, continues to travel extensively.... In addition, he sometimes accompanies presidential candidate Barack Obama in his travels around the country. Brzezinski has supported Obama since last summer. He stated that the senator from Illinois was the only candidate who stood for a radical change in U.S. foreign policy, the military campaign in Iraq first and foremost. The Illinois senator and the author of The Grand Chessboard first appeared together in September 2007 in Iowa. Brzezinski introduced Obama to the audience, and then Obama spoke about his foreign policy program. His main position is the complete withdrawal of American forces from Iraq by the end of 2009. His main long-range policy is a rejection of military force in favor of “soft power,” the economic and cultural influence of the U.S. on the rest of the world. Although Brzezinski is considered in Russia practically the main Russophobe among the American political elite, in the U.S., he is not considered a specialist on Russia.... the last article Brzezinski wrote was called “Putin and Beyond,” published in The Washington Quarterly. “The West’s strategy should not be built upon making things pleasant or convenient for Russia. Making Russia a partner at any cost is not what the West needs today,” he states, summing up his article. Brzezinski said he does not believe that there will be liberalization soon in Russia under President Dmitry Medvedev. He compares that power structure in Russia as it has taken shape since the March 2 election with that of Fascist Italy. “The head of state was nominally the king, but Mussolini set policy. Putin is also considered the national leader. He chose Medvedev himself. The logical conclusion is that Putin will be on top in the near future, and Medvedev will do what he tells him to do.” [...] Hearing that he is called a Russophobe in Russia and thought to be the developer of a plan to divide the country into parts, Brzezinski’s eyes flash with annoyance. “Show me the place in any of my books where I wrote about that,” he snaps. Brzezinski calls himself an optimist in Russian-American relations and says the younger generation of Russian and Americans will find much"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 53 in common as soon as “the dinosaurs of the Cold War” die out. The chief specialist on Russian-American relations in the Brzezinski family, and also on the Obama staff, is Brzezinski’s oldest son Mark. In 1999 a nd 2000, Mark Br zezinski was director for Russia and Eurasia of the National Security Council under president Bill Clinton. “It’s possible that Putinism may be the last gasp of the old regime, and it may well be the case that within the next decade, the Putin-Medvedev government might be replaced by a new generation of Russians, many of them who are trained in the west...who are not products of the KGB and more open to the West.” Mark Brzezinski said recently. He will most likely occupy a high-profile post in the administration, if Obama is elected president. Engaged in our conversation, Brzezinski completely forgets about our 15-minute time limit. “Don’t you think the younger generation of Russians has a much warmer attitude toward America?” he asked toward the end of the conversation. “No, it seems to us that the young have an even worse attitude toward America than those over 30.””That can’t be. I hope you are wrong. Write me, please, later and tell me what the reaction to this interview is, okay?” (Mikhail Zygar and Nargiz Asadova, “Real Live Redbaiters,” Moscow Kommersant , March 27, 2008) The dark and realistic view of Brzezinski is hegemonic among Russian leaders. President Vladimir Putin told a group of foreign reporters on June 4, 2007: “You talk about public opinion. Public opinion in Russia is in favor of increasing our security. Where did you get a public opinion that we should fully disarm and then, according to some theoreticians, such as Brzezinski, divide our territory into three or four states? If there is such a public opinion, I would disagree with it.” (Ibid.) It is worth pointing out that Carter did not choose Brzezinski; it was in actual fact of Brzezinski who had chosen Carter to be the Trilateral candidate for president in 1976. As Br zezinski writes in his book Power and Principal: Memoirs of the National Security Adviser 1977-1981 (New York: Farrar, Strauss, Giroux, 1985): “I first met Jimmy Carter at one of the early meetings of the Trilateral Commission, which I directed in the early 1970s. I remember discussing his membership with my two principal Trilateral Commission colleagues, Gerard Smith and George Franklin. We wanted a forward-looking Democratic Governor who would be"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 54 congenial to the Trilateral perspective. Reubin Askew of Florida was mentioned as a logical candidate, but then one of them noted that Jimmy Carter, the newly elected Governor of Georgia, courageous on civil rights and reportedly a bright and upcoming Democrat, was interested in developing trade relations between his State of Georgia and the Common Market and Japan. I then said, ‘Well, he’s obviously our man,’ and George Franklin went down to Atlanta to explore his background further and came back enthusiastic. Jimmy Carter was invited to join and he accepted.” HOW ZBIGGY CHOSE JIMMY Brzezinski continues his narrative: “In the course of 1974 I was told that Jimmy Carter had declared his candidacy for the Presidency and that he needed advice. I decided, therefore, to approach him, largely because I felt that he would spread the Trilateral Commission’s concept of closer and more cooperative relations between the United States on the one hand and Europe and Japan on the other. I did not then think of him as a candidate with whom I would become closely identified. I wrote him a note making an offer of help, and received in return a handwritten note, dated December 31, 1974: ‘To Zbigniew Brzezinski – Thank you for your offer to help me with analyses of foreign affairs issues. I look forward to meeting with you for a personal discussion, and hope that in the meantime you would let me have any memos or articles which would be instructive to me. The Trilateral Com experience has been a wonderful opportunity for me, and I have used it perhaps even more than you could know. Your friend, Jimmy.’” Brzezinski goes on: “Through the spring of 1975 I sent Jimmy Carter various materials, including some of my speeches. I would receive from time to time handwritten notes expressing appreciation, occasionally praising me for the ideas that I had expressed, and reserving ‘the right to plagiarize freely.’ I became increasingly impressed by him, but the turning point came in the summer of 1975 when Carter and I, as well as other Commission members, attended a Trilateral meeting in Kyoto, Japan. At the Commission meeting itself, Carter spoke forcefully and clearly on behalf of a fair Middle East settlement as very much in the US national interest. Accordingly, I complimented him publicly at one of the plenary sessions. Afterwards, and quite unexpectedly, he asked me if I would be willing to attend a press conference, dealing with his candidacy, that he was giving to a group of American newspapers. I was a little"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 55 surprised at the time, but concluded that he probably wanted to show the newspapermen that his candidacy was being taken seriously and that he could count on expert advice in his campaign. His press conference made a believer of me.” According to contemporary accounts, Carter was introduced to the Kyoto Trilateral meeting by Gianni Agnelli of the Italian FIAT automobile company, who acclaimed Carter as “the next president of the United States.” Brzezinski says that he was tempted to support the campaign of Senator Henry Jackson of Washington state, the arch-neocon Cold Warrior who represented Boeing in the US Senate, but “Henry Jackson, who appealed to me the most on substantive grounds, was vulnerable as a relatively colorless candidate.... By the end of 1975 I had emerged as Carter’s principal foreign policy adviser. In late December he asked me ‘to develop for me the outline of a basic speech/statement on foreign affairs.... I agree with your order of priorities. I would also like to talk to you re more definite analyses and your personal campaign help. Your friend, Jimmy.’” (Brzezinski 1985, 5-7) for those who can read between the lines and disregard the little subterfuges which Zbig has inserted so that things will not look too blatant, this is actually a description of how Jimmy Carter was selected by a group of bankers to become the president of the United States with their decisive financial support. Hitler had Schacht and Krupp, the Herrenklub and the Thule Gesellschaft. Carter had David Rockefeller, Brzezinski, the Trilaterals and the Council on Foreign Relations. Obama has all of these, plus special assistance from the Ford Foundation, which is practically his mother ship. Another member of the Trilateral Commission who was to play an important role during the Carter years was Paul Adolf Volker, who was appointed by Carter to be the boss of the Federal Reserve System in 1979. In conformity with the “controlled disintegration” program of the Trilateral Commission, Volcker hiked the prime lending rate of US banks to 22%, devastating the US industrial base, and destroying the export economy of this country. The Volcker interest rate policy precipitated a severe recession, which helped to guarantee that Carter could not be reelected. As a result of Carter’s defeat by Ronald Reagan in 1980, the United States entered a period of a dozen years of extreme political reaction, rout of the labor movement, declining standards of living, skyrocketing national debt, and general political despair known as “Morning in America.”"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 5 6 This method of examining the candidates’ handlers, advisors, and controllers has proven over the years to be by far the most reliable one in predicting the future behavior of an American presidential administration. Candidates are sometimes such good liars that they manage to conceal almost everything that they really intend to do once they have taken office. An analysis of financial supporters is useful and even imperative, but the problem here is that many large financial interests hedge their bets by giving large contributions to more than one candidate, leaving it uncertain as to whom they really want to see installed in office. But, with very few exceptions, a look at the advisors and handlers generally reveals who will be who in the next administration, and therefore allows us to extrapolate what the new regime will actually do. OBAMA’S CONTROLLERS FROM BRZEZINSKI TO GOOLSBEE If we look at Obama in this way, we are confronted with findings that are nothing short of appalling. It turns out that none other than Zbigniew Brzezinski is the principal guru of the entire Obama campaign, his influence that goes beyond the critical area of foreign policy and embraces the entire public profile of post-partisan, trans- racial, and global elements assumed by this candidate. This time around, we see the mobilization, not just of Zbigniew Brzezinski himself, but of the entire Russia-hating Brzezinski clan, with son Mark Brzezinski, a veteran of the Clinton era NSC, also on board for foreign policy, and media groupie Mika Brzezinski leading the cheering section for Obama at the cable television network MSNBC. Another wing of the Brzezinski operation is represented by son Ian Brzezinski, currently Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Eastern Europe and NATO Affairs. Ian, it should be noted, is technically supporting Senator McCain. A kind of utility infielder in this entire effort is Matthew Brzezinski, a supposed investigative journalist who has written an extensive profile of Ilyas Achmadov, the US resident ambassador for the Chechen terrorist organization, which appeared in 2005 in the Washington Post. The real dimensions of the Brzezinski machine are much larger than this: as used in this book, the term Brzezinski machine indicates that entire part of the US intelligence community which assumes a left of center coloration in its public dealings. The Brzezinski machine by this definition therefore includes the strategically decisive left wing of the Central Intelligence Agency, which often does"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 5 7 business as the National Endowment for Democracy, frequently lining up with the Soros foundations and other foundations which operate in the orbit of the intelligence community. These are more or less the same forces which dominated the Baker-Hamilton Iraq study group of December 2006, which criticized and rebelled against the policy orientation of the George Shultz-Rupert Murdoch neocon faction, which had been dominant inside the US-UK banking establishment since about the time of the impeachment of Clinton in 1999. It is therefore necessary to ignore for a moment the edifying rhetoric and utopian platitudes spouting from the mouth of the candidate, and instead turn our attention to the handlers and advisers who represent the potential future White House palace guard, since it is these figures who will actually repair the policy options for the next tenant of the White House, and will thus actually make policy. Don’t listen to the mouth; watch the motions of the hands and feet, who are in this case the advisors who will later fill the Cabinet and other key posts. FROM HUMAN DIGNITY TO POLITICAL BALKANIZATION AND PARTITION Brzezinski’s influence is not limited merely to issues of war and peace in the foreign policy sphere, critical though that obviously is. The entire public persona or political profile exhibited by Obama during his campaign would appear to derive from the theoretical elaborations of Brzezinski. The key piece of evidence in this regard is Brzezinski’s latest book, Second Chance . Here Brzezinski repeats his thesis that a worldwide political awakening is now taking place, and that the goal of this movement is “dignity.” Brzezinski’s notion of dignity, once all the obfuscation is peeled away, boils down to the quest for cultural and political self-determination and extreme identity politics on the smallest possible scale, with everything shaped by the cultural, ethnic, religious, and social peculiarities and parochialisms of the smallest possible groups. Brzezinski wants mini-states and micro-states with the dimensions of the local control and community control projects which have so long been in vogue for counterinsurgency purposes. There is no doubt that Brzezinski’s “dignity” thesis represents a declaration of war, not against this or that modern nation-state, but against the institution of the nation-state itself as we have known it for the last 500 to 650 years, going back to the Visconti of Milan c. 1380 in the Italian Renaissance. If respecting"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 58 the tiniest peculiarities of every conceivable group is the order of the day, then a massive wave of secession, Balkanization, subdivision, and partition of the existing nation states will be the unavoidable result. And this is exactly what Brzezinski wants. The most obvious example is the secession of Kosovo province from Serbia (under KLA terrorist auspices), opening a super power crisis between Washington and Moscow. For Africa, Brzezinski recommends the so-called “micro-nationalities” concept, which means that the national boundaries established in the 19th century should be swept aside in favor of a crazy quilt of petty tribal entities, each one so small that it could not hope to resist even a medium-sized oil multinational. In the Middle East, knowledgeable observers have long been familiar with the Bernard Lewis plan, which contemplates the breakup of the existing nation states into impotent, squabbling, principalities, each one an easy prey for J.P. Morgan Chase, Halliburton, Blackwater, Exxon-Mobil, and other neo-feudal corporate predators. The case of Iraq is already before the eyes of the world: instead of one Iraq, we now have three — the Kurdish entity in the north, the central Sunni region, and the Shiastan in the south. Still according to the Bernard Lewis plan, Iran is one day to be divided into six or seven subdivisions, Sudan into at least two parts, and Lebanon into a checkerboard of petty enclaves, while Turkey, Syria, and other Middle East states are destined to be carved and mutilated to create an independent greater Kurdistan and other will-o’-the-wisps that have populated the diseased imagination of Anglo-American geo- politicians going back to Versailles in 1918. Policymakers in Moscow, for their part, are well aware of the Brzezinski Plan, which calls for the partition and subdivision not only of the Russian Federation, but of the age-old European Russian heartland itself. Under the Brzezinski Plan, the world map would come to look more and more like the map of the Holy Roman Empire in about 1600, which had some 500 theoretically independent political entities, some of them no bigger than a small sized family farm, speckled across central Europe. Knowing Brzezinski, we must suspect that the one country destined to remain intact is Poland, perhaps in the form of a greater Poland stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea, as it once did, under the control of an oligarchy of imbecilic petty noblemen (or “gentry”) rather like Brzezinski himself. Brzezinski’s notion of dignity is thus revealed as an extreme form of local control over a Bantustan or ethnic-religious mini-homeland of the type used in the past in such countries as South Africa. The"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 59 greater the local control of language, culture, and related parochial issues, the greater the subjugation of the resulting entity to outside political, economic, and military interests. OBAMA: SKULL AND BONES AND THE CHICAGO BOYS If the Russia-hating Brzezinski clan dominates Obama’s foreign policy apparatus, what of economics and finance, areas which are obviously at the forefront of everyone’s concern in the present Bush world economic depression, marked by dollar hyperinflation, universal banking panic, and the death agony of the US dollar as the world reserve currency? Here the results give rise to just as much consternation. Obama’s leading economics guru is Professor Austan Goolsbee, a 1991 graduate of the ultra-elitist Yale University, where he was a member of the infamous Skull and Bones secret society which brought us Bush the Elder and the current tenant of the White House, to say nothing of the effete patrician, John Forbes Kerry. Goolsbee is a leading exponent of the monetarist Chicago school of economics, founded by the unlamented Milton Friedman, whose doctrines have inflicted untold genocide on the developing countries. Milton Friedman worked closely with such reactionary Republicans as Barry Goldwater, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan, all of whom used his approach to chip away and undermine the economic rights won by the American people through the epoch labor struggles of the New Deal era. The most sustained application of Milton Friedman’s economic views came during the fascist dictatorship of Pinochet in Chile. Goolsbee says that he is an inveterate fan of “free markets,” and any treaty with free trade on the cover will automatically get his support. When asked to differentiate the Obama campaign from others, Goolsbee has replied that the Obama campaign is more respectful of “the market.” Goolsbee is hostile to winter fuel assistance for low-income families because he thinks the program in question is “bureaucratic.” He also does not like any government interference with the process of foreclosing on working families and throwing them and their belongings out into the street. PRIVATIZING SOCIAL SECURITY UNDER OBAMA Another of Obama’s economics advisers is Harvard professor Jeffrey Liebman. Liebman is devoted to the “partial privatization” of Social Security, which is exactly the strategy supported by the current Bush. Partial privatization smacks of the Newt Gingrich “let it wither"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 60 on the vine” approach used by Republicans in the 1990s. Then there is David Cutler, another Harvard professor on board with Obama, who thinks that increased monetary incentives for health insurance companies and pharmaceutical firms are the way to go. In other words, Cutler wants to increase cash transfers into the insatiable pause of these corporate predators. All of this speaks volumes about what Obama would actually do if he ever got to the White House. And no one should be fooled into thinking that the Brzezinski-left CIA-NED faction represents a peace loving alternative to the warmongering excesses of the bellicose and truculent neocons. Quite the contrary. For all their bluster, the neocons have always had one saving grace: as the cowardly bullies they are, they have always chosen to pick on relatively defenseless states, meaning countries with little or no ability to retaliate against the United States for the unprovoked aggression meted out to them. The neocons in short pick on the little guys, the ones with little or no intercontinental strategic weaponry. The really alarming aspect of Brzezinski is that he lacks even the bully’s instinct for survival. Brzezinski is determined to use the next US administration as a vehicle for his final settling of accounts with Russia, his own personal twilight of the gods. Brzezinski’s self conception is that he is the statesman who successfully destroyed the Soviet Union by goading Moscow to invade Afghanistan in 1979, leading to Moscow’s defeat in a decade-long protracted guerrilla war from which the Soviet Union never recovered. Brzezinski also takes credit for having masterminded the dismemberment of the Warsaw Pact, starting in his native Poland in 1988-1989. Brzezinski now intends to crown the edifice of his geopolitical career with the destruction of the Russian Federation, including the Balkanization and partition of European Russia itself. This is an enterprise of incalculable folly, since the Russian Federation is the one state on earth which retains the ability to incinerate the United States, as well as Japan and Western Europe, inflicting tens of millions of casualties in the first hour of a thermonuclear exchange. Brzezinski is therefore attempting to drag the world back into the worst nightmare of the Cold War. Brzezinski himself would most likely argue that a direct US- Russian confrontation is not what he is working towards. He would assert that his goal is to play other states off against Russia, so that the United States will be able to observe the resulting conflicts from the"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 61 sidelines. China is unquestionably the number one nation on Brzezinski’s list of potential US adversaries who should be turned into kamikaze stooges and pawns of Anglo-American imperialism and embroiled in conflict with Moscow. The Brzezinski plan also cannot work unless the European Union is willing to subordinate its own survival to the fulfillment of Brzezinski’s aggressive plans. Countries like Turkey, Syria, and Iran are all regarded by Brzezinski as potential pawns in his apocalyptic struggle with Moscow; this is why Brzezinski is not interested in a direct US attack on these countries, in the way that the neocons have been. BRZEZINSKI: GLOBAL SHOWDOWN WITH RUSSIA AND CHINA As this book will demonstrate, the epicenter of world confrontation is rapidly shifting out of the Middle East and towards Eastern Europe and everywhere else along the borders of the Russian Federation, as well as towards Africa and Pakistan. Brzezinski is in favor of winding down the Iraq war, but certainly not because he intends to usher in an era of golden peace. Rather, he wants those resources freed up so they can be better deployed on some anti-Russian or anti- Chinese front. An important secondary theater of operations for Brzezinski is increasingly Africa. The goal here is to disrupt Chinese economic cooperation with the African countries, and hopefully to eject the Chinese from Africa entirely. Brzezinski calculates that if China cannot procure the necessary oil, energy and strategic raw materials from partners in Africa, the Chinese will have no choice but to turn their attention to the oil and mineral resources of eastern Siberia and the Russian Far East. Brzezinski intends to drive the Chinese in on eastern Siberia by using their overwhelming vulnerability to cutoffs of overseas energy, of the type that the US and the British can engineer. Eastern Siberia notoriously contains much oil, many important mines, and relatively few Russians. This is the apple of discord that Brzezinski would like to parlay into a titanic Russo-Chinese war, which he imagines would eliminate both of the main competitors to continued Anglo-American world domination. This is the reality which lurks behind the edifying messianic-utopian rhetoric of the candidate Barack Obama. This is beyond question the most important single issue with which American voters have a right to become acquainted before the November 2008 election, and this is the major task of this book."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 62 OBAMA: A QUARTER CENTURY OF INDOCTRINATION? It might be said that Brzezinski and his Trilateral Commission circles, including the aging but still active David Rockefeller, are attempting to repeat their Carter administration caper of 1976 - in other words, they are attempting to install their own wholly owned puppet president into the White House. That is a good first approximation, but it falls somewhat short of the enormity of what is going on today. At the time that he was elected president in 1976, Carter had been under the influence of the Trilateral Commission, David Rockefeller, and Zbigniew Brzezinski for at most a few years. Carter was famous as a quick study, and this seems to have applied to his indoctrination in the belief structure of Trilateralism. In the case of Obama, the exposure of the prospective future candidate to systematic training, indoctrination, and ideological formation, up to and including what the average person might regard as out and out brainwashing, appears to have been going on for many, many years. As we will show in this book, there is good reason to believe that Obama was identified and recruited by Brzezinski at Columbia University between 1981 and 1983, at a time when Obama was studying politics with a specialty in international relations and a thesis topic involving Soviet nuclear disarmament — a topic which has Brzezinski written all over it. During these same years, Zbigniew Brzezinski was presiding as the director of the Communist Affairs Institute at Columbia. (It is worth pointing out that Columbia University was not only a bastion of Cold War anti-Sovietism of the Brzezinski school, but had also been the American university most friendly to the Mussolini brand of fascism during the 1920s and 1930s.) Obama, who has freely admitted using the illegal narcotics marijuana and cocaine, has proven to be extraordinarily secretive about his years at Columbia, refusing to help a New York Times reporter with any information about his courses, professors, activities, or friends. What is Obama hiding? Why the obsessive secrecy about this point and so much openness about other things that might at first glance appear much more damaging? The answer may well be that it was at Columbia University between 1981 and 1983 that Obama was recruited by the Brzezinski machine, be it through direct personal contact with Zbigniew Brzezinski, or through his relations with professors in Brzezinski’s orbit. As always, the candidate is cordially invited to come forward with detailed information and documentation"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 63 if he wishes to refute this obvious conclusion. But if the hypothesis ventured here should prove to be true, it would mean that Obama has been undergoing indoctrination from the Brzezinski intelligence faction and its allies for approximately a quarter century, making him a Manchurian candidate in the fullest sense of the word. Concerning the role of the Ford Foundation in the creation of Obama, there is no doubt. Obama’s mother worked for the Ford Foundation. Obama himself worked as a community counterinsurgent for the Gamaliel Foundation, a satellite of the Ford Foundation. He sat on the board of the Woods Fund, another Ford Foundation satellite; it was here that he rubbed elbows with Bill Ayers, the Weatherman terrorist bomber. Obama’s now infamous Trinity United Church of Christ boasts a pastor who was a Ford Foundation scholar, and a key teacher and spokesman who is a Ford Foundation operative. And the Ford Foundation is the oligarchy’s principal watchdog in preventing the emergence of any challenge to financier rule in this country. OBAMA HAS NEVER WON OFFICE IN A CONTESTED ELECTION The sponsorship of Obama’s entire career starting no later than 1983 would be coherent with certain glaring problems suggested by his biography, in so far as it is known. The most dramatic is that Obama has never been elected to public office by way of a contested election. When he ran for Illinois State Senate, a pricey election lawyers helped him to eliminate all his opponents by throwing them off the ballot. Once he was the incumbent, his later re-election to the same seat was a mere formality. The prime example is Obama’s successful campaign for election to the United States Senate from Illinois in 2004. In order for Obama to go to Washington, not one but two opposing candidates had to be destroyed by scandals so that they would no longer encumber his path. The first of these was the hapless Marson Blair Hull, a millionaire stockbroker who spent at least $12 million, and perhaps as much as $28 million, on television advertising in his quest for the U.S. Senate seat that is now occupied by Obama. Just before the March 2004 senatorial primary in Illinois, Hull was hit by a series of scandals in which he was accused of battery and other abuse against his former wife, including threatening her life. Needless to say, these explosive revelations swiftly knocked Hull out of the race."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 64 But now Obama had to face a Republican opponent in the person of Jack Ryan, by all accounts a capable and formidable politician. At this point, a court in Los Angeles took the exceptional step of unsealing the court papers relative to Ryan’s very ugly divorce of a few years earlier. In these papers, Ryan’s former wife alleged that he had taken her to sex clubs in several cities and had tried to coerce her into sexual relations in the presence of third parties. Thanks to these revelations, the Ryan campaign promptly collapsed. In both cases, the arch-reactionary and neocon Chicago Tribune has led the effort to unearth and publicize the material which destroyed Obama’s opponents. At this point the Illinois Republican Party, possibly sensing that they were in the presence of the anointed one, did not put up another serious candidate to run against Obama, but brought in the well-known windbag and self promoter Alan Keyes of Maryland. Keyes’ chances were not helped by his status as an obvious out-of- state carpetbagger and interloper, so Obama won the Senate by the most lopsided outcome in the recent history of Illinois. Since Keyes was black, he was unable to attract even the anti-black backlash vote from downstate Illinois that any white Republican could have counted on. But what invisible hand had so mysteriously brushed aside Obama’s formidable opponents, always at precisely the right moment? If we set aside the notion of divine intervention which might appeal to Obama’s more enthusiastic followers, we must conclude that the pervasive intelligence networks of the left CIA and the Trilateral Commission had been at work. One might also conclude that the many troubles that seemed to rain down on the head of poor old John McCain, notably from muckraking by the New York Times, as soon as it was clear that he represented a key obstacle in the path of Obama to the White House also had their source in that same invisible, Trilateral hand. The question of Obama’s puppet status has far-reaching implications, and must accordingly be studied with great care. If we look only at the 20th century, we find that the vast majority of presidents were indeed puppets of a super-constitutional banking establishment that may be associated with the names of Morgan, Mellon, and Rockefeller, with the City of London looming in the background. This is of course the invisible government or parallel government founded in its current form around 1895, when President Grover Cleveland capitulated to the Morgan and London financier interests during a run on the gold backing of the United States dollar. Since 1895, Morgan and London have controlled the public debt of"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 65 the United States. This arrangement was consolidated under color of law with the passage of the Federal Reserve act under Woodrow Wilson. This Morgan-led financier faction has generally — but not always — been able to have its way over the intervening decades, especially in matters of foreign policy and finance policy. William McKinley is an example of a president who was not sufficiently puppet-like to satisfy the Morgan interests; McKinley was not enthusiastic about founding an American empire during and after the Spanish-American war, and was accordingly liquidated. This process was facilitated because of the vice presidency of Theodore Roosevelt, a mental deficient who manifestly lacked the intellectual or moral capabilities to take any form of effective independent action. The banking elite has always favored presidential candidates whose pedigree includes at least one nervous breakdown, and extreme neurosis, or a borderline psychosis so powerful as to cripple them as autonomous political actors. The banking oligarchy was appalled by the ability of Franklin D. Roosevelt to actually exercise the constitutional powers of the president as prescribed by the U.S. Constitution. After Roosevelt’s death, the oligarchy swore to itself that it would never again permit a real president that might threaten the sacred principle of oligarchical rule itself. One result of this collective resolve by the banking oligarchs was the imposition of term limits on the presidency, which has tended to make incumbent presidents into impotent lame ducks, sometimes as early as the midpoint of their first term. When John F. Kennedy attempted to reassert the New Deal concept of the presidency, he was liquidated by the secret team or rogue network which is the operational arm of the banker’s invisible government. CIVIL WAR UNDER OBAMA? Obama must be regarded as a Manchurian candidate who is wholly owned by the Ford-Trilateral-Council on Foreign Relations bankers’ consortium. He is the most thoroughgoing puppet candidate yet observed in the postwar era, even more so than Carter because of his more lengthy indoctrination. It is very unlikely that Obama could ever assert an independent political identity or an independent political judgment. Obama owes everything to his Trilateral sponsors, and they control him lock, stock, and barrel. Because of the acute need of his backers for the most extreme imperialist aggression and economic"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 6 6 austerity policies, Obama could well preside over the descent of the United States into a Second Civil War, even as he sought armed intervention in Africa and confrontation with Pakistan, China, Russia, and the members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Obama could in any case deploy his lemming legions in the form of a postmodern fascist mass movement, making political resistance to his regime inside the United States a very difficult enterprise. Sen. McCain would be our bridge to the fourteenth century, the century that brought the Black Plague and the Hundred Years’ War, which together destroyed the civilization of medieval Europe. McCain’s well-known and uncontrollable rage fits suggest that he is indeed a borderline but controlled psychotic, perhaps partly because of issues related to his time as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam. Even so, McCain would have a good opportunity of beating Obama by capturing the votes of the Reagan Democrats, Latinos, Asians, Roman Catholics, Jews, retirees, women, and other groups who regard Obama with insuperable suspicion. Against Obama, McCain would probably win Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Florida, would quickly lock up Texas, and would be competitive even in states like California and, incredibly, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, where voters have seen more than enough of Gov. Deval Patrick, Obama’s Siamese twin demagogue from the Trilateral stable. The only way Obama could defeat McCain is through Gestapo attacks such as those used in this cycle to destroy New York Governor Elliott Spitzer, a Clinton superdelegate and scourge of the Wall Street financier elite. With McCain, we would probably be in war with Iran and Syria, in addition to Iraq and Afghanistan, within six months. But, since McCain hardly represents a face lift for US imperialism, and has no fascist mass movement to support him, it might be possible to parlay McCain’s likely catastrophic defeat in foreign wars, combined with the total immiseration of the US population into a successful political challenge to his labile and brittle governing coalition. THE CLINTONS AS LESSER EVIL This leaves Sen. Clinton. Much criticism of her is totally justified. But much of it is not – especially the lunatic toxic residue of the raving reactionary 1998-1999 impeachment campaign by such scoundrels as Gingrich, Delay, and their clique. Other elements of resentment against Sen. Clinton clearly derive from the male"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 6 7 impotence of the critics. What do we actually know about Sen. Clinton? First, she is a politician who responds to public opinion as she perceives it through triangulation. Compared to the imperviousness of the quasi-psychotic McCain to public opinion, and Obama’s status as a puppet Manchurian candidate, this may well represent the lesser evil, or at least the best we can hope for in what is admittedly a terrible situation. Sen. Clinton is not the leader of a fascist mass movement, and this may prove the most important qualification of all. Second, Mrs. Clinton has no single owner, in the way that Obama must perforce dance to Brzezinski’s tune. If she has many owners, this is a way of saying that in the last analysis she really has none. If she can be rented, it means that she may not be for sale. Bill Clinton was brought to Washington by Pamela Churchill Harriman, but Pam is long dead. The Clintons may have outlived many of their former part owners. By becoming the only Democrat since FDR to win re- election, Clinton has taken on something of an independent life of his own, and this provides a certain strength. No one should fear a Clinton dynasty; the dynasty we should fear is the Brzezinski one, incomparably worse. SHE FIGHTS Mrs. Clinton demonstrates an admirable human quality in that she fights. Senator Edwards talked a good game of fighting all the way to the convention, and he would have performed an important public service by doing so, but he folded. Mrs. Clinton soldiers on. In the process, she has been betrayed and traduced by a whole series of rotten elements – Teddy Kennedy, Bill Richardson, Maria Shriver, and a whole catalogue of decadents. In fact, much of the rotten part of the Democratic Party has gravitated to Obama. If Obama goes down to defeat, the Democratic Party will have been purged of some of its most repulsive elements. In the meantime, Mrs. Clinton will have built up considerable resentment against the media whores, against the Soros and other Wall Street elements who have repeatedly stabbed her in the back. These forces are unlikely to have the inside track in a future Clinton regime. This leaves the question – underneath the triangulation and the relentless and disciplined self-censorship, what does Mrs. Clinton"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 68 really believe? What outlook has she been hiding for so long, due to her fear of the vaunted Republican attack machine? The guess here is that Mrs. Clinton, underneath all the reaction formations and layers of cosmetic camouflage acquired in decades under fire, may actually harbor New Deal sympathies. In 1993-2001, she often talked of her admiration of Eleanor Roosevelt. This may be the actual bedrock of her personality, still latent after all the years of political warfare, vilification, and distortion. If so, that is something to build on. This is admittedly a slender reed, but what are the choices? McCain, a borderline psychotic, thinks he is General von Falkenhayn at Verdun, seeking to bleed his enemy white and bleeding his own country white in the process. Obama, a deeply disturbed, race-obsessed, and unstable megalomaniac personality larded over with years or even decades of Ford-Trilateral indoctrination, thinks he is Frantz Fanon re-incarnated as an exterminating angel, about to exact revenge on the American people for centuries of racism and colonialism, in the form of a bankers’ postmodern fascist regime. With those two alternatives in view, Sen. Clinton is clearly the lesser evil. It is likely that, in a Clinton administration, opposition political activity could take the form of carrot and stick operations – pushing for ending the wars, for the implementation of New Deal anti- depression measures and related reforms, while demanding the ouster of reactionary and imperialist figures like Gen. Wesley Clark, Richard Holbrooke, and others who are still in the Clinton camp. The more she triangulates, the better the chance of an aroused citizenry to push Clinton in the desired direction. What other hope is there? In the meantime, the successful completion of the party re-alignment, which at this point Sen. Clinton alone can make possible, would begin to shift the entire political axis of the United States back towards the New Deal, opening as many potentialities as the American people have the intelligence, energy, and courage to fight for. THE BANKERS REVERSE THEIR FIELD As I have described elsewhere, after September 11, 2001 the terrorist attacks of that day, dressed up in suitable mythical attire, provided an all-purpose racist, militarist, and fascist myth and cover for every anti-human cause on this planet. It seemed for a time as if the 9/11 myth might become the vehicle for the imposition of a comprehensive top-down bureaucratic-authoritarian-totalitarian transformation in the United States, the NATO countries, and Japan. But, by now, it is clear that the attempt to carry out such a strategy"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 69 under the auspices of Bush-Cheney would call forth popular mass resistance on such a scale as to threaten the success of the entire project. Part of this limitation had to do with the inherent structural features of Bush-Cheney as political figureheads of the more traditional top-down, oppressive, reactionary type, lacking the capacity for mass mobilization of the mob. Now the banking establishment (Trilateral, Bilderberger, CFR, etc.) appears determined to play the card of mass mobilization through the so-called Obama movement. This notable shift in strategy and tactics will also require the synthesis of a new form of mass demagogy, of a new ideology. It is not clear, but appears doubtful, that Obama’s current messianic-utopian platitudes about bipartisan cooperation represent the last word in this department. It will also be necessary to add additional features to permit the targeting of foreign enemies, and this will probably need to be done in a form that does not appear to depend on the 9/11 myth. The new Obama-era rhetoric of imperialist aggression is not yet complete, but some aspects are already evident. The initial stress will likely be anti-Chinese, with hostility to Russia to some extent on the back burner. Joe Madison, a black talk show host with a track record of synergy with various US government operations, recently made some broadcasts from Darfur, Sudan with Thom Hartmann of Air America Radio, a drooling Obama acolyte. Madison’s line was that the Chinese, through their cooperation with General Bashir’s Sudanese government in Khartoum, were guilty of genocide and ethnocide against the southern Sudanese animists and Christians, including the ethnic groups represented by the Sudanese People’s Liberation Front, a notorious creature of CIA, MI-6, and Mossad. The Chinese were destroying villages and traditional lifestyles, raved Madison. Allegations of Chinese genocide against black Africa as a cover story for Brzezinski’s strategy of blocking Chinese access to African oil and strategic raw materials give some idea of the new, leftist tinged US-UK imperialist propaganda that would become plausible for some under an Obama regime. Hysterical agitation against the Serbs in Kosovo, the Chinese in Tibet and Sinkiang, the Russians in the Caucasus, and other obvious variations would not be far behind. Most of these would possess more appeal in Europe than the current Bush-Cheney neocon harping on their single obsessive note of “Islamo-fascism.”"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 70 SCENARIOS FOR OBAMA’S FUTURE: THE NEED FOR A GRIEVANCE One vital ingredient of earlier fascist movements which the Obama agitation so far has lacked is the element of overwhelming grievance, the bitter anger at having been betrayed, the sense of the stab in the back for which there must be retaliation. In the fascism of the interwar period, this element was provided by burning mass discontent over the outcome of World War I, over the horrendous sacrifices which had not been recompensed with the desired outcome. In the Italian frame of reference, this took the form of raging resentment against the Versailles peace conference and especially Woodrow Wilson personally, on the grounds that most of the former Austrian territories Italy had aspired to acquire at the end of World War I had been used instead for the Anglo-American project of creating Yugoslavia as a new synthetic state. This was the Italian slogan of the mutilated victory. In the German case, the overwhelming national grievance was the Armistice of November 11, 1918, which in the eyes of German fascism had represented a stab in the back for the gallant soldiers at the fighting front, who supposedly still had a good chance to win the war, on the part of the new Social Democratic government ministers in Berlin. This was the Stab in the Back, the main staple of all German fascist agitation during the 1920s and beyond. So far the Obama movement has no such obvious grievance which could serve as a fountain for endless bitterness, rage, and resentment. But it is all too easy to see how such a dimension could be acquired, since Obama has been hard-wired by his financier masters to destroy himself. Three alternative scenarios come to mind: In the first, Obama is defeated in his quest for the Democratic presidential nomination. In this case, his supporters are likely to riot at the Democratic National Convention in Denver at the end of August. Such a riot would be a cynically orchestrated media event in the way that similar staged protests in Belgrade, Tiflis, and Kiev have been in recent years. In addition, provocateurs would do their best to generate some action in poor black inner city neighborhoods. In the second, Obama wins the Democratic nomination but is defeated by McCain in November, most likely through a failure by the intelligence community to deliver an adequate combination of scandals against McCain and vote fraud in favor of Obama. In this case Obama’s backers might attempt to impose his presidency"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 71 through color revolution riots on some campuses, in certain black inner city neighborhoods, and perhaps through a March on Washington. This scenario would be more likely if the election had been thrown into the House of Representatives because of a lack of a clear winner in a very plausible three-way race among Obama, Clinton, and McCain. In the third, Obama wins the presidency in November 2008, and then goes on to implement the policies demanded by the Trilateral- CFR bankers. Some combination of war, depression, mass privation, economic breakdown, and a general fracturing and dislocation of society result. In the course of this, Obama inevitably disappoints, then betrays, and finally viciously attacks his own base, pitching the lemming legions into acute psychological distress on top of all their other woes. In this scenario, mob action is generated in protest against Obama’s betrayal or stab in the back, and a full-blown fascist mass movement, quite possibly of right-wing and racist coloration, results. Lurking beneath all these scenarios is now the new pattern of domestic US terrorism which has been evident since the Virginia Tech shootings of mid-April 2007. The new pattern is that of college student or campus-associated terrorism, which has taken center stage as Columbine-style high school or other public school terrorism and allegedly Islamic terrorism have moved to the sidelines. The new model is Virginia Tech gunman Cho, a mentally disturbed or brain– washed mass killer. Another case was that of Steven P. Kazmierczak, who in mid-February 2008 shot 21 people and killed five of them at Northern Illinois University in Dekalb. Kazmierczak was described as being intensely concerned with “corrections, political violence, and peace and social justice.” With the media spinning out a story of Obama’s alleged popularity among college students, these cases may represent dress rehearsals or pilot projects for multiple-shooter college student terrorism being prepared for detonation in the wake of political events like the ones just enumerated. Another possibly related ingredient is the death of a man in Las Vegas in late February after he had stayed in a room tainted with highly poisonous ricin gas. Ricin had also been sent to the Dirksen Senate Office Building in Washington DC in February 2004. If we imagine college student kamikazes with a ricin capability, the potentialities for massive disruptions and dislocations clearly become enormous. This analysis leaves open the question of whether Obama represents the final and definitive demagogue. In the case of Italian"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 72 fascism, the definitive demagogue Mussolini was preceded in terms of public impact by the poet Gabriele D’Annunzio, who functioned as a kind of pilot project until Mussolini took center stage. It may be that the Trilateral bankers consider US institutions as still too strong to topple by means of a single attack wave. Obama may represent only their first assault echelon, an expendable formation which is designed to be decimated as it does its work of weakening existing government institutions. In the aftermath of Obama, other fascist formations with different ideological colorations could emerge. It is well to recall that Benazir Bhutto evidently returned to Pakistan in October 2007 with the idea that she had been selected as the successful protagonist of a CIA people power coup. She accordingly waded into the throngs with reckless abandon, believing that Anglo-American intelligence would protect her. But, when her popularity began to ebb, she was evidently deemed by her masters to be more valuable as a martyr than as a candidate. The same sort of danger clearly exists for Obama, if he should falter. HUNTINGTON’S TASK: ABORT THE MASS UPSURGE OF 2010-2030 A quarter century ago, as we show elsewhere in this book, Zbigniew Brzezinski’s subaltern Samuel Huntington described the Trilateral Commission perspective for the American future, which amounted to a totalitarian transformation. This was right after the close of the catastrophic Carter administration, which Brzezinski, Volcker, and Huntington had done so much to guide into the abyss. It was also about the time that young Barack Obama may have been recruited by Brzezinski at Columbia University. In his book on American Politics Huntington looked ahead to a new period of political ferment and mass upsurge (what he calls a “creedal passion period”). “If the periodicity of the past prevails, a major sustained creedal passion period will occur in the second and third decades of the twenty-first century.” At this time, he argues, “the oscillations among the responses could intensify in such a way as to threaten to destroy both ideals and institutions.... This situation could lead to a two-phase dialectic involving intensified efforts to reform government, followed by intensified frustration when those efforts produce not progress in a liberal-democratic direction, but obstacles to meeting perceived functional needs. The weakening of government in an effort to reform it could lead"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"CIA People Power Coup in the USA, 2008 73 eventually to strong demands for the replacement of the weakened and ineffective institutions by more authoritarian structures more effectively designed to meet historical needs. Given the perversity of reform, moralistic extremism in the pursuit of liberal democracy could generate a strong tide toward authoritarian efficiency. (p. 232) I called attention to this perspective a few years after Huntington published his analysis [See Webster G. Tarpley, “Project Democracy’s Program: The Fascist Corporate State,” in Project Democracy: The Parallel Government Behind the Iran-Contra Affair (Washington DC: EIR), April 1987, excerpted elsewhere in this book.] If the Huntington formula remains in effect in the secret councils of the Trilaterals, the precise course of future development will depend to a great degree on exactly where the ruling financiers decide to insert Obama in the oscillating “two-phase dialectic” mentioned above. Obama might represent a transitional figure for the first phase. A FASCIST MOB IN DENVER, LATE AUGUST 2008? As things now appear, all of these questions are going to be hotly debated all the way to the Democratic National Convention in Denver at the end of August 2008. The lemming legions are already announcing their intention to make that even the focus of a people power coup/color revolution, with a rent-a-mob/dupe-a-mob of swarming adolescents descending on the city to stage a made-for- television spectacle of ochlocracy and mob rule in order to impose an Obama candidacy. I know whereof I speak: I have seen the greatness and the misery of the Democratic Party. On the evening of November 5, 1960, I was part of an overflow crowd of high school students who listened over outdoor loudspeakers to the speeches delivered by John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson at the New York Coliseum in the closing hours of the Nixon-Kennedy presidential contest. This Kennedy-Johnson rally was billed as an answer to the joint appearance by Eisenhower and Nixon, also at the Coliseum, a few days earlier. When the speeches were over, I joined the other high school kids in what we thought was a spontaneous march down Broadway from Columbus Circle to Times Square, where we were finally penned in and dispersed by the police. This march, though hardly epic, merited a line in the next day’s New York Times.

Despite the unavoidable presence of anarchist provocateurs and police agents among the protesters, the Chicago DNC protests ended in what was officially described by the Walker Commission as a “police riot” – meaning that it had been Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, most likely in cooperation with President Johnson, who had goaded the Chicago cops into their outrageous rampage of violence against peaceful political protestors. The protests being planned for Denver at the end of August this year will not represent a protest against war, nor against the financial and economic depression, nor against the growing police state. They will represent a piece of top-down political theater, cynically orchestrated by pro-financier think tanks and political operatives, and designed to impose a candidate who by then will have demonstrated his narrow appeal and inability to win the Democratic nomination in the normal way: Obama. They may think that they are in Denver to fight for an end to war, but they will be serving the interests of those who desire bigger and more catastrophic wars. They may think that they are fighting for power to the people, but they will be delivering more power to the financiers.

By Webster G. Tarpley Washington, DC, Jan. 19 — The New Hampshire Democratic primary was no exercise in grass roots retail politics, but rather a clash between two cynical covert operations run by contending factions of intelligence community professionals. On the one side was an attempt to replicate here in the United States on behalf of Obama the sort of “color revolution” or “CIA people power coup” which the National Endowment for Democracy and the Brzezinski intelligence faction have carried out in such countries as Serbia, Georgia, and Ukraine. On the other hand, an opposed intelligence faction was able to win the day by a more traditional type of Diebold voting machine pattern fraud in favor of Mrs. Clinton. The people power coup in particular was designed to abort the entire Democratic primary season, prevent further radicalization of the Democratic base on economic issues, and submerge the issues raised by John Edwards, the wild card in this race and the Democratic candidate Wall Street organized money hates for his introduction of the rhetoric of economic populism into the campaigns of both parties. Mrs. Clinton came into New Hampshire as the candidate of the machine bosses of what remains of the Democratic Party, the Shaheen machine of New Hampshire, of much of the trade union bureaucracy, of Washington lobbyists, and of large sectors of Wall Street. Barack Obama came in as the candidate of the Brzezinski-Soros machine, overwhelmingly focused on the need to assert Anglo-American world domination over Russia and smash the Shanghai Cooperation Organization during the next presidential term. Obama’s appeal was primarily to independents, many of them well-heeled elitists and good government types of the chablis and brie set. Edwards represented a"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 78 new variable, with significant trade union backing and a broad potential appeal to the traditional “Joe Sixpack” blue collar Democratic base. The outstanding lesson of the Iowa caucuses had been the ascendancy of anti-Wall Street economic populism, a theme pioneered by Edwards. This had been shown by Obama’s tendency to appropriate as his own the basic themes of the Edwards campaign: poverty, the Two Americas of rich and poor, the horrors faced by 50 million people who lack medical insurance, and the criminal practices of insurance companies and pharmaceutical firms. This approach had been successfully copied on the Republican side by the clever evangelical demagogue Mike Huckabee, who had used it to defeat the most plutocratic Republican, the stockjobber and asset-stripper Mitt Romney, a man who wanted to conquer Iowa with his all-powerful checkbook. Many reactionary commentators, including the Wall Street Journal and George Will, had savagely attacked Huckabee and Edwards for their verbal attacks on the finance oligarchs. BEHIND OBAMA, THE BRZEZINSKI CLAN OF RUSSIA HATERS George Bush had no foreign policy background, so it turned out to be his advisors who called the shots: these were the neocon fascist madmen, who have created a disaster. Obama has no knowledge and no experience of foreign policy, so it is reasonable to examine who his top advisers in this field are. We immediately find that Obama’s foreign policy is made by the Russia-hater Zbigniew Brzezinski of the Washington Center for Strategic and International Studies and the gray eminence of the Democratic Party foreign policy establishment. Brzezinski’s enthusiastic endorsement of Obama and scornful rejection of Mrs. Clinton last summer was a turning point in the rise of the Illinois senator. But Zbigniew is not just an individual; he is the gruff patriarch of an extended clan of intelligence operatives around which an entire coterie of the intelligence community is grouped. One is his son Mark Brzezinski, who served in the National Security Council during the Clinton era. Zbigniew and Mark jointly directed the infamous orange revolution in the Ukraine in November and December 2004, which brought a pro-NATO puppet regime of kleptocrats and oligarchs to power deep into the former Soviet territory. At one point in this operation, it looked like the pro-Russian eastern Ukraine might secede, leading to possible civil war within that country. If Russian troops had come into such a war on one side, and"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Coup and Counter-Coup in New Hampshire 79 Polish NATO troops had intervened in support of Brzezinski’s puppets, the result might have been a general European and world war. The Brzezinskis are happy to take such risks, sure in the knowledge that it is the Appalachian poor and black ghetto victims who will pay the price, and not their own circles of the cosmopolitan decadent émigré nobility. It is plausible, although not yet proven, that Obama was discovered by the Brzezinskis and created from the ground up starting in the early 1980s. Zbig taught at Columbia University from 1960 to 1989, and was the head of the Institute for Communist Affairs, a nest of anti-Soviet ideologues. After two years at Occidental College in California, Obama transferred to Columbia for his junior and senior years, majoring in political science with a specialization in international relations – Brzezinski’s own bailiwick – and receiving a B.A. degree in 1983. Zbigniew Brzezinski’s brand of lunatic geopolitics would obviously dominate a future Obama administration, but that is only the beginning. Zbigniew’s most recent book is Second Chance: Three Presidents and the Crisis of American Superpower (New York: Basic Books, 2007). Here Brzezinski argues that there is a global political awakening going on, and that the US is missing the boat. The goal of this global awakening is, in Zbig’s opinion, “dignity.” Not economic development, not the alleviation of poverty, not national sovereignty against the IMF and World Bank, but just dignity, with strong overtones of small-state particularism, parochialism, and local control. Obama’s alleged global approach and trans-ethnic, trans- racial allure are right out of Zbig’s cosmopolitan prescription. Many have pointed to Second Chance as the manual or printout for the entire Obama campaign, starting with the cultural and ideological profile assumed by the candidate. The entire Obama operation may be regarded as a cloak for Brzezinski’s resurgent ambition to go out in one great blaze of revanchist glory. Obama did not choose these advisers; it is a safe guess that the advisers chose Obama. The outlines of Zbigniew’s plan are also clear: he considers himself the man who shattered the Warsaw Pact, and who then brought on the collpase of the entire Soviet Union. Now he wants to dismember the Russian Federation itself, with the option of carving up the Russian heartland. Perhaps Zbig is dreaming of a Greater Poland with the dimensions it had about 1600: from the Black Sea to the Baltic, all controlled by petty szlachta aristocrats like the Brzezinskis."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 80 Brzezinski’s lunatic vendetta against Moscow cannot be worth a single American life. It is widely recognized that Zbig has provided the playbook for Obama. David Ignatius made this relationship clear enough in his review of Second Chance in the Washington Post when he wrote: “The most intriguing part of Brzezinski’s book is what I would describe as the Obama manifesto. (He doesn’t call it that, but I don’t think he would quarrel with that characterization, either.) Brzezinski argues that the world is undergoing a “global political awakening,” which is apparent in radically different forms from Iraq to Indonesia, from Bolivia to Tibet. Though America has focused on its notion of what people want (democracy and the wealth created by free trade and open markets), Brzezinski points in a different direction: It’s about dignity.” (March 14, 2007) Zbig’s brand of dignity is the kind attained through secession, balkanization, and the creation of a weak petty state for each ethnic minority – starting with Kosovo and Chechenia. This is the mine of neo-Wilsonian demagogy that an Obama administration will exploit – in the service not of peace but of US world domination and encirclement of Russia. Zbig said in endorsing Obama: “What makes Obama attractive to me is that he understands that we live in a very different world where we have to relate to a variety of cultures and peoples.” This may sound edifying, but the real meaning is to put a trendy multi-cultural mantel over a revanchism inherited from World War II and its aftermath. (http://firstread.msnbc.msn.c om/archive/2007/09/12/358475.aspx) LONDON ECONOMIST : ZBIG IS OBAMA’S BRAIN The London Economist recently revealed to its readers that Zbigniew is Obama’s brain in much the same way that Karl Rove or the neocons in general have been considered as Bush’s brain. The Economist blog enthused: “A NEW brain for Barack Obama! It’s 78 years old and it still works perfectly. It belongs to Zbigniew Brzezinski, the peppery ex-national security adviser to Jimmy Carter.” (March 14, 2007) Working under this brain are numerous subsidiary ganglions. As already noted, Zbigniew Brzezinski’s son Mark Brzezinski served in the National Security Council as Director of Russian and Eurasian Affairs under President Clinton. Mark Brzezinski was in his own right one of the prime movers of the November/December 2004"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Coup and Counter-Coup in New Hampshire 81 people power coup or color revolution in Ukraine. He is also prominently listed as an adviser to the Obama campaign. In a recent op-ed, Mark Brzezinski gushed in praise of his family’s standard bearer: “Mr. Obama’s early opposition to the war in Iraq is well known. But his opposition to the war in Iraq is related to his more general concern that America is bungling it in global leadership. His candidacy gives America an opportunity to redefine itself in relationship with the world precisely because he takes a global approach to our challenges rather than a more conventional approach. That global approach comes from a man who at an early age lived abroad, learned a foreign language and was raised by parents who themselves were foreign or desired to live in a foreign country.” (Mark Brzezinski, “Obama’s Global Approach,” Washington Times , Oct 26, 2007) Reality is much uglier: as the Voltaire Network wrote during the 2004 election, on the eve of the Kiev coup: “Zbigniew Brzezinski recommends how Russia should be militarily weakened and intimidated. He is convinced that the best way to achieve it is by destabilizing its border regions, a political strategy that aroused the interest of former presidential candidate John Kerry’s team who recruited his son Mark Brzezinski as its foreign policy adviser.” (Zbigniew Brzezinski, the Empire’s Adviser: The Outrageous Strategy to Destroy Russia, Voltaire, October 22, 2004) Another of Zbigniew’s sons is Ian Brzezinski, currently the US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and NATO affairs and a backer of NATO expansion into Ukraine and Georgia. This project means that Americans will be committed to fight and die for a gangster regime in the Caucasus, at the far end of the Black Sea. Ian is also pushing the installation of US ABM missiles in Poland and radars in the Czech Republic. He is also a protagonist of the independence of Kosovo, to be accomplished under the gun-running, drug-running KLA terrorist organization. Zbigniew Brzezinski’s daughter is Mika Brzezinski, who holds forth every morning as the sidekick of former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough on MSNBC. NBC and MSNBC were at the leading edge of the attempt to stampede the New Hampshire vote in favor of Obama. The most hysterical partisan for Obama in this context was of course the mentally unbalanced Chris Matthews, who acted as an open partisan and cheerleader for Obama, quite possibly violating Federal Elections Commission rules in the process. Other pro-Obama propagandists at NBC/MSNBC included Andrea Mitchell, the wife of Alan Greenspan, Tim Russert, and Scarborough"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 82 himself. Mika Brzezinski was slightly more discreet, skewing the coverage in favor of Obama without the same level of bombastic excess exhibited by Russert. Mika Brzezinski’s major interview with Michele Obama of the New York Council on Foreign Relations, the wife of the candidate, was a significant contribution to the general media swoon in favor of the newcomer. Mika’s mother and Zbigniew’s wife is a Benes, a relative of the President of Czechoslovakia at the time of the Chamberlain’s Munich sellout of September 1938, who was later the head of the London-sponsored Czech government in exile. Such anti-Russian, anti-Austro- Hungarian, and anti-German political figures in eastern Europe are often descendants of the old 1848-1870 Mazzini pro-terrorist networks, and this tradition of British subversion is alive and well with the Brzezinskis today. Finally, there is Matthew Brzezinski, who reported in the Washington Post Magazine of March, 2005 about his amicable discussions with Ilyas Akhmadov, “foreign minister” and US envoy of the Chechen terrorist opposition, who is living high on the hog with a comfortable apartment in the Woodley Park area of Washington, a Reagan-Fascell stipend, an office at the National Endowment for Democracy, a secretary, a travel budget, and a public relations expense account – all to rehabilitate the public image of the Chechen terrorists, all paid for by the US taxpayers with checks signed by Secretary of State Condol eezza Rice, and all courtesy of the lobbying efforts of Zbigniew Brzezinski. Matthew Brzezinski, quite possibly a Canadian citizen, went out to have a few beers with Akhmadov. Hobnobbing with a spokesman for terrorists, provided that he is anti-Russian, is typical of the Brzezinskis. The group Akhmadov represents specializes in killing defenseless women and children in the hospitals and schools of southern Russia. Russia has repeatedly demanded the extradition of Achmadov as a terrorist, but the Bush regime has refused. A COLOR REVOLUTION ATTEMPTED IN NEW HAMPSHIRE The model of the orange revolution run by Zbig and Mark Brzezinski in Ukraine is the key to understanding what was attempted in New Hampshire. Methods that the Brzezinskis, the George Soros Open Society Foundation and their helpers at the US National Endowment for Democracy (NED, also known as Project Democracy) have perfected overseas are now being brought home to"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Coup and Counter-Coup in New Hampshire 83 promote the Brzezinski agenda and continue the line of stolen elections from 2000, 2002, and 2004. Mob rule, what the Greeks called ochlocracy, is the essence of the color revolution or people power coup. The modern theoretical basis of these mob coups has been provided by the writings of a certain Gene Sharp. In order to carry out a color revolution, large sums of money are required to pay bribes and buy support. Beyond that, the following ingredients are necessary: 1. Media. It is essential to control the key television channels, or at least one major network. In less developed societies, a well-known radio station might suffice, but here in the US it takes a broadcast network and one or more cable networks, backed up by news magazines, daily newspapers, and various internet sites. These organs must attempt to create a collective hysteria or mania in the whole society in favor of the people power coup. In Iowa and New Hampshire, the media swoon was led by NBC/MSNBC, but included most of the networks, plus Newsweek, the Boston and New York tabloids, and many others. Obama was fawned over by George Will, David Broder, Robert Novak, and many other columnists, including those with markedly right wing profiles. 2. Rent-a-mobs. This term became widespread during Brzezinski’s 1978 overthrow of the Shah of Iran in favor of Ayatollah Khomeini. No self-respecting anti-Shah politician in Teheran could venture outdoors without a numerous rent-a-mob. In Kiev, large numbers of young people camped out in the central square of the city to drive home their demand that the pro-Moscow government be replaced with Brzezinski’s pro-NATO puppets, although many of them were too naïve to realize that this was the issue. In more prosperous countries, such as the US, the dupe-a-mob offers a more economical equivalent. In any case, the mobs must be big enough to be shown on television, thus creating the illusion that the coup leader is riding a wave of overwhelming popular support and truly represents the Collective Will in Rousseau’s sense. The large crowds of well-meaning but ignorant and poorly informed young people who stood in long lines outside Obama’s events on the Sunday and Monday before the New Hampshire"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 84 primary are examples of such dupe-a-mobs. One modish technical term for these procedures is swarming, but the idea is as old as the mob itself. As Bill Engdahl has noted, “The Pentagon and US intelligence have refined the art of such soft coups to a fine level. RAND planners call it ‘swarming,’ referring to the swarms of youth, typically linked by short message services and weblogs, who can be mobilized on command to destabilize a target regime.” 3. Symbols and slogans. Ukraine had the orange revolution; Georgia had the rose revolution. The Prague velvet revolution was an earlier pilot project for the same thing. The cedars revolution in Lebanon did not fare so well; here the groups of well-heeled and privileged young people could not match the actual organized power of the Hezbollah mass base. A similar attempt in Byelorussia also collapsed in failure. Jeans, tulips, the colors blue and purple, and even bulldozers have been mobilized as mindless symbols. In addition to the catchy color or symbol, an effective slogan is also required. In Belgrade, at the start of the current series, that was “Gotov je” – “he is finished,” meaning that Milosevic had to go. Other slogans have included “It’s enough” and “It’s time!” For Obama, the solution in this regard was “Change We Can Believe in.” 4. Fake polling. Since the color revolution usually takes place under the cover of an election, faked polling for mass manipulation purposes is indispensable. In Ukraine, the pro-Moscow candidate Yanukovich was declared the winner by the official government vote count, but the rent-a-mobs and dupe-a-mobs in the streets began yelling that this was vote fraud. How could they prove it? Project Democracy had thought of everything: the polling firm of Penn, Schoen and Berland Associates was on the scene, and had carried out an exit poll of voters leaving the polling places. The results of this faked and doctored exit poll, a masterpiece of NATO intelligence, were the basis of the accusation of vote fraud, which was then endorsed by international observers from the European Union, the NED, and the Helsinki CSCE watchdog groups. Who was Brzezinski’s pollster? It was none other than Mark Penn, currently the much-hated boss of the entire Hillary Clinton campaign, for which he is top strategist and top pollster"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Coup and Counter-Coup in New Hampshire 85 at the same time. There are many indications that Mark Penn, the former partner of Clinton’s Svengali Dick Morris, is not really interested in Mrs. Clinton’s victory, but is rather dancing to the tune of the Brzezinski machine. Mark Penn’s probable role will be described shortly. 5. A suitable demagogue. In Serbia and Georgia, these were young and attractive oligarchical politicians, often western trained, and always on the make. In Ukraine, the coup candidate was Yushchenko, something of a tired retread and therefore not entirely plausible for the purpose at hand. To drum up sympathy for Yushchenko, he was apparently submitted to some form of disfiguring chemical or biological attack, and this was blamed on the Russians. Demagogue in chief is the role assigned to Obama, an ambitious and unprincipled politician who had been thoroughly vetted by the Soros apparatus, in addition to being groomed by the Brzezinskis. The net effect of these elements, orchestrated together in ruthlessly coordinated fashion, is to create an atmosphere of mob hysteria which can grip an entire nation, or at least the capital and certain other selected areas, and when amplified by controlled media for long enough can bring down a government and replace it with the protagonists of the coup. In this case, the various components of the coup were designed to converge on Monday, January 7, and on Tuesday, January 8, primary election day in New Hampshire. INSIDE THE PEOPLE POWER COUP: MARK PENN’S DIVIDED LOYALTIES The serious weakness of the Hillary Clinton campaign was its adoption of a rhetorical profile suitable at best to a presidential general election in calm times. Instead, in 2007-2008 Hillary was attempting to win over radicalized antiwar Democratic primary voters in the midst of a Big Change or party re-alignment election along the lines of 1828, 1860, 1896, 1932, and 1968. On the surface it might have been argued that this was because no member of the Clinton inner circle had fought a contested primary since 1992, ages ago in political terms. But it appears increasingly that this confusion between general and primary voting was willful, the result of a hidden agenda on the part of Brzezinski’s man Mark Penn."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 8 6 On January 3, 2007 Robert Novak wrote in the Washington Post that Mark Penn had been guilty of “premature triangulation,” advising Mrs. Clinton to pose (in the Dick Morris tradition) as a third force halfway between the leftists and right-wingers long before it was the suitable time to do so. Mrs. Clinton repeatedly exposed the warmongering nature of her campaign, leaving little doubt that she would keep at least 75,000 US troops in Iraq during her entire presidency, as she told the New York Times last March, and that she would act as an eager cheerleader for an attack on Iran, which had almost occurred with the new staged Gulf of Tonkin incident near Hormuz on the Saturday night before the voting in New Hampshire. Before the caucuses, published Iowa polls were showing that Obama and Edwards were pulling ahead of Mrs. Clinton. Novak gloated that this was “white knuckle time” for the New York senator, and threatened her with the specter of Howard Dean’s debacle in Iowa in 2004. Mark Penn purported in public not to believe the last-minute polls which showed Mrs. Clinton losing. According to one blogger, “based on everything I’ve heard and read, Penn genuinely didn’t believe the Des Moines Register poll showing Obama up big prior to the caucuses.” (Noam Scheiber, “Can Someone Explain Mark Penn To Me?”) According to other sources, Mark Penn was telling Mrs. Clinton that his own private internal campaign polls were showing her on the way to victory. The guess here is that Penn knew better, but was stringing Hillary along, counting on the notorious tin ear that helped her to bungle her 1993-94 health care campaign. Penn’s argument was reportedly that the upbeat internal polls could not be wrong, and so the traingulation and trimming strategy that was producing them could not be wrong either. In reality, both polls and strategy were disastrous, and Zbigniew’s friend Mark Penn must have known it. Clinton lost to Obama in Iowa by 9 points, and to Edwards by 1 point. Did Penn give wretched political advice, and then cook his polls to hide the damage done to Mrs. Clinton by her right-wing posturing? A CYNICALLY ORCHESTRATED MEDIA SWOON FOR OBAMA The shock of this thoroughly unexpected Iowa defeat explains the stunned disorientation of the Clinton forces when they arrived in New Hampshire on Friday, January 4. The feeding frenzy of the corporate media, doubltess stirred up by intelligence operatives favoring the"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Coup and Counter-Coup in New Hampshire 8 7 Brzezinski-Obama project larded through the various news and polling organizations, took an increasing toll. Penn made matters worse by claiming that there would be no Iowa bounce for Obama in New Hampshire, presumably on the basis of his internal polling, but more likely to keep the Clinton campaign totally disoriented and confused. “What I don’t understand is why Penn, having been proven completely, disastrously wrong in his reading of the Iowa numbers, would then go out on another limb yesterday, claiming Obama would get no bounce from Iowa based on a very early set of polls,” wrote blogger Noam Scheiber. A FOX News/Opinion Dynamics poll conducted from January 4 to 6 had Obama at 32 and Clinton at 28. A Marist College poll conducted January 5 to 6 showed Obama at 34% and Clinton at 28%. A USA Today/Gallup poll conducted from January 4 to 6 showed Obama 13 points ahead of Clinton. The thesis here is that these polling organizations, especially in acutely sensitive points like Iowa and New Hampshire, are regarded by the ruling circles as critical components of political control, and are throughly compromised and penetrated by the intelligence community. This has been the case for many decades. We will have to wait for a new Church Committee and a new Pike Committee to provide the details, but the general outlines are clear: the Obama vote totals were inflated in an effort to produce a people power stampede in favor of Obama as the Brzezinski candidate, while deflating both Edwards and Hillary. This hypothesis presumes the plausible presence of intelligence community represenatives in most of the leading polling organizations, something that no student of the 9/11 events would venture to deny. The Republican primary was left to vegetate away on its own, apart from stealing votes from Ron Paul, as far as can be determined. The critical time arrived on Monday afternoon, when the merciless pounding of the Chris Matthews storm troopers of the controlled corporate media and the barbs of the Boston and New York tabloids converged on the New Hampshire voters and the Clinton campaign. Through the afternoon rumors swirled that Mrs. Clinton was going to drop out even before the voting started, or, failing that, as soon as the dimensions of her humiliation became evident on primary night. The sooner she dropped out, the better, in any case. Edwards was given even less attention, but was also informed that his campaign was hopeless. The poetry of Obama had outclassed the prose of Hillary, crowed the New York Times , flagship of the Wall Street financier oligarchy. The Washington Post , which had been supporting Hillary,"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 88 began to signal a turn against her. The watchword of the color revolution forces had become the slogan that Obama was no longer just a candidate – he had become “a movement.” This was the hype emanating from millions of television sets. The goal was to stampede the voters onto the Obama bandwagon, make Obama the Democratic nominee by the acclamation of a virtual dupe-a-mob, force Hillary and Edwards to go home, and shut down the entire undesirable primary process. The media were offering Obama the crown. On Tuesday, January 8, primary day, the shameless and naked media hype for Obama continued. Exit pollsters sent by the media consortium appeared at the polling places, and one politics professor from St. Anselm College remarked later on MSNBC that the exit pollsters she had seen were feckless and callow youths, wildly flailing in their task, not knowing whom they should interview, not understanding voter profiles, and all in all throughly unprofessional. But the exit polling did not have to be accurate, and there was no point in hiring experienced professionals: this time the field data would be supplanted and overriden by cooked and massaged figures coming from the computers controlled by the coup – perhaps those of the National Endowment for Democracy, which has carried out this routine so many times abroad. Chris Matthews stated on MSNBC that he was provided polling data that afternoon showing that Obama was winning big. Shawn Hannity of Fox News confirmed that the data he was given showed the same thing – Obama way ahead. Novack’s post-election column suggested the same thing. Once again, the ochlocrats of the Brzezinski networks are the prime suspects. The results of the exit polls kept most of the television talking heads firmly committed to an Obama victory until the polls closed. THE CLINTON MACHINE STRIKES BACK But the Clinton machine, the Democratic Party bureaucracy, their trade union allies, and the relevant intelligence community factions were far from defenseless. They relied on more traditional methods of manipulating election outcomes. There are persistent reports that the Clinton forces brought in large numbers of out-of-state voters on buses in observance of Walter Mondale’s famous 1976 dictum of “Vote early, vote often.” Reports allege that voting is possible in New Hampshire on the basis of a verbal declaration of residence and intent to remain in the state. More important were the Diebold machines,"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Coup and Counter-Coup in New Hampshire 89 which were used in by 80% of New Hampshire voters. Where the votes were counted by Diebold, Mrs. Clinton had an advantage of about 3 %. In the 20% of the state where there were paper ballots, Obama was ahead by a similar amount. The result was not the will of the people but rather a vector sum of two competing covert operations, each one cynically created by factions of the US intelligence community. Congressman Kucinich has attempted to secure a recount of the paper trail left behind by the Diebold system used in New Hampshire, and this enterprise should be supported by others, such as Ron Paul. But Kucinich should not thereby gain sympathy for his foolhardy instruction to his supporters in Iowa to transfer their support to Obama on the second round of the caucuses there. Obama is the most right wing Democratic candidate, to the right of Hillary and far to the right of Edwards on all the major economic issues. He wants to expand the US military by almost 100,000 soldiers. Obama has also called explicitly for the bombing of Pakistan, a nation of 160,000,000 people armed with nuclear bombs. Obama is doubtless being instructed by his handlers, just as Jerry Ford was in November 1976, that his work of healing and reconciliation is not compatible with a challenge that is likely to uncover some serious vote fraud. Given Obama’s apolitical apathy and rejection of any form of struggle, it is possible that the real story of the 2008 New Hampshire primary may not be known for a long time. But in order to understand the whole picture of what did occur, it is necessary to take unto account both people power coup/color revolution side of things, which leftists have a very hard time understanding, as well as the Diebold voting machine fraud aspect, which leftists are better equipped to comprehend because of the experience of 2000 and 2004. AN ENCORE FOR THE BRZEZINSKI DOCTRINE OF REVANCHISM The Obama campaign deserves the closest sustained scrutiny; its Messianic qualities have not been seen since the days of Jimmy Carter, the president who promised that he would never lie. Obama, like the Carter of 1976, is a highly artificial product. Carter turned his foreign policy over to Brzezinski and his clique of Russia-hating eastern European émigrés and their children. Brzezinski’s entire adult life has been dedicated to what might be called revanchism – the obsessive desire to obtain revenge from the Russian people for the events of the Second World War and the Cold War. It was in the"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 90 service of that anti-Russian monomania that Brzezinski decided in 1976 to foment the rise of Islamic fundamentalism, which he touted as the greatest single bulwark against Soviet communism. As part of this insane project, Brzezinski was the prime mover in the overthrow of the Shah of Iran, and was then instrumental in installing the Ayatollah Khomeini in power in Tehran. Brzezinski cared less about the Middle East and its oil than he did about the need for a center from which Islamic fundamentalism of the most retrograde type could radiate out into the soft southern underbelly of the USSR. For Brzezinski, the space between the southern frontier of the Soviet and the Indian Ocean littoral became an “arc of crisis,” and his handiwork is with us until this day. The 1980 Carter Doctrine, which announced that the United States was determined to dominate the Persian Gulf against all comers, is at the root of the first Gulf War, of the present Iraq war, and of the clash with Iran which could come at any moment, as the most recent Gulf of Tonkin stunt near Hormuz has demonstrated. Brzezinski, as he himself boasted ten years ago in then pages of the Nouvel Observateur , ordered US subversion teams into Afghanistan in the summer of 1979, six months before the Soviet invasion, with the clear object of provoking Moscow to intervene. To this day, Brzezinski takes diabolical pride in having unleashed the decade-long Afghan War, which he touts as the Soviets’ Vietnam debacle, which restored the world balance during the 1980s. Brzezinski was very much a part of the effort that led to the creation of al Qaeda as a wholly owned subsidiary of US and UK intelligence, with an initial tasking of bleeding the Russians white north of the Khyber Pass. Brzezinski was eager to go to the brink with the USSR over Poland, even though this meant running a risk of general nuclear war with Moscow. “Brzezinski, acting under a lame duck Carter presidency, but encouraged that Solidarity in Poland had vindicated his preference for engagement and evolution in Eastern Europe, took a hard-line stance against what seemed like an imminent Soviet invasion of Poland. He even made a midnight phone call to Pope John Paul II— whose visit to Poland in 1979 had foreshadowed the emergence of Solidarity—warning him in advance. The U.S. stance was a significant change from previous reactions to Soviet repression in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968.” (Wikipedia, “Zbigniew Brzezinski”) In other words, Brzezinski was more of a lunatic adventurer than John Foster Dulles or Dean Rusk."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Coup and Counter-Coup in New Hampshire 91 The current tensions in US-Russian relations are the merest hint of what things would look like under a Brzezinski-controlled Obama foreign policy: the US might soon find itself locked in combat with the most formidable foreign power in today’s world, the resurgent Russian Federation of Vladimir Putin. In this sense, the “post- partisan” rhetoric of Obama could be the overture to World War III. FOR OPEN CONVENTIONS AND ROBUST PLATFORM DEBATES The US financier elite does not like the idea of a long primary election campaign leading up to national political party conventions in late summer — August 25-28, 2008 in Denver for the Democrats, and September 1-4, 2008 in Minneapolis-St. Paul for the GOP. Since they come so late, these conventions are likely to be conducted after a long spell of deepening economic and financial breakdown crisis, increasingly bad news from the Iraq and Afghanistan war fronts, and incessant political radicalization. Even more than they wanted the acclamation of the apolitical and “post-partisan” Obama, the financiers wanted to bring the primary process to a rapid end, especially on the Democratic side. It is already a good thing that the financiers have not succeeded so far in doing this. In every state in which there is a primary election, the level of politicization is raised, and local concerns, especially economic breakdown and economic insecurity, are highlighted. If the clever populist demagogue Huckabee, who talks to Wal-Mart Republicans and attacks Wall Street Republicans, can gain against the lavishly funded plutocrat takeover artist and asset stripper Romney, the warmonger McCain, and the would-be il Duce Giuliani, that will indicate which way the political wind is blowing. The same goes for South Carolina, for all the states who will vote on February 5, Super Tuesday, and for states further down the road like Maryland, which votes on February 12. Pennsylvania votes on April 22. All these states have a right to a real primary with real contending candidates. The primaries and caucuses should go on through all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the territories, no matter how much the Rumpelstiltskin Chris Matthews may scream and bluster. We have all had enough of pollsters, push polling, pundits, propagandists, perception-mongers, consultants, and the K Street-Madison Avenue axis of evil generally."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 92 Many of the later primaries, unlike the New Hampshire paradise of petty-bourgeois independents, are strictly limited to the registered voters of each party. Independents are not allowed to vote unless they change their registration. Among such straight party line voters, the bland platitudes of bi-partisanship have far less appeal. Joe Sixpack may want to vote for a Democrat or for a Republican, but he seldom wants to vote for the bipartisan party. The results in these states may thus promote a more pronounced radicalization. At traditional party conventions, the candidates were chosen by delegate votes, not brainwashing media hype and attempts to stampede the voters by idiotic hyperbole. The last truly open and contested party convention was the 1952 Republican convention, marked by the clash between the Eisenhower and Taft forces. Conventions were also the scene of real political clashes, quite often in the form of battles over issue planks for the party platforms. An example of this was the protracted fight over the Vietnam war plank at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August of 1968. If the current campaigns can breathe new life into the party conventions of the existing parties, that will be a sign of the realignment of the 40-year old party system going back to Nixon that is finally in progress this year. Forget the pundits, forget the commentators, forget the pollsters. Ignore the hysterical demands of the controlled corporate media that certain candidates whom Wall Street does not like should immediately drop out of contention and go home. Instead of paying attention to this babbling, watch the delegate count. After the New Hampshire primary, the approximate delegate count was Obama 26, Hillary 25, and Edwards 18. (There are of course the 800 or so Democratic superdelegates, party hacks who will try to go with the winner.) This still indicates a much closer race than the raving pundits of TV land are willing to concede. Above all, we must be on guard to prevent the Brzezinski clan from manipulating and stampeding the electorate through the use of new color revolutions or CIA people power coups here on the home front. BEWARE OF MESSIANIC PLATITUDES In 1976, the Carter candidacy was plausible because of the Republican debacle of Watergate, the prolonged war followed by defeat in Vietnam, and economic downturn after August 15, 1971. Carter made utopian promises – “I’ll never lie to you.” He was"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Coup and Counter-Coup in New Hampshire 93 mellifluous and ambiguous. But he turned economic policy over to Volcker, and foreign policy over to the Russophobe Brzezinski, who used the lofty rhetoric of human rights to begin systematic meddling in Soviet internal affairs, and created the Khomeini regime in Iran. Brzezinski’s grandiose schemes of world transformation caused a renewal of the Cold War, and without Soviet restraint the results could easily have been far more tragic than they in fact turned out to be. By 1980, disillusionment was great, Carter went down to defeat, and the nightmare of the Reagan regime began. In 2000, another obscure southern governor, George W. Bush, came forward with an array of utopian platitudes. He would be a uniter and not a divider, he promised. He would practice a compassionate conservatism. He would initiate a foreign policy of humility, and would restore the honor of the presidency. Deluded independent voters chose to believe these assurances. But since Bush knew nothing of the world, he called in his neocon advisors, the Vulcans, carefully chosen by George Shultz, just as Bush and Cheney themselves had been. The Vulc ans were Condol eezza Rice, Paul Wolfowitz, Douglas Feith, Scooter Libby, and the rest of the neocon cabal, who had their own utopian fantasy of re-ordering world affairs and giving US world domination a new lease on life. But their fantasy reflected an obsession with the security needs of Israel in the Middle East and a pathological hatred of Arabs and Moslems. The resulting disaster is all around us today in the form of lost wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, all predicated on the 9/11 myth. In 2008, we have an obscure Illinois senator, a neophyte with no legislative achievements to speak of and no track record of courage or principle, who has evidently been groomed by the deans of the Democratic Party establishment. A new raft of utopian promises are floated: the race problem in America and its attendant collective guilt will be expunged with a single vote. The clash of contending interests in Washington DC will be replaced by a magically harmonious bi- partisan and non-partisan cooperation. The bitterness of the clash derives from real conditions, and especially from the fact that the economic pie has shrunk to such a point that the traditional demands of the various ruling class factions can no longer be fulfilled, leading to life boat ethics in the elite itself, as some groups must necessarily be shut out completely. But no matter: a golden age and the earthly paradise are proclaimed by the pundits to be at hand, thanks to the magnetic personality of the new purveyor of platitudes. Even on the surface, the new leader caters to the overclass and exhibits a studied"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 94 indifference to the concerns of black ghetto victims and the oppressed poor of all races, but this callousness is re-defined as post-partisan, trans-racial, and global. But since he knows nothing of foreign policy, these matters will be managed by the Brzezinski cabal, which brings with it yet another set of fantasies of world renovation and social engineering, but still directed at preserving US-UK world domination. At the heart of the new fantasies is the desire to eliminate Russia and Putin as a factor capable of contesting Anglo-American hegemony. The potential for catastrophe here is if anything even greater than the perils of neocon meddling among the Arabs and Moslems. If they are to survive much longer, the American people need to become far more skeptical and critical in their evaluation of political candidates. They need to finally invalidate P.T. Barnum’s famous dictum about suckers and how there is one born every minute. They need to radically reform their own set of political criteria of judgment. Have they learned anything from their disastrous choices of recent decades? Many of them voted for Nixon, Carter, and the Bushes, to name just a few failed presidents. Have they learned anything from their own colossal folly? Are they ready to repeat their own tragic gullibility with Obama, or with some other demagogue? The failure of the New Hampshire people power coup gives them an opportunity to reflect and hopefully learn something. The Republicans have their neocons, obsessed with war with Iran, a danger that is far from being over. Any Republican can be relied on to continue the bankrupt Bush-Cheney neocon line for four more years, including a wider war with Iran. That is bad enough. But the entire foreign policy establishment of the Democratic Party is infected with raving hatred of Russia. If Mrs. Clinton wins out, her secretary of state will most likely be Richard Holbrooke or Wesley Clark, both mad bombers of Serbia in the spring of 1999, a piece of vandalism whose real goal was to deliver a warning to Moscow. Holbrooke and Clark come in at about 80% insanity due to hallucinatory Russophobia. But Obama’s Brzezinski clan handlers come in at 125% insanity on the same scale, which is worse. As for Edwards, he co- authored a “get tough with Russia” op-ed with Jack Kemp, among other sallies, but the guess here is that his Russophobic insanity index is on the whole lower. This is a dismal situation, although it is still possible to distinguish better and worse outcomes.

If Americans knew that this is the “foreign minister” of a terrorist group specializing in killing women and children first in a hospital, then in a school, and later defenseless civilians in a theater, their indignation might grow into rage. If they knew that this envoy for terrorists is living in the comfortable Woodley Park neighborhood of Washington DC with a lifestyle most Americans could not afford, with an office, a secretary, a travel budget, and a public relations budget all paid for at the expense of the US taxpayers, with State Department checks signed by Condoleeza Rice, they might be furious. If they knew that this ambassador for terrorists had been set up in his current all expenses paid, taxpayer-funded lifestyle by a man who is the main image adviser and the main foreign policy adviser to Barack Obama, their view of the Illinois senator and his qualifications for the presidency might well undergo a radical change."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Obama Campaign Linked to Chechen Terrorism 9 7 And yet, all this is reality. The terrorist organization in question is the Chechen rebel group associated with the names of two of the greatest butchers of our time, Aslan Maskhadov and Shamil Basayev, both deceased even though the organization they built fights on. The foreign minister and ambassador for this terrorist group is Ilyas Khamzatovich Akhmadov ( Ильяс Хамзатович Ахмадов , born December 19, 1960), who was granted political asylum in the United States in 2003. Akhmadov’s patron is none other than Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former head of the National Security Council during the Jimmy Carter administration and, before that the co-founder with David Rockefeller of the Trilateral Commission in 1973. Zbigniew Brezezinski in turn is not only the main foreign policy adviser to the Barack Obama presidential campaign; Zbigniew is in many ways the creator of the public relations image profile now being used by Obama in his quest for the White House, an image that is developed in Zbig’s latest book, Second Chance . Zbigniew’s son Mark Brzezinski, a veteran of the NSC under Clinton, is another key foreign policy adviser for Obama. Mika Brzezinski, daughter to Zbigniew and sister to Mark, churns out a propaganda line slanted in favor of Obama every morning on the MSNBC Morning Joe program. Ian Brzezinski, another son of Zbigniew, is busy poisoning US relations with Russia from his post as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Europe and Russia in the Bush Pentagon. Yet another member of the clan, Zbigniew’s nephew Matthew Brzezinski serves as a de facto public relations representative for Akhmadov, whitewashing this envoy for Chechen terrorists in the pages of the Washington Post . The entire crew is made up of petty Polish aristocrats notable mainly for their fanatical, consuming hatred of Russia and Russians. The family project is to hitch the remaining military power of the United States to their monomania of hatred. If they are allowed to succeed, the bloody excesses of the neocons in the Middle East will seem like schoolyard games by comparison, since the Brzezinski gang wants to court all-out confrontation with a first-class thermonuclear power that is moving well ahead of the US in certain crucial types of strategic weaponry. The now-infamous neocons have been careful to pick on powers with little or no strategic retaliatory potential. Brzezinski lacks this faculty of discrimination. This is the reality behind the messianic edification and utopian platitudes dished up by Obama. Under an Obama administration, Americans will risk getting a reminder of what real war looks like, and they may discover that it is a two-way street."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 98 Voters who may be wondering what the foreign policy of a future Obama administration might look like need to learn from recent painful experience with George W. Bush and look closely at the foreign policy advisers around the candidate, since it is these figures who will prepare the policy options and, by so doing, will determine the course of a new administration. For Bush, these advisers were the self-styled “Vulcans,” figures like Wolfowitz, Condi Rice, Rumsfeld, Colin Powell, and Cheney, most of them neocons and most of them chosen by George Shultz, who created the disaster of the Afghan and Iraq wars. Even though Bush might have been a blank slate in foreign policy, it was evident from the presence of these neocon warmongers which direction the new regime would choose. Who then are the corresponding figures around Obama? A cursory look reveals that in foreign affairs and not just foreign affairs, Obama is the creature of the Brzezinski machine. “HE’S A TERRORIST, THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT” The country that wants Akhmadov extradited into their custody to stand trial for multiple murder charges is the Russian Federation, which has repeatedly requested that Akhmadov not be allowed to stay in Washington. Russia has been demanding Akhmadov’s extradition since 2003. “He’s a terrorist, there is no doubt about it,” commented Aleksander Lukashevich, senior political counselor at the Russian Embassy in Washington. “We have proof . . . Our foreign minister has made Russia’s position on extradition quite clear.” “Harboring terrorists, their henchmen and sponsors undermines the unity and mutual trust of parties to the antiterrorist front,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated in an address to the U.N. General Assembly in 2004. Russian President Vladimir Putin commented during a visit to India in December 2004: “We cannot have double standards while fighting terrorism, and it cannot be used as a geopolitical game.” Akhmadov’s presence in Washington is thus already a major irritant in US-Russia relations. Seen in this context, Akhmadov emerges as pawn in the Brzezinski clan strategy to set the United States and Russia on a confrontation course, a strategy they plan to impose on Obama, who is their clueless puppet in international affairs. Voters may remember the Chechen terrorists for their greatest atrocity, the September 2004 attack on a school in Beslan, North Ossetia, located in the ethnically diverse trans-Caucasus region of southern Russia. At that time, Chechen terrorists took hundreds of"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Obama Campaign Linked to Chechen Terrorism 99 hostages in an elementary school. Before the terror attack was finished, more than 300 persons, mainly school children and women, had been massacred. The responsibility for this atrocity was claimed in a formal statement by the terrorist leader Shamil Basayev, a reputed CIA agent later killed by Russian troops. This infamous Basayev, one of the fiercest terrorists of our own or any other time, is generally acknowledged to have been the direct superior officer, mentor, and friend of Ilyas Akhmadov, the protégé of Zbigniew Brzezinski now living at US taxpayer expense. Akhmadov himself admits his close relationship to Basayev, whom he first met in 1992. In 1994, when the Chechen secessionist rebellion began, Akhmadov was quick to join an infantry unit commanded by Basayev operating near the Chechen capital of Grozny. Akhmadov’s other great terrorist sponsor was the Chechen rebel “president” Maskhadov, who named Akhmadov to the job of foreign minister which he still claims to hold, despite his claims to disagree with the terrorist policies of the government he continues to represent. Maskhadov was killed by Russian forces. Akhmadov, who demands Sam Adams on draft, not in bottles when he is thirsty, told Zbigniew’s nephew Matthew that he no longer approves of what Basayev and Maskhadov did, but his complicity is beyond doubt. (See Matthew Brzezinski, “How a Chechen terror suspect wound up living on taxpayers’ dollars near the National Zoo,” Washington Post , March 20, 2005.) 1995 BUDYONNOVSK HOSPITAL MASSACRE BY AKHMADOV’S FRIENDS In 1995, a group of 150 Chechen terrorist fighters commanded by Basayev attacked a Russian hospital in Budyonnovsk, about 100 miles north of the Chechen border. Basayev and his terrorist commandos took more than 1,000 hostages at the hospital, leading to a siege by Russian forces which lasted a week. Basayev’s Chechen terrorist fighters used the defenseless Russian patients and staff as human shields. In the ensuing fighting, more than 100 Russian hostages, including many women and children, perished. These are the forces which Akhmadov has represented and continues to represent, with the American taxpayer footing the bill. Akhmadov’s track record is so horrendous that even some important Republican Congressmen resisted granted him asylum in the US. The 2003 House Judiciary Co mmittee Chairman F. James Sensenbrenner (R-Wisconsin), and the chairman of the Immigration and Border Security subcommittee, John Hostettler (R-Indiana)"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 100 jointly demanded that the then Attorney General John Ashcroft review the ruling that granted Akhmadov political asylum. “If the United States had evidence that Mr. Akhmadov was involved in terrorist activities, it is unclear why he was not barred from asylum as a terrorist and as a danger to the security of our nation,” they told Ashcroft in September 2004. ZBIGNIEW: “ONE OF THE HAPPIEST DAYS OF MY LIFE” “In July 2004...after running up legal fees that (if he had had to pay them) would have set him back $250,000, Akhmadov received the final decision. He could stay in America,” writes Matthew Brzezinski. He does not make clear who footed the bill for Akhmadov’s quarter million dollars of lawyers’ expenses. Was it the American taxpayer? In any case, there is no doubt that the pro- Akhmadov lobbying was spearheaded by Zbigniew Brzezinski and his faction of Russia haters. When Akhmadov was granted permanent asylum, it was apparently Zbigniew Brzezinski who called to give him the news: “I’m not exaggerating when I say that one of the happiest days of my life was when I called Ilyas to tell him that he would be able to stay in America,” said Zbigniew Brzezinski, as quoted by his own nephew, Matthew. ( Washington Post , March 20, 2005) Akhmadov was later given a Reagan-Fascell grant by the State Department. This provides him with a generous stipend for living expenses, an office at the National Endowment for Democracy complete with private secretary, plus extra money for travel and public relations purposes – all courtesy of the American taxpayer. Would an Obama administration, with an anti-Russian foreign policy dictated by Zbigniew Brzezinski and his clan, bring Chechen terrorists in large numbers to this country, provided that they were anti-Moscow? Would these terrorists get Reagan-Fascell grants from the State Department, so that they could live and operate at US taxpayer expense? What impact might that have on US-Russian relations? If these terrorists were to orchestrate a huge atrocity in Russia that had their fingerprints all over it, what might the Russian response be? Do we really want to go down this road in deference to the psychotic obsessions of an aging revanchist and Russophobe like Zbigniew Brzezinski?

The scandal came out in the pages of Johnson’s Russia List , the scholarly clearing house for information about Russia. Professor Robert Bruce Ware of Southern Illinois University offered the following facts to challenge the Matthew Brzezinski article, which had claimed that Akhmadov was now a penitent for the actions of the Chechen terrorist regime: “On August 2 and September 5, 1999, the Russian Republic of Dagestan was invaded by about 2,000 terrorists from al-Qaeda-connected bases in Chechnya. Dozens of innocent Dagestani men, women, and children were murdered. According to figures furnished by the UNHCR, 32,000 people were driven from their homes. The invasions were potentially genocidal in that they exposed to direct attack the entire ethnic territories, and all villages, inhabited by some of Dagestan’s smaller ethno-linguistic groups, such as the Andis. During these months Illyas Akhmadov was serving as Chechnya’s foreign minister. He did not resign from that position. I have been able to find no evidence that Akhmadov issued any public statement repudiating the invasions of Dagestan during the six weeks that they were in progress. During interviews with Dagestanis since that time, I have been able to find no one in Dagestan who is aware of any public statement issued either by Illyas Akhmadov or Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov repudiating the invasions while they were in progress, let alone offering to assist the people of Dagestan in resisting them.” (Robert Bruce Ware, “Response to Brzezinski,” Johnson’s Russia List , March 20, 2005) Professor Ware challenged the Brzezinski cabal to justify their support for Akhmadov and the Chechen terrorists, especially in the light of Bush’s posturing that those who harbor terrorists are themselves to be classified as terrorists: “We Americans can easily imagine how we would feel if we were to discover that Mullah Omar, or any other important Taliban official, had been granted political asylum in Russia. ...Now here are my first questions for Illyas Akhmadov, the Brzezinski clan, ... and everyone else cited in the Brzezinski article: If the United States was correct to declare the entire Taliban government a terrorist organization, then why isn’t the Russian government correct to declare Chechen government, including Aslan Maskhadov and Illyas Akhmadov, to be a terrorist organization?

Why"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 102 didn’t Illyas Akhmadov resign from the Chechen government when Dagestan was invaded? Why didn’t Illyas Akhmadov resign from the Chechen government when Aslan Maskhadov refused to extradite the leaders of the invasion of Dagestan? During the months of August and September 1999, Illyas Akhmadov was shuttling between Moscow and Grozny in order to negotiate these points with Russian officials. During those months did Illyas Akhmadov personally refuse, or convey refusals, of requests such as these? Exactly what record is there that Illyas Akhmadov ever issued a public statement repudiating the invasions of Dagestan while those invasions were in progress, or supporting the extradition of the invasions’ leaders? (Robert Bruce Ware, “Response to Brzezinski,” Johnson’s Russia List , March 20, 2005) “ACHMADOV SHOULD BE ASKED TO LEAVE THE UNITED STATES” Professor Ware’s conclusion was that Akhmadov needed to be deprived of his State Department funding and kicked out of the United States: “If the 9/11 made Bin Laden a terrorist, and if the Oklahoma City blast made McVeigh a terrorist, then why didn’t his public acceptance of responsibility for the Ingushetia raids make Aslan Maskhadov a terrorist? And if his public acceptance of responsibility for those raids made Maskhadov a terrorist, then why doesn’t it implicate those who represented him, such as Illyas Akhmadov, in charges of terrorism? And if it does make Illyas Akhmadov a terrorist then why is he enjoying political asylum and a prestigious professional position at the expense of the American taxpayer?... Akhmadov should be asked to leave the United States as soon as possible.” (Robert Bruce Ware, “Response to Brzezinski,” Johnson’s Russia List , March 20, 2005) Better yet, Akhmadov should be handed over to Russia, which would get him off the back of the US taxpayer. At the very least, Akhmadov should be indicted for terrorism and put on trial in Washington. BRZEZINSKI SUPPORTED POL POT Zbigniew Brzezinski’s support for Chechen terrorism, no matter how dangerous this policy may be for the United States, is exemplary for his entire approach to world affairs, which he calls “geostrategy.” In practice, this means Russophobia, the hatred of Russia. So fanatical is Zbigniew’s hatred for Russia that he is willing to embrace any lunatic adventure, no matter what the potential for blowback and"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Obama Campaign Linked to Chechen Terrorism 103 damage to the United States, as long as he thinks that Moscow may be harmed in the process. A good example is his support of the genocidal Pol Pot regime in Cambodia during the time he ran foreign policy during the Carter Administration. Pol Pot was supported by the Chinese, and the Chinese at that time were the key to Brzezinski’s version of the China card policy, which was to play Beijing against Moscow in the hopes of weakening both. This is another very dangerous idea that he hopes to duplicate under a future Obama regime. Here is Brzezinski’s confession that he backed Pol Pot, which makes him an accessory to one of the greatest crimes against humanity in the twentieth century. The Pol Pot regime slaughtered between two and three million of its own people, a greater proportion of the target population than that attained by any other genocide in our time. But this was no impediment to Zbigniew: “In 1981, President Carter’s national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, said, ‘I encouraged the Chinese to support Pol Pot.’ The US, he added, ‘winked publicly’ as China sent arms to the Khmer Rouge through Thailand.” Even after the Pol Pot regime had been defeated on the battlefield by the forces of Hanoi, it continued to occupy the Cambodian seat at the United Nations, thanks largely to the support of the Carter administration which was ordered by Zbigniew Brzezinski as a Cold War measure and as a part of his China card anti-Russian rapprochement with Beijing. By this time, it was clear that the Pol Pot regime had indeed committed genocide. (John Pilger, “The Long Secret Alliance: Uncle Sam and Pol Pot,” Fall 1997, online at: http://chss.montclair.edu/english/furr/pol/pilgerpolpotnus.pdf., citing Elizabeth Becker, When the War was Over , New York: Simon and Shuster, 1986, p. 440.) Brzezinski also set the United States on the course that has led to the First Gulf War and the current Iraq and Afghanistan debacles. In 1980, Brzezinski was the author of the Carter Doctrine, which stated that the United States was determined to dominate the Persian Gulf against all comers. Two subsequent wars have done nothing more than play out the logic of that committment, which Zbigniew intended to favor a collision between Washington and Moscow. BRZEZINSKI BOASTS OF STARTING THE AFGHAN WAR Brzezinski was also the great promoter of Islamic fundamentalism, which he celebrated as the greatest bulwark against Soviet Russian communism. Using the Islamic faundamentalists, Brzezinski hoped to"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 104 make the entire region between the southern border of the USSR and the Indian Ocean into an “arc of crisis,” from which fundamentalist subversion would radiate into Soviet territory, first and foremost into the five Soviet republics of central Asia, Azerbaijan, etc. It was in the service of this Islamic fundamentalist card that Brzezinski first helped overthrow the Shah of Iran, and then insisted that the replacement could be no one else than Ayatollah Khomeini. To magnify the impact of Khomeini, Brzezinski sent subversion teams into Afghanistan during the summer of 1979 to undermine the pro-Soviet forces there and induce Moscow to intervene. When the USSR invaded Afghanistan at Christmas 1979, Moscow claimed that they were responding to earlier aggressive moves into that country by the US. In an interview about ten years ago, Brzezinski conceded that this had been true: Zbig had indeed sent subversion and terror teams into Aghanistan at least six months before the Soviet invasion., as is clear from this excerpt from that interview: Brzezinski : ... According to the official version of history, CIA aid to the Mujahadeen began during 1980, that is to say, after the Soviet army invaded Afghanistan, 24 Dec 1979. But the reality, secretly guarded until now, is completely otherwise: Indeed, it was July 3, 1979 that President Carter signed the first directive for secret aid to the opponents of the pro-Soviet regime in Kabul. And that very day, I wrote a note to the president in which I explained to him that in my opinion this aid was going to induce a Soviet military intervention. Q : Despite this risk, you were an advocate of this covert action. But perhaps you yourself desired this Soviet entry into war and looked to provoke it? B : It isn’t quite that. We didn’t push the Russians to intervene, but we knowingly increased the probability that they would. Q : When the Soviets justified their intervention by asserting that they intended to fight against a secret involvement of the United States in Afghanistan, people didn’t believe them. However, there was a basis of truth. You don’t regret anything today? B : Regret what? That secret operation was an excellent idea. It had the effect of drawing the Russians into the Afghan trap and you want me to regret it? The day that the Soviets officially crossed the border, I wrote to President Carter: We now have the opportunity of giving to the USSR its Vietnam war. Indeed, for almost 10 years, Moscow had to carry on a war unsupportable by the government, a conflict that"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Obama Campaign Linked to Chechen Terrorism 105 brought about the demoralization and finally the breakup of the Soviet empire. Q : And neither do you regret having supported the Islamic fundamentalists, having given arms and advice to future terrorists? B : What is most important to the history of the world? The Taliban or the collapse of the Soviet empire? Some stirred-up Moslems or the liberation of Central Europe and the end of the cold war? Q : Some stirred-up Moslems? But it has been said and repeated: Islamic fundamentalism represents a world menace today. B : Nonsense! ( Nouvel Observateur , January 15-21, 1998) From today’s perspective, a greater irresonsibility and adventurism could hardly be imagined. The First Gulf War, the disastrous Iraq War, and the looming Iran War are the direct fruits of Zbigniew’s adventurous precedents. If Zbig now argues that he did not mean to go so far in this theater, that changes nothing in this picture. THE BRZEZINSKI PLAN FOR RUSSIA The leaders in Moscow have Zbigniew’s number – he has been ranting against them for fifty years and more. They are well aware of the existence of a Brzezinski Plan, a confidential design to break up the Russian Federation and partition European Russia along the lines of what occurred during the Russian Civil War in the wake of World War I and the Bolshevik Revolution. In those days the White Armies were led by figures like Wrangel, Deinkin, Kolchak and the rest, with US forces landing at Murmansk. Today, the reactionary armies are led by the megalomaniac Zbigniew, who deludes himself that he can go as a victor to Moscow, where Napoleon and Hitler failed. Brzezinski’s aggressive plans are notorious among Russian leaders. As the Russian government minister Ivanov remarked: “Russia has to remain strong culturally, economically and politically,” he was quoted as saying by ITAR-Tass. “Otherwise, the ‘Brzezinski plan’ may prove a reality.” The wire explained that the “‘Brzezinski plan’ is a term used by Russian political figures since at least the mid-1980s to describe alleged Western plots to destabilize the Soviet Union and later Russia.” (Douglas Birch, “Kremlin Powers May Be Split After Putin,” AP, June 26, 2007)"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 10 6 Another news article related that by 2002 pro-Russian forces in Ukraine “have increasingly given credence to a ‘Brzezinski plan’ conspiracy that was first aired by Russian sources close to President Vladimir Putin. The ‘Brzezinski plan’ is supposedly an elaborate plan concocted by a group of U.S. policymakers to overthrow President Kuchma [then the president of Ukraine] and replace him with [NATO puppet] Yushchenko in a ‘bloodless revolution.’ An analogy is drawn with the overthrow of Slobodan Milosovic in Serbia in October 2000. Yushchenko’s alleged allies in this plot are the two wings of the radical anti-Kuchma opposition, [kleptocrat] Yuliya Tymoshenko, his former deputy prime minister, and Socialist leader Oleksandr Moroz. (Taras Kuzio, “Russia Gives Ukraine a Helping Hand in Its Elections,” RFE/RL, January 22, 2002) This is of course the scenario that played out under Brzezinski’s command, with great and continuing danger to the peace of Europe and the world, at the end of 2004. The Yushchenko pro-NATO regime in Kiev was installed by the November-December 2004 CIA people power coup or color revolution cynically orchestrated by Zbigniew and Mark Brzezinski, with the help of Mark Penn. OBAMA: A FACE LIFT FOR IMPERIALISM The terms of Zbig’s endorsement of his own protégé are very revealing. Obama “recognizes that the challenge is a new face, a new sense of direction, a new definition of America’s role in the world,” Brzezinski remarked during an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital with Al Hunt.” “Obama is clearly more effective and has the upper hand,” Brzezinski said. “He has a sense of what is historically relevant, and what is needed from the United States in relationship to the world.” Brzezinski dismissed Hillary Clinton as totally inadequate: “Being a former first lady doesn’t prepare you to be president. President Truman didn’t have much experience before he came to office. Neither did John Kennedy,” Brzezinski said. Clinton’s foreign-policy approach is “very conventional,” Brzezinski added “I don’t think the country needs to go back to what we had eight years ago.” “There is a need for a fundamental rethinking of how we conduct world affairs,” he continued. “And Obama seems to me to have both the guts and the intelligence to address that issue and to change the nature of America’s relationship with the world.” (Bloomberg, “Zbigniew Brzezinski Endorses Barack Obama,” Friday, August 24, 2007)"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Obama Campaign Linked to Chechen Terrorism 10 7 In other words, US imperialism needs a face lift and a dose of steroids to be able to address the question of finally eliminating any challenger powers and attaining a permanent US-UK Universal Monarchy, the real content of the shopworn phrase, “New World Order.” Brzezinski’s latest book, Second Chance , is widely viewed as the user manual for an Obama puppet regime. Here Zbig argues that there is a worldwide political awakening going on. This is true, and in the real world the content of this awakening is the demand for national independence, no more IMF conditionalities, economic progress, modern science, modern industry, modern technology, and rising standards of living. This awakening is clearly expressed in the world-wide demand for peaceful nuclear power reactors which is currently sweeping the planet, and which the Bush administration has been powerless to block, despite their efforts at confrontation with Iran over precisely this issue. Here is Zbigniew’s prescription in a nutshell: “The price of failing to implement ... [my] strategy is twofold. First, the US will spur Russia and China among others to form a rival axis of power that could tip the world toward larger imperial wars. Second, it will antagonize the emerging populist rebellion against global inequality. This widening inequality is producing “revolutionaries-in-waiting ... the equivalent of the militant proletariat of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.... [The] political awakening is now global in geographic scope, comprehensive in social scale..., strikingly youthful in demographic profile and thus receptive to rapid political mobilization, and transnational in sources of inspiration because of the cumulative impact of literacy and mass communications. As a result, modern populist passions can be aroused even against a distant target, despite the absence of a unifying doctrine such as Marxism.... Only by identifying itself with the idea of universal human dignity— with its basic requirement of respect for culturally diverse political, social, and religious emanations—can America overcome the risk that the global political awakening will turn against it.” As a perceptive reviewer summed it up, “Brzezinski’s book is a liberal manifesto for rehabilitating imperialism. But it relies on a fundamental, faulty assumption that the world’s nations, both great powers and war torn nations, can be led by the US as a global commonweal.” Ashley Smith, “Rehabilitating US Imperialism: Review of Zbigniew Brzezinski’s Second Chance: Three Presidents and the Crisis of American Superpower ,” www.

Brzezinski’s ancestors worked with the British to incite the subject nationalities of the Russian, Austro-Hungarian, and German Empires to rebel against St. Petersburg, Vienna, and Berlin, not in their own interests, but rather for the greater glory of London. Now Zbigniew wants to pose as the modern Mazzini, who wanted to make Italy turbulent – which was bad for Vienna – without making her united and strong, which would have posed problems for the imperial lifeline to India through the central Mediterranean. Brzezinski’s method would lead quickly to an economically depressed, impoverished and desolate world of squabbling, impotent petty states, presided over by Anglo-American finance oligarchs and their all-mportant eastern European emigre advisers. Naturally, Zbigniew is a fanatical opponent of third world economic development; he once said that the US would never tolerate any more Japans in Asia – in other words, no more successful transitions from backwardness to a modern full-set economy. A basic tenet of counter-insurgency is that when you are confronted with broadly supported economic and political demands, play the card of divide and conquer in the form of local control, tribal, racial, ethnic, and religious divisions, etc. Zbig claims that the real goal of the world-wide awakening is “dignity.” By dignity he means respect for every minute parochial or particularist trait of every real or imagined ethnic group and sub-group. It is the kind of dignity that reduces those who enjoy it from the status of independent nations to mere ethnographic material. Such dignity as Zbig imagines it can only be attained by the smallest possible political units – by the thorough balkanization, partition, and subdivision of the existing national states. It is the kind of dignity the British Empire had in mind when it played the Mazzini card of national self-determination against the Austro-Hungarian, Russian, and Ottoman Empires. Woodrow Wilson played the same card at Versailles. This kind of dignity is congenial and compatible with the Bernard Lewis Plan for carving and balkanizing every nation in the Middle East – three Iraqs, six or seven Irans, four or five Pakistans, two Sudans, multiple Lebanons, with"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Obama Campaign Linked to Chechen Terrorism 109 Turkey, Syria, and others mutilated and chopped up as well. Think of the current tragic status of Iraqi Kurds, Sunnis, and Shiites, and you will see the kind of dignity that Zbig is selling. Zbig obviously intends to apply this recipe in the ethnic labyrinth of the Caucasus and Trans-Caucasus with a view to starting the ethnic disintegration of all of Russia – a lunatic ploy if there ever was one. Another obvious flashpoint is Kosovo, where attempts to declare unilateral independence by the terrorist gun-runner and narcotics dealers of the KLA could come as soon as February 2008 – this month. Russia has already announced unspecified countermeasures to deal with such a unilateral declaration of independence, which is illegal under international law because of the Helsinki CSCE treaty of 1975 which finally put an end to World War II by fixing all European borders as of that date as permanent, except for changes mutually agreed to by the concerned parties. Zbig, one of the cheerleaders for the bombing of Serbia in the spring of 1975, cares as little about international law as any neocon. OBAMA WANTS TO ATTACK PAKISTAN Writing in the Atlantic Monthly , pro-Obama swooner Andrew Sullivan pointed to the massive soft power – understood as the ability to dupe and deceive the masses of the developing sector – that would accrue to the United States by making the Illinois senator with his lofty utopian and messianic platitudes the new face of US imperialism. He illustrates this by imagining a young Pakistani Moslem who sees Obama’s inauguration on his television screen, and presumably rushes off to join in the pro-Obama swoon of the corrupt and decadent US media whores. This is an ironical choice, since Pakistan is the one country that Obama has talked of attacking and bombing. Will Obama’s magical charisma still be able to dupe the Pakistanis when the bombs begin to fall? Another issue that worries the imperial apologist Sullivan is the deep partisan divide in US public life which is the heritage of Bush and his gaggle of neocon fascist madmen. Sullivan is concerned that the raging resentment against Bush & Co. may undermine the ability of the US ruling elite to manipulate and control public opinion by means of false flag terror operations. Here Sullivan sees the potential for a Spanish-style anti-terrorism backlash, on the model of Madrid in March of 2004, which punished and ousted the neofascist prime minister Aznar, who had tried to ride the terror attacks into a permanent personal dictatorship by suspending the national elections."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 110 Obama is seen by Sullivan as the key to restoring the unity of a nation of sheep and dupes that will have a uniform Pavlovian reaction to the next false flag terror provocation: “Perhaps the underlying risk is best illustrated by our asking what the popular response would be to another 9/11-style attack. It is hard to imagine a reprise of the sudden unity and solidarity in the days after 9/11, or an outpouring of support from allies and neighbors. It is far easier to imagine an even more bitter fight over who was responsible (apart from the perpetrators) and a profound suspicion of a government forced to impose more restrictions on travel, communications, and civil liberties. The current president would be unable to command the trust, let alone the support, of half the country in such a time. He could even be blamed for provoking any attack that came.” Andrew Sullivan, “Good-Bye to All That,” Atlantic Monthly , December 2007, p. 46) With Obama in the White House and the partisan divide papered over, the way would be clear to unleash new false flag provocations as needed, and the entire Anglo-American oligarchy could breathe easier. In addition to his call for an attack on Pakistan, Obama has also demanded the addition of 93,000 more combat troops to the permanent US regular army. This demand puts him in the company of the some of the most extreme hawks. Obama stated: “To defeat al Qaeda, I will build a twenty-first-century military and twenty-first- century partnership as strong as the anticommunist alliance that won the Cold War to stay on the offense everywhere from Djibouti to Kandahar.” (Fred Hiatt “Stay-the-Course Plus: Obama, Romney and Foreign Engagement on Steroids,” Washington Post , June 4, 2007.

(Max Hastings, (“Will we have to fight Russia in this century,” Guardian , June 5, 2007) ZBIG’S GRAND STRATEGY FOR 2009-2013: PLAY CHINA AGAINST RUSSIA Given the ongoing breakdown crisis and disintegration of the US- UK currency and banking systems, these powers are impelled to try to consolidate their world domination while there is still a chance of doing so. Single superpowers do not last very long, as history shows. The Spanish Empire of Phillip II seemed close to universal monarchy after the Turkish naval defeat at Lepanto in 1571 and the outbreak of the religious civil wars in France, but by the treaty of Vervins in 1598, it was clear that the resurgent France of Henry IV was once again capable of checkmating and balancing the Spanish. The France of Louis XIV appeared close to universal domination at the time of the Peace of the Pyrenees with Spain in 1659, at the end of the Thirty Years War. But by 1689 William of Orange had assembled his grand alliance against the French Sun King, and by Rijswijk in 1697 it was clear that the French domination was weakening. Today’s grand alliance against US-UK pretensions to universal empire is the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), composed of China, Russia, and most of the central Asian republics, with new members knocking at the door. It is this SCO which Brzezinski is determined to smash, with Obama as his chief operative. In June, 2007 Bush the elder and Bush the younger co-hosted Vladimir Putin at their compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, in the so-called lobster summit. The goal here was to detach Russia from the SCO and play it against China as an Anglo-American kamikaze. This was of course wrapped up in platitudes about preserving US-Russian"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 112 friendship, but the reality was the attempt to use Russia as a dagger against Beijing. Putin was of course far too intelligent to accept such a degrading and suicidal role, despite the many false friends who were urging him to accept. In reality, the Russian nyet had already been delivered six months earlier by Foreign Minister Lavrov in his essay on the catastrophic Russian experience as a member of the British-dominated triple entente during World War I. Lavrov’s retrospective led to the conclusion that Russia would never again be duped into the role of pawn for anybody’s imperialism. Since Putin declined to go to work for the US-UK against China, Washington- Moscow relations have steadily deteriorated, with Bush threatening world war three in both October and November 2007. Since the Bushies had failed to play Russia against China, Zbig now proposes to play China against Russia. In a recent op-ed, he argued in veiled language that China’s energy needs could be manipulated in such a way as to direct Chinese expansionism and dynamism on eastern Siberia, thereby setting up China for a direct military conflict with Russia – an old cold war dream that has circulated in Zbig’s revanchist circles since the 1950s. Zbig delicately summed up China’s energy vulnerability as follows in a late November 2007 Washington Post op-ed: “I recently visited China, where I had the opportunity to engage Chinese leaders in wide- ranging private conversations. I returned with two str ong impressions regarding China’s attitude toward the Iranian problem. The first is that the magnitude of China’s internal transformation makes it vulnerable to global political and economic instability.” The second is that China does not want the US to attack Iran, which is a major oil supplier. In Samuel Huntington’s work on the clash of civilizations in the mid-1990s, the assumption was that China and the Arab/Islamic world were the main challengers to the US-UK world system. Now Zbig wants to revise that, putting China among the supporters of the status quo and Russia at the top of the list of the rebels against the Anglo-American yoke: “Thus China, despite its meteoric rise toward global preeminence, currently is geopolitically a status quo power.” By contrast, “...Russia is an increasingly revisionist state, more and more openly positioning itself to attempt at least a partial reversal of the geopolitical losses it suffered in the early 1990s. Cutting off direct U.S. access to Caspian and Central Asian oil is high on the Kremlin‘s list.” A US attack on Iran is to be rejected, because it would alienate China while making Moscow stronger, Zbig argues: “Moreover,"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Obama Campaign Linked to Chechen Terrorism 113 longer-term geopolitical threats are seen by Moscow’s elite as involving potential Chinese encroachments on Russia’s empty but mineral-rich eastern areas and American political encroachments on the populated western areas of Russia’s recently lost imperial domain. In that context, the outbreak of a political conflict in the Persian Gulf may not be viewed by all Moscow strategists as a one-sided evil. The dramatic spike in oil prices would harm China and America while unleashing a further wave of anti-American hostility. In that context, Europe might distance itself from America while both Europe and China would become more dependent on Russia’s energy supplies. Russia would clearly be the financial and geopolitical beneficiary.” ( Washington Post , November 30, 2007) In other words, an attack on Iran is useless and self-destructive, since it would help Russia and open the eyes of the slumbering Europeans. Better to address the Russian challenge directly, Zbig hints. What this doubletalk points to in the real world is the need to turn away from confrontation with Iran in the short run, allowing the Chinese to increase their dependence on Middle East oil that must come across waters controlled by the US-UK fleets. An unspoken but obvious corollary is that the US must do everything possible to prevent the Chinese from developing access to oil sources in Africa or in central Asia. The African side of this effort is easily visible in the US-UK agitation around Darfur: the attempt to orchestrate an attack on Sudan has nothing to do with humanitarianism (by the butchers of Baghdad!), and everything to do with the fact that Sudan is one of the key oil suppliers to China, and will become an even bigger supplier as time goes on. The new US-AFRICOM, now in Stuttgart but soon to move to Ethiopia, is a key aspect of the US mobilization in many African countries to deprive China of future oil sources in that continent. About a year ago, the US-UK successfully played off Ethiopia against Somalia, severely weakening both. The new US deal with Libya is another aspect of the same effort. In recent months, terrorist actions by al Qaeda in Algeria and the other countries of the north African Maghreb have indicated that Algeria, a large oil producer, will be subject to US-UK destabilization as part of the same anti-Chinese campaign. The destabilization of Kenya has everything to do with this same thrust. If the Chinese can be kept out of Africa, their dependence on the Middle East will increase. As this is written, there is word of large-scale destabilization in Chad. At some future time, London and Washington could close the Middle East oil spigot, and China might conclude that the only alternative would be to seize"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 114 the oil wells of sparsely populated eastern Siberia, as Brzezinski’s article suggests. That way one could get rid of both China and Russia, Zbig suggests. Hare-brained “geostrategic” scheming of this sort was an important cause of World War II. The advantages offered by Obama for a campaign of large-scale subversion in Africa are obvious. The detailed work would be done by Susan Rice, Clinton’s assistant Secretary of State for African affairs, and manifestly a proponent of an early US attack on Sudan, among other targets. The mere thought that Trilateral Commission founder Brzezinski clan may be getting close to the nuclear button thanks to an Obama puppet presidency has already elicited rumblings from Moscow. General Yuri Baluyevsky, the Russian chief of staff, announced in January 2008 that Russia was now shifting its nuclear doctrine to include first use of nuclear weapons in certain situations. An AP report quoted Baluyevsky as stating: “We have no plans to attack anyone, but we consider it necessary for all our partners in the world community to clearly understand ... that to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Russia and its allies, military forces will be used, including preventively, including with the use of nuclear weapons,’ Gen. Yuri Baluyevsky said.... Baluyevsky identified no specific nations or forces that threaten Russia. According to the ITAR-Tass news agency, however, he said threats to global security include ‘the striving by a number of countries for hegemony on a regional and global level’ — a clear reference to the United States — and terrorism.” (AP, January 19, 2008) Around the same time, a group of retired NATO generals led by John Shalikashvili of the United States and Klaus Naumann of Germany proposed that NATO also shift its doctrine to frank reliance on the first use of nuclear weapons – a shift that the United States has already made for its own forces. General Ivashov, the former chief of staff of the Russian forces, replied from Moscow that the collapse of the US dollar was spurring the US and NATO to court “nuclear Armageddon.” Every vote for Obama is a vote to make these matters worse by bringing Zbigniew Brzezinski’s fingers closer to the nuclear button."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Obama Candidacy Means No Impeachment of Bush-Cheney Washington, DC, Feb. 4 — Wondering why Congressman Kucinich has withdrawn his impeachment resolution against Cheney, and dropped out of impeachment in general?

An increase in federal low-income heating assistance (known as LIHEAP), Goolsbee pointed out, had been championed by Obama’s opponent, New York Democratic Senator Hillary Clinton. Goolsbee’s remarks came in an interview this morning with Carl Quintanilla of CNBC business news television. Goolsbee stressed that the main difference between Obama and Clinton was that Obama was “more respectful of market forces.” Goolsbee was adamant that Obama was opposed to expanding the stimulus package to include “money for low-income heating assistance through a bureaucratic program.” Goolsbee’s statements came just one day after leaders of the Maine legislature had convened in Augusta to face the dire situation of low income families who cannot afford to heat their homes this winter, partly as a result of the sky-high price of heating oil. Some influential members of the Legislature spoke of taking money from Maine’s Rainy Day reserves to help people who are running short of heating oil this winter. Supporters of the proposed move said the high price of heating oil is cutting into the size of deliveries to households receiving Low Income Home Energy Assistance (LIHEAP), with many low-income families not being able to afford a full tank.

If this is what Obama will do in the White House, we don’t want any part of it,” Dobson added. Goolsbee also used his CNBC interview today to repeat that Obama is opposed to solving “the mortgage crisis by freezing interest rates,” a freeze which Wall Street is lobbying against. Such a “teaser freezer” would prevent rapacious mortgage bankers from re-setting upward the interest rates on Adjustable Rate Mortgages which they sold to unsuspecting homeowners. If there is no such freeze, monthly mortgage payments will suddenly rise for millions of current homeowners, forcing many of them out on the street through foreclosure because of their inability to pay the new, higher rate. “Mrs. Clinton has proposed a five-year freeze on mortgage interest rates,” commented Senate candidate Dobson, “but that seems to be a voluntary program so far. I am proposing a compulsory federal law to block interest rate hikes and outlaw all foreclosures for at least five years, or for as long as this depression lasts. Once again, Mrs. Clinton goes in the right direction, but Obama’s right-wing economists are offering nothing to the hard-pressed homeowners of Maine.

The Super-Tuesday results show conclusively that Obama could never win the general election in November. He would be yet another losing Democratic candidate, acceptable to wealthy elitists but not to the voters from working families of the middle class and lower middle class, doomed to go the way of George McGovern, Walter Mondale, Michael Dukakis, and John Kerry. He appeals to two groups – well-off suburbanites and blacks, and these will not be enough to carry the general election. Any Democratic candidate who cannot win California and New York should probably call it a day. That applies to Obama, but his situation is even worse. The voter pool for the Democratic primaries is notoriously not typical of the broader US population. The Democratic primaries have been skewed for decades by the presence of large numbers of upper-middle class elitists concerned about environmentalism, race and gender quotas, balanced budgets, good government, corruption, gridlock, excessive partisanship, and related issues. They are not interested in the minimum wage, trade union rights, stopping home foreclosures, and other kitchen table concerns of the less well off. In this year’s Super Tuesday, it was estimated that about 56% of the voters on the Democratic Party side had been to college – about twice the level for the population as a whole.

Missouri might fall to Clinton on a recount; in any case, the race was very close. Minnesota is a special case because of the Democrat Farmer-Labor Party; this was in any case a state that went for Mondale, for various reasons – not a good bellwether.

Mrs. Clinton carried these states convincingly, starting with California, where all of Obama’s money could not save him. California is so huge, so crucial, and so much a symbol of America’s future in the Pacific century, that the argument could well end here. A Democrat who cannot win California has no hope of entering the White House. But there is much more. RICH ELITISTS FOR OBAMA The Obama campaign looks very much like the past campaigns of Howard Dean, Gary Hart, Paul Tsongas, Bill Bradley, and other losers of the past. He appeals to wealthy elitists, and therefore has a fundraising base. He can turn out small numbers of dedicated liberal activists for caucuses, as we have seen in Iowa. He can use the Internet to get money in the same way that Howard Dean did. He enjoys the benefits of a collective media swoon, and the systematic fawning of the media elites. But none of this adds up to the ability to win a general election. Obama lost Massachusetts, in spite of the effusions of the politically decadent Kennedy clan. Despite media hype, he lost New Jersey. He lost border states like Tennessee and Oklahoma that a Democrat might win. Mrs. Clinton had already won megastates Florida and Michigan. She is likely to win in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas. What can we do with a Democratic candidate who cannot win"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Why Obama is a Sure Loser – and Prelude to a Disaster 125 California, New York, Texas, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Florida – cannot win even the skewed Democratic primary voters of these critical states? The question answers itself. As sociologist Fabio Rojas has noted: “The Obama campaign assumed that winning big states, aside from Illinois, was simply impossible. [Obama’s] strengths do not undermine Hillary’s single most powerful asset: rock solid support among the white women, retirees, and unionists who make up the majority of the Democratic base. There is nearly nothing that Obama can say to sway those voters....Obama can continue to win his kind of state (caucuses, low union, small to medium size, heavily Affirmative Action) and have the money to continue till the end, but he can’t deliver a knockout punch by winning in California, NY, NJ, Texas, Florida, Ohio or PA.” Obama’s campaign depends on creating the illusion of success. When there is no real success. A DEMOCRATIC SOUTHWESTERN STRATEGY Again, a Democratic candidate who cannot appeal to working women, retirees, and trade unionists is an exercise in futility. But Obama’s situation is even worse. While winning California, Arziona, New Mexico (already), and likely Texas, Mrs. Clinton has demonstrated a superiority among Latino voters, now the largest minority group in this country and the key to the future for any political party. Here she won by a 2:1 margin. She also carried the best educated group, Asian Americans, by a similar 2:1 margin. It might be argued that these Latino and Asian voters will simply go to a Democratic candidate in the general election, whoever that candidate might be. But the Latinos might just as easily go to McCain, who has carefully built a public record of being sympathetic to them, as Rush Limbaugh repeats every day. Therefore, it seems fair to say that while Obama may have a strategy to win the Democratic nomination, he has no strategy at all for winning the general election in November. Mrs. Clinton’s results, by contrast, add up to something historically important in American and world history: this is the outline of a new national coalition in the United States, and a new geographical formula for carrying the Electoral College. During the four decades since Richard Nixon’s victory in 1968, the Electoral College has been dominated by the so- called Southern strategy of Kevin Phillips, as refined by Lee Atwater and Karl Rove. This has meant that the Republican nominee generally"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 12 6 starts off with a solid Southern block of reactionary states, motivated initially by racist backlash against the civil rights laws, as well as resentments against the Vietnam and student protests of the 1960s. In sociological terms, the Southern strategy for Reagan coalition has meant that the Republicans could build a majority around such groups as the South, white men, affluent suburbanites, Christian evangelicals, and ideologized factions like the neocons. We are now in the throes of a party realignment, that is to say of a qualitative transformation of the structure and dynamics of American politics with the emergence of a new majority coalition. These events come rarely — generally only once in about four decades. We have seen party realignments in 1828, 1860, 1896, 1932, and 1968. The 1932 party realignment ushered in the great progressive Era of the Roosevelt new deal. The 1968 disaster brought us Nixon and 40 years of reactionary politics. It is now clear that the old Southern strategy and Reagan coalition have collapsed as of 2006. The recognition of this collapse has even become an issue in the Republican primaries, with the comments by Ed Rollins of the Huckabee campaign. A MODERN EQUIVALENT OF THE FDR PROGRESSIVE COALITION If we want to usher in a new progressive Era, we must find a new national coalition, somewhat similar to Roosevelt’s New Deal alliance, that will dominate American politics for the next four decades or so. We must also identify a formula for winning the Electoral College. Obama’s crazy quilt of states, heterogeneous congeries of supporters, and odd assortment of potential Electoral College votes can never do this. The key to replacing the old reactionary Southern strategy of the Republicans may well be a Southwest strategy for progressive Democrats. We have already noted that Mrs. Clinton has carried the Latino vote by a margin of two to one, and has also carried the Asian vote by a similar two to one margin. Latino voters and Asian voters represent two of the most dynamic classes of voters in the United States today — they represent in many ways a wave of the future. If we add in women, trade union families, blue-collar workers, retired people, blacks, the lower middle class and the broad middle class, plus immigrant groups, we can see the outlines of a national coalition capable of dominating the American political scene for the foreseeable future. This national coalition will not be based on the wedge issues developed by Lee Atwater and Karl Rove over the last"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Why Obama is a Sure Loser – and Prelude to a Disaster 12 7 40 years. It will be based on solid economic populist issues like a rising standard of living, the eradication of poverty, and expanded economic opportunity for all. In terms of the Electoral College map, we must especially stress Mrs. Clinton’s ability to carry California, Arizona, and New Mexico. Because of her ascendancy among Latino voters, it may well prove possible to add Texas to this voting bloc. If we can succeed in detaching Texas from the reactionary Republican solid South of the past 40 years, something that Latino votes will help to make possible, then the future path of virtually any Republican to the White House is permanently barred. Hispanics distrust Obama. Asians also distrust Obama. As we will see, we all have good reason to distrust Obama. If Obama is the Democratic nominee, Latinos and Asians may be tempted to vote for McCain. A McCain/Lieberman presidency would abort the ongoing party realignment, creating disastrous consequences which we would have to live with for the next 40 years — for many of us, for the rest of our lives. In addition, a McCain/Lieberman presidency virtually guarantees war with Iran within six months. THE PARTY REALIGNMENT MUST SUCCEED It is therefore imperative that we take the historically long view of current events. The choices of 2008 will determine the political playing field from now to the middle of the 21st century. It is vital that people look beyond their resentments concerning Senator Clinton; some of these are valid, but many are absolutely irrational. But the argument here does not turn on any personal qualities Senator Clinton may have or not have. We should not focus our attention on the number worn on the player’s back, or on the color of the jersey being worn. We need to focus on the redesign of the entire playing field, since the players of today will in any case soon pass from the scene. The great task of 2008 is to prevent a catastrophic abortion of the party realignment now so clearly going on. OBAMA A PUPPET OF BRZEZINSKI If Senator Obama possessed truly exceptional qualities of leadership or morality, it would not be necessary to make this argument against him.

Most important, he is a Manchurian candidate, reminiscent in many ways of the disastrous Jimmy Carter of 1976. Jimmy Carter had been chosen and groomed for the presidency by David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski, the leaders of the Trilateral Commission. When Carter reached the White House, he turned US foreign policy over to Brzezinski. The results were the seizure of power by Ayatollah Khomeini, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the founding of Al Qaeda by the CIA as an Arab Legion to fight the Soviets in that country. Carter turned economic and financial affairs over to Paul Adolf Volcker of the Federal Reserve, who raised interest rates to 22%, thereby destroying the industrial potential of the United States, and contributing to a disastrous fall in the standard of living. Volcker, by the way, has just made a rare presidential endorsement – of Obama. Our left liberal friends are in a united front with Volcker of the Federal Reserve. The chilling image of Carter as a failed puppet president who set the stage for two decades of reaction, labor rout, and national decline should remind us that a candidate like Obama must be carefully scrutinized. The overall image consultant for Obama is none other than Zbigniew Brzezinski, now joined by his son Mark Brzezinski — a veteran of the Clinton National Security Council — plus Mika Brzezinski, who is leading the charge for Obama at MS NBC. Zbig is also Obama’s foreign policy controller. Zbigniew Brzezinski’s entire life has been dominated by his consuming, fanatical hatred for Russia. As he approaches 80 years of age, Brzezinski feels that he has one last chance to dismember the Russian Federation and to partition European Russia. This will be the great foreign policy project of a future Obama administration. It is certain that Zbigniew Brzezinski will join Napoleon and Hitler in failure, but what will become of our country? The Bush neocons have been addicted to aggressive war, but they were at least cunning enough to pick countries which had no ability to strike against the continental United States. Brzezinski lacks this cunning. He proposes to court confrontation with Russia, the one country, which maintains the capacity to incinerate the United States several times over. The Brzezinski project to be carried out under an Obama regime is a project of incalculable folly, tailored to the obsessions of a clique of old central European revanchists left over from the 1930s, not to the needs of the United States in the twenty- first century."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Why Obama is a Sure Loser – and Prelude to a Disaster 129 OBAMA WOULD PRIVATIZE SOCIAL SECURITY In the area of economics, Obama’s handlers and advisers are a group of right wing thinkers. The first is Austan Goolsbee, a 1991 member of Skull and Bones at Yale. Goolsbee is a member of the monetarist Chicago school founded by Milton Friedman; he is a free trade ideologue. Another Obama advisor in economics is Jeffrey Liebman of Harvard, who has proposed the partial privatization of the Social Security system, in addition to increasing the regressive payroll tax, while lowering and delaying Social Security benefits. This is not materially different from the proposals of George Bush in 2005. Then we have David Cutler, who thinks that high health care costs are a stimulus to the overall economy. He has proposed more financial incentives in the healthcare field, meaning that he wants to transfer more and more money into the hands of insurance companies and pharmaceutical firms. Is this the politics of hope? In every area of economics, Obama has turned out to be far to the right of former candidate John Edwards, and substantially to the right of Senator Clinton. Obama rejects the concept of universal health coverage. Obama’s economics team has rejected the idea of a freeze on home foreclosures in the current crisis. Obama’s economic stimulus package, as Paul Krugman has correctly observed, is skewed to the right. In a year marked, above all, by a rebirth of powerful economic populism in the electorate, Obama offers nothing in this crucial department. Instead, Obama offers fatuous and fuzzy platitudes of the utopian and messianic sort. He favors the appeasement of adversaries. He wants to end partisan struggle in politics. He seems to conjure up a golden age or earthly paradise. He seems to want to restore an oligarchical consensus, and give a face lift to US imperialism. It is no accident that left liberal activists who have signed on with Obama are dropping the impeachment issue like a hot potato. Impeachment is sure to be a very messy, very partisan, and very acrimonious process. It will be a short, political struggle, and struggle of any kind is simply not found in the Obama playbook. The senator is a weak and passive figure, a quietist. Many can remember the refusal of Bill Bradley to defend himself against the lies of Al Gore in 2000, or the stubborn impotence of John Kerry as he was swiftboated by the Bushies in 2004.

MICHIGAN AND FLORIDA: THE PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY DECIDED A controversy has now risen about the delegates of two critical mega-states, Michigan and Florida, at the Democratic National Convention. Once again, these are states that a Democratic candidate must win, so it would not make sense to offend voters there. However, Howard Dean, Donna Brazil, and a gaggle of elitists at the Democratic National Committee have decided that for some arcane reason, the delegates of Michigan and Florida should not be seated. Perhaps this has something to do with the fact that Senator Clinton has handily won both these big states. In Florida, she received 850,000 votes, and beat Obama going away. In Michigan, she received an absolute majority of voter support — not just a plurality. Obama’s hope of winning the Democratic nomination seems to come down to excluding Michigan and Florida in the same way that the Mississippi Freedom Democrats were excluded from the Democratic Convention in 1964. Now Howard Dean is saying that Michigan and Florida need to repeat their primaries, except now it must be in the form of caucuses. Anyone who says caucuses is saying Obama, since in caucuses small numbers of wealthy elitists and ideologues can exercise a political effect out of all proportion to their real numbers in the population. So Howard Dean is not an honest broker, but rather a partisan for Obama. Obama says he is the candidate of hope and reconciliation, but he seems quite ready to resort to some very dirty tactics to grab the Democratic presidential nomination that he can never hope to win in a fair fight. Any rational person would instead say, “Let the people decide!” And in this case, the people have already decided. More broadly, Obama’s hopes of grabbing the nomination seem to revolve around the prospect of a palace coup in a smoke-free room Howard Dean is saying that if no clear front runner emerges in the next couple of months, he will convene a pow-wow and decide the nomination in connivance with a narrow oligarchy, while flaunting the will of the Democratic primary voters.

So American voters can have no confidence in Howard Dean. DUMP OBAMA, AND A DEMOCRATIC LANDSLIDE COMES INTO VIEW The perspective for November can only be the destruction and break up of the Republican Party as we have known it for the past four decades. The Republican Party has always been an uneasy alliance of four distinct, and even antithetical groups: the social conservatives or Christian evangelicals, the foreign policy conservatives or neocon warmongers, the fiscal conservatives or Wall Street plutocrats, and the anti-state Libertarians. Because of the onset of the Bush economic depression — including dollar hyperinflation, the death agony of the US dollar as the world reserve currency, and banking panics breaking out all over the world — the available pie has shrunk to such a degree that these competing interests can no longer all be satisfied. Life boat ethics have set in. Accordingly, they are now all at each other’s throats in a hilarious spectacle of factional warfare. Romney, a hedge fund operator and asset stripper, has now dropped out — which ought to remind David Swanson that money means very little in 2008. (Obama’s millions will not buy him a single Electoral College mega-state outside of Illinois.) Huckabee is the wedge issue social conservative, but his appeal is strictly limited to the Deep South. McCain is the warmonger, and he now seems to be on his way to seizing the nomination. Ron Paul, of course, is the Libertarian, but can only appeal to a slender ideological minority since he has no elements of economic populist appeal. The traditional conservative leaders and spokespersons like Rush Limbaugh, Shawn Hannity, Ann Coulter, and James Dobson are all loudly denouncing McCain as a heretic and apostate to their strange reactionary doctrines. This indicates a party that is already severely fractured, and may be on the verge of an outright split. THE NEXT GOP: A MINOR REGIONAL PARTY OF THE DEEP SOUTH If the Obama campaign subsides, the prospect for the Democratic Party is that of a colossal historical landslide victory on the scale of 1932 or 1964. The Republican Party may well emerge as a Southern regional party, limited to the deep South states of the old Confederacy, based primarily on racism and Mexophobia, and with little or no appeal in other parts of the country. It would be, in short,"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 132 the party of Huckabee. There is every reason to believe that the Republican representation in the House and the Senate might be cut by as much as one third to one half. This would have the effect of sweeping away the alibis and excuses that have been used by the bankrupt Pelosi-Reid leadership to explain away and justify their own countless crimes and betrayals, from the failure to end the war in Iraq and Afghanistan to the failure to roll back the police state to the failure to impeach Bush and Cheney. The more the Republican Party collapses and disintegrates, the greater the potential for a split on the Democratic side between the reactionary neocon minority and the antiwar progressive majority. Any Democratic president will have to choose, and, if not a puppet, will likely choose the majority. This is the great promise of 2008. Obama’s rhetoric seems to assume that the Republican Party will be around indefinitely in its present form, and therefore a compromise with them will be unavoidable. The party realignment now taking place suggests that a more effective strategy will be to aim at a radical reduction in Republican power on the basis of aggressive economic populism, making preventive concessions to the GOP needless and counterproductive. The main threat to such an historic Democratic Party victory is the Obama candidacy itself. THE GOP: A BORDERLINE PSYCHOTIC AND A FOREIGN AGENT The Republican ticket right now looks like McCain and Lieberman. McCain is a borderline psychotic. Republican Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi says, “The thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine.” McCain is known to be subject to transports of rage, which allow him to be cleverly manipulated by his unscrupulous handlers. Lieberman is one of the foremost warmongers in the Senate, and may well be a foreign agent. If this ticket were to take the White House, war with Iran would be guaranteed within six months. But because of McCain’s immigration policies, he might be able to appeal to Latino voters and other recent immigrants – provided of course that the Democratic nominee were Obama. A final consideration is the danger of a puppet president. After the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945, the financier oligarchy in Wall Street swore that they would never again permit an American president to actually exercise the powers prescribed by the Constitution. They did this because they saw a strong president as a lethal threat to the oligarchical system, which they intended to perpetuate. Accordingly, since 1945 we have had a parade of puppet"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Why Obama is a Sure Loser – and Prelude to a Disaster 133 presidents who have tended to carry out the orders of the Wall Street group. Whenever a new presidential candidate comes on the scene, especially when they are relatively unknown, the first question we must ask ourselves regards whether or not they would function as puppets in some future White House. This is a critical question, because only a president who is not a puppet will be able to respond to the will of the people as expressed through the political process overall. OF PUPPETS AND PRESIDENTS With a McCain/Lieberman ticket, the judgment on puppet status is clear – a psychotic and a reputed foreign agent add up to guaranteed puppets. Obama also flunks this crucial test. Obama would be nobody without the investiture, financing, networking, media support, and other forms of assistance provided by Zbigniew Brzezinski, the Trilateral Commission, Skull and Bones, and other members of the financier elite. He is a candidate who has been literally manufactured out of nothing in a very few years, through a carefully planned media campaign culminating in the hysterical media swoon of the past several months. Even so, he has proven unable to carry a single Electoral College mega-state outside of his own home base in Illinois. But it is certain that Obama’s potential for escaping puppet status is very, very low. Obama is also afflicted with certain egregious scandals, which the media have so far covered up. First, Obama is closely linked to a slum lord and organized crime figure named Tony Rezko, who was jailed at the end of January, just before Super Tuesday. This explosive information has been totally covered up by the controlled media. Secondly, there are the Larry Sinclair allegations, contained in a U- tube video widely viewed online, and involving a cocaine orgy. Finally, some enterprising investigative journalist might make the connection between Zbigniew Brzezinski, the center of the entire Obama campaign, and Ilyas Achmadov, the current Washington ambassador for the Chechen terrorist organization. This ambassador of terrorism is currently living in the United States, at taxpayers’ expense, thanks to the lobbying of Zbigniew Brzezinski. The Clintons may not use this material against Obama, but we can be sure that Karl Rove will not hesitate. Here we have the making of a swiftboating campaign far beyond anything seen in 2004. Even if the Rezko and Larry Sinclair allegations are not brought up, they can be used to blackmail Obama and keep him obedient in the status of a puppet."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 134 As for the Clintons, they are a known quantity, for good and for ill. They have a well-established personal and historical identity. Bill was a protege of Pamela Churchill Harriman and her PAM-PAC, but she is gone now, and the Clintons cannot be said to owe their entire existence to any one person or faction in today’s world, in the way that Obama may be fairly said to owe his entire existence to his Brzezinski-Goulsbee Trilateral/Skull and Bones handlers and backers. The Clintons were treated very roughly by the financier elite during impeachment ten years ago, and they fought back. They are getting a very rough treatment from the bankers and their controlled media outlets right now, and they are fighting back. They are also getting betrayed by an array of rotten elitist politicians like Ted Kennedy and John Kerry who owed the Clintons a great deal, and are now stabbing them in the back. The Clintons are not the beneficiaries of a CIA people power coup or flower revolution. It seems clear that Billary as a combat team are on the whole less likely to follow orders from the banking establishment than the Manchurian candidate Obama, who has no record, stands for nothing, and seems to have no loyalties to anything. This may not be much, but it is at least something, in the present terrible situation. In short, our left liberal friends are demanding that we support a hand-picked Wall Street Manchurian candidate for another puppet presidency à la Carter, a man who probably cannot win the White House, whose economic profile is far to the right of his opponent, and who would probably provoke war with Russia if he ever did get elected. They are doing this to spite the obvious fact that the controlled corporate media are signaling every day that Obama is the preferred alternative of the financier elite and the banking establishment. And, although they may not know it, they are supporting the only Democrat left standing whose ineptitude, incompetence, and narrow appeal will almost certainly cause the ongoing party realignment to miscarry, generating catastrophic consequences that will be felt for decades. Obama is manifestly the wrong choice. Under most circumstances, is doomed to lose. If he wins, our likely reward will be that Zbigniew Brzezinski will get the chance to live out his twilight of the gods in all-out thermonuclear confrontation with Russia. All in all, this is the worst of all possible alternatives. As usual, our left liberal friends are out of sync with the American people, and out of sync with the imperatives of world history."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Barack Obama Fronts Wall Street’s Infrastructure Swindle: What “Change” Really Means. By Bruce Marshall Do not be fooled! Barack Obama’s call for National Infrastructure Reinvestment Bank (NIRB) does not signal the return of the Democratic Party to the values of FDR and a revival of the Constitutional prerogative to ‘promote the general welfare,’ but would rather provide more welfare for Wall Street and worse. Obama’s plan is nothing more than the direct means of instituting the Rohatyn-Rudman National Investment Corporation (NIC) plan called for in 2005, which in essence is a revival of Mussolini’s methods of corporatist control of the state in a politically correct post modern fashion. When Senator Obama states that his National Investment Reinvestment Bank (NIRB) will magically turn $60 billion into trillions of dollars as he did in his Feb 13th Jamesville, WI speech, one can easily realize that the only way that this can happen is through the perverse magic of Wall Street. What would happen is that bonds floated by the NIRB will be bought on the open market, to then be speculated upon, securitized as derivatives, traded and ultimately used as collateral on the newly built infrastructure. What we will see is the emergence of an infrastructure bubble to replace the mortgage bubble, propped up by initial government expenditures towards infrastructure. This is just the start as Obama will fund the feel good ‘carbon credit’ swap to be the next blast of hot air to make Wall Street giddy. This is a key insight to a true understanding of what is going on. Bailout the financial powers with a clever plan that will raise money to then buy up hard assets, in other words the remaining wealth of our nation, as the meltdown crisis of over a quadrillion in derivatives losses grows and grows. Besides artificially propping up the markets, Obama’s NIRB, as an initiation of the Rohatyn-Rudman infrastructure investment model, opens the door to the privatization of public assets.

Then they run the turnpikes into the ground as cash cows while they mercilessly bilk the users. Privatization is a key goal of the Anglo- American financiers behind this scheme. Both the NIC and NIRB rely on the new darling of the markets, PPPs, known as public private partnerships. PPPs are the means by which market forces will dictate, and that is the word, the implementation of these projects. The argument is that the PPP will keep costs down, but in reality only because the private corporations, now controlling the public sector, will own the assets of what is being constructed. The PPP model is none other than the model implemented by Mussolini in his fascist corporate state. The creation of NIRB funds hark back to Hjalmar Schact’s ‘MEFO’ bills that created the speculative bubble of money so that the National Socialists could rearm Germany and fight World War II. Since 9/11 America has certainly turned into a top-down police state, but true post-modern fascism requires a popular movement to usher it into power.

Goolsbee stated on CNBC that Obama is more market friendly – more in the pocket of Wall Street. This is precisely the establishment’s secret fear of Hillary Clinton that she might act as her heroine Eleanor Roosevelt, to implement a post modern New Deal that would oppose austerity measures against programs that help the poor. That she would fund essential public services, like hospitals and schools, and provide universal health care available to all. The greatest fear is that she might act like FDR to now start regulating the markets starting with a 1% Tobin tax which could eliminate the income tax burden for everyone earning less than $125,000 year with plenty of money to fund the basic social programs of a civilized and truly decent society. Now Obama, with economic advisers such as David Cutler, who believes that rising health care prices are good for the economy, and Jeffrey Liebman, who wants to partially privatize social security, you see that Obama’s MBAs will be quite good at implementing the vision of the Democratic godfather Felix Rohatyn (ex-Lazard Freres) and Republican Warren Rudman, an proponent of savage austerity and the wrecking of entitlements. Their obsession with balanced budgets, privatization, and asset stripping will be given new cover as the United States is dissolved into one great corporatist PPP. Yes, we do need infrastructure, but the reason we have an infrastructure crisis is because people like Rudman and Rohatyn have influenced thinking against infrastructure projects because it would get in the way of their balanced budget mania and plans to loot the economy. Now they have a new solution and salesman. Watch out! Remember it was Rudman who was a key figure in the conservative revolution around Gingrich. The nefarious interest of Rohatyn is even more sinister considering that this is the fellow who was part of the international team supporting fascist dictator Augusto Pinochet, where Rohatyn’s social security privatization scheme was first tried. Soon a limited revised version of social security privatization will be introduced by Obama when an alarm is pulled by Wall Street during an Obama Presidency. In the 1970’s Rohatyn became the actual dictator of New York City under Big Mac (the 1975 Municipal Assistance Corporation), trumping the city"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 138 government, as a financial czar who cared more about the city’s bond rating than lives, cutting essential services, including many inner-city hospitals in a mad example of a PPP.

No wonder the Democrats have not stopped the war; it is good for their business arrangements too. While Senator Obama says that he will stop the war and use that money to initially finance the NIRB and his green initiatives, this will do nothing to stop the speculative forces that are causing the present hyperinflationary bubble. Will Obama stand up to the speculators whose gambling is responsible for up to 40% of the price of every gallon of gasoline? Not likely. Sure the NIRB will create some low-wage jobs, but the PPP arrangement will make certain that organized labor does not get assertive about living wages and benefits, all the while private companies welcome a work force of illegal immigrants who will do much of the work for virtual slave wages as is already the case. So what is to be done? First we need a real debate towards electing a President and Congress who will confront the crisis, the real issues surrounding the present meltdown of the derivatives bubble and what that means for the entire economy. The sub-prime mortgage collapse is the tip of the iceberg.

Tarpley Washington DC, Feb. 18 — The recent discovery by various functionaries of the Clinton campaign that Obama habitually lifts entire passages from the speeches of Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick points far beyond the issue of alleged plagiarism and gets us close to the central issue about Obama: the Illinois Senator is a synthetic Manchurian candidate who has been concocted over a period of two decades or more by a political intelligence faction associated with the Zbigniew Brzezinski clan, and Zbig’s friends of the “color revolutions” faction at the National Endowment for Democracy and the Soros milieu. The striking fact revealed by the discovery that Obama and Patrick parrot the same type of utopian and messianic platitudes is not just that these two mellifluous demagogues habitually swap chunks of their speeches. It is rather that both of them are the product of the same process of programming, training, and indoctrination – one might well say brainwashing – on the part of the Brzezinski faction. They are both from the same stable, so to speak. The reason that there are two of them is that each is a backup for the other within the framework of the same overall intelligence community project, which is to bring the techniques of postmodern coup, otherwise known as the CIA color revolution or people power putsch, into this country in order to seize power in a postmodern coup d’état. Both Obama and Patrick can be viewed as the dummies through which the ventriloquist Brzezinski speaks. They are both clones of a mother ship which the public, for the moment at least, does not see. The mother ship is the Trilateral Commission. It is of course ironic that Obama, the professional word-monger, deals in words he has filched elsewhere. With no achievements, no record, no commitments, no promises, no loyalties, and no track record, Obama’s stock in trade is oratory. How revealing that his only capability, his words, have been purloined. Here is an example, widely quoted on the Internet, of parallel passages spouted by Obama and by Patrick:"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 140 Obama : “Don’t tell me words don’t matter. ‘I have a dream’ – just words? ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal’ – just words? ‘We have nothing to fear but fear itself’ – just words? Just speeches?” Patrick : “‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal’ – just words? ‘We have nothing to fear but fear itself’ – just words? ‘Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.’ Just words? ‘I have a dream’ – just words?” The passages are interesting since they amount to a pre-packaged defense against the most obvious objection to the two politicians in question: they are short on concrete policy proposals, and long on vapid rhetoric. Since it would appear that Patrick made his remarks first, there is little doubt that Obama is indeed a mimic of Patrick. This discovery, however, is not new. Over the past year, the New York Times Magazine , the Boston Globe , and the Boston Phoenix have all published articles pointing to the fact that the babblings of these two politicians are astonishingly similar, to the point of being practically identical. What these passages reveal is that both Obama and Patrick are indeed Manchurian candidates, and that both are reciting from the same intelligence community print out. They have memorized their lines from the same prompter. They have been programmer by the same software people. This points to the fact that both of these candidates come out of a laboratory, the same laboratory, and not out of any normal political process is the average person would understand that. Their rhetorical style and repertoire of themes are coherent with the same covert operation, in which they are both cogs. As far as can be seen at this time, the roots of the Obama candidacy go back to a project begun by Zbigniew Brzezinski and his National Security Council subordinate, Professor Samuel Huntington of Harvard, in the early 1980s. This was the immediate aftermath of the catastrophic Carter administration, which Zbigniew Brzezinski had helped to wreck with the help of his fellow Trilateral Commission member Paul Adolph Volcker, whom Carter had appointed as head of the Federal Reserve System. For Brzezinski and the Trilateralists, the Carter administration had been a great success, one destined to be repeated. The Soviets had been enticed to enter Afghanistan, where they were destined to undergo a humiliating defeat in a long and genocidal war. The Shah of Iran had been ousted and replaced with Khomeini, thus wrecking the Iranian economy and permitting a"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Governor Deval Patrick: Brzezinski’s Spare Obama 141 second phony oil crisis. In Carter’s State of the Union address for 1980, he had promulgated the so-called Carter Doctrine, namely that the United States would maintain supremacy in the Persian Gulf against all comers. This became the framework for the first Gulf War and the current Iraq war, not to mention possible future attacks on Iran. The entire US economy was well on the road to de-regulation, and the de-industrialization of this country had been largely carried out. Carter had also left the office of the presidency far weaker and far more hated than it was when he found it. TRILATERALS PLANNED SINCE 1981 TO WRECK US UPSURGE OF 2010-2030 At this point, Brzezinski, Huntington and their Trilateral associates were already looking ahead towards the prospect of a mass political upsurge which they expected to emerge sometime between 2010 and 2030 – in our own time today. They were already busily scheming to find ways to use this next political upsurge to further their favorite cause, that of totalitarian government in the United States. Huntington wrote in his American Politics: The Promise of Disharmony (1981): “If the periodicity of the past prevails, a major sustained creedal passion period will occur in the second and third decades of the twenty-first century. ...the oscillations among the responses could intensify in such a way as to threaten to destroy both ideals and institutions. Yet the continued presence of deeply felt moralistic sentiments among major groups in American society could continue to ensure weak and divided government, devoid of authority and unable to deal satisfactorily with the economic, social and foreign challenges confronting the nation. Intensification of this conflict between history and progress could give rise to increasing frustration and increasingly violent oscillations between moralism and cynicism. This situation could lead to a two-phase dialectic involving intensified efforts to reform government, followed by intensified frustration when those efforts produce not progress in a liberal-democratic direction, but obstacles to meeting perceived functional needs. The weakening of government in an effort to reform it could lead eventually to strong demands for the replacement of the weakened and ineffective institutions by more authoritarian structures more effectively designed to meet historical needs. Given the perversity of reform, moralistic extremism in the"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 142 pursuit of liberal democracy could generate a strong tide toward authoritarian efficiency.” (p. 232) Huntington, like his model Carl Schmitt, has always been looking for ways to institute a dictatorship. Obama is a means to that end. It is evident that during these years, Brzezinski, Huntington, and company began the process of recruiting and indoctrinating promising young people who could, after a suitable process of training and indoctrination, be turned into political operatives to be deployed decades later, in the midst of a crisis which Brzezinski and Huntington were able to foresee, to ensure an outcome agreeable to the ruling finance oligarchy. There is every reason to think that Obama and Patrick are two examples of the assortment of candidates and political operatives which the Trilateralists began assembling at that time. This is the deeper reason why Obama and Patrick spout the identical platitudes of utopian reform, the abolition of partisan strife, and the healing of our “broken souls” by the touch of a false messiah. JIMMY CARTER AS TRILATERAL COMMISSION CLONE This process was nothing new for Brzezinski and Huntington. Around the time of the Watergate crisis and the ouster of Nixon, they had begun planning to field a Manchurian candidate who would carry the program of the Trilateral Commission into the 1976 election campaign. After the disgrace of Nixon, it was evident that a Democrat would be needed. In addition, the Trilateralists wanted an outsider, untainted by the Watergate scandal of the corruption of Washington. They decided to select a southern governor with vague populist overtones. As Brzezinski boasts in his memoir Power and Principle , Carter was selected because he was more interested in international affairs. But at the same time, the immense investment in money, time, and work in assembling a political machine, developing position papers, purchasing and corrupting journalists and television personalities, preparing vote fraud options in battleground states like New York and Ohio, etc., etc., was much too great to let it depend on one person alone. What if Carter had another nervous breakdown? What if he got hit by a car? What if he were indicted? For these weighty but obvious reasons, the Trilateral planners decided that they would need a spare candidate, to be held in reserve and to be deployed in case their primary choice proved unviable or unworkable. As Brzezinski also points out, the spare Carter was Governor Reuben Askew of the state of Florida, who also had presidential ambitions."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Governor Deval Patrick: Brzezinski’s Spare Obama 143 But without the financial backing of David Rockefeller and the rest of the Trilateral machine, Askew’s ambitions were destined to remain a dead letter. But the point is that there was a spare candidate always available to be rushed into the breach. OBAMA’S LOST YEARS AT COLUMBIA, 1981-1983 There are indications that Obama was recruited by Brzezinski or his immediate circles in 1981-1983, when Obama was a student at Columbia University in New York City. The main problem that arises in investigating this issue is the obsessive secrecy on the part of Obama concerning this phase of his life. As New York Times reporter Janny Scott wrote last year: Barack Obama does not say much about his years in New York City. The time he spent as an undergraduate at Columbia College and then working in Manhattan in the early 1980s surfaces only fleetingly in his memoir. In the book, he casts himself as a solitary wanderer in the metropolis, the outsider searching for a way to “make myself of some use.” He barely mentions Columbia, training ground for the elite, where he transferred in his junior year, majoring in political science and international relations and writing his thesis on Soviet nuclear disarmament. He dismisses in one sentence his first community organizing job — work he went on to do in Chicago — though a former supervisor remembers him as “a star performer.” Yet he declined repeated requests to talk about his New York years, release his Columbia transcript or identify even a single fellow student, co-worker, roommate or friend from those years. “He doesn’t remember the names of a lot of people in his life,” said Ben LaBolt, a campaign spokesman. Mr. Obama has, of course, done plenty of remembering. His 1995 memoir, “Dreams from My Father,” weighs in at more than 450 pages. But he also exercised his writer’s prerogative to decide what to include or leave out. Now, as he presents himself to voters, a look at his years in New York — other people’s accounts and his own — suggest not only what he was like back then but how he chooses to be seen now. In a long profile of Mr. Obama in a Columbia alumni magazine in 2005, in which his Columbia years occupied just two paragraphs, he called that time “an intense period of study.”"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 144 “I spent a lot of time in the library. I didn’t socialize that much. I was like a monk,” he was quoted as saying.” “Obama’s Account of New York Years Often Differs from What Others Say,” New York Times , October 30, 2007. OBAMA’S OBSESSIVE SECRECY ABOUT HIS COLUMBIA YEARS What is Obama hiding about his years at Columbia? Why the obsessive secrecy? It is likely that this is the decisive moment of his life, when he comes under the guidance of his protector and patron, Zbigniew. “Soviet nuclear disarmament” is a thesis title that has Zbigniew Brzezinski written all over it. Zbig was at this time the head of the Institute on Communist Affairs, where he was located from 1960 to 1989, apart from his time in the Carter White House. There is therefore a strong prima facie circumstantial case that Obama entered Brzezinski’s orbit between 1982 and 1983 at Columbia. (Persons who knew Obama at Columbia during those years are urged to contact the author if they have information bearing on thiese questions.) Today, the fact that Obama’s and Patrick’s utopian verbiage is basically identical points to the fact that an arrangement similar to the Carter-Askew one is in effect. This is not the place to illustrate the parallel lives of these two subjects. We can only mention the fact that they both come from relatively humble circumstances, both grew up – as did Bill Clinton – as fatherless African-American boys, both were selected to attend upscale prep schools, and both attended law schools. They are profiles of remarkably similar, to the point of being almost congruent. Everything points, in short, to the fact that they are both products whipped up by the same intelligence community operation. They have both been synthesized, groomed, indoctrinated, and programmed with the same demagogic political operation in view. As individuals, they may or may not be aware of all that has been done with and to them. For their part, voters have every right to be disturbed by the robot-like similarities of the sounds coming out of the mouths of these two operatives. They are both playing back the same tape. As time goes on, it should prove possible to reconstruct in much detail the specific sessions, drills, and other procedures which have been used to inculcate the ability to speak in this strange and singular manner. But even now, the lesson for voters ought to be clear: it would be very unwise to put the Manchurian puppet candidate Obama, the creature of Zbigniew Brzezinski and his gang, into the White House."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Brzezinski Seizing Control Over US Policy in Slow-Motion Creeping Coup By Webster G. Tarpley Washington DC, Feb. 23 — Events of the past few days indicate that the Zbigniew Brzezinski faction of lunatic Russia haters have now won the upper hand inside the secret councils of the Anglo- American finance oligarchy, displacing the hitherto dominant George Shultz-neocon faction. Although George Bush and his cronies still occupy the White House, the policies that are being carried out are coming from the Brzezinski left CIA machine. Brzezinski has returned to public prominence in recent months due to his role as top establishment controller for the Obama campaign. But Brzezinski is not waiting for the outcome of the November elections to take over key parts of the US government. Brzezinski and his left CIA allies are already moving to assert their strategy, even as the neocons and their characteristic obsessions are moved to the back burner. The probability of an attack on Iran or Syria is declining, even as the danger of confrontation with Russia, China, and Pakistan – all much more dangerous targets to trifle with – increases exponentially. 1. KOSOVO : The independence of Kosovo has opened a new crisis front in Eastern Europe, with the potential for very nasty complications in regard to Russia. This is the essence of the Brzezinski anti-Russian policy. Kosovo independence is of course a flagrant violation of all existing norms of international law, most notably the Helsinki CSCE treaty of 1975 which finally put an end to World War II by declaring that all borders in Europe were to be considered final unless and until any changes had been agreed through mutual consultation of the interested parties. Since the Serbian government in Belgrade is vehemently opposed to Kosovo independence, the unilateral actions of the US, British, and NATO are the very essence of international anarchy. The new regime in Kosovo goes far beyond the usual kleptocracy of NATO puppets favored by Brzezinski and his circles. The new regime in Kosovo is essentially the terrorist KLA, an organization devoted to gun-running, drug- running, and trafficking in human slaves. The KLA is a Balkan"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 14 6 version of Al Qaeda, and both are wholly owned creations of the CIA and British intelligence. With Kosovo independence, the US, British, and NATO stand ready to use armed force to defend the right of a terrorist gang to assert sovereignty over a segment of modern Europe. The criminal obscenity of this policy could hardly be greater, but for Brzezinski all methods are legitimate provided that they increase tension with Moscow, and in that respect Kosovo independence is already a glowing success. 2. US EMBASSY BELGRADE : The attack on the US embassy in Belgrade, Serbia by gangs of drunken students is a classic Brzezinski operation. The tactic of having an incensed rent-a-mob of swarming adolescent patsies attack the US Embassy in order to gin up a crisis is one of Zbigniew’s signature specialties. During the time that Brzezinski was running the foreign policy of Trilateral puppet Jimmy Carter, there were bloody attacks on the US embassies in Pakistan and in Afghanistan, both countries that featured prominently in Brzezinski’s arc of crisis theory. Most famous of all was of course the attack on the US embassy in Teheran, Iran, which led to the taking of hostages and the huge international crisis which helped to doom the Carter administration to extinction at the polls. If US diplomats or State Department personnel are taken hostage anywhere in the world in the weeks and months to come, this must be attributed to Brzezinski. 3. SPACE WARFARE : The shooting down by the Pentagon of a US satellite over the Pacific is a very provocative military stunt designed to intimidate both Moscow and Beijing, who happen to be Brzezinski’s immediate targets. This reckless and irresponsible action has raised the specter of an uncontrolled arms race reaching into outer space. 4. SYRIA : Zbigniew Brzezinski himself, fresh from addressing a retreat of House Democrats in Williamsburg Virginia, is now in Syria at the head of a RAND Corporation delegation. The purpose of this mission should not be construed as peace in the Middle East, although some naive observers may read it in that way. Brzezinski’s goal is immediately to lessen Russian influence in Syria, including the closing of certain naval facilities that the Russian navy has maintained in that country. In the longer run, Brzezinski would like to turn both Syria and Iran into components of the ring he means to forge around Russia for the purpose of the strategic encirclement of that rival superpower. Zbigniew’s argument against the neocons is,"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Brzezinski Seizing Control Over Policy in Creeping Coup 14 7 why attack Iran and Syria, when you can turn them into kamikaze stooges, play them against Russia, and get rid of all of them that way? Europe and China are destined to play similar anti-Russian roles in Brzezinski’s playbook. 5. BUSH IN AFRICA : President Bush may not know what he is doing on his current visit to five African countries, but Zbigniew Brzezinski knows exactly what the mission is. The Brzezinski policy is to foment destabilization and chaos in Africa under the auspices of the new United States African command (US-AFRICOM), all for the purpose of driving the Chinese out of Africa. As Zbigniew announced on November 30, 2007 in the Washington Post, he intends to cut off Chinese access to oil, other energy sources, and strategic raw materials on the African continent. Since the Anglo-Americans control the Persian Gulf by direct military occupation, this is tantamount to a policy of driving the Chinese in on Eastern Siberia. Brzezinski believes that if the Chinese cannot get their oil from Africa, they will be forced to attempt the military seizure of Russia’s oil wells in the Far East, where there is much oil and very few Russians. Both Moscow and Beijing know exactly what Brzezinski is doing in this regard. This is the kind of harebrained scheming by Lord Astor, Lady Astor and Sir Neville Chamberlain which helped to bring about World War II. The idea then was to play Hitler against Stalin and get rid of both of them that way. When that blew up in the faces of the British, the result was World War II. This time, it may well be thermonuclear World War III. 6. CIA UNILATERAL KILLINGS IN PAKISTAN : Back in July 2007, Obama attracted much unfavorable attention when he announced his plan to bomb targets inside Pakistan without reference to the government of that country. He was vigorously criticized by Bush, McCain, and Mrs. Clinton. Obama turned out to be a bigger warmonger than Bush himself, since the tenant of the White House said that it was absolutely essential to work with the government of Pakistan against terrorism, and not humiliate them unnecessarily. Now it turns out that Obama’s puppet master Zbigniew Brzezinski is more powerful than Bush on this issue. The Washington Post of Tuesday, February 19 revealed that a CIA Predator drone aircraft had attacked the Pakistani town of Mir Ali, killing a certain Abu Laith al- Libi, supposedly a leading figure of the al Qaeda patsy organization. The big news was that this time around, the CIA had not sought approval from the government of Pakistan.

Thus, the aggressive policy put into Obama’s mouth by Zbigniew Brzezinski has become operational US policy, regardless of what the lame-duck Bush had to say about this issue last summer. Pakistan is now being targeted because of President Musharraf’s strategic understanding with China. Brzezinski intends to strip the Chinese of all their traditional allies as part of his campaign to smash the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and any other foci of resistance inside Eurasia against Anglo-American imperialism. 7. FALL OF ITALIAN GOVERNMENT : The European government most friendly to Russia and most reluctant to follow Brzezinski’s lead into confrontation was the Italian regime of Romano Prodi. Italy had launched a program of large-scale economic cooperation with Moscow, much of it mediated through the Italian oil company ENI, a perennial outsider and rival of the Anglo-American cartel. Underpinning the cooperation between Italy and Russia was a far-reaching rapprochement between the Vatican and the Russian Orthodox Church aiming at forms of ecumenical dialogue with obvious overtones of political and economic cooperation. This dialogue between the Roman Pope and the Russian Orthodox Patriarch is something Brzezinski abhors. A few weeks ago, Prodi was overthrown through the actions of a Quisling political faction centered on the Bank of Italy. The other European governments, most notably Mrs. Merkel in Germany, and Sarkozy in France, are currently in the pocket of the Anglo-Americans. The British regime of Gordon Brown has of course taken the lead in fomenting confrontation with Russia through such transparent provocations as the Litvinenko-Berezovsky affair and the recent flap about UK subversive activities in Russia conduited through the British Council, supposedly a cultural exchange organization, but in reality a very aggressive arm of MI-6, which is now being expelled from Russia. The policy being imposed by Brzezinski is by its origins a London policy. POLICE STATE MOVES TO ELIMINATE OBAMA’S COMPETITION The campaign of scandal revelations against Senator John McCain in the New York Times suggest that the banking establishment is determined to remove all obstacles that might impede the March of Brzezinski’s puppet Obama to the White House. In addition, Arizona"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Brzezinski Seizing Control Over Policy in Creeping Coup 149 Republican Congressman Rick Renzi, a McCain ally, has just been indicted on charges of extortion, wire fraud and money laundering in an alleged scheme to profit from a land deal. Renzi is an honorary co- chairman of McCain’s presidential campaign. At the same time, the controled corporate media continue to cover up the explosive revelations of Larry Sinclair, which have now been covered on numerous web sites and in the supermarket tabloid, The Globe . Since Karl Rove already knows all about these scandals, Democratic primary voters need to know about them too – otherwise they risk choosing a candidate so thoroughly compromised as to be unelectable. Obama is an intrinsically weak candidate, who might well be defeated even by McCain in a normal election, especially given the overwhelming suspicion about Obama among Latino, Asian, and Catholic voters. The motivation of the New York Times smear campaign against McCain by his former admirers and backers is to eliminate any serious contenders who might hinder the new Messiah between now and November. This is not the first time that the intelligence community-police state apparatus has had to intervene decisively to provide assistance to the faltering ambitions of their puppet, Obama. During his quest for a seat in the United States Senate from Illinois in 2004, Obama received a scandal boost not once but twice. Obama’s opponent in the Illinois Democratic senatorial primary of March 2004 was Marson Blair Hull, a wealthy securities broker who spent $28 million on television advertising and was heavily favored to defeat Obama in that primary. But Hull’s campaign was torpedoed by a barrage of well timed media charges that he had abused his former wife. Hull was therefore obliged to drop out of the race. After Hull had been eliminated, Obama still had to face his Republican opponent in the November general election. Here his adversary was Jack Ryan, an investment banker from Goldman Sachs. Ryan had divorced his wife Jeri in 1999, and the case was sealed at their mutual request. Suddenly the Chicago Tribune and WLS television began undertaking mighty exertions to get these divorce records made public, even though they involved a dispute about child custody. On June 22, 2004, Los Angeles Superior Court judge Robert Schneider released the court documents in question. They revealed an accusation by Jeri Ryan against her husband, now Obama’s political competitor, to the effect that Jack Ryan had induced her to frequent"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 150 sex clubs in a number of locations, and had attempted to coerce her into sexual intercourse in the presence of third parties. Judge Schnider’s decision was all the more extraordinary because it was made in the face of the direct opposition by both parties to the divorce, and bore on a Family Court matter that is normally kept vigorously secret. It was as if some totalitarian invisible hand were intervening in favor of the beleaguered Obama candidacy. At this point Jack Ryan was compelled to abandon his candidacy at the urging of Dennis Hastert, then Speaker of the House. By now the Illinois Republican Party appeared to have gotten the message that Obama enjoyed divine protection, since they did not nominate a serious candidate to oppose him in the November election. Instead, they brought in a carpetbagger and well known windbag in the person of Allan Keyes of Maryland, who predictably went on to lose to Obama by the most lopsided margin in Illinois political history. This process also recalls the 1988 elimination of top Democratic contender Gary Hart through a sex scandal. Hart’s prospective opponent was Bush the Elder, another intrinsically weak candidate favored by the CIA who needed police state assistance top make it to the White House. Gary Hart was knocked out of contention by a scandal involving Donna Rice, with whom Hart had been embroiled with the help of underworld figure Don Aronow, an ally of the Bush family. With US missiles about to be installed in Poland under the direct supervision of Ian Brzezinski, the Pentagon’s top man for Eastern Europe, the world is demonstrably moving towards a US – Russian superpower confrontation with unmistakable thermonuclear overtones. The one missing ingredient in this pattern is a suitable demagogue in the White House who can make an appeal for national mobilization in this crisis, including quite possibly a restoration of the military draft, and a dimension of economic sacrifice and tax increases which Bush never proposed. This is the role of Zbigniew Brzezinski’s puppet and Manchurian candidate, Obama. The anointed one can still be prevented from carrying out the Brzezinski-Soros plan to seize the Democratic presidential nomination through the domestic equivalent of a color revolution or people power coup. The dynasty we need to worry about at this point is neither the Clintons nor the Bushes. The main concern today is an extension of the Brzezinski dynasty.

Tarpley Washington DC, March 11 — The media-fueled hysteria around the presidential candidacy of Barack Obama received a decisive setback this past week at the hands of ordinary American voters in Ohio, Texas, and Rhode Island. The forces of the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, the RAND Corporation, Skull and Bones, and the Friedmanite Chicago school, who control the Obama campaign, had fervently hoped to parlay Obama’s successes in Republican and marginal states during the harrowing month of February into an acclamation of their Manchurian candidate as the pre-emptive Democratic nominee in the primaries of March 4. Obama’s failure to wrap up the nomination now opens the perspective of prolonged political warfare, in which intensified scrutiny of Obama’s personal history and campaign organization is likely to lead to a total or partial collapse of his synthetic candidacy. It may not yet be the beginning of the end for Obama, but it is the end of the beginning. Obama’s strategy has depended from the beginning on creating an irresistible tidal wave of hysteria, adulation, media swoon, and sense of messianic inevitability so as to stampede Democratic voters and the American people in general into capitulating to his cynical power grab. He has not been running for president, he has been running for Savior. His campaign does not offer political reforms, but rather the prospect of a golden age in which the lion shall lie down with the lamb. He does not ask to serve as president, he demands transfiguration. This approach clearly depends on the orchestration of a controlled environment through the media, the Internet, the press, and other avenues for the manipulation of public opinion. Everything depends on creating an aura of seraphic superiority, as the anointed candidate floats to power above the grimy mundane world of real"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Elitist Obama Hysteria Broken by Votes of Working People 153 political conflicts and real political and economic interests. Depending as it does an extraordinary gullibility, suggestibility, and manipulability on the part of the voters, this kind of strategy is exceedingly vulnerable to countermeasures tending to break the controlled environment, pollute the fantasy with reality, and force utopian dream time to yield to the world as it actually exists. THE PRO-OBAMA CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT NOW SHATTERED Time is therefore the most critical variable in the Obama strategy. Everything depends on wrapping up the nomination before the controlled environment of seraphic superiority, post-partisan purity, transracial transcendence, and nonpartisan sainthood is punctured and broken by growing awareness of the actual thuggery, duplicity and dirty politics practiced by the Obama campaign, and of the numerous scandals swirling around the candidate. All indications now suggest that the first week in March constituted the watershed between the time of Obama the beatific perfect Master and the current era of Obama the discredited, desperate demagogue slogging through the mud, the blood, and the sand of a real political campaign. Since so much of Obama’s image has depended on completely artificial and unsustainable hype, that it is now quite possible that he could collapse in a relatively short period of time like so many other ephemeral crazes. Obama may become a political Sanjaya, flashing like a meteor across the heavens and then flaming out into total obscurity and oblivion, and leaving his followers wandering what in the world his candidacy was all about. Obama also started with a strategy for gaming the absurd and obsolete McGovern rules of the Democratic Party in order to carry out a people power coup or color revolution here in the United States, using the playbook of similar operations carried out by the Brzezinski faction, the left wing of the CIA, the National Endowment for Democracy, and the Soros foundations in such places as Serbia, Georgia, and Ukraine. These methods involve the use of an attractive and charismatic demagogue, fake polling, rent-a-mobs and dupe-a- mobs of swarming adolescents, catchy slogans, colors, and symbols, media whores, abundant cash from wealthy financiers, narcotics, Nuremberg rallies, balcony speeches, and related stratagems to orchestrate a coup d’état, often under the cover of elections.

UKRAINE ON BRINK OF CIVIL WAR AFTER ORANGE REVOLUTION IN KIEV, 2004 It is important to note that the Brzezinski-Soros Kiev-centered Orange Revolution in Ukraine in late 2004 brought that country to the verge of civil war as the pro-Russian eastern Ukraine balked at accepting the new regime of NATO puppets and kleptocrats, and threatened secession. The possible beginnings of something similar can already be observed here in the United States. Ironically, although Obama has pontificated ad nauseam about his ability to bring the country together, the concrete observed result of his postmodern multicultural candidacy has been to split the Democratic electorate six ways to Sunday: whites against blacks against Hispanics, men against women, rich against poor, and, with his notorious Joshua speech and youth cult operations, old against young. This gives some idea of how a possible future Obama administration would shatter the United States into a multiplicity of violently contending fragments. Could civil war ensure? No one could rule it out at the present stage. OBAMA’S TWO MISSED CHANCES FOR A COUP The preferred strategy for Obama’s handlers would have been to administer stunning defeats to Senator Clinton in both Iowa and in New Hampshire, forcing her and any other Democratic contenders to drop out of the race, thereby bringing the primary process of the Democratic Party to an early, abortive and apolitical conclusion - thus avoiding the politicization and political education of a whole series of states through a prolonged primar y campaign. Obama succeeded in winning the Iowa caucuses, thanks to the disproportionate weight of affluent suburbanites, academics, and Malthusian ideologues in the rarefied and ultra-left atmosphere of Democratic caucuses. After this defeat, the Clinton campaign was left reeling in disarray. But in New Hampshire, Obama received an important rebuff. In retrospect, Obama’s defeat in New Hampshire can probably be best explained through the ability of voters in that state to observe the scandals enveloping Governor Deval Patrick of Massachusetts during his first year in office. Patrick and Obama share an almost identical public profile, and spout verbatim the identical utopian and messianic"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Elitist Obama Hysteria Broken by Votes of Working People 155 rhetoric, in lieu of positive and specific policy proposals. This is because both Obama and Patrick are clones of the same mother ship, the Brzezinski faction. Having seen Patrick in action, New Hampshire voters had Obama’s number as soon as he arrived on the scene, and they were not buying it. Patrick’s rapacity and corruption — spending large sums of state money to redecorate his office, insisting on a Cadillac limousine, and hiring a Chief of Staff for his own wife at a cost to taxpayers of $75,000 per year — all this showed what greedy excesses of corruption might be expected under a future Obama administration. Patrick had promised to provide relief from onerous real estate taxes, but had entirely struck out in this regard, severely undermining his job rating on that score. Obama’s failure to knock Clinton and Edwards out of the race in New Hampshire meant that the primary season would continue until Super Tuesday in the first week of February. On Super Tuesday, Senator Clinton scored the most important victory of the entire primary season by winning the Electoral College megastate of California by a thumping landslide majority of 10%, while also winning in New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. Again, her Massachusetts win, representing a humiliating repudiation of the corrupt and decadent Kennedy political dynasty, had much to do with voters’ familiarity with the Obama template thanks to their dismal experience under the Patrick regime. The Super Tuesday results prolonged the contest through the month of February, giving Obama a chance to win a string of 11 victories in caucus states, Republican states, ultraleft states, and marginal states, each time stoking the hysterical adulation of fawning media whores on the controlled corporate television networks. Obama second chance to knock Mrs. Clinton out of the race and seized the Democratic nomination therefore came on March 4. His failure to win big on that date means that his postmodern coup d’état will be on hold for seven weeks until the Pennsylvania primary, or until Puerto Rico votes in early June, or until the Democratic national convention in Denver in the last week of August. The protracted campaign which now opens up before us is in itself Obama’s worst enemy, since the artificial enthusiasm of his deluded followers will be harder and harder to maintain as the weeks and months grind on. Although he poses as an insurgent, Obama has been collecting endorsements from the most discredited elements of the Democratic Party, not just the Kennedy clan. Bill Bradley, elitist Wall Street"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 15 6 investment banker, has now mobilized his own holier than thou rhetoric in favor of the South Side Savior. We can all remember Bradley for his impotence when Al Gore debated him during the 2000 primary campaign. Gore lied about Bradley’s health care proposal, and Bradley lacked the courage to denounce Gore to his face. His impotence is yet another reason why there is no universal health care in this country. For Bradley, Obama’s raising of political cowardice to the level of a virtue is doubtless attractive, since it re-interprets his own past failures as high-minded triumphs. Senator Jay Rockefeller is also campaigning for Obama. With Brzezinski, Volcker, and Carter already on board, the Obama campaign is looking more and more like a Carter re-union. The Obama campaign remains a brutal and dangerous enemy who should not be underestimated, especially given the extent of his backing from the left wing of the US intelligence community. OHIO: THE CLASSIC BELLWETHER Ohio is of course the classic battleground swing state of recent years. It is the classic bellwether state, and an indispensable component in any Democratic candidate’s formula for winning the Electoral College. The most important voting group in Ohio is the Reagan Democrats — blue-collar, trade union, middle class and lower middle class voters who deserted the Democratic Party in 1980 after the horrors visited upon them by Zbigniew Brzezinski’s puppet Jimmy Carter. Many Reagan Democrats are of Eastern European origin – Poles, Hungarians, Slovaks, and others. Many are Roman Catholic. They cultivate strong family centered values and are interested in New Deal style measures to help them maintain a middle-class standard of living, obtain adequate medical care, and educate their children despite the current George Bush economic depression. Many are working-class women. Many are retired. These voters are not interested in Obama’s vapid utopian rhetoric. They see him as the wealthy and condescending elitist and spokesman for banking interests that he in fact is. Joe Sixpack, in a word, is not falling for Obama. Senator Clinton racked up decisive 2:1 majorities among these Reagan Democrats, and this is a fact of vital importance for deciding who represents the most viable presidential candidate for the Democratic Party in the November 2000 election."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Elitist Obama Hysteria Broken by Votes of Working People 15 7 TEXAS AND THE CRUCIAL LATINO VOTE Senator Clinton’s victory in Texas also has sweeping implications for the question of which political party might dominate the Electoral College over the next four decades. In Texas, it was working-class, lower middle class, and middle-class Hispanics and Latinos who voted for Senator Clinton over Obama by a two to one ratio. The Latinos are now the largest single minority group inside the United States. Latinos had succumbed to the demagogy of George Bush in 2004, with 40% of them voting for the current tenant of the White House. Latino immigrants are by all odds the most important swing group for the political future of the United States in the 21st century, and here again they are not falling for Obama. Senator Clinton had won the Latino vote by a similar two to one margin in California, and also racked up two to one majorities among Asian immigrants. Obama’s failure to penetrate the Latino and Asian voting blocs provides an exceedingly grim commentary on his chances for winning the Electoral College. Another lesson of Texas is that Senator Clinton won the election, while Obama prevailed in the caucus. Many commentators are increasingly condemning the caucus form itself as an inherently elitist and undemocratic method of choosing candidates, since it tends to exclude working families who cannot devote so many hours to expressing their political preference, and who also feel repelled and intimidated by the snobbery and vitriolic class prejudice of many Obama supporters. In Texas, there were many reports of voter intimidation and harassment carried out, ironically, by those same Obama forces who claim to float in beatified detachment far above the normal, grubby, political fray. The secret ballot was one of the fundamental demands of the prairie populists of the 1890s, and the Democratic Party would be well advised to abolish caucuses and go back to the voting booth. The abuses of the caucus form represent a scandal every bit as big as the fraud committed in recent years with the help of electronic voting machines. RHODE ISLAND: INOCULATED BY WATCHING DEVAL PATRICK’S CORRUPTION As for Rhode Island, here is another state where Governor Deval Patrick’s personal greed and failed administration have tended to inoculate voters against Obama’s trademark demagogy. Obama’s success in Vermont confirms the analysis offered here ex contrario :"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 158 Vermont is notoriously the playground of rich elitists and affluent exurbanites. Similar demographics were doubtless at work in Obama’s success in the Wyoming Democratic caucuses: this is a state where the Democratic Party can meet in the phone booth, which Democrats have no hope of ever carrying in the November election, and where the rich elitists who jetted in to Jackson Hole for the weekend also stopped off to caucus for the anointed one. Many hourly workers who might have voted for Mrs. Clinton in a fair secret ballot election were doubtless working through the weekend and could not take several hours to participate in a caucus in which they would be looked down on by Obama’s well-heeled backers. This dynamic is becoming more generally recognized. A veteran columnist for the London Times , concluding that Clinton was the only viable choice, wrote: “But Hillary Clinton now seems more likely than Mr Obama to become the next president of the United States.... Mrs Clinton has won by decisive margins in every big state that the Democrats must win to send their candidate to the White House. Mr Obama’s lead in the delegate count is based on his success in small states with little electoral significance or in Republican strongholds such as Alabama and Nevada where the Democrats have no chance of success. (Anatole Kaletsky, London Times , March 6, 2008) As of this writing, Obama has failed to win a single closed Democrats-only primary election. Of the Electoral College megastates which are absolutely indispensable for any Democratic candidate, he has won only Illinois, and he is unlikely to prevail in any other of these big states. Mrs. Clinton has now won California, Texas, New York, Florida, Michigan, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Ohio. Obama’s dubious exploits in such reactionary strongholds as Alaska, Idaho, Kansas, North Dakota, Utah, and similar places appear nugatory in comparison. It is nice to be popular with the rich elitists of Vermont or of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, but this does not have much to do with winning the presidential election. WITH CLINTON, DEMOCRATS RULE THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE The lesson of all this is that Mrs. Clinton’s campaign so far adumbrates a durable winning combination for the Democratic Party among key sociological groups and in the Electoral College. Obama, by contrast, offers an odd assortment of states, an incongruous slapdash coalition, a random congeries, a crazy quilt or checkerboard"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Elitist Obama Hysteria Broken by Votes of Working People 159 of states where he might conceivably muddle through. By now it should be plain to all that 2008 will go down in history as a great watershed year in the latest party realignment of American politics, joining such landmark elections as the Jacksonian Democrats of 1828, the Lincoln Republicans of 1860, the Wall Street Republicans of 1896, the magnificent Franklin D. Roosevelt New Deal of 1932, and the abominable reactionary Nixon success of 1968. The house we build this year is the one we will have to live in until the midpoint of the 21st century, so it is imperative to step back from the Obama craze and its swarming adolescents and soberly measure what is at stake. The old Democratic Party of the New Deal was destroyed first of all by Lyndon B. Johnson’s incalculable folly in going into Vietnam, and then by the catastrophic presidency of Jimmy Carter, Obama’s direct predecessor in the ranks of Trilateral Commission puppets. Fleeing from the horrors of Carter, Brzezinski, and Volcker, there emerged a group of voters known as the Reagan Democrats, heavily concentrated in the rust belt states of the newly de-industrialized Great Lakes region. These voters were largely Catholics, Eastern Europeans of Polish, Hungarian, and Slovak background, blue-collar former industrial workers, socially conservative but economically still looking for a return to the New Deal. Today many of the Reagan Democrats are working women, retirees, senior citizens, and working families. In order to win in 2008 and to build a lasting majority at the same time, it is absolutely indispensable that the Democratic Party win back these Reagan Democrats. Without them, states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, will always be vulnerable to the latest Republican demagogue. The message from the Ohio primary is that Senator Clinton has by far the best chance of reincorporating the Reagan Democrats into their traditional Democratic Party home. Senator Clinton wins this group by better than two to one. Since so many Reagan Democrats are also Catholics, it is relevant to recall that Senator Clinton has been winning Catholic voters, the most important single swing religious group, by similar to 2:1 margins. Obama, by contrast, is viewed with deep suspicion as a candidate whose soaring inspirational rhetoric has nothing to do with the gritty realities of daily life in Sandusky, Altoona, and Flint; Obama is the rich man’s candidate. Polling indicates that up to 25% of Democrats who voted for Senator Clinton in Ohio would never cast their ballots for Obama, but would rather defect to Senator McCain. Tepid support for Kerry from Reagan"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 160 Democrats and Catholics helped doomed the Democratic ticket in 2004. Why should the wealthy parvenu elitist Obama fare any better? OBAMA WOULD HAND THE ELECTION TO MCCAIN There is therefore the gravest doubt as to whether Obama could ever hope to carry Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. Without these states, any Democratic candidate is doomed to defeat. The nationwide polls touted by the Obama public relations machine are meaningless: Presidents are chosen state-by-state in the Electoral College, and not by nationwide votes — ask Al Gore. The Texas results in particular confirm Senator Clinton’s lock on about two thirds of all Hispanic and Latino voters. An attempt by the controlled corporate media to gin up a generational split among Latinos fell relatively flat, especially among the vast majority of Latinos who have to work for a living under difficult circumstances and who need effective help, and not vapid utopian rhetoric. A look back at the California primary confirms Obama’s inability to appeal to Chinese, Korean, and other Asian voters. Based on the results from Texas and California, it is fair to say that Obama is a very inferior vote-getter among the newer immigrant strata who represent the fastest growing ethnic groups in the United States, and who therefore embody a large part of the political future of this country. Latinos do not vote for the Democratic Party automatically; we stress once more that in 2004, 40% of Latinos voted for Bush, giving him a significant part of his margin of victory. Here is a group which clearly merits the most sustained and sympathetic attention on the part of anyone proposing to win the presidency, and here, once again, Obama strikes out. This means that Obama has little hope of carrying Florida, another state that a Democrat must win. For Florida, factor in the important Jewish vote, where Obama’s left CIA connections into the Middle East are causing him serious trouble. RETIRED VOTERS WILL DOOM OBAMA Retired people and senior citizens have the highest levels of voter participation, and this is a demographic which has been extremely skeptical of Obamaphilia and its utopian expectations. Here lies the potential for a backlash that would add one more nail to Obama’s political coffin for November. As a British observer noted, “Finally there is the matter of maturity and experience. This is Mr McCain’s biggest gift to the Clinton campaign. An Obama-McCain contest"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Elitist Obama Hysteria Broken by Votes of Working People 161 would be seen as a match of inexperience against old age. Mr Obama hopes to win this competition by invoking the spirit of John F. Kennedy. What he forgets, however, is that Kennedy was swept to power on the crest of the baby boom, when the largest group of voters was in its twenties. Today these boomers are in their sixties or seventies - and will not take kindly to the charge that Mr McCain is too old to be president. Given the high propensity to vote among the elderly, this election will not be decided by a baby boom but by a senility surge.” (Anatole Kaletsky, London Times , March 6, 2008) Try winning Florida, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan against that tide. The only way that Obama might conceivably seize the presidency is through the kind of scandal assistance which has so notoriously been employed to catapult him into the Senate in the first place. But even in this case, Obama’s own vulnerability to scandal (Tony Rezko, Larry Sinclair, Bill Ayers, Bernard Dohrn, Ilyas Achmadov, etc.) is so massive that at this point no one could be certain that even the most massive scandals unleashed against Senator McCain could guarantee success for Obama. The Illinois Senator truly represents damaged goods, and those seriously interested in evicting the reactionary Republicans from the White House need to dump him while there is still time. If we combine Senator Clinton’s proven appeal to the Reagan Democrats, plus her hegemony among Latinos and Asian voters, we can then turn to the Electoral College map. With Clinton as the candidate, California stays locked up for the Democratic Party for the entire foreseeable, future thanks to Asian and Latino voters there. Arizona and New Mexico move permanently into the Democratic column. Florida ceases to become a battleground state, and begins to tend heavily Democratic. Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan are no longer vulnerable Republicans, and also join the Democratic column. Texas by contrast, begins to leave the Republican deep-freeze, and becomes much more of a battleground swing state in which the GOP must expend large amounts of precious resources in order to have a chance — all thanks to Latino voters. In this way, a solid Democratic majority emerges, destined to last until the middle of the 21st century, and destined to provide a political playing field automatically biased in favor of progressives and against the benighted reactionaries who have been in command since the advent of Nixon. A new political world, not utopian but realistic, opens up."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 162 These changes, it must be stressed, are of an objective rather than a subjective order. The personality of Mrs. Clinton is only incidental to them. Like a sacrament, they work independently of the state of mind of the person who is bringing them about. A positive outcome of the ongoing party realignment will shape events for many decades, long after the politicians of today have departed from the scene. Those who do not like Mrs. Clinton should recall that she represents neither the cause nor the final fruition of this party realignment, but rather the transitional figure who serves as a vehicle to make it possible. Under the Clinton scenario, the Republican Party ticket of McCain- Lieberman or McCain-Condoleezza Rice or any other McCain variant undergoes a catastrophic loss of both White House and Congress in 2008, reverting to the status of a regional party primarily concentrated in the deep South, and trading prevalently in Mexophobia and racism. It becomes a party of the states where Governor Huckabee has won primaries, and ceases to be a true national party. Under the Obama scenario, however, these same hypothetical Republican tickets can win Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan with the help of the critical swing factor represented by the Reagan Democrats, and also take Florida thanks to disaffected Latinos who cannot stomach Obama. Texas belongs to the GOP. California becomes a battleground state, draining Democratic Party resources that are needed elsewhere. A US attack on Iran occurs within six months after McCain’s inauguration, followed by a likely escalation towards all-out thermonuclear confrontation with Moscow and Beijing. Martial law and dictatorship are imposed on the home front, and we discover that the potential of the 2008 party realignment has been aborted into dictatorship and world war. This is what it means to succumb to the siren song of the Obama propaganda machine. Especially because some parts of the black community have become infatuated with Obama, it would be well to prepare a series of measures to heal the rift that may result as the Senator sinks into obscurity. One very concrete progressive reform would be to admit the District of Columbia into the Union as the 51st state, virtually guaranteeing two black senators and an additional black member of the House. That is a reform that would keep on giving forever, and which would materially improve the voting balance in the Senate. More broadly, the black community would benefit most from class- based measures for economic recovery. Although the numerical majority of the beneficiaries of such programs would probably turn"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Elitist Obama Hysteria Broken by Votes of Working People 163 out to be white, a greater portion of the black community — specifically of the black underclass — would benefit as compared to any other group in the population. The class-based criterion is decisive in making sure that economic development assistance actually reaches the sidewalks of the black inner-city ghetto, and is not absorbed by members of the black overclass, as has so often been the case in the past. OBAMA FLEES QUESTIONS ABOUT REZKO Obama’s failure had much to do with the fact that he had been defeated in several media cycles before the Texas and Ohio voting. This was something new and unusual. It is clear that the Obama supporters are extremely labile and suggestible, requiring hour by hour maintenance and support in the form of a steady diet of adulation, fawning, and idolatry by the stable of kept media whores. Even the temporary disturbance in this support system leads to disorientation and consternation among these lemming legions. The trial of Obama’s underworld friend Tony Rezko had been in the news for several days before the March 4 voting. On March 3, Obama had beat a hasty retreat from a press conference in which some Chicago reporters had pushed aside Obama’s usual fawning traveling press corps, and asked tough questions about his meetings and fundraisers with Rezko, and about the amount of money this gangster had injected into the Obama campaign. As he often does under these circumstances, Obama began to stutter and stammer, whining that eight questions was all that he could be expected to answer, and then ran out the door as fast as his legs could carry. With that, the reverential decorum of Obama’s usual media adoration session was abruptly broken. The press contingent who habitually travel on the Obama campaign plane were exposed as contemptible lapdogs, experts in softball questions, and shills for the Obama campaign. Obama’s hissy fit was a sign that he really did not have the stamina, grit, and determination necessary to overcome the vaunted Republican attack machine in the fall. The Huffington Post website, dominated by a rich cosmopolitan elitist who was an eager participant in the attempt to remove Bill Clinton from office, and whose open love affair with McCain she is now trying to put behind her, is normally the inner Temple of Obama cultism. But even here, the hypnotic spell of this Manchurian candidate was being broken: on"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 164 March 6, Rachel Sklar posted a perceptive article discussing the obvious weakness and fecklessness of the anointed one. Many Obama skeptics offered comments, pointing out that “Egobama” was a petulant whiner, too brittle to take on the GOP. Both Time and Newsweek put Senator Clinton on their covers. GOOLSBEE TO CANADIANS: DON’T WORRY, OBAMA IS LYING Even worse were the vicissitudes of Austan Goolsbee, the Skull and Bones member and Chicago school free-trade fanatic who serves as Obama’s top economic policy handler. Under pressure from Ohio voters who are deeply disillusioned with the free-trade sellouts of recent decades, Obama had tried the rhetorical gambit of announcing his intentions to renegotiate the NAFTA free-trade pact among the US, Canada, and Mexico. Goolsbee had contacted the Canadian consulate in Chicago to reassure the neocon regime of Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper that Obama’s sallies against NAFTA were simply demagogic ploys designed to get him votes, and that he did not mean any of this seriously. Obama was lying, so the Canadian bigwigs had nothing to worry about. Naturally, Obama’s lies were difficult to reconcile with the much touted politics of hope, and this incident had helped many Ohio voters solidify their vague suspicions of Obama into a firm resolve to reject him at the polls. OBAMA CAN’T FIRE GOOLSBEE – GOOLSBEE OWNS OBAMA Some commentators noted that if Obama wanted to be taken seriously in the future, he needed to immediately fire Goolsbee. But this misconstrues the essential nature of the Obama campaign: it is Brzezinski and Goolsbee who have selected and recruited Obama for his current role, and not the other way around. Brzezinski and Goolsbee own Obama, it is they who are the bosses of this puppet candidate. Obama cannot fire them; if anything it is they who might decide to fire him, and it might not be pretty. During these critical days, a number of websites revealed that, during Obama’s campaign for the United States Senate in 2004, he had met with the editorial board of the Chicago Tribune to announce his support for US bombing attacks against both Iran and Pakistan. As David Mendell of the Chicago Tribune staff had reported, “U.S. Senate candidate Barack Obama suggested Friday that the United"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Elitist Obama Hysteria Broken by Votes of Working People 165 States one day might have to launch surgical missile strikes into Iran and Pakistan to keep extremists from getting control of nuclear bombs.” (Chicago Tribune, September 25, 2004) Coupled with Obama’s more recent enthusiasm for bombing strikes on Pakistan, this provided a useful reminder that Obama, despite his rhetoric of opposition to the Iraq war, is in reality the most adventurous warmonger in the entire Democratic field, far more bellicose than Senator Clinton, and indeed more aggressive and dangerous than Bush himself. Thanks to this timely reminder, voters were able to see that Obama’s self-serving narrative of his own clairvoyance in regard to the Iraq war was worse than a fairytale — it was the cover story for a coming nightmare of aggression scripted by the revanchist and Russia hater Zbigniew Brzezinski. Other attacks on Obama took their toll during these days. The supermarket tabloid The Globe published a story on accusations from Larry Sinclair that Obama had consumed crack cocaine during a homosexual encounter. A Yahoo search on the eve of the March 4 voting disclosed that the Larry Sinclair allegations had been mentioned on over 800,000 websites, and were continuing to spread rapidly across the Internet. Paul Krugman condemned Obama in the New York Times as an unscrupulous demagogue for his use of classic reactionary Republican arguments against Senator Clinton’s plan for universal health care. Sean Hannity of Fox News hammered away at Obama’s close association with the Weatherman terrorist Bill Ayers who, according to the Obama campaign, was still a friend of the senator. The London Times revealed Obama’s intention of choosing a Republican as his vice presidential running mate or else as secretary of defense, mentioning the names of GOP senators Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and Richard Lugar of Indiana in this connection. The sanctimonious Hagel had used voting machines manufactured by his own company to filch his Senate seat in Nebraska. Lugar had run for president well before 9/11 on a platform of generating fear of a coming terrorist attack in the United States. Obama’s post-partisan sellout was already beginning, even before he had the nomination in his hands. SEAN WILENTZ: OBAMA’S CUTTHROAT, FRAUDULENT RACE POLITICS The distinguished Princeton history professor Sean Wilentz attacked the pervasive media legend that Bill Clinton had somehow"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 16 6 been guilty of racist tactics during the run-up to the South Carolina primary. Wilentz showed conclusively that the shoe was in fact on the other foot: it had been the Obama campaign and its media cheering section who had cynically played the race card. Wilentz wrote: “While promoting Obama as a ‘post-racial’ figure, his campaign has purposefully polluted the contest with a new strain of what historically has been the most toxic poison in American politics. ... The Clinton campaign, in fact, has not racialized the campaign, and never had any reason to do so. Rather the Obama campaign and its supporters, well-prepared to play the ‘race-baiter card’ before the primaries began, launched it with a vengeance when Obama ran into dire straits after his losses in New Hampshire and Nevada — and thereby created a campaign myth that has turned into an incontrovertible truth among political pundits, reporters, and various Obama supporters. This development is the latest sad commentary on the malign power of the press, hyping its own favorites and tearing down those it dislikes, to create pseudo-scandals of the sort that hounded Al Gore during the 2000 campaign. It is also a commentary on how race can make American politics go haywire. Above all, it is a commentary on the cutthroat, fraudulent politics that lie at the foundation of Obama’s supposedly uplifting campaign.” (Sean Wilentz, “How Barack Obama played the race card and blamed Hillary Clinton,” The New Republic , February 27, 2008) OBAMA’S SCRIPT IS WEARING THIN Obama’s speech in the wake of his decisive defeats in Ohio, Texas, and Rhode Island showed how quickly his demagogy was wearing thin in the new climate of adversity. Obama came across as frowning, angry, saturnine. He spoke of his desire to create a new world in which Americans could be proud of their own nationality when they traveled abroad — hardly a leading preoccupation for Joe Sixpack, who does not get over to Paris quite as often as the senator and his wealthy elitist backers. He told the story of one of his supporters from Uganda, who had stayed up late to watch the Iowa caucus. He suggested that Americans needed to be on their best behavior when voting because this man from Uganda was watching how they conducted themselves — a peculiar thesis, to say the least. This speech, as so often with Obama, was a script read off the glass plates of a Teleprompter. He seemed to be overcompensating for defeat, and the effort fell flat."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Elitist Obama Hysteria Broken by Votes of Working People 16 7 Commentators are now suggesting that Obama needs to abandon his characteristic Nuremberg rally or balcony speech style, and begin listening to voters about their needs, showing that he understands the economic situation, has a specific economic program, and possesses the guts and determination necessary to fight for the needs of his base. But that, of course, might sully his carefully cultivated seraphic image. Many observers noted that Obama was a politician with a glass jaw, who could not absorb a haymaker and then come back up off the mat. A journalist from Texas wrote that her friends had concluded that Obama had no balls. All these observers were right: Obama had raised cowardice, appeasement, and preventive capitulation to the status of positive virtues. His announced intent of giving the vice presidency or the Pentagon to a Republican amounted to throwing away the fruits of Democratic victory even before it had been gained. Hard-pressed working families were taking note. SAMANTHA POWER SPEWS VENOM The disarray in the Obama campaign was underscored in the wake of his defeats in Texas, Ohio, and Rhode Island by the flap around Samantha Power, who appears to have assumed the role of schoolmarm, governess and nursemaid in foreign policy questions for the superficial Senator. One commentator propounded the comparison that Samantha Power was to Obama as Condoleezza Rice was to Bush. The Obama campaign talks reconciliation but runs on pure venom, and this was illustrated once again when Professor Samantha Power told The Scotsman that Senator Clinton is “a monster.” “We f***** up in Ohio,” she added, with a refinement that would have made the foul-mouthed terrorist Bernardine Dohrn proud. “In Ohio, they are obsessed and Hillary is going to town on it, because she knows Ohio’s the only place they can win.” What are they obsessed with in Ohio? The savage destruction wrought by free trade? Jobs? Health care? Wages? One wonders what world the elitist jet set professor lives in. She also told the BBC that Obama did not intend to be bound by his solemn campaign promise to engineer a departure of US combat forces from Iraq within 16 months of taking office; Obama would act according to an operational plan developed in agreement with the generals, she suggested. This meant that Obama was blatantly lying on Iraq as well as NAFTA, even as he assured foreign bigwigs and media that he did not believe a word of his own campaign demagogy. The politics of hope, indeed. Top Obama controller Zbigniew"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 168 Brzezinski, never the brightest political bulb, faulted his protégé’s handling of this affair: “I think an expression of regret for using an inappropriate description of Senator Clinton should have sufficed. And I don’t think she should have resigned.” Things were not improved when Susan Rice, Obama’s hate-filled, bellicose, and trigger-happy advisor on African affairs told an interviewer that it was true that Obama was not ready for an emergency 3 a.m. phone call, but whined that Mrs. Clinton was not ready either. Some observers have noted that when Goolsbee embarrassed the Obama campaign, he was not reprimanded in public. When Professor Samantha Power did the same thing, she was immediately given the sack. The main reason for this is that Goolsbee belongs to the inner circle of controllers, while Professor Samantha Power was there to provide a kind of daycare support for the labile protagonist. But others saw a large dose of sexism in the obvious double standard for male and female advisors. THE OBAMA CAMPAGN AND THE LEFT CIA The figure of Professor Samantha Power should remind us of the pervasive presence of the left wing of the CIA and of the US intelligence community generally in the Obama campaign. Professor Power is the self proclaimed “genocide chick” whose book about Bosnia made her famous. She has also written about the Portuguese United Nations functionary Vieira de Mello, who was blown up in Baghdad in 2003 in an incident that more than one commentator attributed to Achmed Chalabi, the darling of the neocons and a leading US agent. Professor Power has also been beating the drum on Darfur, attempting to create the preconditions for US military attack on Sudan that would serve the Brzezinski strategy of driving the Chinese out of Africa; Sudan is one of the main oil exporters to China on that continent. Professor Power is interested in genocide, but mainly when that genocide can be pinned on a country the US wants to attack. She is not interested in the genocide created by the US in Iraq, with the butcher’s bill already in excess of one million defenseless civilians slaughtered. She is not interested in the ongoing US genocide in Afghanistan, where reckless bombing of civilian targets is now the norm. She is not interested in the greatest genocide of them all, the 40,000 human beings who perish every day from malnutrition, starvation, and diseases which can be cured for pennies — all thanks"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Elitist Obama Hysteria Broken by Votes of Working People 169 to the savage conditionalities of the US-dominated International Monetary Fund and the US-dominated World Bank. In an interview with the London house organ of NATO intelligence, Professor Power argued in effect that Obama would be a more effective salesman for the discredited war on terror and for recruiting Europe into future US aggressive campaigns. She boasted: “Obama can go door-to-door in Europe and say, ‘Look, like you I opposed the war in Iraq but what are we going to do together about Al Qaeda?’” She also hinted that Obama’s ability to demand blood, sweat, and tears from the American people would far exceed that of Bush: “The Bush years have left the American people looking for visible change. There was this post-September 11th yearning, people were waiting for a call to do good - instead of getting the call we were told to go shopping. What the Obama movement has shown is that that yearning still exists in people.” ( London Daily Telegraph , March 8, 2008) In effect, when it comes to breaking strikes, imposing a new military draft, mandating forced labor, or demanding sacrifices and austerity for new wars, Obama would doubtlessly have more demagogic power than the discredited Bush. MEDIA WHORES FOR OBAMA The deplorable antics of the media whores for Obama deserve special attention. Lying, distortion, manipulation, and blatant partisanship have reached scandalous levels at all the networks and in the mainstream press, but perhaps nowhere is the situation worse than it MSNBC and NBC. MSNBC starts every morning with the sleazy Joe Scarborough — who has never yet answered the relevant questions about the dead woman whose body was found in his congressional office — joined by the obvious partisan Mika Brzezinski in a tendentious spectacle which has been dubbed Obamavision by insiders. This is also the network of Chris Matthews, whose pro-Obama tirades have violated any objective reading of the Federal Elections Commission regulations on unpaid political advertising. Most hypocritical of all and therefore worst of all is the hypocritical Keith Olbermann, who attempts to cover up his reactionary and pro-Wall Street instincts with his opposition to the Iraq war and his facile contempt for Bush. Olbermann is no journalist, but rather a ham-handed booster of Obama. He is appropriately joined on many evenings by the effete British snob"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 170 Richard Wolfe, whose claim to understand the political dynamics of the United States is as impudent as it is absurd.

Then there is the atrocious Andrea Mitchell, Mrs. Federal Reserve and a mouthpiece for finance capital if there ever was one. Olbermann is also frequently joined by Dana Milbank of the Washington Post , notoriously the house organ of the Federal Reserve system. Milbank is a member of the infamous Skull and Bones secret society of Yale University, a monstrous conflict of interest which he does not routinely disclose. The scurrilous David Shuster has been rehabilitated and continues in his partisan métier. Olbermann’s line of nonstop groveling adulation for Obama exposes his moral, intellectual, and political bankruptcy in the harshest light. Whatever credibility he might have built up over the years with his criticism of the Iraq war has now been erased by his current meretricious activities in support of the current flagship covert operation of the intelligence community. Brian Williams and Tim Russert and NBC occupy the same plane of media degradation. Most Air America broadcasters have turned out to be so corrupt as to be practically worthless. The boor and philistine Ed Shultz has also become a water boy for Obama. Shultz preens himself on being the leading progressive radio talk show. Shultz is closely associated with former Democratic Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, who lost his seat ignominiously because he was so closely identified with the interests of Citibank, the Wall Street concern which is at the same time one of the largest employers in South Dakota. The milquetoast Senator from Citibank made betrayal, capitulation and cowardice into a fine art during his time as Democratic Senate leader. Ironically, it is just this kind of craven appeasement of the reactionary Republicans which Obama elevates to the status of an article of faith. Since Daschle is one of the national co-chairs of the Obama campaign, Ed Shultz’s membership in the Media Whores for Obama is no surprise. Some members of the controlled corporate media are now encountering spontaneous outbursts of rage and resentment on the part of middle-class voters on the campaign trail due to the outrageous favoritism for Obama shown by their so-called “news organizations.” It is a salutary phenomenon."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Elitist Obama Hysteria Broken by Votes of Working People 171 OBAMA RODE INTO THE SENATE ON RIGGED SCANDALS AGAINST HIS FOES We must always remember how weak Obama is as a candidate. He would not hold his Senate seat today without the providential deus ex machina of his reactionary backers at the Chicago Tribune , who conveniently smoothed his path into the Senate by demolishing his two main opponents of 2004 with the help of well-timed scandals. First there was Marson Blair Hull, who had spent some $12 million on television advertising in hopes of winning the Democratic nomination for Senate. A gaggle of Chicago media led by the Chicago Tribune insisted on opening the sealed court papers relative to Hull’s contentious divorce, swiftly destroying his chances. Then came the turn of Republican senatorial candidate Jack Ryan, a credible and formidable opponent heading towards the November election. The same rat pack of media led by the Chicago Tribune demanded that Ryan’s divorce papers be opened, leading to salacious revelations that knocked him out of the race too. Instead of fielding a serious candidate, the Illinois Republican Party at that point decided to punt, trucking in the well-known buffoon and windbag Alan Keyes as a carpetbagger from distant Maryland. After that, Obama floated to victory. This is why Obama is such a hypocrite when he complains about dirty politics; he is one of the biggest beneficiaries of dirty politics to be sitting today in the United States Senate. This is why Michelle Obama is such a cynical hypocrite when she boasts that her husband comes from the rough-and-tumble world of Chicago and Illinois politics: so far, the rough-and-tumble has been largely directed against Obama’s hapless opponents, and seldom against the arrogant and pretentious Senator."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Obama’s Oligarchs OBAMA’S NEW SPIN DOCTOR IS USAF CHIEF OF STAFF GEN. MERRILL MCPEAK, THE “BOMB NOW, DIE LATER” BUTCHER OF THE 1991 IRAQ WAR At today’s Obama rave in Oregon, the Manchurian candidate was loudly defended by retired US Air Force General Merrill McPeak, one of Obama’s high-profile handlers. McPeak accused Bill Clinton of McCarthyite tactics (or was it lèse majesté?) for remarks in which Obama’s holy name was not even mentioned. Who then is Obama’s new defender? McPeak is a Republican Bush family appointee who was named as Air Force Chief of Staff by President George H.W. Bush in October of 1990. McPeak took over during the time of Operation Desert Shield, and assisted in the overall target selection and strategic planning for the First Gulf War (“Operation Desert Storm”) of January-February 1991. During that time McPeak’s forces flew about 130,000 sorties over Iraq, bombing that country back into the stone age as part of a Bush-Kissinger operation. It was estimated at the time that if each sortie had killed just one Iraqi, then 130,000 Iraqis had already died when the bombing stopped. In particular, McPeak was the mastermind of the cowardly and infamous “bomb now, die later” strategy which targeted civilian drinking water and sewage treatment facilities, plus civilian transport infrastrcuture and irrigation systyems needed for farming. This was a strategy of deliberate genocide which resulted in hundreds of thousands of delayed action deaths caused by polluted water and concentrated among old people, infants, and the sick. McPeak thus provided an important contribution to the harvest of hatred against the United States, which is about to result in the 4,000 th death among the occupying forces. McPeak helped to prepare the current Iraq debacle more than a decade in advance. According to recently broadcast accounts, McPeak was also a part of the mass killing in East Timor: “Another Obama adviser, General Merrill McPeak, an Air Force man, who not long after the Dili massacre in East Timor in ‘91...I happened to see on Indonesian TV"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Obama’s Oligarchs 173 shortly after that—there was General McPeak overseeing the delivery to Indonesia of US fighter planes.” (Allan Nairn, Democracy Now, January 3, 2008) Yet, with this record, McPeak has the gall to lecture Democrats on whom they should vote for. Among air power genocidalists, McPeak is up there with Bomber Harris of RAF Bomber Command and Gen. Curits LeMay of the Tokyop firestorms. Is this change we can believe in? McPeak is a typical reactionary Republican, having served as Oregon state chairman for the Bob Dole campaign in 1996. In 2000, he enthusiastically endorsed George W. Bush, and worked for Bush as co-chair of Oregon Veterans for Bush. Maybe McPeak should keep his election advice to himself. Instead of pontificating at Obama rallies, he should be standing in the dock at Nuremberg to answer for high crimes against humanity, including genocide in Iraq. Maybe McPeak’s admiration for Obama is due to Obama’s status as a trigger-happy warmonger who was ready to bomb both Iran and Pakistan during his US Senate campaign (David Mendell, “Obama would consider missile strikes on Iran,” Chicago Tribune, Sept. 25, 2004). Obama now wants to bomb Pakistan – maybe McPeak is drawing up the plans for that one already. (Jake Tapper, “Anti-War Obama Pushes Pakistan Invasion,” ABC News, August 1, 2007). Or maybe it is just that McPeak likes Obama’s plan to choose a Republican running mate or Secretary of Defense like Hagel or Lugar. (Sarah Baxter, “Barnstorming Obama plans to pick Republicans for cabinet,” London Sunday Times , March 2, 2008). With the Obama campaign in desperate straits over the last several weeks, a shocking parade of the candidate’s elitist backers have been forced to rush to his public defense.

Rockefeller III), Joseph Nye (Trilateral- Bilderberger theoretician of imperialist “soft power”), and now “Bomb Now, Die Later” McPeak. Is this what a future Obama confrontation cabinet would look like? McPeak, for his part, looks like Death Warmed Over.

Zbigniew, a low-level Polish aristocrat whose life has been devoted to hatred for Russia, lauded Obama for his 2002 speech opposing the Iraq war, saying that he himself was the source of Obama’s arguments back then - thus confirming Obama’s long-term status as his puppet, which probably began in 1981-1983, when Obama was a student at Columbia University, and Zbig was directing the anti- Russian institute.

Zbig is an infamous Cold War hawk who has managed to re-invent himself in the eyes of some dupes by opposing the Iraq adventure, mainly because it is bad for imperialism. Zbig did not mention that the reason he wants to downplay certain aspects of US aggression in the Middle East is to free up resources for use in the much bigger and more dangerous adventures which the Trilateral Commission is now directing. Zbig is the mastermind of the Kosovo secession under KLA terrorist auspices, a gambit against Serbia and Russia to prepare a coming Operation Barbarossa II against Moscow.

Brzezinski’s goal is confrontation with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the main world center for resistance to US-UK global domination. Anti-war activists are still fixated on Iran, but Brzezinski is not - his target is China, TWENTY times bigger than Iran, with ICBMs ready to launch, followed by Russia, the world’s biggest nuclear power.

Now we have a situation where a sore loser, Obama, wants the votes shredded, or else wants half the delegates. Such nonsense is nothing other but affirmative action for weak politicians. What is happening is the deliberate disenfranchisement of voters’ rights, something the Democratic Party has become quite adept at in capitulating to Bush’s stolen elections. This constitutes a deliberate wrecking operation against the Democratic Party that should not be tolerated.

Senator Clinton has responded by saying she would accept a new primary; Obama, knowing he would lose, rejects and sabotages a new primary, and would rather have a caucus that would favor him, because caucuses attract affluent voters who have time to participate in caucuses. Failing that, Obama wants to simply be given half the votes, just because he is the divine Obama. Entitlement over democracy is what typifies elitists oligarchs like Howard Dean, a man who comes from Wall Street money and has never betrayed The Street. Dean regards government as the avenue to securing the entitlements of his class over the concern for the common good. When he was Governor of Vermont, Ho Ho — as the widely read Vermont columnist Peter Freyne referred to him — was in essence a Republican, fiscally very conservative; he was not the environmentalist nor progressive that he thought he was, other than in his health care initiative. Dean of course was very guarded about his real record in Vermont when he had his gubernatorial records officially and hermetically sealed before he ran for president in 2003- 4. One speculation was that he had been using his position as Governor to further his political aspirations. There is more to the story. There is some question as to whether Dean ever took the oath of office as Governor of Vermont. Discovery in an unrelated legal proceeding failed to turn up any proof that Dean was ever actually a ‘subscriber’ to the Oath of Office, and photo ops of Dean taking the oath do not count. Does this explain the unconstitutional conduct of such an occupant of high office, which has continued with the present"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Why the Democratic Party Rules are not a Suicide Pact 18 7 Republican Governor of Vermont? Does this not say something about the disregard for the Constitution across the nation, especially in Washington? Dean helped private business developers, but he did not work to save Vermont’s once famous machine tool industry, the “Precision Valley” along the Connecticut River, the type of vital manufacturing capabilities America desperately needs. Perhaps this disregard explains Dean’s elitist class prejudice against Michigan’s overwhelmingly blue-collar voters, who realize that the current economic depression is a reality that goes beyond a bad day on Wall Street. The Dean/Obama hedge fund does not understand the economics of the real world, but their respective political operations are in essence political hedges for the finance oligarchy. The Dean presidential campaign of 2004 (remember the Deaniacs?) has in essence been carried over tactically and demographically by the Obama campaign, which has copied Dean’s signature ploy of using the internet to suck in money and hype voters. Both Dean and Obama are fakes, demagogues. One must remember that Howard Dean was not the antiwar candidate that he wanted you to think he was. Dean only opposed the way the Iraq war was started, and had no objection to the occupation; in fact, Dean thought we should have attacked Iran instead! Likewise Obama, who said he was against the war in Iraq, but has certainly voted repeatedly to fund the occupation and refused to support even Kerry’s tepid pullout resolution. Obama’s real character is revealed by his repeated calls to bomb Pakistan, and if need be Iran. Glen Ford of The Black Agenda Report was absolutely correct in characterizing Obama as a “War Ho,” not only for his bellicose and aggressive statements, but also for being complicit with Bush in funding the war. Now that Gen. Merrill McPeak, the architect behind the First Gulf War’s “Bomb Now, Die Later” air slaughter campaign, has actively joined his campaign, Obama the ‘War Ho” has real creds. Democrats always seem to have the weakness of wanting to show that they are macho, and this applies to the Clintons as well. But the issue though is that Obama is a direct asset and puppet of Zbigniew Brzezinski, one of the world’s most dangerous men.

The financier elite and their controlled media have turned against Hillary because she might become the woman who would revive the legacy of FDR, whom she has invoked against Wall Street. She might promote the general welfare over financier welfare. Remember Austin Goolsbee, the Skull and Bones-Chicago School economic handler of Obama if you have any doubts that Obama would not be more “market friendly” than Clinton. Michael Bloomberg, who now praises Obama, tells you all have to know about the reality of Obamanomics. Obama is a wrecking operation against the Democratic Party and the revival of the tradition of FDR in this time of crisis. Dean considered Harry Truman to be his political hero. Truman, an earlier rage-filled war ho and puppet of Skull and Bones operative Averell Harriman, began the demolition of the New Deal. Today Bloomberg is also part of the wrecking operation against the Democratic Party, and might even be Obama’s running mate and Cheneyesque overseer. Obama’s reported openness to Republicans as running mate and cabinet officials suggests that he will indeed carry out the Felix Rohatyn-Warren Rudman swindle of privatizing what remains of US infrastructure. The crisis of leadership in the Democratic Party will only be solved when the grassroots of the party says “Enough!” Certainly people need to learn from the betrayal by the Pelosi Democrats of the antiwar majority that elected them to Congress in 2006 to stop the war. Obama has stepped into that vacuum left by that betrayal with his message of hope, which has duped and pacified many. But Obama never seriously fought the war as a Senator. When it comes to impeachment, it has been the Democratic leadership that has repeatedly stopped it. Dean has said he is against impeachment because it will get in the way of the election. In Vermont, where the impeachment movement based on article 603 of Thomas Jefferson’s manual of the House of Representatives rules first started, we saw the state Democratic leadership swayed by pressure coming directly from Senator Leahy’s office against impeachment. The blatant sabotage against impeachment was repeated by Democratic Representative Peter Welch, a machine hack who said impeachment would get in the way of the Democrats stopping the war and investigating Bush and Cheney. Both Leahy and Welch are, like Dean, Obama supporters."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Why the Democratic Party Rules are not a Suicide Pact 189 Today, Dean is using stalling tactics as concerns Florida and Michigan. In the background is the whole question of the super- delegates that Dean is manipulating as a way for Obama to win the nomination. Dean is now trying to coerce and stampede the super- delegates into supporting Obama. In essence this tactic is working to say that the whole primary/caucus process is illegitimate if Dean’s chosen candidate does not win. Certainly there is grave doubt that Obama could ever win the general election against McCain, especially after the Jeremiah Wright revelations. To give Obama the election through disenfranchisement and strong-arm tactics could well alienate many voters, who would then be impelled to vote for the self-styled maverick moderate McCain. Since Obama did not win the big states like California, New York, Florida, Michigan, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio and Texas, and is likely to lose heavily in Pennsylvania, how can he win a general election, especially if he alienates independents and the important Reagan Democrats, not to mention the Latino and Asian vote? Of course, Obama’s policies do nothing for inner city, low- income blacks, but offer a great deal to social climbers like Dean’s DNC handmaiden, Donna Brazile. It would seem that Democrats are preparing for another loss in the tradition of McGovern, Mondale, Dukakis, Gore and Kerry. What this country needs as an antidote to such chicanery is a real debate. The present controversy that has kept the nomination up for grabs has some important benefits, as it is forcing Hillary Clinton to fight, while pushing her towards New Deal and populist economic measures to broaden her appeal to the ever-expanding number of voters who are getting seriously hurt in this economic crisis. She needs to be in touch with what is really going on with people and this nation and she is slowly responding, having invoked FDR’s anti- foreclosure policies in a recent speech in Pennsylvania. Perhaps she is waking her up to the Federal Reserve’s attack against the American people’s economic future and economic sovereignty now being carried out by means of outrageous and illegal bailouts, as in the Bear Stearns scandal. The defining issue is this: will the government support the interests of bankrupt Wall Street, or will We the People prevail?

Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1936 Stop protecting those receiving welfare benefits! Jimmy Carter to HEW Secretary Califano (Leuchtenburg 14) The catastrophic Trilateral presidency of James Earl Carter offers a not so distant mirror for Obama as he strives to seize the White House. Carter’s disastrous tenure has tended to be eclipsed in recent years because of the long reactionary nightmare under Reagan which followed him, because of the horrors of Bush the Elder, because of the impeachment and right-wing hatred aroused against the Clinton presidency, and because of the terrible years of Bush the younger. But because the Carter administration was so completely dominated by such Trilateral Commission figures as David Rockefeller, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Paul Volcker, and others — some of the same people who are functioning today as the puppet masters of Obama — the Carter years will repay our study as we seek to look into the future and chart the course of a possible future Obama administration. The memories of the Carter years have also been repressed because they were so intrinsically painful and represented such a colossal waste of the golden post-Watergate opportunity. There can be no doubt that Jimmy Carter is a strong contender along with Herbert Hoover and George Bush the elder for the opprobrium of being the worst one term president of the 20th century. The most important fact to understand about the Carter administration is that it was not a product of a normal political process as most people would understand this term, but was rather be artificially orchestrated outcome of a multi-year commitment by a faction of bankers, think tanks, professors, sociologists, economists and psychologists who sought to carry out a program which served the imagined interests of Wall Street, but which was so destructive to the average person and to the United States as a whole that it could"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Catastrophic Presidency of Trilateral Puppet Jimmy Carter 191 not be avowed in public. Carter did not improvise or make up his lunatic policies as he went along; rather, he was pre-programmed as an exercise in Shumpeterian creative destruction before he ever got close to the Oval Office. CARTER CHOSEN AS PRESIDENT BY THE TRILATERALS For those who are able to read between the lines, Brzezinski has never made a secret of the fact that he personally chose Carter as the Trilateral candidate for president in 1976. As Br zezinski writes in his book Power and Principal: Memoirs of the National Security Adviser 1977-1981 : “I first met Jimmy Carter at one of the early meetings of the Trilateral Commission, which I directed in the early 1970s. I remember discussing his membership with my two principal Trilateral Commission colleagues, Gerard Smith and George Franklin. We wanted a forward-looking Democratic Governor who would be congenial to the Trilateral perspective. Reubin Askew of Florida was mentioned as a logical candidate, but then one of them noted that Jimmy Carter, the newly elected Governor of Georgia, courageous on civil rights and reportedly a bright and upcoming Democrat, was interested in developing trade relations between his State of Georgia and the Common Market and Japan. I then said, ‘Well, he’s obviously our man,’ and George Franklin went down to Atlanta to explore his background further and came back enthusiastic. Jimmy Carter was invited to join and he accepted.” (Brzezinski 1985, p. 5) Carter had won office in Georgia as a segregationist and friend of arch-racist Lester Maddox, but the point is clear: Carter was the Trilateral choice for 1976. David Rockefeller of Chase Manhattan Bank and his associates had been the masterminds of the phony oil crisis detonated by Henry Kissinger’s Yom Kippur war in the Middle East in the autumn of 1973. Viewing the impact of this crisis, they then set about studying ways that artificial emergencies or scarcities of this sort could be used for the imposition of dictatorial and authoritarian rule. The actual research into these topics was assigned to academics like Brzezinski and his sidekick Samuel Huntington of Harvard. In the words of two investigative journalists, “In one of the earliest Trilateral Commission reports, ‘The Crisis of Democracy,’ published in 1975, Huntington demanded that democratic government be curbed in times of economic crisis. “We have come to recognize that there are potentially desirable limits to economic growth,” he stated. “There are also potentially desirable “limits to the indefinite extension of"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 192 political democracy”. . . . A government which lacks authority. . .will have little ability, short or cataclysmic crisis to impose on its people the sacrifice which may be necessary.” CARTER’S SCRIPT: THE CFR 1980s PROJECT Various accounts have attributed the Carter administration policy playbook to some smalltime lawyers, but the reality is that the Carter script came from a group of elite think tanks associated with Wall Street. “In 1973, the Council of Foreign Relations launched its ‘1980s Project,’ which it called the ‘largest single effort in our 55- year history.’ By its own account, the 1980s Project was aimed at “describing how world trends might be steered toward a particular desirable future outcome.” Zbigniew Brzezinski belonged to the 1980s Project’s governing body, and Samuel Huntington served on its coordinating group. Among the most important products of the project was ‘Alternatives to Monetary Disorder,’ by the late Fred Hirsch, senior adviser to the International Monetary Fund. Hirsch wrote: ‘A degree of controlled disintegration in the world of economy is a legitimate objective for the 1980s and may be in order. A central normative problem for the international economic order in the years ahead is how to ensure that the disintegration indeed occurs in a controlled way and does not rather spiral into damaging restrictionism.’ ‘Controlled disintegration’ became the policy of Jimmy Carter’s Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, whose high interest rates wrecked the U.S. industrial and farm base during the Carter and Reagan years.” (Kathleen Klenetsky and Herbert Quinde, “FEMA’s structure for fascist rule,” EIR , Nov 23, 1990) Even honest observers who do not understand the central fact that Carter was a puppet of the financiers of the Trilateral Co mmission have no doubt that this administration was a colossal failure. The journalist Haynes Johnson describes the Carter presidency as a “tragedy” in his book In the Absence of Power . In Carter’s speeches and actions, we can see the hand of his partially cloaked Trilateral masters, and gain insight into what genocidal bankers like David Rockefeller actually think and what their real program includes today. The Carter presidency had many stumbling blocks. Among them was an aggressive and imperialist foreign policy that depended on blatant meddling in the internal affairs of sovereign states under the guise of concern about human rights. The second, reflecting the dominant role of Brzezinski, was a course towards confrontation with"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Catastrophic Presidency of Trilateral Puppet Jimmy Carter 193 the Soviet Union in Iran, Afghanistan, and over the question of limited nuclear war in such places as central Europe. Another fatal defect of the Carter presidency was a commitment to a Malthusian, zero growth, and neo-Luddite energy policy that rejected nuclear power out of hand on the domestic front and sought to sabotage peaceful nuclear development worldwide as a means of perpetuating dependence on the oil and coal controlled by the US-UK, while betting the future of the United States on such technologically backward options as coal-fired power plants and a Synthetic Fuels Corporation. Carter posed as an outsider who wanted to reform the corruption of the Washington fleshpots, and at the same time as the high priest of the presidency as a civic religion based on austerity and sacrifice. Scholars of the Carter presidency have concluded that he “told the American people what they did not want to hear — that they would have to renounce their profligate lifestyles.” (Kaufman 1) Here we see a clear foreshadowing of an Obama presidency, which will demand painful sacrifices from working families in the name of global warming, a wholly unproven hypothesis which appeals to the Malthusian instincts of rich elitists and oligarchs worldwide. CARTER AS US BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATOR Carter, like Obama, promised to end the partisan haggling in the Congress and in Washington generally. Carter felt that he was morally superior to the Congress, with its atmosphere of horse trading, long rolling, pork barrels, and earmarks. But in doing this, he courted his own worst defeats. During his time in office, Carter enjoyed a congressional majority for the Democratic Party of two to one in the House of Representatives, and of three to two in the Senate. Nevertheless he was constantly squabbling with Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill and other Democratic congressional leaders. As Burton I. Kaufman has pointed out, “... For better or worse, there is a political process in any system of representative government which no leader can simply ignore on the basis of being above the fray....” Carter imagined that he was a tribune of the entire American people and that he embodied the national interest. Naturally, the Congress had other ideas. Congress was intent on re-asserting itself after the outrageous abuses of the Nixon presidency – the same thing that the self-styled uniter Obama would face in a Democratic Congress eager to reverse the destructive precedents of the Bush regime. Some scholars have pointed out that even if Carter had been the legitimate tribune of the"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 194 people that he claimed to be, this was all the more reason “to operate in a tandem-institutions world,” meaning to work closely with Congress. Some historians of the Carter years have suggested that Carter wanted to act as a trustee of the interests of the American people, or perhaps as a “common cause monarch.” (Jones, passim) It would be more accurate to describe him as a kind of bankruptcy administrator and austerity enforcer running the country after the dollar collapse of August 15, 1971 in the interests of the creditors like David Rockefeller, in much the same way that Felix Rohatyn (another Obama backer today) in 1975 became the virtual dictator of the City of New York under the Mutual Assistance Corporation. Today, Obama claims that he will be able to float like a seraph above the nasty fray of partisan haggling going on on Capitol Hill. The traumatic experience of the Carter years suggests that this is pure utopia, as long as the Congress exists as a co-equal branch of government with decisive control over the power of the purse and taxation, where real economic and political interests inevitably clash by day and night, and all the more so now that the pie is shrinking. The main innovation offered by Obama in this context is that he proposes to establish national harmony and suppress partisan bickering by an almost mystical process centering on the beatific and transfiguring powers of his own personality. As Paul Krugman has pointed out, the Obama campaign is indeed a personality cult with a strong dose of venom thrown in for those who do not appreciate the candidate’s magical appeal. HUMPHREY: ANTI-WASHINGTON IS THE NEW RACISM Carter, like Obama, marketed himself as someone who stood apart from the government in Washington, rejected its prevalent values, and proposed to reform it from top to bottom. Both candidates have devoted a special blather about the prevalence of special interests in the capital. This is an obvious form of demagogy with highly destructive implications for any notion of activist government or maintenance of the social safety net. Even Hubert Humphrey in 1976 was lucid enough to point out that “candidates who make an attack on Washington are making an attack on government programs, on blacks, on minorities, on the cities. It’s a disguised new form of racism, a disguised new form of conservatism.” (Leuchtenburg 11) This is of course a good diagnosis of the monetarist-Friedmanite demagogy of Ronald Reagan in 1980 – or of Ron Paul today. But it was pioneered before Reagan by Carter."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Catastrophic Presidency of Trilateral Puppet Jimmy Carter 195 Carter, like Obama, presented himself as a leader with the capacity to transcend the conventional left-right spectrum. In reality, Carter belonged to the center-right, and much of his patina of newness was achieved by his treacherous and deliberate abandonment of the FDR New Deal tradition of the Democratic Party. But his rhetoric was able to delude left liberals into believing that they were dealing with a novel historical phenomenon. Carter’s speech writer, James Fallows, later commented: “I felt that he, alone among the candidates, might look past the tired formulas of left and right and offer something new.” Today, Fallows is an editor for the Atlantic Monthly , one of the leading bastions of Obamaphilia. A celebrated definition of the essence of politics offered by Harold D. Lasswell states that politics boils down to “who gets what, when, how.” (Jones 2) This political recipe inevitably clashes with the greed of austerity-minded bankers in an economic breakdown crisis. Carter and Obama agree that this is a scandal, and this holier-than-thou attitude marks both of them as apolitical or anti-political politicians, fundamentally incompatible with representative government which must always justify its existence and legitimacy by providing some kind of amelioration and progress in the standard of living and general living conditions of the people. For Carter and Obama, government that wins support by delivering the goods – technically called eudaemonic legitimation – is inherently corrupt, and replaced by some set of mystical values which, upon closer examination, generally tend to reflect the interests of financiers and other oligarchs. CARTER’S 1966 NERVOUS BREAKDOWN AS PREREQUISITE FOR RELIABLE PUPPET STATUS Part of Carter’s basic equipment for the presidency in the eyes of his Trilateral Commission sponsors was a 1966 nervous breakdown suffered after he had come in third in the race for governor of his home state of Georgia. According to Kaufman, Carter “fell into a deep depression, which was lifted only by the solace he found as a born-again Christian.” (Kaufman, p. 8) Questions about mental health caused Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton, McGovern’s first choice for vice president, to be forced off the Democratic ticket in 1972 in the midst of a firestorm of negative publicity. Similar questions were raised about Michael Dukakis in 1988 when it became known that he, too, had suffered a bout of prolonged depression after an election defeat. Qualified mental health experts have suggested that George W. Bush suffers from severe cognitive impairment as a"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 19 6 result of youthful cocaine, marijuana, and alcohol abuse, and published reports have suggested that he is kept going from day to day with a cocktail of psychotropic medications. Obama, like Bush, offers some obvious symptoms of megalomania; one trait they share is the extreme reluctance to exhibit any moment of self-criticism, as shown by Obama in his response to the Jeremiah Wright revelations. This disturbing pattern makes it absolutely mandatory that all candidates for the presidency disclose their full medical records, including HIV test results, as well as records of any and all mental health treatments, including shock treatments, they may have received. This is the minimum that must be demanded of persons who wish to become the custodians of the thermonuclear button in a time of aggravated world crisis. Not even Obama should be exempt from this requirement, which must be imposed by an aroused public opinion. The establishment financiers are known to prefer presidents whose weakness and subservience are guaranteed by previous psychological traumas which make it difficult or impossible for the president in question to undertake decisive actions against the wishes of his handlers and backers. These financiers prefer a chief executive who is too weak to break out of the prison which envelopes him. CARTER, LIKE OBAMA, STARTED OFF PLAYING THE RACE CARD In order to become governor of Georgia in 1970, Carter assumed the profile of a racist, attacking school busing, supporting segregated private schools, and signaling a willingness to collaborate with George Wallace, the infamously racist governor of neighboring Alabama. (Obama, needing a political base in Chicago, chose the church of Jeremiah Wright, a purveyor of the Ford Foundation- supported black liberation theology, a racist counterinsurgency ideology designed to pit black against white and keep both subjected to the financiers.) As governor of Georgia, Carter stressed radical environmentalism and austerity in the form of zero based budgeting, a favorite gambit of the Wall Street bond holders who want to make sure that they are not taxed for the general welfare, and that such tax revenue as does get collected goes into their own pockets via debt service on state bonds, and not into the social programs they despise. In May 1971, Carter got his picture on the cover of Time magazine, indicating that he had already attracted sympathetic attention of the Luce-Skull and Bones Faction. During these years, Carter assembled"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Catastrophic Presidency of Tr ilateral Puppet Jimmy Carter 19 7 his insider clique, later known as the Georgia Mafia, composed of Hamilton Jordan, Jody Powell, Pat Caddell, Charles Kirbo and Dr. Peter Bourne.

(Obama’s kitchen cabinet is even worse than Carter’s: here we find the ultra-left racist provocateur Jeremiah Wright, the bisexual Weatherman terrorist bomber Bill Ayers, the deranged Manson groupie Bernardine Dohrn, and the underworld figure Tony Rezko. Here, if ever, was a feast for Karl Rove’s GOP attack machine.) CARTER: STUDIOUSLY VAGUE Carter started planning his campaign in 1972, just after his failed attempt to become George McGovern’s vice presidential running mate. He began with the intention of capitalizing on the general distrust of government and politicians that existed on all levels of American society during the Nixon years. But at the same time, Carter carefully avoided any specific commitments on programs or measures to be implemented in favor of the American people: as Kaufman points out, “where ever he traveled, Carter remained intentionally vague on the issues....” (Kaufman 12) Carter’s main selling point was that the United States government had to reflect the decency and honesty of the American people. Carter possessed a disarming and folksy personal charm, which contrasted very favorably with the excesses and arrogance of Nixon. Obama, playing off popular disgust with the arrogant, thieving, and incompetent Bush administration, repeats a mantra of hope, change, unity, and moving beyond old divisions; he attempts to project the illusion of an approach that is both post-partisan and post-racial, to say nothing of post-political. CARTER’S STUMP STYLE: BETWEEN A CAMP MEETING AND HYPNOTISM The veteran journalist Jules Witcover evoked the mood of the early Carter campaign in Iowa and New Hampshire in the following terms: Carter “... Combined an easy, warm, personal style with an icy, resolute determination, a kind of soft-sell evangelism that one adherence across the ideological spectrum. There was almost a hypnotic quality to his stump technique. He spoke very softly, in the rush of words that obliged his audiences to listen closely. In all he"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 198 said, he punctuated his remarks with frequent ingratiating smiles and expressions of affection. The word “love,” awkward coming from the mouth of the commonplace politician was used by Carter as if it were a natural neighborly embrace with baffling effect. ‘I want the government,’ he would intone to his rapt audiences in a quiet, deliberate cadence, ‘that is as good, and honest, and decent, and truthful, and fair, and competent, and idealistic, and compassionate, and is filled with love as are the American people.’ He recited this sequence almost as if it were his personal rosary, and, in crowd after crowd, it worked. Then, having given the assembled this layman’s benediction, he would descend among them, smiling benignly, this peanut-farmer Billy Graham, and put his hands upon them, and in the process commit them thoroughly. From these personal political baptisms came a small army of dedicated supporters who defied ideological classification, united in their conviction that ‘Jimmy’ — everybody called him that — would restore harmony, and peace, and honesty, and decency, and compassion, and, yes, love, to government.” Carter had “an almost missionary quality: no soul was not worth saving, nor beyond redemption, if only Carter persisted. And so persist he did, almost with a vengeance and, beyond that, with an unshakable conviction of right.” (Witcover 210-211) The messianic and religious overtones of the Carter campaign are evident enough. Carter was in fact the first self-described born-again Christian to be elected to the presidency, and he attracted the support of many Christian evangelicals, although many of these turned against him during his tenure in office and went over to the reactionary Moral Majority of Jerry Falwell. In a very real sense, the right wing orientation of the Christian evangelical movement in the late 20th century grows out of an abreaction against Carter. Carter was also famous for his tactic of feigning interest in each voter as a discrete individual, rather than a member of the masses. As Witcover pointed out, “Carter dealt... on an intensely personal level that was a big part of his effectiveness: he would listen long, no matter who was talking to him, important politician or crackpot on the street... Carter’s opponents in Iowa soon found out that the Good Shepherd was going to be no pushover... He would call on a farmer in the morning, talk for a while, stay for lunch, then come by again a few weeks later. If the farmer wasn’t home, he would leave a handwritten note pinned to the front door that said: ‘Just dropped by to say hello. Jimmy.’ Many such visits were followed by telephone"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Catastrophic Presidency of Trilateral Puppet Jimmy Carter 199 calls or notes of thanks... Carter and his wife and children pursued this retail campaigning....” And further: “From the beginning, in Iowa, his campaign was oriented to the individual voter; the premise was that if he could ignite a spark with the people, the press would have to come around. Supporters once made remained supporters, because they were not simply supporters made, but friends made. And not only Carter engaged in this Good Shepherd exercise; his wife, Rosalynn, his sons, and his sister, Ruth Stapleton, a sexy blonde mother who was also a professional evangelist, all worked Iowa like some foreign mission whose natives had not found salvation, but only needed to hear the word....” Obama would seem to represent an adjustment of these techniques for a target population that is more heavily impacted by the smorgasbord of trendy New Age spirituality, while Carter was of the older, Elmer Gantry school. “In Iowa and subsequent 1976 political battlegrounds, Jimmy Carter not only witnessed to voters about his Christian faith but about his faith in the nation and the American people. And when he left, he had organized his own church of political believers, thoroughly committed to him, willing to work with a zest and dedication approaching his own. And like a missionary so convinced of the Word that he was confident his new church would stand against all manner of secular pressures, Jimmy Carter openly disdained the demands of the infidel press that he speak in specifics, that he say exactly what his general proposals would do, would cost. He asked the voters the same ‘leap of Faith’ that is at the core of religious belief, and to a remarkable degree they gave it to him.” (Witcover 211, 212, 222, 223) Here the necessary link between a lack of programmatic specifics on the one hand, and a messianic and utopian rhetoric on the other, is clearly pointed up. GNOSTICISM IN POLITICS The common messianic themes of Carter and Obama raise the question of Gnosticism in politics. Both of these politicians of the Trilateral Commission are associated with the promise that their candidacies will help to realize on earth the kinds of millenarian events or values which are traditionally associated with notions of Paradise. Carter suggested that voting for him would establish the rain of decency and truth and love over Washington, DC. Obama, working on a more jaded target group in a more sophisticated postmodern idiom, similarly implies that putting him in power will cause the lion to lie down with the lamb when the bitterly contending lobbyists and special interests representatives in the capital are bathed"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 200 in the transfiguring power of his personality. The core idea is that purely secular politics can bring about miraculous transformations reserved by traditional religion for the life of the world to come, be it paradise or nirvana, not the fallen world in which we live as mortals. Both Carter and Obama can thus be associated with a kind of ersatz or civic religion which invites comparison with the utopian and millenarian promises made by the totalitarian movements of the mid- 20th century. GAMING THE IOWA CAUCUS OF 1976 Carter, especially in his exceptionally thorough below the radar preparations for the 1976 Iowa caucus, was the first president to successfully and systematically game the emerging system of primaries and caucuses by which the Democratic Party would henceforth choose its presidential nominees. These primaries and caucuses are doubtless to be preferred to the smoke-filled room of yesteryear, but they also bring their own peculiar problems. The Democratic primary electorate is skewed in favor of affluent suburbanites, liberal ideologues, and Malthusian-Luddite activists. The party’s working-class base among blue-collar strata and trade unionists has correspondingly declined, with many of them bolting to become Reagan Democrats when the self-righteous environmentalist austerity and ultra-left social-cultural preoccupations inside the Democratic Party became too suffocating. In 1976, Carter, using techniques that seem elementary today, successfully manipulated the newly emerging system of caucuses and primaries with its McGovern-Fraser gender-conscious and multicultural rules. As one analyst of the Carter campaign has pointed out, “following their tumultuous convention in 1968, the Democrats enacted many democratizing reforms in their presidential nominating process. One major result was the increase in the number of delegates selected by presidential primaries and committed to candidates. In 1952 there were 17 primaries that selected 46% of the delegates and committed 18% of them to candidates. Not much had changed by 1968 when the same number of primaries selected 49% and committed 36% of the delegates. The system was then reformed, and in 1976 there were 29 primaries that selected 75% and co mmitted 66% of the delegates. Clearly, the advantage in 1976 would go to a candidate whose strategy and resources were directed to an open process of delegate selection that reduced the role of party leaders.... Increasing the number of primaries has the effect of handicapping late"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Catastrophic Presidency of Trilateral Puppet Jimmy Carter 201 entrance.” (Jones 19) Carter was able to game the system by frontloading his campaign in Iowa, concentrating on the recruitment of dedicated party activists and ideologically committed supporters who could be relied on to turn out for the lengthy and inconvenient caucus process. A win in Iowa could then be parlayed (with the help of a complicit press whose palms had been greased by Trilateral gold) into a slingshot effect, allowing Carter to arrive in New Hampshire with more momentum than any of the other candidates. The 1976 process of gaming by Carter appears in retrospect as rather simple, compared to the elaborate strategy used in 2007-2008 by Obama. Obama has notoriously focused his efforts on caucuses in Republican or borderline states, to which the unrealistic and dysfunctional Democratic Party rules give an importance out of all proportion to their actual role in regard to the Electoral College. Obama has tended to win primaries and caucuses in Republican states which he could never hope to carry in the general election. But the sheer numbers of such meaningless victories have tended to drown out the central fact of the primary season, which is that Mrs. Clinton defeated her opponent by a 10% margin in the all-important Electoral College megastate of California, traditionally the one that shows the rest of the country its own future. Obama would appear to have a cynical gaming strategy for grabbing the Democratic nomination, but winning the general election in November is a very different matter, in which Obama may find himself facing insuperable difficulties if he ever gets that far. CARTER AND OBAMA: RUNNING TO THE RIGHT OF THE COMPETITION Some observers noticed that Carter was running well to the right of the other Democratic presidential candidates that year, in a Democratic Party that was still deeply influenced by the Roosevelt New Deal and the better moments of the Lyndon B. Johnson Great Society. Today, it is hardly a secret that Obama has been running to the right of Senator Clinton, and ran far to the right of the economic populist John Edwards. Carter found that his rejection of the New Deal and the Great Society was something of an embarrassment, and attempted to avoid the issue. Obama’s supporters do the same thing today. The Daily Kos, dominated by a person who has admitted that he was once a CIA trainee, and who continues to admire the CIA as a humanitarian organization dedicated to world stability, has instructed its gullible readers that the entire question of centrism versus"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 202 liberalism “misses the mark” in today’s Democratic Party debates. Cass R. Sunstein is a University of Chicago Law Professor and adviser to Obama who argues that Obama transcends the usual ideological continuum and must be placed above it as a “visionary minimalist... Willing to think big and to endorse significant departures from the status quo — but [who prefers] to do so after accommodating, learning from, and bringing on board a variety of different perspectives.” Obama offers a more recent example of a cynical and consummate strategy to successfully game the unrealistic rules installed by accretion in the Democratic Party nominating process over the years. After virtually living in Iowa for about two years, Carter came in first in the Iowa caucus with about 28% of the vote, topping a field that included Birch Bayh and Governor George Wallace. Carter was then able to parlay the Iowa momentum into a win in New Hampshire. An important success for Carter came when he defeated Wallace in the state of Florida. But in Massachusetts, Carter came in fourth. He won in Illinois and North Carolina, but was badly beaten in New York, and barely managed to take Wisconsin. Carter was able to win in Pennsylvania, but was defeated in such vital states as California and New Jersey. On the whole, Carter’s performance, though weak in itself, appears to be stronger than that of Obama, who has failed to take any of the electoral vote mega-states except for his own home base of Illinois. Every now and then, Carter’s racist past broke through the carefully cultivated veneer of his new Trilateral political persona. At one point he told reporters that he had “nothing against” an ethnically-based community “trying to maintain the ethnic purity of their neighborhoods.” (Kaufman 13) Jesse Jackson found that Carter’s reference to ethnic purity made the Georgia governor “a throwback to Hitlerian racism.” Mayor Richard Hatcher of Gary Indiana called Carter a “Frankenstein monster with a Southern drawl.” (Kaufman 14) Carter was also foolish enough to give an interview to Playboy magazine in which he confessed that he had committed adultery in his heart many times by lusting after women. As we will doubtless see with Obama, any candidate whose political project is so strongly dependent upon his own supposed personal magnetism is likely to be vulnerable to the narcissistic erotic self- indulgence of the megalomaniac. In Obama’s case, the Larry Sinclair revelations suggest that possible partners would evidently include men as well as women."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Catastrophic Presidency of Trilateral Puppet Jimmy Carter 203 CARTER: “I’LL NEVER LIE TO YOU,” PRELUDE TO CYNICISM Carter continued to proclaim his own qualities of openness, truthfulness, and morality, going so far as to formally promise that he would never lie to the American people. “I’ll never lie to you,” he intoned hundreds of times. It is an impossible standard. This is of course the kind of utopian idealism which inevitably leads to corresponding cynicism once these impossible promises have been betrayed, as they must be in the world of practical politics. Realistic voters are more concerned about securing an improving standard of living for themselves and their children, rather than attempting to purge the universe of sin. Rather than stress specific solutions to urgent economic problems, Carter preferred to pontificate about the superiority of his principles and his general value system. Like Obama today, Carter was a process-oriented candidate, concerned far more with methods than results. Compare this with decadent socialite Caroline Kennedy’s endorsement of Obama at UCLA, where she announced that “It’s rare to have a candidate who can help us believe in ourselves and tie that belief to the highest ideals.” THE FUZZINESS ISSUE Like Obama, Carter’s successfully inveigled many voters into supporting him through a posture of studied vagueness. “On a range of issues, he showed all the elusiveness of the scat back. In time, that very slipperiness would become one of the most effective issues against him — the ‘fuzziness issue — but it took his foes, and the press, months to fully identify it and brand it for more effective tracking.” (Witcover 239) When Carter joined combat with the Republican nominee Gerald Ford, this systematic vagueness became a major issue in the campaign, with Ford constantly harping on Carter’s lack of specificity and “fuzziness.” Observers marveled at Carter’s ability to fuse contradictions and reconcile opposites to produce a singular assortment of “unified ambiguities and ambiguous unities,” as C. Vann Woodward put it. (Kaufman 16) One of Ford’s favorite lines against Carter was: “He wavers, he wanders, he wiggles, and he waffles, and he shouldn’t be president of the United States.” This would fit Obama remarkably well, but such lèse majesté would elicit accusations of sacrilege from the left liberal acolytes who guard the shrine of the Perfect Master."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 204 The Wall Street Journal in July 1976 focused on Carter’s lack of clarity on the issues as a main factor in public confusion about what he represented. Carter lacked any coherent ideology, this newspaper argued. Here Carter was described as a candidate who promised love and healing and wanted to be “all things to all people,” with a campaign that was “studiously vague on the substance of government.” (Rozell 14) Time magazine saw in Carter a “grab bag political personality that offers something for almost everyone.” Carter was a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma wrapped up with a question mark. After Carter had won the presidency the Wall Street Journal editorial was entitled “A Change, but What Kind?” — a direct anticipation of Obama’s mantra of vagueness, and of the kind of real political problem this represents once such a candidate enters the White House. Like Carter, Obama poses as a non-ideological, non-doctrinaire candidate: “I don’t think he’s wedded to any ideological frame,” comments a source. With Obama, there is only the man himself — his youth, his ease, his race, his claim on the new century. His candidacy is essentially a plea for voters to put their trust in his innate capacity for clarity and judgment. There is no Obama-ism, only Obama. (See “Destiny’s Child,” Rolling Stone , Feb. 22, 2008) The young Mussolini argued that fascism rejected programs, since there were already too many of them. The fascist program, he argued, was simple – to govern Italy. Mussolini pointed to the quality of his men, not to any specific promises, as the best guarantee of the outcome. THE CORPORATE MEDIA GAVE CARTER A FREE PASS On the whole, the controlled corporate media were at first exceedingly favorable to Carter, whom they regarded as a breath of fresh air after the suffocating paranoia and exclusionary measures of the Nixon years. During the 1976 New Hampshire primary, it was evident that the controlled corporate media were favoring Carter. As Witcover notes, “...in Carter’s case a chartered bus now followed him, carrying his large press contingent. By such signs are winners and prospective winners gauged.” (Witcover 239) Carter enjoyed a preponderance of positive coverage, just as Obama does today: “In early 1977 the journalistic reviews of Carter’s symbolic activities and political rhetoric were highly favorable. Journalists portrayed Carter as a ‘great communicator’ seeking to establish his leadership by building public support through symbolic activities.” (Rozell 7)"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Catastrophic Presidency of Trilateral Puppet Jimmy Carter 205 But even Carter never enjoyed anything approaching the unprecedented hysterical media swoon carried out by the fawning journalists of the controlled corporate media who chose in late 2007 and early 2008 to join the media whores for Obama. The adulation and immunity to all investigative journalism and criticism which have been vouchsafed to Obama are so extreme that he may experience a severe psychological shock once this controlled environment is broken, and this fantasy world comes crashing down. This may be happening with the Jeremiah Wright revelations, which have caused some fits of stammering and stuttering by the previously mellifluous candidate. It will be even worse if the collapse of the fantasy world built up by the media around Obama comes at some future moment when the reality of world economic depression and/or superpower confrontation reasserts itself. Under these circumstances, Obama could experience a nervous breakdown. CARTER NEEDED VOTE FRAUD IN OHIO TO SEIZE POWER Carter would never have entered the White House without the help of systematic vote fraud, especially concentrated in the key battleground state of Ohio. There were reports that Walter Mondale, Carter’s vice president show running mate, had told his supporters to “vote early, vote often” on Election Day. Obama prefers to have his opponents destroyed by carefully orchestrated and timed scandals. One of Carter’s biggest handicaps in the White House was that the new Democratic Congress, energized by many new members, was interesting in reasserting its constitutional prerogatives in the wake of the Watergate scandal and the oppressive Nixon years. That mood can be expected to prevail on Capitol Hill starting in January 2009 as well, when Congress will try to re-assert itself after the end of the Bush nightmare. Among other things, there will be a long backlog of patronage requests which Obama is likely to considered as corrupt and beneath his seraphic dignity. Just as Carter was on a collision course with his own party in Congress because of his claim to represent the honesty and probity of the collective will, so Obama is headed for grave difficulties when he attempts to assert the primacy of hope over the need of every legislator to bring home the bacon and the patronage jobs to his or her own state or district. Many of Carter’s supporters, especially among trade unionists and blue-collar strata, had come to regard the Nixon years as a kind of aberration which could now be set aside in favor of a return to the"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 20 6 Johnson Great Society. They expected that Carter would restart the war on poverty, increase programs for the working poor, and undertake an array of other social reforms. But Carter had heeded the advice of crackpot futurologist Alvin Toffler who called on Democrats in 1975 to “throw out all the old New Deal claptrap,” and of elitist Gary Hart, who raved in 1976 that “the New Deal has run its course. The party is over. The pie cannot continue to expand forever.” (Leuchtenburg 18) As soon as Carter got into office, it was evident that he was hostile to new social spending, and that he wanted to balance the budget on the backs of the poor, as demanded by his right-wing economic advisers such as Blumenthal. In late 1978, Carter launched what amounted to a national austerity program involving draconian cuts in programs designed to combat poverty. “We look heartless,” said Vice President Mondale. But Carter paid more attention to pro-Wall Street ideologues like Alfred Kahn who blurted out after the administration had been thrown out of office: “I’d love the Teamsters to be worse off. I’d love the automobile workers to be worse off.” Carter began the process of dismantling the New Deal state in favor of the unlimited domination of the “market,” meaning in reality monopolies, oligopolies, cartels, and Wall Street predators in general. It was under Carter that the disastrous process of deregulation of oil and gas, airlines, banks, communications, railroads, trucking, and public utilities got into high gear, creating the future potential for Enron, WorldCom, Global Crossing, Adelphia, and the mess we see before us today. These tendencies of Carter doomed his attempt at reelection in 1980, when even one of his supporters had to admit, “he often seems unduly concerned with appeasing right-wingers, not realizing that it’s all but impossible to outflank the Reaganites [on the right] without coming out for child labor, apartheid, and the Great White Fleet.” (Leuchtenburg 14) ARTHUR SCHLESINGER JR.: CARTER NOT A DEMOCRAT Many contemporaries saw Carter as a Democrat who thought like a Republican. Historian Arthur Schlesinger, who had been an aide to President Kennedy, took the judgment further in 1980 when he wrote that, “the reason for Carter’s horrible failure in economic policy is plain enough. He is not a Democrat — at least in anything more recent than the Grover Cleveland sense of the word.” For Schlesinger, Carter was “an alleged Democrat” who had “won the presidency with demagogic attacks on the horrible federal"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Catastrophic Presidency of Tr ilateral Puppet Jimmy Carter 20 7 bureaucracy and as president made clear in the most explicit way his rejection of... affirmative government.... But what voters repudiated in 1980 was not liberalism but the miserable result of the conservative economic policies of the last half dozen years.” (Leuchtenburg 17) Obama seems to be expressing the same intent when he praises the right-wing reactionary Reagan: “I don’t want to present myself as some sort of singular figure. I think part of what’s different are the times...I think Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not. He put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it. I think they felt like with all the excesses of the 1960s and 1970s government had grown and grown but there wasn’t much sense of accountability in terms of how it was operating. I think people, he just tapped into what people were already feeling, which was we want clarity we want optimism, we want a return to that sense of dynamism and entrepreneurship that had been missing.” ( Reno Gazette Journal , Jan. 17, 2008) Mark well that what Obama is talking about here is the process of the demolition and destruction of the New Deal state, the most effective form of human organization yet devised, which was begun under Carter and consummated under Reagan. Obama is known to be considering Republican like Hagel and Lugar for the vice presidency and the Pentagon. ( London Times , March 2, 2008) Obama also promises a foreign policy in which Republican elements will predominate: “The truth is that my foreign policy is actually a return to the traditional bipartisan realistic policy of George Bush‘s father, of John F. Kennedy, of, in some ways, Ronald Reagan,” Obama told his supporters at a rally in Greensburg, Pennsylvania on March 28, 2008, according to an AP wire that day. Between a real Republican and a fake Republican, they’ll vote for the Republican every time. OBAMA AS BLANK SLATE AND RORSCHACH TEST: NO MANDATE Perhaps even more than Carter, Obama has been described as a blank slate upon which voters are invited to project their own fondest hopes, dreams, and aspirations. Some observers have described Obama as a kind of political Rorschach test, with the voter being invited to decide what kind of an image is really being shown. This can work well enough in gathering votes, but once such a candidate"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 208 enters the White House, he or she inevitably encounters the problem of a wide range of strong but contradictory expectations among duped voters who now expect their dreams and aspirations to become reality. Once the newly elected president is forced to act, it is inevitable that the large majority of voters will find that the dreams and aspirations they thought were in the process of fulfillment are actually going to be cruelly discarded. This virtually guarantees a hangover of bitterness, resentment, and disillusionment in the first months of the new presidency. This is, in other words, a question of the new president’s mandate. A presidential candidate who makes specific promises and runs on an intelligible program of reform can actually educate the public and build consensus for what he or she wants to do. After taking power, such a president can claim the legitimacy of popular approval for his or her legislative agenda. The Carter-Obama method of vague and fuzzy aspirational campaigning means that there is no mandate or popular consensus for anything. Therefore, when the policies dictated by the bankers who actually control these puppet candidates begin to be implemented, the crisis of the new administration begins almost immediately. A good example is the fact that Carter talked most of all in his election campaign about the need to address the problem of unemployment, which was then rapidly rising. But once he got into the White House, he suddenly decided that inflation, and not the growing ranks of the jobless, was the real problem. This was of course the Wall Street view. Carter reached a peak approval rating of between 71% and 75% at the end of April 1977, just after he had completed his first hundred days in office. From then on, his approval ratings and personal popularity fell steadily and precipitously, interrupted only by an upward bump frequented by a crisis rallying reflex occasioned by the seizing of American hostages by the Khomeini regime in Iran in November 1979. Before long, Carter’s popularity rating had fallen to the lowest point in recorded history, lower than Truman, and lower than Nixon in the depths of the Watergate scandal. Carter touched 29% job approval several times between July and November 1979, and once reached a nadir of 28%. Bush the younger has since explored these depths. Obama may be able to challenge Harry S. Truman, who reached 22% job approval in February 1952."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Catastrophic Presidency of Trilateral Puppet Jimmy Carter 209 CARTER FLIP-FLOPS: INFLATION, NOT UNEMPLOYMENT AS TOP PRIORITY Mass unemployment is unquestionably the foremost issue discussed around the kitchen table by blue-collar working families. Carter’s abrupt reversal of field to make fighting inflation the top priority was in effect an attack on important groups inside his own electoral base. The trade unionists of the AFL-CIO had expected Carter to propose a $30 b illion public works program for 1977 to fight unemployment. When Carter threw this idea overboard, the unions began to rapidly turn against him. One can imagine the same thing befalling Obama. The same thing happened to Carter with the Democratic mayors, who wanted more help for the cities. The anti- inflation austerity campaign pleased Wall Street, but it was also a direct betrayal of Carter’s own Election Day coalition. Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill tried to convince Carter to defer to some extent to the needs of the legislative process in Congress, but Carter was obdurate in favor of austerity and sacrifice. Carter started his tenure in office by demanding the elimination of a large number of dam and water projects, which he placed on a porkbarrel hit list and which he touted as a means to fight waste in government. These 19 water projects represented jobs and economic modernization, but they did not fit the Trilateral outlook. Carter axed the water projects in a surprise attack, and the resentment from congressional Democrats was immense. Carter’s pose was always that he represented the purity of the national interest, while the Congress was a gang of hagglers, tainted and corrupt. Another early defeat for Carter came when he failed to secure confirmation Theodore Sorenson as CIA chief, largely because of a contemptuous refusal to coordinate with Democratic congressional leaders. We can already see Obama colliding with the Congress over the question of the earmarks in much the same way in 2009. OSTENTATIOUS DISLIKE FOR CONGRESSIONAL NEGOTIATING Like Carter, Obama cultivates a pose of holier-than-thou distaste for the operations of Congress. According to a recent profile, “Beyond his considerable charm, Obama can be righteous and cocky. He came to Washington pushing the hope that politics could be better — but now he can give the impression that he’d rather be just about anywhere other than in Washington. ‘It can be incredibly frustrating,’"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 210 he tells me. ‘The maneuverings, the chicanery, the smallness of politics here.’ Listening to a bloviating colleague [Could this be Biden? – WGT] at his first meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Obama slipped a three-word note to a member of his staff: ‘Shoot. Me. Now.’” (Ben Wallace Wells, Destiny’s Child, Rolling Stone , Feb. 22, 2008) This posturing is enough to doom any legislative agenda, especially one packed with austerity and sacrifice, as Obama’s is sure to be. CARTER’S ADMINISTRATIVE CHAOS All of Carter’s political problems were doubtless exacerbated by the endemic chaos that prevailed inside the White House. Carter had been the governor of a state of some size, and considered himself to be an expert in the administrative reform of government. But he long refused to appoint a White House Chief of Staff to manage the paper flow, and busied himself obsessively with the minutest details of government operations while neglecting questions of overall policy and strategy. He thought to some degree as an engineer, regarding every problem as susceptible to a technical or technocratic solution. He was offended when Congress wanted to haggle about his findings. Still, Carter had considerable executive experience. Obama by contrast has none whatsoever. What would a future Obama White House looked like? Would it be an anarchic chaos populated by multicultural extremists, Malthusian visionaries, and resurgent cold warriors with virtually no executive guidance, all dancing to the tune of powerful Wall Street interests? At this point, this seems to be the best guess, especially in light of what happened to Carter under the same puppet masters. ENERGY AUSTERITY THE MORAL EQUIVALENT OF WAR (MEOW) In a new expression of his contempt for his supposed allies on Capitol Hill, Carter insisted on developing an emergency energy program as a virtual covert operation inside the White House, without congressional input. On April 18, 1977, Carter made an address to the nation in which he referred to his energy program as “the moral equivalent of war.” Some noticed that the acronym for the slogan would be MEOW. Even so, Newsweek praised Carter as “a strong activist president” who “had seized the initiative on energy.” (Kaufman 33) If we delve into the details of Carter’s energy policy, we find an eerie and bizarre parallel to Obama today: both demand"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Catastrophic Presidency of Trilateral Puppet Jimmy Carter 211 and increased reliance on coal as an energy source, ignoring pollution even as they exclude any consideration of nuclear energy. In his speech that night, Carter argued: “If we wait, and do not act, then our factories will not be able to keep our people on the job with reduced supplies of fuel. Too few of our utilities will have switched to coal, our most abundant energy source....Because we are now running out of gas and oil, we must prepare quickly for a third change, to strict conservation and to the use of coal and permanent renewable energy sources, like solar power...Our energy plan will also include a number of specific goals, to measure our progress toward a stable energy system....” Among the goals that Carter wanted to reach by 1985 were the following: “Reduce the annual growth rate in our energy demand to less than two percent. Reduce gasoline consumption by ten percent below its current level. Cut in half the portion of United States oil which is imported, from a potential level of 16 million barrels to six million barrels a day. Establish a strategic petroleum reserve of one billion barrels, more than six months’ supply. Increase our coal production by about two thirds to more than 1 billion tons a year.” This emphasis on increased use of coal prefigures a similar policy advocated by Obama in blatant contradiction to his other claims to be the most environmentally sure candidate in the Democratic field. The Washington Post of January 10, 2008 carried an article detailing Obama’s strong and consistent s upport for measures to increase the use of coal in US energy production, with special emphasis on coal liquefaction, which has been condemned as an obsolete technology. Obama was of course pandering to southern Illinois coal mining interests, which he in reality represents on this issue, although this relationship is covered by the usual cloak of hypocrisy. A sane environmental policy focused on human needs would attempt to deemphasize the use of coal as a source of energy, while reserving coal deposits for use in petrochemical production. Only the most dramatic technological breakthroughs could promote coal to the front rank of energy sources. The close parallels between Carter’s coal- based energy policies in the Obama campaign of today can help provide new evidence as to be puppet masters of these two candidates. It is evident that Wall Street, from David Rockefeller in the 1970s to such figures as Felix Rohatyn and Warren Rudman today, is committed to a labor intensive, low technology energy policy based on coal, coal gasification, coal liquefaction, and synthetic fuels."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 212 During his presidential campaign, Carter had railed against Secretary of State Henry Kissinger for his notorious practice of secret diplomacy, and for his thinly veiled contempt for the moral values of the American people. Carter’s own foreign policy was to be administered by Trilateral Commission founder Zbigniew Brzezinski, a revanchist and reactionary Polish aristocrat who soon pushed aside the nominal Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance. Brzezinski was a well- known anti-Soviet cold warrior and hawk, and his presence in the critical NSC post was an ominous sign of disastrous events to come. Carter aroused right-wing resentments by his advocacy of the Panama Canal Treaty in 1977. Carter stated that he would rather commit suicide than hurt Israel, but in practice he expected the Israelis to make concessions according to Brzezinski’s estimate of the needs of the US superpower position vis-à-vis the Soviets. Carter also began talking about a total withdrawal of US troops from South Korea, which at that point, with the unstable Kim Il Sung still in command, might easily have detonated a war in the Far East in which China and Japan might have become embroiled, which may have been what Brzezinski wanted. This notion of getting rid of rival powers by playing them one against the other is a hallmark of Brzezinski’s cynical and manipulative approach to foreign policy. BERT LANCE, LANCEGATE, AND CRONYISM Utopian and messianic aspirational rhetoric can have no greater deflator than a scandal centering on corruption in high places in government. In the case of Carter, the first scandal involved his best friend, Bert Lance, an Atlanta banker whom Carter had made head of the new Office of Management and Budget. Lance was accused of taking sweetheart loans based on his political position, and he was hounded out of office in September 1977. Carter had shown exceedingly poor judgment in attempting to defy public opinion by keeping his crony in government as long as possible, despite the firestorm of corruption charges. As Kaufman points out, “there seems little question that his support of Lance did irreparable harm to his administration. Even the president later conceded this point. Not only did the controversy distract the administration from more pressing domestic and foreign policy matters and helped poison relations with Congress, it undermined public trust in Carter, which he had worked so hard to foster and which was so essential to his success as president.” (Kaufman 63) If a politician becomes president after campaigning as an ordinary mortal, the inevitable instances of"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Catastrophic Presidency of Trilateral Puppet Jimmy Carter 213 corruption that will plague any administration can be taken in stride. But a candidate whose stock in trade is a messianic or utopian perspective like that of Carter and Obama finds the inevitable scandal to be especially damaging, since it is the delusion of purity which is being demolished. By the end of 1977, the media question du jour was, “can Carter cope?” Squabbling between the Carter administration and the Democratic Congress was pervasive. By February 1978, only 34% of the American people thought that Carter was doing an excellent or good job, which represented a 21% decline over six months. From this we might be able to conclude that the popularity of a future Obama presidency would begin to collapse in the late summer and early autumn of his first year in office. Naturally, the worldwide economic breakdown crisis of 2008-2009 is already far more serious than what Carter faced in 1977, so it is perfectly plausible that an Obama administration would collapse at an even more rapid rate. This time, the consequences might be much uglier than they were three decades ago. CARTER CREATED FEMA Carter was instrumental in setting up same of the key institutions needed for a US police state. One was the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA. “FEMA was established in March 1979 by presidential Review Memorandum 32, with the mandate to maintain ‘the continuity of government’ (COG) during a national security emergency. PRM 32 bypassed the U.S. Constitution, and awarded power to the unelected officials at the National Security Council to direct U.S. government operations by emergency decree. By placing FEMA under the NSC’s control, Huntington, Brzezinski, et al., turned the NSC into a shadow technocratic dictatorship, waiting for a real or manufactured crisis to seize control of the country.” (Kathleen Klenetsky and Herbert Quinde, “FEMA’s structure for fascist rule,” EIR , Nov. 23, 1990) In 1978, Carter increasingly turned his attention to foreign affairs. One of his obsessions was to prevent West Germany from building a nuclear reactor in Brazil, since this violated the Trilateral Commission policy of making third world countries depend either on oil from the Anglo-American controlled Middle East, or on coal, in which countries like the US, Canada, and Australia had a virtual world export monopoly. Then as now, nuclear energy meant national"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 214 independence and economic development not controlled by the Wall Street bankers. Carter’s biggest project of 1978 was the Camp David Accords between the Egypt of Anwar Sadat and the Israel of Menachem Begin. Although some observers claimed that Carter had dealt brusquely with the Israelis, the net effect of the Camp David Accords was to split the united front of Arab states, leaving an isolated Egypt to contend with an aggressive rejection front led by Iraq, Syria, and the other Arab states. This was of course the handiwork of Brzezinski. Beyond the fixed points of attempting to sabotage the industrial development of the Third World, and the quest for an anti-Soviet breakthrough, Carter’s policy appeared on the surface as incoherent, contradictory, and lacking in direction. But from the Trilateral point of view, it was largely coherent, although it could not be avowed in that form to the public. CARTER AND BRZEZINSKI INSTALL KHOMEINI IN IRAN By August 1978, there were clear signs of impending revolution in Iran. This was of course a CIA people power coup orchestrated by British intelligence, the BBC, and the CIA in order to overthrow the Shah and to install in power the Ayatollah Khomeini, whom Brzezinski supported in the context of his notorious policy that Islamic fundamentalism was the strongest bulwark against the danger of Soviet communism. Carter and Brzezinski betrayed the trust of their nominal ally, the Shah, with the help of US Ambassador William Sullivan. Their objections to the Shah did not revolve around his monstrous human rights abuses, but rather focused on the Shah’s attempts to make independent deals with Italy, other European countries, and the Soviets, for the purpose of accelerating the scientific, technological and industrial development of his country. This was a matter of naked power politics based on the Trilateral program of blocking Third World economic development at all costs — it was not a matter of human rights. After the Shah had departed from Iran in January 1979, Carter, Brzezinski and NATO commander Al Haig sent Haig’s deputy General Huyser to Tehran with the mission of overthrowing the moderate Bakhtiar government, blocking the possibility of a military coup or any other non-theocratic solution, and installing none other than Khomeini and his benighted s upporters. In Brzezinski’s view, Iran was destined to become a point from which Khomeini’s doctrines of Islamic fundamentalism would radiate out into the considerable Islamic population of the Soviet Union, preparing the"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Catastrophic Presidency of Trilateral Puppet Jimmy Carter 215 final downfall of communist rule. One immediate result of Khomeini’s seizure of power in Iran was a new fake oil crisis, with a 200% increase in energy prices. This constituted the second great oil hoax perpetrated on the world economy by the Anglo-American oil cartel and its Wall Street and City of London owners. Carter tended to attribute rising oil prices to an actual scarcity, rather than to the reality of oligopolistic machinations and price gouging. FAKE OIL CRISIS AND GAS LINES, JULY 1979 During June and July of 1979, many parts of the United States experienced a severe gasoline shortage. This quickly produced the shocking spectacle of long lines of automobiles waiting at service stations in the hopes of being able to buy gas. Normal economic activity was severely disrupted as commuters ran out of gas before they could reach their jobs. It was a scene of appalling chaos. Intelligent people realized that there was no absolute gasoline shortage, but rather a cynical strategy of the oil companies to create panic and hysteria as a way of getting up the price of gasoline into the ionosphere. There was growing contempt for Carter as a stooge and chump of the Rockefeller oil interests, as a president too weak and cowardly to facedown the malefactors of great wealth in the way that Kennedy had crushed the rapacious Roger Blough of US Steel. Carter would soon exacerbate the rage directed against them by attempting to blame the public, and not his own fecklessness, for the crisis situation was now engulfing the country. Will Obama react in a similar way? By mid-1978, Carter was again announcing that inflation was public enemy number one. He decided to abolish the tax deductible three martini lunch, earning the lasting enmity of businessmen all over the country. Some said that Carter governed more like a crusty old New England Puritan than the Southern Baptist that he claimed to be. For her part, Michelle Obama has promised sacrifice and forced changes in living standards if her husband gets to the White House. BRZEZINSKI PLAYS CHINA CARD AGAINST MOSCOW In early 1979, Carter and Brzezinski played their own version of the China card, breaking US diplomatic relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan and opening full-fledged diplomatic ties to Beijing. Brzezinski pressed for military cooperation between the United States and China. When Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping visited Carter in"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 21 6 Washington in January, the final US Chinese joint communiqué denounced “hegemony,” the Chinese propaganda term for Soviet expansionism. During this same visit, Deng told the Americans of his plan for a punitive military strike into Vietnam, and this occurred in February of that same year. It was evident that Brzezinski had given a green light to this reckless and adventurous move by the Chinese against a well-known ally of Moscow. During this same period, Brzezinski was supporting the Chinese backed Pol Pot regime in Cambodia, also against the Vietnamese. Not surprisingly, this emerging Sino-American block caused a backlash in Moscow, and the passage of the SALT II nuclear disarmament treaty was seriously impeded. All this is of course exactly what Brzezinski wanted. These events offer the merest hint of the kind of super power adventurism and brinksmanship that octogenarian Brzezinski can be relied upon to produce in his possible status as a controller of a future Obama administration. In fact, playing China against Russia in a Eurasian World War III is at the heart of Brzezinski’s designs for an Obama administration, and represents a ploy that is sure to blow up in his face. CARTER REGIME IMPLODES, JULY 1979 In the summer of 1979, the Carter regime for all intents and purposes imploded. If it had been a parliamentary government, it would have fallen. The occasion for this crisis was an address to the nation which Carter had announced for July 5, 1979, which he had billed in advance is one of the major addresses of his presidency. But just one day before he was to go on the air, Carter canceled this speech without any public justification. At this point, in one of the most extraordinary pieces of political theater in recent American history, Carter left the White House and took up residence for 11 days at his Camp David retreat, where he received a series of visits from business, government, labor, academic, and religious leaders. He made occasional sorties by helicopter to visit with average middle- class families in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, in a self-described bid to tap the pulse of the common man. Establishment figures including the Harrimanite Clark Clifford were brought in, and they roundly berated Carter for his lack of leadership. Carter’s pollster Pat Caddell argued that the problem United States was facing was a “crisis of spirit,” and that this was the issue that had to be solved before any progress on the energy front could be made."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Catastrophic Presidency of Tr ilateral Puppet Jimmy Carter 21 7 THE MALAISE AND ‘CRISIS OF SPIRIT’ SPEECH, JULY 15, 1979 Carter strongly espoused this “crisis of spirit” thesis and made it the centerpiece of his television address to the nation on July 15, 1979. This is the famous malaise speech which became the defining moment of Carter’s entire presidency. Carter argued that a solution to the energy crisis was vital for the future prospects of the American economy but that success depended on the American will. “We are at a turning point in our history,” Carter stated. “All the legislation in the world can’t fix what’s wrong with America. What is lacking is confidence and a sense of community.... Energy will be the immediate test of our ability to unite this nation.” (Kaufman 145) Here we see a clear note of utopian transcendence of the normal legislative and political process in the name of what amounts to a mystical goal. Observers pointed out that Carter’s oratorical delivery and voice inflection were more eloquent in this speech than in any previous address. Brutal energy austerity and price gouging, since that is what Carter was concretely proposing, were imbued with spiritual and transfiguring significance. This demagogic synthesis of mysticism and spiritualism in a Gnostic key in the service of bankers’ austerity is even more prominent in the Obama campaign of today. CARTER: BLAMING THE PUBLIC FOR HIS OWN INCOMPETENCE Many of the 100 million Americans who heard this speech came to the conclusion that the Carter administration was in effect berating and scapegoating the American people because of the incompetence and ineptitude of the Carter White House. Carter was in effect passing the buck to the public at large because he was unwilling to face the consequences of his own subservience to Wall Street and its doctrines of austerity and Malthusianism. Will Obama imitate Carter’s crude ploy of blaming the people for his own deception and treachery? For those who remember the Carter years, it would appear to be just a question of time. MICHELLE OBAMA’S VERSION OF MALAISE : “OUR SOULS ARE BROKEN” Carter’s central argument has been echoed in a slightly different context by Michelle Obama, the wife of the current Trilateral candidate for the presidency. Part of Michelle Obama’s standard"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 218 stump speech is a remark that we cannot fix the health care system until we have fixed Washington. Obama himself agrees: according to The Swamp, the politics blog of The Chicago Tribune , Mr. Obama says that to fix health care, “we have to fix Washington,” according to the New York Times online blog The Caucus. (Feb, 26, 2008) This begs the question of what is wrong with Washington. Michelle Obama’s answer generally goes like this: “Before we can fix our problems, we have to fix our souls,” Michelle Obama says repeatedly in her stump speech. ``Our souls are broken in this nation. We have lost our way. And it begins with leadership. It begins with inspiration. It begins with leadership. This race is about character. I am married to the only person in this race who has a chance of healing this Nation...And right now we need some inspiration. Inspiration and hope are not words. Everything begins and ends with hope. And the only person in this race who has a chance of getting us where we need to be is Barack Obama.” “We need a leader who’s going to touch our souls because you see, our souls are broken,” Michelle Obama stresses. “The change Barack is talking about is hard, so don’t get too excited because Barack is going to demand that you too be different.” We need to be inspired...to make the sacrifices that are needed to push us to a different place,” she repeats. “Dreaming does count. You need to dream to realize your possibilities.” It is important to call attention to the sinister hints in this demagogic performance that point towards a future of austerity and sacrifice of the American people. The American standard of living has by the best calculations been cut since the Eisenhower Kennedy era by something approaching two thirds. Any proposals for austerity and sacrifice inside the United States have obvious genocidal overtones against the American population, and can only serve the interests of the parasitical Wall Street bankers who bear the full responsibility for the present catastrophic world depression. It is these Wall Street banking and financial interests whom Obama obviously serves. BEYOND MALAISE : CARTER’S CABINET MASSACRE OF JULY, 1979 Two days after the infamous malaise speech had been broadcast, Carter provoked a total crisis of his own regime at the cabinet meeting of July 17, 1979 by demanding the resignation of all of his Cabinet secretaries and all of the senior members of the White House staff. This reckless and ill-considered action created a worldwide"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Catastrophic Presidency of Trilateral Puppet Jimmy Carter 219 impression that the United States government had descended into total chaos. In the words of White House spokesman Jody Powell, this July massacre had unleashed “semi-hysteria” among the White House staff and in the executive departments. The next day, Carter announced that he would accept the resignations of Energy Secretary James Schlesinger, Secretary of the Treasury Blumenthal, and Health Education and Welfare Secretary Califano. Shortly thereafter, Carter also announced the ouster of Transportation Secretary Brock Adams and Attorney General Griffin Bell. The big winner in the July massacre was Carter’s crude and incompetent crony Hamilton Jordan, who became White House Chief of Staff and Carter’s direct proxy in giving orders to the executive departments. VOLCKER’S 22% PRIME RATE DESTROYS US INDUSTRY In August 1979, Carter named longtime treasury official Paul Adolf Volcker to become a head of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Volcker promptly set about the systematic destruction of the United States’ remaining industrial base through a merciless process of interest rate hikes, soon reaching the astronomical level of a 22% prime rate. Volcker claimed that his policy was aimed at purging the economic system of inflationary tendencies, but the cure was far worse than the disease. The economic theory of John Maynard Keynes had been described as inflation as a remedy for economic depression. The Volcker method was sometimes called Keynesianism in reverse: this time it was self-imposed depression as a remedy for inflation. This monetarist insanity straight out of the Friedman-von Hayek playbook, more than any other single factor, destroyed the Carter regime. In January 1980, the consumer price index rose 14%, translating into an annual rate of 18.2% inflation, which was the highest level attained in six years. Wholesale prices for January 1980 were rising at a rate of 21% on a yearly basis. It was calculated that the purchasing power of an average wage worker living in a city declined by 1.4% during February 1980 alone. By March 1980 the prime rate touched 16.75%, and by April it was 18.5%. As a result of the Volcker high-interest policy, the two most important industries left in the American economy, housing and automobiles, virtually collapsed. Housing starts in March 1980 fell 42% from the rate of a year before; this was also the worst monthly decline in 20 years. The sharp decline in the housing industry ravaged the entire first quarter of 1980, generating a ripple effect in which building suppliers closed"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 220 their factories and laid off the remaining workers. Auto sales fell 24% compared to the previous year. Unemployment in Detroit was at 24%. By July 1980 the Labor Department reported 8.2 million unemployed, an increase of almost 2 million new jobless since February. The economic situation was so wretched that commentators began talking about a misery index, which consisted of the unemployment percentage added on to the yearly inflation rate. A new term had to be coined to describe the horrors of the Carter-Volcker Trilateral economic bust: this was stagflation, a combination of high unemployment and high inflation which had hitherto been sought theoretically impossible, but which Carter, Volcker and the Trilateraloids had succeeded in achieving. Between April and June 1980, corporate profits declined by more than 18%, which represented their third biggest drop since 1945. Gold reached $850 per ounce. The dollar tanked on international markets. Both the Treasury and the Federal Reserve allowed the sociopathic Hunt brothers of Texas to run wild as they attempted to corner the silver market in early 1980. Carter, following the model of Herbert Hoover rather than that of Franklin D. Roosevelt, focused on defeating inflation by trying to balance the federal budget. Given the gravity of the situation, these priorities were simply insane in economic terms, as well as being politically suicidal. Today, with the collapse of the US automobile industry, the drastic slowdown in the housing as a result of the subprime mortgage crisis, the signs of incipient hyperinflation, and the confused alarms of banking panic across the globe, it is easy to see the eerie parallels between the Carter era in our own time. An uncanny calculus has apparently motivated the Trilaterals to dish up yet another Manchurian candidate for president in the midst of a crisis which is similar to, though far more severe than, the one of the Carter years. (Kaufman 168-169, 183) Given Carter’s economic mismanagement, reactionary commentators had a field day: William Safire wrote in the New York Times during the 1980 primaries that the “wind that chilled the Carter candidacy this week was made up of four Is — Inflation, Iran, Israel, and Ineptitude.” (Kaufman 171) Things were so bad in the US economy that when Carter left office and opened the blind trust into which he had placed his financial assets before taking office in 1977,"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Catastrophic Presidency of Trilateral Puppet Jimmy Carter 221 he found that the Carter peanut warehouse business, his main economic asset had gone bankrupt, leaving him deeply in debt. BRZEZINSKI PROVOKES THE SOVIET-AFGHAN WAR, 1979 In June and July 1979, Brzezinski ordered US special forces and subversion teams to cross the border into Afghanistan and begin a campaign of destabilization in that country, with a view to defeating neutralist and pro-Soviet forces and favoring the rise of a pro-NATO regime. This aggressive move in a country along their own border was watched with growing alarm from Moscow. In the Christmas season of 1979, the Soviet Red Army intervened in force inside Afghanistan to ensure a pro-Soviet government there. As Brzezinski told the Nouvel Observateur of Paris in 1998, he had ordered the US subversion and the destabilization teams into Afghanistan with the express hope that he could provoke the Soviets to make a large-scale military countermove that might bog them down in their own version of the bloodletting that the US had just experienced in Vietnam. In that 1998 interview, Brzezinski boasted that he had successfully prompted the Soviets to invade, setting off a war which had lasted almost 10 years and killed between two and three million people. Brzezinski exulted that this geopolitical ploy had begun the downfall of the Soviet Union. He scoffed at questions about the role of the Afghan war in stoking the fires of worldwide Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism. Brzezinski jeered that a bunch of angry Muslims were of no importance in comparison to the vast historical significance of the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the USSR. This is another good insight into Brzezinski’s characteristic method: any tactic that will damage Moscow is to be embraced and ruthlessly implemented. The collateral damage that may be generated against the United States or against traditional US allies is to be simply disregarded as a matter of no importance. Brzezinski clearly helped to lay the groundwork for the creation of the US and British intelligence patsy army or Arab Legion known as Al Qaeda, whose origins reach back to his watch. BRZEZINSKI ORCHESTRATES THE IRAN HOSTAGE CRISIS On November 4, 1979, a group of Iranian militants seized the United States Embassy in Tehran Iran and took 60 American diplomatic personnel as hostages. This incident was cynically exploited by Brzezinski as a proto-September 11 pretext to create a strategic crisis in the Persian Gulf region. The pretext cited for the seizure of the embassy in the taking of the US diplomatic hostages"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 222 was the fact that the Shah of Iran had been admitted to the US on October 22, 1979 in order to receive medical treatment. The Shah had been living in Mexico, and there was no reason why he could not have received top-flight medical care in that country. But Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller had demanded that the Shah he admitted to the United States. Since David Rockefeller was Brzezinski’s boss on the Trilateral Commission, the orchestration of the seizure of the hostages becomes evident. Carter was dimly aware of the implications of admitting the Shah to this country and he did reportedly ask at a meeting, “when the Iranians take our people in Tehran hostage, what would you advise me then?” At this very same time the Iranian Foreign Minister Ibrahim Yazdi was in New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly, where he inveighed against the United States as “the great Satan.” But this posturing did not prevent Yazdi from holding a closed-door meeting with Secretary of State Cyrus Vance. The London Financial Times reported on October 5, 1979 that, as a result of these meetings, the Carter regime had ordered the “resumption of large-scale airlifts of arms to Iran” and was considering dispatching a “limited number of technicians” to that country. Simultaneously, the US military began a buildup in the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean. The Carter regime was in contact with Yazdi through former US Attorney General Ramsey Clark of the left wing of the US intelligence community. Clark wrote to Yazdi: “it is critically important to show that despots cannot escape and live in wealth while the nations they ravaged continued to suffer.” When this letter later became public, it was “taken as evidence that special envoy Clark had incited the Iranians to take over the embassy and demand the return of the Shah to Iran.” BRZEZINSKI AND YAZDI; BRZEZINSKI AND SADDAM HUSSEIN On November 1, 1979 Zbigniew Brzezinski held a secret meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Yazdi in Algeria. “According to intelligence sources, it was during this last tête-à-tête that final details concerning the embassy takeover were hammered out.” Further details of the embassy seizure and hostage-taking were discussed by Yazdi upon his return to Teheran with the US chargé d’affaires Bruce Laingen, who was a key operative in the political charade that was about to begin.” (Robert Dreyfus, Hostage to Khomeini [New York: EIR, 1981], pp. 59-60)"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Catastrophic Presidency of Trilateral Puppet Jimmy Carter 223 Because US hostages had been taken, Brzezinski circles were able to argue behind the scenes that it was imperative to keep up arms shipments to the Iranians because this appeasement of the Khomeini regime was the only way to keep the hostages alive. At no point during the entire Carter administration were arms shipments by the United States to Iran ever halted. They were seamlessly maintained, and this is the beginning of the weapons trafficking which came into public view years later in the form of the Iran Contra scandal of 1986. Another reason why Brzezinski wanted to arm Iran was that he was already planning to play Iran off against Iraq in the genocidal Gulf War, which went far towards destroying both of these countries. The characteristic feature of Brzezinski’s method is to avoid direct US military intervention as long as possible, while attempting to destroy emerging Third World powers and other possible rivals of the United States by playing them off one against the other. (The Iran- Iraq war began in September 1980, as a result of the gullibility of the US asset Saddam Hussein. Brzezinski’s emissaries convinced Saddam that it would be easy to invade Iran and grab the oil province of Khuzestan or Arabistan, where the Abadan refineries and the Karg island tanker terminal are located. In reality, Brzezinski was seeking to consolidate and perpetuate the Khomeini regime, which by that point was in the process of internal collapse. The attack by a foreign enemy gave the Khomeini regime a second wind, and led to a bloody stalemate which lasted for eight full years, until September 1988. Iranian casualties in this war approached one million dead, with those of Iraq being estimated at about 400,000 fatalities. This is the characteristic handiwork of Brzezinski.) SEIZING IRANIAN ASSETS TO ABORT EUROPEAN MONETARY REFORM A key feature of the crisis was Carter’s seizure of more than $6 billion in Iranian assets inside the United States. The new Federal Emergency Management Agency or FEMA, just founded by Brzezinski and Huntington, was a key part of the planning of this illegal move. The resulting turmoil in the international financial markets was useful to Brzezinski in that it blocked the development of the emerging French-German European Monetary System as a global alternative to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, both controlled by the Anglo-Americans. Only one month before the Iranian crisis erupted, French Foreign Minister Jean François-Poncet had told reporters at the United Nations in New York"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 224 of the European “vision” that the EMS would come to replace the IMF and World Bank at the center of the world financial architecture. (Dreyfus 63) As a result of the hostage crisis, Brzezinski was perfectly positioned to blackmail Western Europe and Japan on a series of points that were of interest to the Wall Street banking community. Brzezinski demanded that the Europeans and Japanese scrupulously observe US economic sanctions and economic blockade against Iran. The only alternative to economic sanctions and economic warfare, he argued, was a direct military attack by the US on Iran. It was in this context that Brzezinski told the Frankfurter Rundschau : “It is now up to Europe to prevent World War III.” (Dreyfus 66) This was helped along by a pattern of US military threats to bomb Iranian oilfields or tanker terminals as part of an alleged retaliation for the seizure of the hostages. It was clear that the main victims who would suffer from any US attack on Iran were more the Europeans and Japanese than the Iranians themselves, since oil deliveries out of the Persian Gulf would be severely restricted. Brzezinski’s blackmail was clearly understood by European leaders, who had long despised him. A November 28, 1979 column published in the Figaro of Paris by Paul Marie de la Gorce is indicative in this regard. The author was widely regarded as speaking for French President Giscard d’Estaing. This column stated that any US military attack on Iran would cause “more damage for Europe and Japan than for Iran.” Those who propose such a strategy, the French observer noted, were quite possibly courting a new world war, and were “consciously or not inspired by the lessons given by Henry Kissinger.” (Dreyfus 65) All quite correct, except for the fact that the crisis was being orchestrated by Brzezinski, an even greater madman and lunatic adventurer than Kissinger. THE CARTER DOCTRINE OF JANUARY 1980: SOURCE OF THE IRAQ WAR Brzezinski used the hostage crisis to promulgate the so-called the Carter Doctrine on the Persian Gulf, which was included in the January 1980 State of the Union address. Brzezinski insisted against all objections on the inclusion of this critical passage: “Let our position be absolutely clear. An attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America, and such an assault"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Catastrophic Presidency of Trilateral Puppet Jimmy Carter 225 will be repelled by any means necessary, including military force.” Columnist Joseph Kraft called this lunacy “a breathtaking progression from the dream world to the world of reality.” (Rozell 161) This was a piece of incalculable folly, since it threw down the gauntlet to the Soviet Union in the most provocative possible way. This Carter doctrine has also provided the basis for every US fiasco in the Persian Gulf region over the last several decades, including the first Gulf War to eject Iraq from Kuwait and the current Iraq war itself. If you don’t like the Iraq war, you need to reserve a significant part of the blame for Brzezinski, who is so to speak the founder of the policy carried out by Bush the Elder and Bush the younger. The fact that Brzezinski today tries to acquire left cover by posing as a principled enemy of the Iraq war simply underlines his hypocrisy and guile, and the gullibility of the left liberals who believe him. BRZEZINSKI’S DESERT ONE DEBACLE By the spring of 1980, it was clear to the world that the Carter regime was preparing a desperate military launch into Iran under the pretext of freeing the hostages. In an article that hit the streets on April 22, 1980, the Executive Intelligence Review reported that the Carter regime “has begun a headlong drive towards a Cuban missile crisis-style from a nuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union over Iran, common time to occur between late April and May 11, for the purpose of blackmailing Western Europe and Japan into submitting to Anglo-American political dictates.” (Dreyfus 65) The Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda editorialized on April 11, 1980: “Washington is not only aiming at aggravating its conflict with Teheran. Judging from everything, it is venturing a risky bluff: blackmailing Iran, as well as America’s allies who depend on oil deliveries from the Persian Gulf with the threat of direct military intervention.” The Soviet commentary saw that “this strategy puts Western Europe and Japan in the position of being forced participants in a game designed to strengthen the shaken position of US imperialism in the near and Middle East.” This Moscow observer concluded that “the prospect of being deprived of Iranian oil does not provoke any enthusiasm, especially not in Tokyo, Bonn, or Paris.” (Dreyfus 66) VANCE FEARED WORLD WAR III WITH MOSCOW The tragic failure of the hostage rescue mission at Desert One, a rendezvous point inside Iran, was on the surface yet another proof of"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 22 6 the incompetence and chaos of the Carter administration. There was some question as to whether the rescue mission had been sabotaged by CIA forces loyal to the Bush political machine to abort a pre- October surprise by Carter, since George H. W. Bush was now on his way to becoming Reagan’s vice presidential running mate. This may have been what Iraqi state radio was driving at when it alleged that the failed US attack was “playacting carried out in orchestration between Washington and Tehran.” Secretary of State Cyrus Vance resigned in protest at the rescue mission, although this fact was not made public until after the mission had failed. “We haven’t begun just an attack on Iran,” Vance reportedly commented, “We may have started World War III.” Rumors swirled around Washington to the effect that the failure of the hostage mission had been caused by a direct Soviet military intervention including MIG-21 aircraft, and according to some unconfirmed accounts the Soviet bombardment of the Desert One site. But this may have been an obvious enough cover story to hide the actions of the Bush crowd, or of deliberate sabotage by Brzezinski networks. (Dreyfus 67-68) With the failure of the hostage rescue mission at Desert One, some key Wall Street backers of the Carter administration such as George Ball and Averell Harriman bolted for the exits, abandoning the peanut farmer to his fate. Brzezinski, by contrast, constituted a stay behind operation to run the Carter administration to its bitter end, which he personally had done so much to hasten. At about the same time that the Soviet Union was moving into Afghanistan, fundamentalist fanatics attacked the grand Mosque in Mecca, the holiest shrine of Islam, holding hundreds of pilgrims as hostages. In Pakistan, a mob of 20,000 Muslim rioters attacked and destroyed the American embassy in Islamabad, killing two Americans. The rioters had been told that the US had orchestrated the attack on the grand Mosque in Mecca. Another serious incident was an attack on the US Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, which resulted in the murder of the US ambassador. Given Brzezinski’s commitment to crisis and confrontation, it is not difficult to establish him as a prime suspect in the orchestration of all these attacks. PD-59: BRZEZINSKI STRIVES FOR TACTICAL NUCLEAR WAR, COUNTERFORCE STRIKES In the wake of the failed hostage rescue mission, Brzezinski promulgated a new piece of strategic insanity and brinksmanship in the form of Presidential Directive 59, issued in August 1980. This"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Catastrophic Presidency of Tr ilateral Puppet Jimmy Carter 22 7 document called for the United States to adopt a policy of limited or tactical nuclear war wherever needed to be able to deal with Soviet strategic moves. It was the brainchild of Brzezinski and Carter’s Defense Secretary, Harold “Bomber” Brown, one of the Strangeloves who had helped carry out strategic bombing during the Vietnam War. PD-59 represented a giant step away from the doctrine of deterrence, otherwise known as mutually assured destruction (MAD) which had been the only means of keeping the peace of the world after the late 1950s. PD-59 talked about the possibility of counterforce attacks against Soviet nuclear assets in addition to the long-standing targeting of population centers as part of a so-called counter-value strategy. Brzezinski and Brown claimed that this harebrained scheme meant that the United States nuclear deterrent would continue to be credible even in the face of a Soviet military buildup. But sane observers pointed out that the PD-59 policy vastly increased the chances of crossing the nuclear threshold into the unthinkable realm of nuclear exchange, because it made atomic hostilities easier to start. The Soviet news agency TASS described this new strategy as “madness,” while Pravda attacked it as “nuclear blackmail” destined to cause a new acceleration of the arms race. BRZEZINSKI’S EUROMISSILES CRISIS, 1979-1983 In 1979, NATO had decided under prodding by Brzezinski to begin the process leading to the stationing of US Pershing II and cruise missiles in Western Europe as a counter to the deployment of Soviet SS 20 intermediate range ballistic missiles. Carter had held a very public discussion with himself about building the neutron bomb, which further inflamed the suspicions of Moscow. He then decided to build and deploy the MX multi-warhead ICBM. All of these moves were dictated by the insane warmonger Brzezinski, and they helped to move the world towards the brink of general thermonuclear war, as the French and German governments noted with alarm. Combined with events in Afghanistan and in Iran, the new US doctrine of counterforce combined with tactical nuclear warfare had created a superpower crisis of the first magnitude, all within about 36 months of the Carter Brzezinski regime coming into power. To further antagonize the Soviets, Carter slapped a total grain embargo on the Soviet Union, and boycotted the Moscow Olympics of 1980. Relations between Washington and Moscow reached an absolute nadir. Although he is approaching 80 years of age, it is a safe bet that the aging Strangelove Brzezinski will still be capable of"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 228 taking today’s world to the brink in even less time under a future Obama administration. THREE MILE ISLAND ON CARTER’S WATCH Perhaps the event which best symbolized and summed up the abyss of cultural pessimism and historical despair into which the Carter administration had led the United States with a nuclear incident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in late March, 1979. A malfunction at a nuclear reactor was used by the controlled corporate media to unleash a wave of panic and hysteria which gripped the United States for several days. Not one person was killed in the entire incident. Nevertheless, the Three Mile Island affair was used to solidify and consolidate the post-1968 cultural paradigm shift away from traditional notions of science and progress in that direction of historical pessimism and the limits of growth which had been proclaimed by the neofascist Club of Rome just a decade earlier. Carter had come into office with the firm intent to sabotage the nuclear modernization of the developing countries, and this Three Mile Island incident allowed him to shut down the nuclear reactor industry inside the United States. Since the Three Mile Island media circus, not one new nuclear reactor has been completed and placed online in this country. The incident inside the reactor was extremely suspicious: the entire fiasco came just two weeks after the premiere performance of a film entitled The China Syndrome , starring Jane Fonda and Jack Lemmon. This was an obvious scenario film which showed a devastating incident at a nuclear reactor. It is a good rule of thumb to assume that when a scenario film appears on television or in the movies, and the actual event then occurs soon afterward, an intelligence network has used the scenario film to prepare public opinion for the real-world event. Just a few months before the events of September 11, 2001, for example, Fox television broadcast the scenario film The Lone Gunmen , which showed a hijacked airliner almost colliding with the World Trade Center towers in New York City. With a few variations, the plot was broadly similar to what then happened on September 11. It was known at the time of Three Mile Island that the most likely cause of this incident had not been a mechanical failure of the reactor itself, but rather deliberate sabotage by one of the employees at the plant, obviously enough in the framework of a covert operation designed to paralyze or destroy the nuclear power industry in the United States."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Catastrophic Presidency of Trilateral Puppet Jimmy Carter 229 The Carter administration failed miserably in determining what had actually happened at Three Mile Island, and eagerly embraced the thesis that nuclear energy was inherently unsafe. Together with the Volcker interest-rate policies at the Federal Reserve, Three Mile Island was a principal factor in the de-industrialization of the United States carried out during the Carter years. Here again, this country has not recovered to this day from the destruction wrought under the Carter regime. Those who are concerned about greenhouse gases today should recall that it was under Carter that the fateful decision against nuclear energy and in favor of coal-fired plants was made. Speaking on the National Public Radio Diane Rehm program on February 27, 2008, correspondent Joe Hebert of the Associated Press speculated that another incident on the scale of Three Mile Island would essentially doom the nuclear power industry in the United States, putting an end to the current trend for nuclear power to make a comeback in this country. This raises the obvious question: is a new nuclear reactor incident being planned for a future Obama administration? We can be reasonably sure that if such an incident were to occur, Obama would be just as hostile to finding out what had really happened as Bush was in regard to September 11. GLOBAL 2000: GENOCIDE AS OFFICIAL US POLICY It was during the Jimmy Carter regime that policies of population reduction in the Third World, amounting to thinly veiled genocide, were instituted as the imperative doctrine of the United States government. Many of the documents in question, such as Global 2000 and Global Futures were produced in the State Department under Carter’s second secretary of state, Edmund Muskie, who replaced Vance in 1979. By the spring of 1980, the resident Strangelove of the White House, who had now outlasted his rival Cyrus Vance, had also become a huge public relations liability, both in terms of his track record and in terms of his personality. Newsweek magazine wrote that: “as things now stand, the president’s uncertain diplomatic strategy has left allies perplexed, enemies unimpressed, and the nation as vulnerable as ever in an increasingly dangerous world.” One prominent historian of the Carter presidency writes that: “because of his high profile and combative Cold War views, Brzezinski came under particular attack, prompting Jody Powell to urge Carter to curb the NSC adviser’s public appearances. ‘To put it bluntly,’ Powell"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 230 stated, ‘Zbig needs to almost drop from public view for the next few months at least.” (Kaufman 176) This analysis was correct: when Brzezinski appeared at the 1980 Democratic National Convention in New York City, he was heavily booed, especially by Kennedy delegates. Brzezinski was widely recognized at that time as the most unpopular member of the Carter administration – no mean feat, given how much Carter and some of his underlings were hated. It may well be that Brzezinski was the most unpopular figure in any Democratic administration since Johnson left office in January 1969 – until of course Zbig rehabilitated himself by becoming a critic of the Iraq war. Today, Obama is wisely keeping Brzezinski in the closet and denying his relationship with the Polish incendiary. BILLY CARTER AND BILLYGATE Yet another factor dragging down the Carter regime was the dubious role of the president’s younger brother, Billy Carter. Billy had attracted notoriety by attempting to market a brand of beer bearing his own name, the so-called Billy Beer. Billy had also undertaken a highly publicized trip to Libya in 1978 to meet with officials of the regime of Colonel Moammar Gaddafi. Soon the Justice Department had to ask Billy to register as a foreign agent for the Libyan government. One of Billy’s missions was to procure an increase in Libyan oil deliveries to the Charter Oil Company. By July 1980, it became known that Billy Carter had received $220,000 from the Libyan government. Zbigniew Brzezinski had had a role in the scandal, and may have been one of the leakers who had started the ball rolling. A White House statement specified that Zbigniew Brzezinski had met with Billy Carter and a Libyan official in November 1979 to talk about the possibility of getting Libyan help to release the US hostages held in Iran. This idea had been endorsed by First Lady Rosalind Carter. When Billy had traveled to Libya for his second trip in early 1980, he had taken with him some confidential cables from the State Department. This dose of new corruption evidence was yet another blow to Carter’s popularity. “That damn Billy Carter stuff is killing us,” commented Ha milton Jordan of the Carter White House. (Kaufman 191) THE CARTER REGIME: AUSTERITY, PAIN AND SACRIFICE Perhaps another of the reasons that Carter and Brzezinski did not in fact pitch the world into all-out thermonuclear war during 1980 had to"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Catastrophic Presidency of Trilateral Puppet Jimmy Carter 231 do with the precipitous collapse of the Carter regime on the home front. In November 1980, Eizenstat warned Carter that in the public perception, his economic policy was “viewed solely as austerity, pain, and sacrifice.” (Kaufman 179) Carter had been programmed as an austerity president, and he was now the target of widespread popular rage and resentment for precisely that reason. He had betrayed his own political base. In early 1980, Carter secured the creation of the Synthetic Fuels Corporation with authority to spend $88 billion over the next decade to develop alternative energy sources. This is yet another precursor to the current alternative proposals pushed by Bush and Obama. Carter during early 1980 was also demanding a 10 cents per gallon surcharge on all imported oil. He also demanded the creation of an Energy Mobilization Board, to override state laws and regulations on matters pertaining to energy supplies. He was doing this a few months before a general election, and despite his own wretched popularity ratings in the public opinion polls. On June 4, 1980, both houses of Congress repudiated Carter by approving a joint resolution killing the proposed oil import tax. The vote was 73 to 16 in the Senate and 376 to 30 in the House, in spite of the three to two Democratic majority in the Senate, and a two to one edge in the House. It was the first time that a two thirds majority of the Congress had overwritten the veto of a president from the same party since Harry Truman in the early 1950s, and showed that Carter had so alienated and antagonized the Democrats on Capitol Hill that he had no working majority. Carter whined that his defeat represented a new low in congressional performance during his time in office. Fortunately for the world, Carter settled into the status of a lame duck and concentrated on his doomed reelection effort against the Republican Reagan-Bush ticket. NOVEMBER 1980: CARTER CARRIES FIVE STATES AND DC In the November 1980 elections, Carter was able to carry the District of Columbia, Rhode Island, West Virginia, Georgia, Minnesota, and Maryland for a total of 49 electoral votes to the 489 rolled up by Reagan Bush. This landslide marked the beginning of a reactionary nightmare in American politics which continued unmitigated until the arrival of Bill Clinton in 1992, and has continued to exercise a profoundly negative influence on the United States until this very day."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 232 DID BRZEZINSKI RECRUIT OBAMA IN 1981-83? As for Carter, he became a virtual pariah after leaving office, taking no part whatsoever in the 1984 Democratic national convention or in the campaign of his former Vice President Walter Mondale. He seemed to retreat into the argument that the United States had become ungovernable during his time in office, and that there was nothing that he could have done differently. As for Brzezinski, he went back to Columbia University and by all indications busied himself with the recruitment of a stable of new Manchurian candidates on the Carter model to be deployed farther down the line, in a total political and economic crisis which Samuel Huntington was then predicting for the years between 2010 and 2030. Among the bright young men on the make that Brzezinski began to draw into his orbit at this time was, in all probability, the youthful Barack Obama, who had transferred to Columbia University in 1981, and who graduated in 1983 with a degree in political science, a specialization in international relations, and a thesis topic involving Soviet nuclear disarmament — a topic that represented Brzezinski’s personal area of interest as the boss of the Columbia Institute for Communist Affairs. CARTER AS HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL PESSIMIST In an essay entitled “Jimmy Carter and the Post-New Deal Presidency,” the new deal scholar William E. Leuchtenburg cites an important line from Carter’s inaugural address of January 1977: “we have learned that ‘more’ is not necessarily better, that even our great nation has its recognized limits.” Leuchtenburg then goes on to quote the following comment by Carter in his later memoirs: “Watching the sea of approving faces [on Inauguration Day], I wondered how few of the happy celebrants would agree with my words if they analyzed them closely. At the time, it was not possible even for me to imagine the limits we would have to face. In some ways, dealing with limits would become the subliminal theme of the next four years and affect the outcome of the 1980 election.” Carter evidently knew well enough right at the outset that he had hoodwinked the American people. Leuchtenburg quotes a remark by Michael Malbin that “Americans remain a people of the Enlightenment who find it hard to accept the postmodern (or ancient) view of a world of limited possibilities.” In other words, a presidency founded on historical and cultural pessimism, most notably in the form of Malthusian austerity, is unlikely to be accepted by Americans, and leads to failure and"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Catastrophic Presidency of Trilateral Puppet Jimmy Carter 233 ungovernability. Despite indications of ideological decadence and moral senility in the American people around the turn of the 21st century, it is very likely that the tendency to reject historical and cultural pessimism remains surprisingly strong, and could emerge powerfully under conditions of crisis. A resurgence of scientific optimism and activist government is precisely what synthetic candidates like Carter and Obama have been designed to sabotage. Leuchtenburg cites a reporter who summed up the conclusion of the Carter presidency by remarking: “He preached to us constantly about sacrifice and limitations, which none of us wanted to hear.” The tremendous demoralization and despair associated with the Carter presidency opened the door for the right-wing reactionary Ronald Reagan, who went to the White House wearing a mask of sunny optimism. Leuchtenburg quotes the comment of one scholar that “whatever Reagan did, many Americans felt, would be better than the handwringing, sermons, and demands for sacrifice of the last four years.” One former Carter official summed up his bosses message in the following terms: “in order to be a good American... You’ve got to drive cars you don’t like... And turn up the thermostat in the summer and down in the winter.... You’re a pig, you’ve been using too much energy all your life and you’ve got to change.” (Leuchtenburg 22-23) CARTER AND THE DEMOCRATS’ RETREAT FROM THE NEW DEAL The Carter presidency inaugurated a retreat from the heritage of the Franklin D. Roosevelt New Deal which has been disastrous for the Democratic Party. It was under Carter that the great U-turn in American life, from rising standards of living to falling standards of living, became evident and institutionalized. From the Carter era onwards, American living standards have been in a process of precipitous decline, down to the current level of barely a third of the Eisenhower-Kennedy norm. When Walter Mondale ran for president in 1984, he began including trade unions and teachers’ unions among the sinister interest groups whose influence in Washington had to be contained as if they were big oil or big pharmaceuticals, he was carrying on the same process. When Michael Dukakis in 1988 said that the main issue in the election was competence and not ideology, this was another coded repudiation of the Roosevelt tradition. Dukakis ostentatiously refused to offer any promise of increased federal spending to fight poverty."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 234 Bill Clinton declared that the era of big government was over, embraced free trade sellouts, and abolished the welfare system, abandoning millions of poor children to a grim fate. These wretched policies could never take the place of FDR’s New Deal, JFK’s New Frontier, and LBJ’s Great Society. A FITTING MONUMENT TO CARTER: A BOTTOMLESS PIT After the Carter administration had left Washington, the prominent trade unionist William R. Winpisinger of the International Association of Machinists was asked for his evaluation of Carter’s place in history. He replied: “as presidents go, he was on a par with Calvin Coolidge. I consider his abilities mediocre, his actions pusillanimous, and his administration a calamity for America’s working people. Since an obelisk soaring 555 feet into the air symbolizes the nation’s admiration and respect for George Washington, it would seem the only fitting memorial for Jimmy Carter would be a bottomless pit.” (Leuchtenburg 17) MALTHUSIANISM SPELLS DOOM FOR DEMOCRATS Jimmy Carter is of course not the only failed president of the last several decades, but he is the only Democrat other than Clinton to reach the White House since the end of the Johnson administration in 1969. Carter’s administration is today little understood by younger voters, and older voters are not anxious to remember the agony of the Carter years. The Democratic Party has had its share of failed and dysfunctional presidential candidates — George McGovern, Walter Mondale, Michael Dukakis, Al Gore, and John Kerry come to mind. All of these figures shared the same essential crippling flaw: they could not understand that an embrace of the ideology of the limits of growth and the inevitability of scarcity had to doom any concerns about the alleviation of poverty, the defense of the middle class, or the provision of adequate education, health care, housing, transportation, and other social services — to say nothing of improving the lot of the impoverished masses of the developing countries. Before 1968, Malthusianism was considered an alien doctrine among American leftists. It was after all the New Deal and not any free-market orgy that for the first time in human history unlocked the secrets of the atom, put human beings on the moon, and open the era of computer technology. It is only as a result of the disorientation, disillusionment, defeat, and despair of the late 1960s and early 1970s"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Catastrophic Presidency of Trilateral Puppet Jimmy Carter 235 that ideas about the limits of growth of the impossibility of making people’s lives better through science, technology, and progress became pervasive. During his first year in office, French President Nicholas Sarkozy told the French that they are now living in an “age of scarcity.” Yet, there is no objective reason why this should be so. The age of scarcity ideology represents a self-imposed block universe in which no progressive causes can survive. Jimmy Carter’s greatest failing was his intellectual incapacity to reject the ideology of scarcity and austerity. Today, under circumstances which have qualitatively deteriorated since Carter’s time, the Obama candidacy proposes a final capitulation to these reactionary and inhumane ideas. OBAMA: A NEW DISASTER À LA CARTER It is hoped that this retrospective summary of the Carter- Brzezinski-Volcker Trilateral administration of 1977 to 1981 will help the public to identify the Obama candidacy as a warmed over version, more sophisticated and elaborate to be sure, of the same sinister methods which made the Carter regime such a nightmare. Far from being fresh and new, Obama represents a thoroughly discredited model which has already been tried and which has failed. In spite of his own reckless folly, Carter was nevertheless able to complete four years in office. There is, however, no guarantee that the United States of America could survive and Obama-Brzezinski presidency for that long. THE BRZEZINSKI PLAYBOOK – HINTS OF THE FUTURE UNDER OBAMA This brief retrospective of the 1977-1981 Brzezinski-Carter administration can perhaps provide us with a repertoire of tricks and tactics in which Brzezinski can be considered well-versed, and which we may therefore expect may well be carried out during a possible Obama administration. We can call this brief catalogue the Brzezinski Playbook. 1. Economic stagflation was a new term that had to be invented to describe the Carter-Brzezinski-Volcker Trilateral combination of unprecedented unemployment and high inflation. Now the newspapers are full of dire predictions of stagflation. This time, Brzezinski’s policies will consummate the existing tendencies toward hyperinflationary depression,"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 23 6 something like the Carter economic crisis raised to the third or fourth power. 2. Brzezinski is a past master of orchestrating and exploiting for political purposes attacks on embassies and the seizure of diplomatic personnel as hostages. On his watch, the US Ambassador in Afghanistan was murdered, and the US Embassy in Pakistan attacked by a large mob. The most celebrated example of Zbig’s handiwork in this department was of course the seizure of the US Embassy in Teheran and the taking of the 52 US personnel there as hostages from November 4, 1979 to January 20, 1981. This was a complex operation arranged via many channels, but the finishing touches were applied when Brzezinski met with Iranian Foreign Minister Ibrahim Yazdi in Algeria on November 1, 1979. Shortly after the Serbian province of Kosovo declared its independence in February 2008, a strange attack on the US Embassy in Belgrade, Serbia occurred which could not be assigned to any known Serbian group. This had all the earmarks of a Brzezinski operation. 3. Brzezinski is also an expert in the use of color revolutions and people power coups. The most notable example on Brzezinski’s watch remains the overthrow of the Shah of Iran and the installation of the regime of Ayatollah Khomeini, whom Brzezinski wanted to use as a means of popularizing Islamic fundamentalism, which he wanted to use as a weapon for the subversion of the USSR. The March 2008 Tibet insurrection is a typical Brzezinski gambit, aiming at the destabilization and weakening of China as a whole. The fact that the vehicle is that feudal monster and parasite, the very spiritual NATO agent and provocateur who calls himself the “Dalai Lama,” only increases the gusto for Brzezinski, who is a low-level Polish nobleman. Look for color revolutions in Syria, Venezuela, and other countries. Pakistan is experiencing the aftermath of Benazir Bhutto’s failed color revolution, and is being pushed into breakup by the US-UK. 4. Playing one country against another in an attempt to destroy both is one of Brzezinski’s favorite ploys. He boasts that he played the USSR against Afghanistan and destroyed the Soviet regime in the process. He also played Saddam Hussein’s Iraq against Iran, to weaken both countries and also"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Catastrophic Presidency of Tr ilateral Puppet Jimmy Carter 23 7 to consolidate the Khomeini fundamentalist dictatorship in Iran, which probably would have fallen without the extra cohesion afforded by a foreign aggressor. The playing of Ethiopia against Somalia in late 2006-early 2007 and of Colombia against Venezuela in the spring of 2008 are typical examples of Brzezinski’s handiwork. Look for him to attempt to play Syria and Iran against Russia. His larger goals include playing Europe and China against Russia in the huge pincers operation. This ploy is likely to blow up in his face – the last world war grew out of the British attempt to play Hitler against Stalin, an equally crackpot scheme. 5. Olympic boycotts for political purposes are a Brzezinski specialty; he led the effort by the US and other countries to boycott the 1980 Moscow Olympics after the USSR invaded Pakistan in response to Brzezinski’s own subversion operations there. In 2008, look for a boycott of the Beijing Olympics to make the Chinese leaders lose face. Consider Mexico City 1968 and Munich 1972 for possible variations. The US will face the later harvest of hate, but Brzezinski hardly cares about that. 6. As a fanatical feudalist, Brzezinski hates science and progress. The deliberate sabotage of the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor was played out on Brzezinski’s watch in 1979. The incident had been immediately preceded by the release of the film The China Syndrome , which provided an accurate scenario for the staged incident that was about to happen. With Obama heavily in debt to the coal mine owners, a new sabotage of a nuclear reactor, this time perhaps with real victims, might well be on the agenda, in a bid to end the US nuclear industry forever, condemning this country to fall farther and farther behind the rest of the world, which is going for nuclear energy on an unprecedented scale. 7. To increase environmentalist-Malthusian hysteria and increase public willingness to accept carbon taxes and the burdens of a “cap and trade” speculative market, Brzezinski might well opt for a new fake energy shortage like that of the summer of 1979, complete with endless gas lines stretching over the horizon. 8. Brzezinski’s tenure at the NSC also coincided with the great European terrorist offensive of 1977-78 against the European"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 238 Monetary System and the Schmidt-Giscard-Moro push towards European self-assertion. In Germany in 1977, the Baader-Meinhof group, a tool of NATO intelligence, murdered state prosecutor Buback, the business leader Schleyer, the banker Ponto, while CIA-controlled Palestinian crazies hijacked a German plane to Mogadiscio, Somalia. In 1977, gun-toting extremists engaged in firefights with police in the center of Rome, and in March 1978 the CIA’s own Red Brigades kidnapped and later murdered former Prime Minister Aldo Moro. Watch therefore for a new wave of terrorism against those who oppose Brzezinski’s plans. This brief account is indebted to the following works: William E.

Robert Helvey WASHINGTON, March 19, 2005 — The U.S. government and allied forces’ year-end installation of Victor Yushchenko as president of Ukraine has completed the field-testing of the “Postmodern Coup.” Employing and fine-tuning the same sophisticated techniques used in Serbia in 2000 and Georgia in 2003 (and tried unsuccessfully in Belarus in 2001), it is widely expected that the United States will attempt to apply the same methods throughout the former Soviet Union. “We have to confront those forces that are committed to reproduce a Georgian or Ukrainian scenario,” Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev stated on December 26, the day of the coup, “we’ll not allow the import of Rose [Georgian] and Orange [Ukrainian] revolutions in our country.” One day later, the Kazakh government launched a criminal case against the Soros Foundation for tax evasion, one of the coups’ financiers. And last spring, Uzbek President Islam Karimov accused Soros of overseeing the revolution in Georgia, and condemning his efforts to “fool and brainwash” young intelligentsia in his own country, banned the group. The same networks are also increasingly active in South America, Africa, and Asia. Top targets include Venezuela, Mozambique, and Iran, among others. The method employed is usefully described by The Guardian’s Ian Traynor in a November 26, 2004, article entitled “US campaign behind the turmoil in Kiev,” during the first phase of the coup. With their websites and stickers, their pranks and slogans aimed at banishing widespread fear of a corrupt regime, the democracy guerrillas of the Ukrainian Pora youth movement have already"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 240 notched up a famous victory — whatever the outcome of the dangerous stand-off in Kiev. [T]he campaign is an American creation, a sophisticated and brilliantly conceived exercise in western branding and mass marketing that, in four countries in four years, has been used to try to salvage rigged elections and topple unsavoury regimes. Funded and organised by the US government, deploying US consultancies, pollsters, diplomats, the two big American parties and US non-government organisations, the campaign was first used in Europe in Belgrade in 2000 to beat Slobodan Milosevic at the ballot box. Richard Miles, the US ambassador in Belgrade, played a key role. And by last year, as US ambassador in Tbilisi, he repeated the trick in Georgia, coaching Mikhail Saakashvili in how to bring down Eduard Shevardnadze. Ten months after the success in Belgrade, the US ambassador in Minsk, Michael Kozak, a veteran of similar operations in central America, notably in Nicaragua, organised a near identical campaign to try to defeat the Belarus hard man, Alexander Lukashenko. The operation - engineering democracy through the ballot box and civil disobedience - is now so slick that the methods have matured into a template for winning other people’s elections. Much of the coup apparatus is the same that was used in the overthrow of President Fernando Marcos of the Philippines in 1986, the Tiananmen Square destabilization in 1989, and Vaclav Havel’s “Velvet revolution” in Czechoslavakia in 1989. As in these early operations, the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), and its primary arms, the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs (NDI) and International Republican Institute (IRI), played a central role. The NED was established by the Reagan Administration in 1983, to do overtly what the CIA had done covertly, in the words of one its legislative drafters, Allen Weinstein. The Cold War propaganda and operations center, Freedom House, now chaired by former CIA director James Woolsey, has also been involved, as were billionaire George Soros’ foundations, whose donations always dovetail those of the NED. What is new about the template bears on the use of the Internet (in particular chat rooms, instant messaging, and blogs) and cell phones (including text-messaging), to rapidly steer angry and suggestible"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"The new Gladio in action: “Swarming Adolescents” 241 “Generation X” youth into and out of mass demonstrations and the like — a capability that only emerged in the mid- 1990s. “With the crushing ubiquity of cell phones, satellite phones, PCs, modems and the Internet,” Laura Rosen emphasized in Salon Magazine on February 3, 2001,”the information age is shifting the advantage from authoritarian leaders to civic groups.” She might have mentioned the video games that helped create the deranged mindset of these “civic groups.” The repeatedly emphasized role played by so-called “Discoshaman” and his girlfriend “Tulipgirl,” in assisting the “Orange Revolution” through their aptly named blog, “Le Sabot Post- Modern,” is indicative of the technical and sociological components involved. A CIVILIAN REVOLUTION IN MILITARY AFFAIRS The emphasis on the use of new communication technologies to rapidly deploy small groups, suggests what we are seeing is civilian application of Secretary Donald Rumsfeld’s “Revolution in Military Affairs” doctrine, which depends on highly mobile small group deployments “enabled” by “real time” intelligence and communications. Squads of soldiers taking over city blocks with the aid of “intelligence helmet” video screens that give them an instantaneous overview of their environment, constitute the military side. Bands of youth converging on targeted intersections in constant dialogue on cell phones constitute the doctrine’s civilian application. This parallel should not be surprising since the US military and National Security Agency subsidized the development of the Internet, cellular phones, and software platforms. From their inception, these technologies were studied and experimented with in order to find the optimal use in a new kind of warfare. The “revolution” in warfare that such new instruments permit has been pushed to the extreme by several specialists in psychological warfare. Although these military utopians have been working in high places (for example the RAND Corporation) for a very long time, to a large extent they only took over some of the most important command structures of the US military apparatus with the victory of the neoconservatives in the Pentagon of Donald Rumsfeld. The new techniques of warfare include the use of both lethal (violent) and nonlethal (nonviolent) tactics. Both ways are conducted using the same philosophy, infrastructure, and modus operandi. It is what is known as Cyberwar. For example, the tactic of swarming is a"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 242 fundamental element in both violent and nonviolent forms of warfare. This new philosophy of war, which is supposed to replicate the strategy of Genghis Khan as enhanced by modern technologies, is intended to aid both military and non-military assaults against targeted states through what are, in effect, “high tech” hordes. In that sense there is no difference, from the standpoint of the plotters, between Iraq or Ukraine, if only that many think the Ukraine-like coup is more effective and easier. Indicative of the common objective are the comments of the theoreticians of the post modern coup, for example, Dr. Peter Ackerman, the author of “Strategic Nonviolent Conflict” (Praeger 1994). Writing in the “National Catholic Reporter” on April 26, 2002, Dr. Ackerman offered the following corrective to Bush’s Axis of Evil speech targeting Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, which he otherwise approved: “It is not true that the only way to ‘take out’ such regimes is through U.S. military action.” Speaking at the “Secretary’s Open Forum” at the State Department on June 29, 2004, in a speech entitled, “Between Hard and Soft Power: The Rise of Civilian-Based Struggle and Democratic Change,” Ackerman elaborated on the concept involved. He proposed that youth movements, such as those used to bring down Serbia, could bring down Iran and North Korea, and could have been used to bring down Iraq — thereby accomplishing all of Bush’s objectives without relying on military means. And he reported that he has been working with the top US weapons designer, Lawrence Livermore Laboratories, on developing new communications technologies that could be used in other youth movement insurgencies. “There is no question that these technologies are democratizing,” he stressed, in reference to their potential use in bringing down China, “they enable decentralized activity. They create, if you will, a digital concept of the right of assembly.” Dr. Ackerman is the founding chairman of International Center on Nonviolent Conflicts of Washington, DC, of which former US Air Force officer Jack DuVall is president. Together with former CIA director James Woolsey, DuVall also directs the Arlington Institute of Washington, DC, which was created by former Chief of Naval Operations advisor John L. Peterson in 1989 “ to help redefine the concept of national security in much larger, comprehensive terms” it reports, through introducing “social value shifts into the traditional national defense equation.”"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"The new Gladio in action: “Swarming Adolescents” 243 “SWARMING ADOLESCENTS” AND “REBELLIOUS HYSTERIA” As in the case of the new communication technologies, the potential effectiveness of angry youth in postmodern coups has long been under study. As far back as 1967, Dr. Fred Emery, then director of the Tavistock Institute, and an expert on the “hypnotic effects” of television, specified that the then new phenomenon of “swarming adolescents” found at rock concerts could be effectively used to bring down the nation-state by the end of the 1990s. This was particularly the case, as Dr. Emery reported in “The next thirty years: concepts, methods and anticipations,” in the group’s “Human Relations,” because the phenomena was associated with “rebellious hysteria.” The British military created the Tavistock Institute as its psychological warfare arm following World War I; it has been the forerunner of such strategic planning ever since. Dr. Emery’s concept saw immediate application in NATO’s use of “swarming adolescents” in toppling French President Charles De Gaulle in 1967. In November 1989, Case Western Reserve in Cleveland, Ohio, under the aegis of that university’s “Program for Social Innovations in Global Management,” began a series of conferences to review progress towards that strategic objective, which was reported on in “Human Relations” in 1991. There, Dr. Howard Perlmutter, a professor of “Social Architecture” at the Wharton School, and a follower of Dr. Emery, stressed that “rock video in Katmandu,” was an appropriate image of how states with traditional cultures could be destabilized, thereby creating the possibility of a “global civilization.” There are two requirements for such a transformation, he added, “building internationally committed networks of international and locally committed organizations,” and “creating global events” through “the transformation of a local event into one having virtually instantaneous international implications through mass-media.” This brings us to the final ingredient of these new coups — the deployment of polling agencies’ “exit polls” broadcast on international television to give the false (or sometimes accurate) impression of massive vote-fraud by the ruling party, to put targeted states on the defensive. Polling operations in the recent coups have been overseen by such outfits as Penn, Schoen and Berland, top advisors to Microsoft and Bill Clinton. Praising their role in subverting Serbia, then Secretary of State Madeleine Albright (and later Chairman of NDI) , in an October 2000 letter to the firm quoted on its website, stated: “Your work with the National Democratic"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 244 Institute and the Yugoslav opposition contributed directly and decisively to the recent breakthrough for democracy in that country . . . This may be one of the first instances where polling has played such an important role in setting and securing foreign policy objectives.” Penn, Schoen, together with the OSCE, also ran the widely televised “exit poll” operations in the Ukrainian elections. In the aftermath of such youth deployments and media operations, more traditional elements come to the fore. That is, the forceful, if covert, intervention by international institutions and governments threatening the targeted regime, and using well placed operatives within the targeted regime’s military and intelligence services to ensure no countermeasures can be effectively deployed. Without these traditional elements, of course, no postmodern coup could ever work. Or, as Jack DuVall put it in Jesse Walker’s “Carnival and conspiracy in Ukraine,” in Reason Online, November 30, 2004, “You can’t simply parachute Karl Rove into a country and manufacture a revolution.” GLADIO AND JAMES BOND GET A YOUTH GROUP The creation and deployment of coups of any kind requires agents on the ground. The main handler of these coups on the “street side” has been the Albert Einstein Institution, which was formed in 1983 as an offshot of Harvard University under the impetus of Dr. Gene Sharp, and which specializes in “nonviolence as a form of warfare.” Dr. Sharp had been the executive secretary of A.J. Muste, the famous U.S. Trotskyite labor organizer and peacenik. The group is funded by Soros and the NED. Albert Einstein’s president is Col. Robert Helvey, a former US Army officer with 30 years of experience in Southeast Asia. He has served as the case officer for youth groups active in the Balkans and Eastern Europe since at least 1999. Col. Helvey reports, in a January 29, 2001, interview with film producer Steve York in Belgrade, that he first got involved in “strategic nonviolence” upon seeing the failure of military approaches to toppling dictators — especially in Myanmar, where he had been stationed as military attaché — and seeing the potential of Sharp’s alternative approach. According to B. Raman, the former director of India’s foreign intelligence agency, RAW, in a December 2001 paper published by his institute entitled, “The USA’s National Endowment For Democracy (NED): An Update,” Helvey “was an officer of the Defence Intelligence Agency of the Pentagon, who had served in Vietnam and, subsequently, as the US Defence Attache in Yangon,"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"The new Gladio in action: “Swarming Adolescents” 245 Myanmar (1983 to 85), during which he clandestinely organised the Myanmarese students to work behind Aung San Suu Kyi and in collaboration with Bo Mya’s Karen insurgent group. . . . He also trained in Hong Kong the student leaders from Beijing in mass demonstration techniques which they were to subsequently use in the Tiananmen Square incident of June 1989” and “is now believed to be acting as an adviser to the Falun Gong, the religious sect of China, in similar civil disobedience techniques.” Col. Helvey nominally retired from the army in 1991, but had been working with Albert Einstein and Soros long before then. Reflecting Albert Einstein’s patronage, one of its first books was Dr. Sharp’s “Making Europe Unconquerable: The Potential of Civilian-Based Deterrence and Defense,” published in 1985 with a forward by George Kennan, the famous “Mr. X” 1940’s architect of the Cold War who was also a founder of the CIA’s Operations division. There, Sharp reports that “civilian-based defense” could counter the Soviet threat through its ability “to deter and defeat attacks by making a society ungovernable by would be oppressors” and “by maintaining a capacity for orderly self-rule even in the face of extreme threats and actual aggression.” He illustrates its feasibility by discussing the examples of the Algerian independence in 1961 and the Czechoslovakian resistance to Soviet invasion in 1968-9. In his foreword, Kennan praises Sharp for showing the “possibilities of deterrence and resistance by civilians” as a “partial alternative to the traditional, purely military concepts of national defense.” The book was promptly translated into German, Norwegian, Italian, Danish, and other NATO country languages. See the link to the Italian translation of the book ( Verso un’Europa Inconquistabile. 190 pp. 1989 Introduction by Gianfranco Pasquino ) that sports a series of fashionable sociologists and “politologists” prefacing the book and calling for a civil resistance to a possible Soviet invasion of Italy. Such formulations suggest that Albert Einstein activities were, ironically, coherent (or, possibly updating) the infamous NATO’s “Gladio” stay-behind network, whose purpose was to combat possible Soviet occupation through a panoply of military and nonmilitary means. The investigations into Gladio, and those following the 1978 assassination of former Prime Minister Aldo Moro, also shed some light (immediately switched off) on a professional apparatus of destabili- zation that had been invisible for several decades to the public."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 24 6 It is noteworthy that the former deputy chief of intelligence for the US Army in Europe, Major General Edward Atkeson, first “suggested the name ‘civilian based defense’ to Sharp,” John M. Mecartney, Coordinator of the Nonviolent Action for National Defense Institute, reports in his group’s CBD News and Opinion of March 1991. By 1985, Gen. Atkeson, then retired from the US Army, was giving seminars at Harvard entitled “Civilian-based Defense and the Art of War. The Albert Einstein Institution reports, in its “1994-99 Report on Activities,” that Gen. Atkeson also served on Einstein’s advisory board in those years. Following his posting as the head of US Army intelligence in Europe, and possibly concurrently with his position at the Albert Einstein Institution, the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) reports that Gen. Atkeson, who also advised CSIS on “international security.” served as “national intelligence officer for general purpose forces on the staff of the director of Central Intelligence.” A 1990 variant of Sharp’s book, “Civilian-Based Defense: A Post- Military Weapons System,“ the Albert Einstein Institution reports, “was used in 1991 and 1992 by the new independent governments of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in planning their defense against Soviet efforts to regain control.” As we shall see below, with such backing, Col. Helvey and his colleagues have created a series of youth movements including Otpor in Serbia, Kmara in Georgia, Pora in Ukraine, and the like, which are already virally replicating other sects throughout the former Soviet Union, achieving in civilian form what had not been possible militarily in the 1980s. The groups are also spreading to Africa and South America. AND DOPE TOO? Col. Helvey’s long experience in Myanmar in training insurgent ethnic minorities in a region that is the center of world opium production raises another question of great bearing on “post modern coups.” That is: what is the role of narcotic mafias in facilitating “regime change?” Law enforcement agencies from many nations, including the United States, have long reported that the Balkans is the major narcotics pipeline into Western Europe. Ukraine is said to be a top conduit, as is Georgia. Kyrghyzstan, now at the top of the hit list, is another opium conduit. And George Soros “the Daddy Warbucks of"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"The new Gladio in action: “Swarming Adolescents” 24 7 drug legalization,” has been the top “private” funder of all the Eastern European and Central Asian insurgent groups, as well as those in Myamar. The spread of such mafias, is, of course, one of the most efficient ways of infiltrating and corrupting government agencies of targeted states. Col. Helvey is not the only operator with such a background. The head of the OSCE’s vote monitoring operation in Ukraine, for example, Geert-Hinrich Ahrens, was German Ambassador to Colombia in the late 1990s, when German secret agent Werner Mauss was arrested for working closely with the narco-terrorist ELN, whose bombings are financed by the cocaine trade. Ahrens was also on the scene in Albania and Macedonia, when the narcotics smuggling Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) was created with US and German patronage. And Michael Kozak, the US ambassador whose 2001 effort to overthrow Belarus’ Lukachenko failed, had been a top handler of the cocaine-smuggling Contras. THE SERBIAN VIRUS The networks and methods used in the Serbian through Ukraine sequence were first publicly revealed in a Washington Post article on Dec. 11, 2000, by Michael Dobbs, entitled. “U.S. Advice Guided Milosevic Opposition: Political Consultants Helped Yugoslav Opposition Topple Authoritarian Leader.” He reports that: U.S.-funded consultants played a crucial role behind the scenes in virtually every facet of the anti-Milosevic drive, running tracking polls, training thousands of opposition activists and helping to organize a vitally important parallel vote count. U.S. taxpayers paid for 5,000 cans of spray paint used by student activists to scrawl anti-Milosevic graffiti on walls across Serbia, and 2.5 million stickers with the slogan “He’s Finished,” which became the revolution’s catchphrase. Some Americans involved in the anti-Milosevic effort said they were aware of CIA activity at the fringes of the campaign, but had trouble finding out what the agency was up to. Whatever it was, they concluded it was not particularly effective. The lead role was taken by the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, the government’s foreign assistance agency, which channeled the funds through commercial contractors and nonprofit groups such as NDI and its Republican counterpart, the International Republican Institute (IRI)."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 248 While NDI worked closely with Serbian opposition parties, IRI focused its attention on Otpor, which served as the revolution’s ideological and organizational backbone. In March, IRI paid for two dozen Otpor leaders to attend a seminar on nonviolent resistance at the Hilton Hotel in Budapest, a few hundreds yards along the Danube from the NDI-favored Marriott. During the seminar, the Serbian students received training in such matters as how to organize a strike, how to communicate with symbols, how to overcome fear and how to undermine the authority of a dictatorial regime. The principal lecturer was retired U.S. Army Col. Robert Helvey, who has made a study of nonviolent resistance methods around the world, including those used in modern-day Burma and the civil rights struggle in the American South. Helvey, who served two tours in Vietnam, introduced the Otpor activists to the ideas of American theoretician Gene Sharp, whom he describes as “the Clausewitz of the nonviolence movement,” referring to the renowned Prussian military strategist. Peter Ackerman, the above-mentioned coup expert, analyzed and popularized the methods involved in a 2001 PBS documentary-series and book, “A Force More Powerful: A Century of Nonviolent Conflict,” together with retired US Airforce officer Jack DuVall. Focusing on youth organizing, they report: After the NATO bombing, which had helped the regime suppress opposition, Otpor’s organizing took hold with a quiet vengeance. It was built in some places around clubhouses where young people could go and hang out, exercise, and party on the weekends, or more often it was run out of dining rooms and bedrooms in activists’ homes. These were “boys and girls 18 and 19 years old” who had lived “in absolute poverty compared to other teenagers around the world,” according to Stanko Lazendic, an Otpor activist in Novi Sad. “Otpor offered these kids a place to gather, a place where they could express their creative ideas.” In a word, it showed them how to empower themselves. Otpor’s leaders knew that they “couldn’t use force on someone who . . . had three times more force and weapons than we did,” in the words of Lazendic. “We knew what had happened in. Tiananmen, where the army plowed over students with tanks.” So violence"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"The new Gladio in action: “Swarming Adolescents” 249 wouldn’t work — and besides, it was the trademark of Milosevic, and Otpor had to stand for something different. Serbia “was a country in which violence was used too many times in daily politics,” noted Srdja Popovic, a 27 year-old who called himself Otpor’s “ideological commissar.” The young activists had to use nonviolent methods “to show how superior, how advanced, how civilized” they were. This relatively sophisticated knowledge of how to develop nonviolent power was not intuitive. Miljenko Dereta, the director of a private group in Belgrade called Civic Initiatives, got funding from Freedom House in the U.S. to print and distribute 5,000 copies of Gene Sharp’s book, “ From Dictatorship to Democracy: A Conceptual Framework for Liberation .” Otpor got hold of Sharp’s main three-volume work, “ The Politics of Nonviolent Action, ” freely adapting sections of it into a Serbian- language notebook they dubbed the “Otpor User Manual.” Consciously using this “ideology of nonviolent, individual resistance,” in Popovic’s words, activists also received direct training from Col. Robert Helvey, a colleague of Sharp, at the Budapest Hilton in March 2000. Helvey emphasized how to break the people’s habits of subservience to authority, and also how to subvert: the regime’s “pillars of s upport,” including the police and armed forces. Crucially, he warned them against “contaminants to a nonviolent struggle,” especially violent action, which would deter ordinary people from joining the movement: and alienate the international community, from which material and financial assistance could be drawn. As Popovic put it: “Stay nonviolent and you will get the support of the third party.” That support, largely denied to the Serbian opposition before, now began to flow. Otpor and other dissident groups received funding from the National Endowment for Democracy, affiliated with the U.S. government, and Otpor leaders sat down with Daniel Serwer, the program director for the Balkans at the U.S. Institute for Peace, whose story of having been tear-gassed during an anti-Vietnam War demonstration gave him special credibility in their eyes. The International Republican Institute, also financed by the U.S. government, channeled funding to the opposition and met with Otpor leaders several times. The U.S. Agency for International Development, the wellspring for most of this financing, was also the source of money that went for materials like t-shirts and stickers."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 250 NO LACK OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYMENT In the aftermath of the Serbian revolution, the National Endowment for Democracy, Albert Einstein Institution, and related outfits helped establish several Otpor-modeled youth groups in Eastern Europe, notably Zubr in Belarus in January 2001; Kmara in Georgia, in April 2003; and Pora in Ukraine in June 2004. Efforts to overthrow Belarus President Alexsander Luschenko failed in 2001, while the US over– throw of Georgian President Eduard Schevardnadze was successfully accomplished in 2003, using Kmara as part of its operation. Commenting on that expansion, Albert Einstein staffer Chris Miller, in his report on a 2001 trip to Serbia found on the group’s website, reports: Since the ousting of Milosevic, several members of Otpor have met with members of the Belarusian group Zubr (Bison). In following developments in Belarus since early this year, it is clear that Zubr was developed or at least conceptualized, using Otpor as a model. Also, [Albert Einstein’s report] From Dictatorship to Democracy is available in English on the Zubr website at www.zubr-belarus.com. Of course, success will not be achieved in Belarus or anywhere else, simply by mimicking the actions taken in Serbia. However the successful Serbian nonviolent struggle was highly influenced and aided by the availability of knowledge and information on strategic nonviolent struggle and both successful and unsuccessful past cases, which is transferable. Otpor focused on building their human resources, especially among youth. An Otpor training manual to “train future trainers” was developed, which contained excerpts from The Politics of Nonviolent Action, provided to Otpor by Robert Helvey during his workshop in Budapest for Serbs in early 2000. It may be applicable for other countries. And with funding provided by Freedom House and the US government, Otpor established the Center for Nonviolent Resistance, in Budapest, to train these groups. Describing the deployment of this youth movement, Ian Trainor, in the above cited Guardian November 2004 article, reports: In the centre of Belgrade, there is a dingy office staffed by computer-literate youngsters who call themselves the Centre for Non-violent Resistance.

They emerged from the anti-Milosevic student movement, Otpor, meaning resistance. The catchy, single-word branding is important. In Georgia last year, the parallel student movement was Khmara. In Belarus, it was Zubr. In Ukraine, it is Pora, meaning high time. Stickers, spray paint and websites are the young activists’ weapons. Irony and street comedy mocking the regime have been hugely successful in puncturing public fear and enraging the powerful. Last year, before becoming president in Georgia, the US-educated Mr Saakashvili travelled from Tbilisi to Belgrade to be coached in the techniques of mass defiance. In Belarus, the US embassy organised the dispatch of young opposition leaders to the Baltic, where they met up with Serbs travelling from Belgrade. In Serbia’s case, given the hostile environment in Belgrade, the Americans organised the overthrow from neighbouring Hungary — Budapest and Szeged. In recent weeks, several Serbs travelled to the Ukraine. Indeed, one of the leaders from Belgrade, Aleksandar Maric, was turned away at the border. The Democratic party’s National Democratic Institute, the Republican party’s International Republican Institute, the US State Department and USAID are the main agencies involved in these grassroots campaigns as well as the Freedom House NGO and billionaire George Soros’s Open Society Institute. An Associated Press article by Dusan Stojanovic, on November 2, 2004, entitled “Serbia’s export: Peaceful Revolution,” elaborates: “We knew there would be work for us after Milosevic,” said Danijela Nenadic, a program coordinator of the Belgrade-based Center for Nonviolent Resistance. The nongovernmental group emerged from Otpor, the pro-democracy movement that helped sweep Milosevic from power by organizing massive and colorful protests that drew crowds who never previously had the courage to oppose the former Yugoslav president. In Ukraine and Belarus, tens of thousands of people have been staging daily protests — carbon copies of the anti-Milosevic rallies — with “training” provided by the Serbian group."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 252 The group says it has “well-trained” followers in Ukraine and Belarus. In Georgia, Ukraine and Belarus, anti-government activists “saw what we did in Serbia and they contacted us for professional training,” group member Sinisa Sikman said. Last year, Otpor’s clenched fist was flying high on white flags again — this time in Georgia, when protesters stormed the parliament in an action that led to the toppling of Shevardnadze. Last month, Ukrainian border authorities denied entry to Alexandar Maric, a member of Otpor and an adviser with the U.S.-based democracy watchdog Freedom House. A Ukrainian student group called Pora was following the strategies of Otpor. James Woolsey’s Freedom House “expressed concern” over Maric’s deportation, in an October 14, 2004, press release which reported that he was traveling to Ukraine as part of “an initiative run by Freedom House, the National Democratic Institute, and the International Republican Institute to promote civic participation and oversight during the 2004 presidential and 2006 parliamentary elections in Ukraine.” In a related statement, it added that it hoped the deportation was not a sign of the Ukrainian government’s “unwillingness to allow the free flow of information and learning across borders that is an integral and accepted part of programs to encourage democratic progress in diverse societies around the world.” Timeline: • Otpor founded in Belgrade, Serbia in October 1998.

BOB HELVEY? Who is Col. Bob Helvey, who personally, and through his Albert Einstein Institution, played such a key role in the Serbian and Ukrainian coups? According to his own account, Helvey first got involved in “strategic nonviolence” upon seeing the failures of military approaches to toppling dictators, especially in Myanmar (also known as Burma). In a January 29, 2001, interview with Steve York in Belgrade, Helvey stated: My career has been that of a professional soldier. And one of my last assignments was to be the defense attaché in Rangoon [Myanmar]. And I really had an opportunity — two years living in Rangoon and getting around the country — to really see first hand what happens when a people are oppressed to the point that they’re absolutely terrorized. And, you know, there was no future for people and there was a struggle for democracy going on, but it was an armed struggle on the periphery of the country and in the border regions. And it was very clear that that armed struggle was never going to succeed. So, when I got back [to the US], I kept Burma in the back of my mind. Here were a people that really wanted democracy, really wanted political reform, but the only option they had was armed struggle. And that was really a nonstarter, so there was really a sense of helplessness. Back in the US, he reports, he was selected as senior fellow at the Harvard Center for International Affairs — while still an active duty officer, where he attended a meeting on a “Program for Nonviolent Sanctions.” Dr. Gene Sharp happened to be there. And he started out the seminar by saying, “Strategic nonviolent struggle is all about political power. How to seize political power and how to deny it to others.” And I thought, “Boy, this guy’s talking my language.” And, you know, that’s what armed struggle is about. So I got interested in this approach because I saw immediately that there may be an opportunity here for the Burmese. And how did he get involved in Serbia?"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 254 I had done some work along the Thai-Burmese border with the International Republican Institute. So when they were looking for someone to present information on strategic nonviolent struggle to a Serb group, they called me. The Albert Einstein Institution repeatedly emphasizes Col. Helvey’s role in training the Myanmar opposition, and a substantial amount of the group’s web page stresses the group’s involvement there. Reflecting this preoccupation, Albert Einstein’s writings have repeatedly been translated not only into Burmen, but also into Karen, Chin, Mon, Jingphaw and several other ethnic minority languages and dialects in that country. The Albert Einstein Institute does not emphasize, however, that even the US State Department and Drug Enforcement Agency identify the ethnic minority opposition to the Myanmar government as comprising the world’s largest producers of opium and heroin. The DEA’s 2002 “Drug Intelligence Brief: Burma: Country Brief,” for example, states: Armed ethnic minority groups who have been in conflict with the GOB [Government of Burma, aka Myanmar ed] for decades control cultivation, production, and trafficking in Burma. . . . The drug trafficking groups operating within Burma are mostly insurgent factions that have been warring with the GOB and among themselves for many years. Special note should be made here of Bo Mya and his Karen group, which Col. Helvey has advised for years. Bo Mya, now retired, has admitted to have held meetings with Burmese drug king pin Khun Sa, that Khun Sa said were held in an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate opium and heroin routes of Myanmar and Thailand. (Bo Mya has denied Myanmar government allegations of his involvement in the narcotics trade.) According to Khun Sa’s statements — later made famous by the US military “Missing in Action” investigator “Bo” Gritz — his opium trafficking was done under the coordination of Richard Armitage, currently US Undersecretary of State.

Helvey’s precise relations with the late former CIA deputy director Theodore Shackley, who had been widely accused of overseeing this narcotics trafficking, remain unknown, such reports"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"The new Gladio in action: “Swarming Adolescents” 255 do lend credence to claims that narcotics syndicates have played a pivotal role in the recent coups in the Balkans, and now Ukraine, which comprise an important route for Southeast Asian heroin entering Western Europe. MYANMAR OPERATIONS In its “Report on Activities, 1993-1999,” the Albert Einstein Institution laid great stress on the importance of Helvey’s operations to subvert the Myanmar regime as a centerpiece of their activities. In fact, the first paragraph of the introduction of the report reads: Colonel Kyaw Thein was clearly unhappy with our workshop on nonviolent struggle held along the Thai-Burma border. At a September 1996 press briefing in Rangoon, the spokesman for the military dictatorship charged that “aliens and mercenaries” were trying to “disrupt the peace and tranquility” in Burma — as if widespread torture, forced labor, and other human rights atrocities constitute “tranquility.” The military official was incensed by an ever increasing global phenomenon: direct transnational assistance and cooperation between nongovernmental organizations and pro-democracy groups around the world, in this case of course, in Burma. The Albert Einstein Institution’s groundbreaking outreach on strategic nonviolent struggle is but one example of this growing trend that moves beyond traditional humanitarian and human rights efforts. . . . The impetus for our intensive workshops on nonviolent struggle for Burmese groups came in November 1991, when Robert Helvey, a retired U.S. Army colonel and former U.S. military attaché in Burma, requested that we assist in reviewing lesson plans for an introductory course in nonviolent struggle. Mr. Helvey designed the course for Burmese opposition groups in part by relying on Gene Sharp’s The Politics of Nonviolent Action. The May 1992 course, conducted inside Burma at the opposition headquarters at Manerplaw, was extremely well received. In fact, when leading Burmese opposition groups formed the umbrella organization National Council of the Union of Burma in August 1992, they also established a “Political Defiance Committee” to educate activists and to organize strategic nonviolent struggle inside Burma (“political defiance” is the term adopted in Burma to connote nonviolent struggle)."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 25 6 Senior pro-democracy leaders requested additional workshops from Robert Helvey and the Albert Einstein Institution. A Fall 1992 article in “Nonviolent Sanctions” by Gene Sharp, entitled “Exploring Nonviolent Struggle in Thailand and Burma,” and found on Albert Einstein’s website, describes their role in Myanmar, and in particular Col. Helvey’s role: Gene Sharp traveled to Thailand and Burma in the fall, October 20–November 8, 1992, in response to two invitations. The American Friends of Democracy in Burma (headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia) asked him to help evaluate a course on “Political Defiance” that had been taught in Mannerplaw by Robert Helvey for the Democratic Alliance of Burma. “After two days rest and orientation in Bangkok, I traveled to Mannerplaw, a base camp for the Burmese democratic opposition located along the Thai-Burma border. . . . During my four days in Mannerplaw I participated in a variety of meetings and discussions about nonviolent struggle (or political defiance as it is more often called there). These included meetings with top political officials, military officers, and leaders of the All Burma Students’ Democratic Front, the National League for Democracy, the Karen Youth Organization Leadership Seminar, the Democratic Alliance of Burma, and the Political Defiance Committee.” Robert Helvey, a retired U.S. Army colonel and an expert on Burma, began offering a course on political defiance to groups in Mannerplaw last spring. The aim of this intensive course is to give participants a basic understanding of the technique of nonviolent struggle. At the end of the course, students are expected to understand the insights into political power on which political defiance is based, and also to have developed an understanding of the technique’s multiple methods, its dynamics of conflict against a repressive regime, the mechanisms of change, and the principles of strategy in nonviolent struggle. Peace Magazine , in its April June 2003 issue, contains further details on Helvey’s career, in a laudatory article entitled “Robert Helvey’s Expert Political Defiance.” From 1983 until 1985 Helvey was a US military attaché at the American Embassy in Rangoon, where he was dismayed by the futility of armed resistance to the brutal dictatorship of Burma."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"The new Gladio in action: “Swarming Adolescents” 25 7 An armed struggle had continued without success for over two decades. After retiring from the army in 1991, Helvey gave a speech in Washington, using Sharp’s insights and adding his own. A member of the audience later offered to pay his way to Burma to spread his message. With this funding, from 1992 to 1998, he made 15 trips to the Thai-Burmese border to meet with more than 500 members of the National Council Union of Burma, a pro-democracy umbrella group. On eight occasions, Helvey taught a six-week course, seeking to build confidence, identify the dictatorship’s major weaknesses, and form pressure groups. Many of those attending Helvey’s course had been officers in armed resistance groups for many years and were skeptical about nonviolence. For example, Auun Nang Oo, who is now a fellow at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Nonviolence, was astonished that a career soldier could hold such views. Another unbeliever was General Bo Mya, the leader of the Karens, the biggest national minority. At first he would just grumble and grunt that he “wasn’t interested in doing the work of cowards.” To change such attitudes, Helvey coined the more militant-sounding phrase, “political defiance,” which won Bo over and caused him to ask Helvey to train more Karen leaders. The Myamar government has also commented on Col. Helvey’s career. For example, at a June 27, 1997 press conference entitled “How some Western powers have been aiding and abetting terrorism committed by certain organizations operating under the guise of democracy and human rights by giving them assistance in both cash and kind.” There, Lt-Gen Khin Nyunt, at the time Secretary-1 of the State Law and Order Restoration Council of Myanmar, said of Helvey: He was assigned to Myanmar as Defense Attache (Army) at the U.S. embassy in Myanmar from 1982 to 1984 with the rank of full colonel. On conclusion of his assignment in Myanmar he went home, retired immediately from the US Army and returned to the Myanmar- Thai border. He is military advisor to the KNU, KNPP and the Democratic Party for New Society, personally giving military training and manipulating the armed groups in various ways right up till now. The Myamar government newspaper, New Light of Myanmar, on February 4, 1995, also reported on Helvey’s involvement with insurgent groups then working with opium kingpin Khun Sa."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 258 As the second strategy of the NCUB [National Coalition Union of Burma] , it formed the Political Defiance Committee with the objective to use all sorts of subversive acts so that the people will have wrong impressions of the Government and lose their respect on it and so disturbances and upheavals will break out in the country. Thus, they made contacts with underground elements within the country and distributed agitative pamphlets, set off bombs in townships to disturb peace and tranquility and cause disturbances and resorted to other disruptive acts. Those who gave training in political defiance (PD) activities were a former retired US Defence Attache Robert Helvey and one Gene Sharp. It was seen that during the three-year period of extending invitation for peace, the KNU were bent on undermining the interest of the people. KNU Bo Mya sent KNU Lt-Col Law Wadi, demolition expert Lt-Col Saw Isaac, to drug warlord Khun Sa at Homein Camp and had discussions from 10 to 12 April 1994 on cooperation between KNU and MTA, assisting in making land mines and arms and ammunition and other economic cooperation. THE COUP PLOTTERS The Albert Einstein Institution The Albert Einstein Institution (AEI) has played the key role in recent years in training and deploying youth movements to help prepare the conditions for coups through fostering the impression that the targeted regimes are deeply unpopular, and through destabilizing those regimes through their demonstrations and the like. The group, which is funded by the Soros foundations and the US government, is led by former DIA officer Col. Robert Helvey, and Harvard University’s Dr. Gene Sharp. According to the Albert Einstein Institution’s report, Dr Gene Sharp (curriculum vitae and Biographical Profile) “founded the Albert Einstein Institution in 1983 to promote research, policy studies, and education on the strategic uses of nonviolent struggle in face of dictatorship, war, genocide, and oppression.” Dr. Sharp has held research appointments in Harvard University’s Center for International Affairs for nearly 30 years. His writings, which on the strategic use of nonviolence in overturning states, have been translated into 27 languages. Through funding provided by the Soros foundations, and through the National Endowment of"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"The new Gladio in action: “Swarming Adolescents” 259 Democracy and other US government conduits, Sharp and his associates have regularly traveled to targeted regions to facilitate revolutions, since the group’s creation. According to Sharp, “If the issue is to bring down a dictatorship, then it is not good enough to say, ‘we want freedom.’ It’s necessary to develop a strategy, or a super-plan, to weaken a dictatorship and that can only be done by identifying its sources of power. These [sources of power] include: authority, human resources skills, knowledge, tangible factors, economic and material resources and sanctions like police and troops.” For this reason, Sharp reports, he has written numerous books on nonviolent struggle to help oppressed peoples develop a “superplan.” These works, of which the major one is “The Politics of Nonviolent Action,” have been translated into 27 languages. Among these languages are Russian, Ukrainian, Latvian, Estonian, Macedonian, Arabic, Tamil, Burmese, Karen (and several other Burmese minority languages), Thai, Chinese, Korean, as well as French, Dutch, Spanish, German, Italian, and other European languages still spoken in former colonies. While Sharp is the main theoretician of the group (and officially its senior scholar), its more practical work is overseen by its president, Colonel Robert Helvey, who began working with the center even before officially retiring from the US Army in 1991. A 30-year veteran of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Helvey had practical experience in subversive operations throughout Southeast Asia prior to his work with the institution.

Helvey reports: Strategic nonviolent struggle must be recognized as a subject that can be understood and applied by all who seek to throw off the yoke of governmental oppression. . . . The assumption that there is no realistic alternative to violence in extreme situations is contradicted by various cases of important nonviolent struggles in several countries in recent decades. These include Norway, Germany, France, Czechoslovakia, the Philippines, the Soviet Union, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Serbia, El Salvador, Guatemala, India, and others. Many earlier cases of improvised nonviolent struggle occurred and are also relevant. Usually the importance of these history-making nonviolent struggles has been trivialized or ignored. Although there have also been some failures in nonviolent struggle, such as in China and Burma, the fact that these cases could have been waged at all, and that numerous nonviolent struggles have succeeded, is highly important. International Center on Nonviolent Conflicts The International Center on Nonviolent Conflicts has been heavily involved in the new Postmodern Coups, especially through its top figures, Dr. Peter Ackerman and Jack DuVall. According to its website, the center “develops and encourages the use of civilian-based, nonmilitary strategies to establish and defend democracy and human rights worldwide.” It “provides assistance in the training and deployment of field advisors, to deepen the conceptual knowledge and practical skills of applying nonviolent"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"The new Gladio in action: “Swarming Adolescents” 261 strategies in conflicts throughout the world where progress toward democracy and human rights is possible.” The most significant nonviolent conflicts in the world today, which may lead to “regime changes,” it reports, are occurring in Myanmar, Zimbabwe, Chinese Tibet, Belarus, Ukraine [now nearing completion], Palestine, Iran, and Cuba. Dr. Peter Ackerman is the founding chairman of the center. He is currently the chairman of the Board of Overseers of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy of Tufts University, an important US intelligence recruitment center, and is on the Executive Council of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. Dr Ackerman was also a founding director of the Albert Einstein Institution. Dr. Ackerman was the executive producer of the PBS-TV documentary, “Bringing Down a Dictator,“ on the fall of Slobodan Milosevic, which has since been translated into Arabic, Farsi, French, Mandarin, Russian, and Spanish. He was also the series editor and principal content advisor behind the PBS-TV series, “A Force More Powerful,” which documents the use of nonviolence in regime changes. It has been translated into Arabic, Farsi, Mandarin, Russian and Spanish. Ackerman is the co-author of two books on nonviolent resistance: A Force More Powerful (Palgrave/St. Martin’s Press 2001), which is a companion book to the television series, and Strategic Nonviolent Conflict: The Dynamics of People Power in the Twentieth Century (Praeger 1994). He regularly lectures on the use of the nonviolence in toppling target states, including at the State Department. Former Air Force officer Jack DuVall, is the president of the center, and was one of its founders. Like Dr. Ackerman, DuVall gives frequent lectures nationally and internationally on the strategic use of nonviolence. The center’s vice chairman, Berel Rodal, is the former director- general of the Policy Secretariat of the Canadian Department of National Defence. The Arlington Institute The Arlington Institute (TAI), is an apparent strategist in the use of postmodern coups. It was founded in 1989 by John L.

The need for an organization like the Arlington Institute, its website reports, “evolved from the bipartisan, eighteen-month long National Security Group project that Petersen co-founded and jointly led in Washington, DC, in 1986-7. That ad-hoc group of national security experts was brought together to explore and map the security environment that the successful candidate would have to operate within after the 1988 presidential campaign. Petersen also wrote the final report for the group, ‘The Diffusion of Power: An Era of Realignment,’ which became a strategy document used at the highest levels of the Department of Defense.” “In the early part of the 90s,” it adds, “Petersen was engaged in a number of projects for the Department of Defense which functioned to build a systematic understanding of the major approaches that were then being used to study and anticipate futures. One notable project for the Office of the Secretary of Defense involved traveling throughout the world visiting the foremost practitioners of futures research to assess each methodology and attempt to develop a new, synthetic approach that drew from the best of the then current processes.” Petersen became an advisor to a number of senior defense officials during this time, serving in various personal support roles to the undersecretary of the Navy and the chief of Naval Operations, among others. Midway through the 1990s, it adds, “Petersen became convinced that humanity was living in an extraordinary time of change that would necessarily result in a major global shift within the following two decades. TAI committed itself to playing a significant role in facilitating a global transition to a new world that operates in a fundamentally different way from the past.” Penn, Schoen and Berland Associates Penn, Schoen and Berland (PSB) has played a pioneering role in the use of polling operations, especially “exit polls,” in facilitating"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"The new Gladio in action: “Swarming Adolescents” 263 coups.

His message, delivered to leaders of Serbia’s traditionally fractious opposition, was simple and powerful. Slobodan Milosevic — survivor of four lost wars, two major street uprisings, 78 days of NATO bombing and a decade of international sanctions — was “completely vulnerable” to a well- organized electoral challenge. The key, the poll results showed, was opposition unity. Held in a luxury hotel in Budapest, the Hungarian capital, in October 1999, the closed-door briefing by Schoen, a Democrat, turned out to be a seminal event, pointing the way to the electoral revolution that brought down Milosevic a year later. It also marked the start of an extraordinary U.S. effort to unseat a foreign head of state, not through covert action of the kind the CIA once employed in such places as Iran and Guatemala, but by modern election campaign techniques. Milosevic’s strongest political card was the disarray and ineffectiveness of his opponents. The opposition consisted of nearly two dozen political parties, some of whose leaders were barely on speaking terms with one another. It was against this background that 20 opposition leaders accepted an invitation from the Washington-based National Democratic Institute (NDI) in October 1999 to a seminar at the Marriott Hotel in Budapest, overlooking the Danube River. The key item on the agenda: an opinion poll commissioned by the U.S. polling firm Penn, Schoen & Berland Associates. The poll reported that Milosevic had a 70 percent unfavorable rating among Serbian voters. But it also showed that the big names in the opposition — men such as Zoran Djindjic and Vuk Draskovic — were burdened with negative poll ratings almost as high as Milosevic’s. Among the candidates best placed to challenge Milosevic, the poll suggested, was a moderate Serbian nationalist named Vojislav Kostunica, who had a favorable rating of 49 percent and an unfavorable rating of only 29 percent."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"The new Gladio in action: “Swarming Adolescents” 265 Schoen, who had provided polling advice to former Yugoslav prime minister Milan Panic during his unsuccessful 1992 campaign to depose Milosevic, drew several conclusions from these and other findings of the poll. . . . Most important, only a united opposition had a chance of deposing Milosevic. “If you take one word from this conference,” Schoen told the delegates, “I urge it to be unity.” Mark Penn has been president of the firm since its founding in 1975. He served as President Clinton’s pollster and political adviser for the 1996 re-election campaign and throughout the second term of the administration, including during the period he oversaw the Serbian election campaign which toppled President Milosevic. His influence over the Clinton administration was such that the Washington Post called him perhaps “the most powerful man in Washington you’ve never heard of”. According to the firm’s website, Penn helped elect 15 overseas Presidents in the Far East, Latin America, and Europe. Doug Schoen is the firm’s founding partner and a principal strategist. According to the firm, Schoen has, for the last 20 years “created winning messages and provided strategic advice to numerous political clients in the United States and to heads of state in countries around the world, including Greece, Turkey, Israel, the Philippines, the Dominican Republic, Bermuda and Yugoslavia.” Additionally, he was “President William Jefferson Clinton’s research and strategic consultant during the 1996 reelection, and has been widely credited with creating and effectively communicating the message that turned around the president’s political fortunes between 1994 and 1996.” Alan Fleischmann, who runs the firm’s Washington offices, is described as a “specialist in strategic and crisis communications who has served in domestic and overseas senior management posts in the private and public sectors, specializing in finance, public and foreign policy, marketing, communications, negotiation, mediation, and strategy.

Tarpley which appeared in Project Democracy: The Parallel Government Behind the Iran-Contra Affair , published by EIR in April 1987.) Even in an epoch full of big lies like the late 20th century, it is ironic that the financiers of the Trilateral Commission should have chosen the name “Project Democracy” to denote their organized efforts to install a fascist, totalitarian regime in the United States and a fascist New Order around the world. It is ironic that so many of the operatives engaged, in the name of “democracy” in this insidious, creeping coup d’état against the United States Constitution should be first and second- generation followers of the Soviet Russian universal fascist, Nikolai Bukharin. Though ironic, all these propositions are indeed true. Project Democracy is fascist, designed to culminate in the imposition of fascist institutions on the United States, institutions that combine the distilled essence of the Nazi Behemoth and the Bolshevik Leviathan. Project Democracy is high treason, a conspiracy for the overthrow of the Constitution. An organization whose stock in trade is the destabilization and the putsch in so many countries around the world can hardly be expected to halt its operations as it returns to the U.S. border. For Project Democracy, it can happen here, it will happen here. The greatest obstacle to understanding the monstrous purpose that lurks behind Project Democracy’s bland and edifying label is the continued ignorance on the part of the American public of the real nature of 20th-century totalitarian regimes. Despite the fact that Stalin deliberately helped bring Hitler and the Nazis to power, despite the Nazi-Communist alliance of 1939-41 under the Hitler- Stalin Pact, despite Mussolini’s close ties to Moscow, despite the deep affinity"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Project Democracy’s Program: the Fascist Corporate State 26 7 between Nazi-fascists and communists demonstrated repeatedly in many countries by mass exchanges of membership between political organizations of the two persuasions, the average American still sees communism and Nazism-fascism as polar opposites. The expression “fascist” exists only as a strongly derogatory but very vague epithet, empty of any precise political content. “Totalitarianism” is much more than just a dictatorship or authoritarian state. The totalitarian state seeks to dictate the behavior of its inmates down to the most minute detail, and creates for this purpose institutions that will allow that total surveillance and total control. In Byzantine-Orthodox civilization and in the Western totalitarianism copied from it, all departments of human endeavor, including economics, religion, sports, marriage, and even thinking are conceived of as departments of the state. Appropriate institutions are required to mediate totalitarian control in each of these areas. In totalitarianism, by contrast, both the individual and society disappear into the maw of the all-consuming Moloch, the state. A DEFINITION OF FASCISM Starting from these premises, it is possible to furnish a rough definition of modern fascism or Nazi-communism, the regime toward which Project Democracy is working. That definition contains the following elements: 1. Totalitarian fascism starts as a radical mass movement sponsored by bankers which, if it is able to seize power, produces a regime or governing system which seeks to mutilate, mortify, and crush the conception of the individual. As in the writings of Mussolini’s ideologue, Giovanni Gentile, or in the ravings of Michael Ledeen, the aspirations of the individual are rigidly subordinated to the exigencies of the regime. 2. The fascist regime is a government controlled in practice by a single party — a one-party state. 3. Fascist ideology, whatever its specific predicates, repudiates human reason and exalts irrationalism and irrationalist violence, often in the form of wanton military aggression and imperialism. A fascist mass movement is the most aggressive form of militant irrationalism. From Mussolini’s romanità through Hitler’s Herrenvolk , fascist ideology is based on notions of racial superiority and race hatred, extreme chauvinism, and blood and soil mysticism. Fascism is neo-"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 268 pagan and ferociously hostile to Augustinian Christianity, as can be shown from Mussolini’s early career and from Hitler’s private conversations. 4. Fascist economics is the murderous austerity associated with the names of Hitler’s finance minister, Hjalmar Schacht, and Mussolini’s finance minister, Count Giovanni Volpi di Misurata. The final logic of fascist economics is the concentration camp, the labor camp, the Gulag. Fascist irrationalism cannot tolerate scientific rationality on a broad scale, and is therefore correlated with hostility to technological innovation, and permanent peasant backwardness in agriculture. 5. The institutions through which totalitarian control of economic life is mediated merit special attention. In totalitarian regimes in the Western world, masses of labor have often been simply dragooned through institutions such as Dr. Ley’s Nazi Labor Front. But the characteristic institutions of fascism in the West are those of the so- called corporate state. In the fascist regime of Italy, Vichy France, and many others, it was the corporations which were to bring together ownership and employees, management and labor under the direct control of the one-party state for the purpose of extending totalitarian domination into the nooks and crannies of everyday economic life while at the same time fragmenting potentially rebellious workers along the lines of branches of industry. THE CORPORATIST PRINCIPLE This corporatist principle in fascism is so neglected and misunderstood that it merits our special attention, especially because the form of fascist totalitarianism which Project Democracy aims at is of a corporatist variety. The word corporation here has nothing to do with its usual English meaning of a joint-stock company. “Corporation” here means, approximately, a guild. For present purposes it is enough to recall that corporatism emerged as an irrational, solidarist opposition to capitalism and the United States Constitution during the period of the reactionary Holy Alliance after the end of the Napoleonic wars. Corporatism asserted that the way to overcome the tensions between labor and capital was not through the broad national community of interest prescribed by Alexander Hamilton’s American System of dirigist political economy, but rather through the artificial creation of medieval guild organizations, based on the pretense that capitalists were masters, and workers were"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Project Democracy’s Program: the Fascist Corporate State 269 journeymen and apprentices, all functioning together in “organic” unity. Thus, Mussolini advertised his fascist regime as the stato corporativo or corporate state, proclaiming that “O il fascismo sara corporativo o non sarà” (fascism is corporative or it is nothing). In German, the equivalent for stato corporativo is Ständestaat , wherein Stand has the meaning of estate or social group in the sense of aristocracy, clergy, and bourgeoisie, which along with the peasantry were the three “estates” of pre-revolutionary France. Hitler’s National Socialist German Workers Party was corporatist from the very beginning: point 25 of the “unalterable” program of the Nazis as adopted on Feb. 25, 1920 included the “creation of corporative and professional chambers” (“die Bildung von Stände- und Berufskammern zur Durchfuhrung der vom Reiche erlassenen Rahmengesetze in den einzelnen Bundesstaaten.) [Note 1] For a certain period after Hitler’s seizure of power in 1933, his regime referred to itself prominently as a Ständestaat, or corporate state. When Marshal Pétain and Pierre Laval created their Nazi puppet-state in Vichy, Pétain announced that one of the principal goals of his “national regeneration movement” was the creation of an ordre corporatif . Other fascist regimes, especially the many that were directly modeled on the Italian one, also stressed corporatism, so that corporatism emerges as the characteristic institutional structure of fascism. Theories of the corporate state can be traced back to Germans like Pesch and Kettler, or to the “guild socialism” of the Englishman William Morris. An early attempt to actually create a corporate state came in 1919, with the filibustering expedition to Fiume of Gabriele D’Annunzio, the protofascist of our epoch. D’ANNUNZIO AS SEEN BY LEDEEN The corporate state D’Annunzio attempted to create during his Fiume adventure is of double relevance to an analysis of the fascism of Project Democracy. On the one hand, D’Annunzio’s 16- month tenure as dictator in Fiume was the model and dress rehearsal for Mussolini’s March on Rome. On the other hand, D’Annunzio’s activities in Fiume have been the subject of a lengthy treatise by the most overt and blatantly fascist ideologue of Project Democracy, Michael Ledeen."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 270 Ledeen’s discussion of D’Annunzio in Fiume is to be found in his book, The First Duce . Ledeen celebrates the poetaster D’Annunzio as the founder not only of fascism, but of 20th-century politics in general, through his creation of a Nazi-communist mass movement of irrationalism: Virtually the entire ritual of Fascism came from the “Free State of Fiume”: the balcony address, the Roman salute, the cries of “aia, aia, alalà,” the dramatic dialogues with the crowd, the use of religious symbols in a new secular setting, the eulogies of the “martyrs” of the cause and the employment of their “relics” in political ceremonies. Moreover, quite aside from the poet’s contribution to the form and style of fascist politics, Mussolini’s movement first started to attract great strength when the future dictator supported D’Annunzio’s occupation of Fiume. (p. viii) D’Annunzio’s political style — the politics of mass manipulation, the politics of myth and symbol — have become the norm in the modern world. All too often politicians and parties have lost sight of the point of departure of our political behavior, believing that by now ours is the normal political universe and that the manipulation of the masses is essential in the political process. D’Annunzian Fiume seems to have marked a sort of watershed in this process, and that is perhaps the explanation for the fascinating symbiosis between themes of the “Right” and the “Left” in the rhetoric of the comandante . It is of the utmost importance for us to remind ourselves that D’Annunzio’s political appeal ranged from extreme Left to extreme Right, from leaders of the Russian Revolution to arch-reactionaries. (p. 202) Michael Ledeen is especially fascinated by D’Annunzio’s ability to re- create an “organic” unity out of the disparate elements of modern society: “At the core of D’Annunzian politics was the insight that many conflicting interests could be overcome and transcended in a new kind of movement.”(p. ix) For Ledeen, the key institutional feature of the D’Annunzian fascist order is the corporate state. The city of Fiume at the southern base of the Istrian peninsula was in 1919 a former territory of the newly defunct Austro-Hungarian Empire under dispute between Italy and the new nation of Yugoslavia, where the town is located today under the name of Rieka. Italy, having participated in the victorious cause of the Allies, desired to annex Fiume as it had the other Austro-Hungarian port of Trieste,"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"Project Democracy’s Program: the Fascist Corporate State 271 but the weak Nitti ministry hesitated to do so because of the opposition of France. France at that time was determined to emerge as the protector of the new states created in the Balkans by the Peace of Paris, and therefore supported the Yugoslav claim to Fiume, which the Yugoslavs saw as a key port. In order to force the hand of Nitti, D’Annunzio, starting from Venice, gathered a force of arditi , veterans of the elite shock troops of the Italian army, and seized Fiume in September 1919, demanding that Italy annex it. D’Annuzio’s regime, which he sometimes called a Regency, organized acts of terrorism and piracy. In November 1920, with the Treaty of Rapallo, Fiume was made a free city. D’Annunzio refused to accept this solution and Italian troops dispersed his “legions” some time later. The Fiume expedition was a classic example of Venetian cultural- political warfare, designed as a pilot project for fascist movements and coups in the aftermath of the hecatomb of the First World War. The centerpiece of the operation was the so-called Charter of Carnaro ( Carta del Carnaro ), the corporatist guild constitution for Fiume as an independent city- written by D’Annunzio in collaboration with the anarcho-syndicalist agitator Alceste de Ambris. The Carta del Carnaro was reminiscent of certain features of the Venetian Republic. Legislative power was vested in a bicameral legislature. One house was called the Consiglio degli Ottimi, or Council of the Best, and was elected on the basis of universal direct suffrage with one councilor per every thousand inhabitants. The Ottimi were to handle legislation regarding civil and criminal justice, police, the armed forces, education, intellectual life, and were also to govern the relations between the central government and subdivisions or states, called communes. The corporate chamber of the Fiume parliament was to be the Consiglio dei Provvisori, a kind of economic council. The Consiglio dei Provvisori was composed of representatives of nine guilds or corporations whose creation was also provided for in the document. These included the industrial and agricultural workers, the seafarers, and the employers, with 10 representatives each; the industrial and agricultural technicians, private bureaucrats and administrators, teachers and students, lawyers and doctors, civil servants, and cooperative workers, with five representatives from each group, for a grand total of 60. The Consiglio dei Provvisori was responsible for all laws regarding business and commerce. The Consiglio dei Provvisori also decided all matters touching labor, public services, transportation"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 272 and the merchant marine, tariffs and trade, public works, and medical and legal practice. The Ottimi served for a term of three years, and the Provvisori for two years. A third legislative body was prescribed, formed through the joint session of the Ottimi and Provvisori: This was called the Arengo del Carnaro, and was to deal with treaties with foreign states, the budget, university affairs, and amendments to the constitution. The Provvisori were chosen by nine corporations. Membership in one of these corporations was obligatory for all citizens, and was posited in the Carta del Carnaro as an indispensable precondition for citizenship. The article on corporations states that “only the assiduous producers of the common wealth and the assiduous producers of the common strength are complete citizens of the Regency, and with it constitute a single working substance, a single ascendant fullness.” (Ledeen, p. 166) D’Annunzio’s corporations are horizontal, similar to the estates, and are not organized according to vertical branches or cycles of economic activity, as Mussolini’s corporations were to be. The Carta del Carnaro provides for a 10th corporation, which seems to have been reserved for geniuses, prophets, and assorted supermen. D’Annunzio’s conception of the corporation is almost tribal, as the text of the constitution shows. He stipulated that each corporation was to “invent its insignia, its emblems, its music, its chants, its prayers; institute its ceremonies and rites; participate, as magnificently as it can, in the common joys, the anniversary festivals, and the maritime and terrestrial games; venerate its dead, honor its leaders, and celebrate its heroes.” (Ledeen, p. 168) The executive power was normally vested in seven rectors or ministers (including foreign affairs, treasury, education, police and justice, defense, public economy, and labor). For periods of emergency, it was provided that the Arengo could appoint a dictator or comandante for a specified term, as was the custom in the Roman Republic. There was also a judiciary, with communal courts (Buoni uomini, or good men), a labor court (giudici del lavoro), civil courts (giudici togati, of judges in toga), a criminal court (giudici del maleficio), and a supreme court called the Corte della Ragione, or court of reason. For Ledeen, D’Annunzio assumes the status of Nazi-communist prophet of the mass irrationalism of the 20th century. For Ledeen, the Carta del Carnaro sums up the “essence of European radical"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Project Democracy’s Program: the Fascist Corporate State 273 socialism.” From the point of view of Ledeen’s universal fascism, D’Annunzio is located in the same tradition as the classics of Marxism and historical materialism, since his writings “conjure up the Karl Marx of the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 . The young Marx, like many other heirs of Hegelianism, had been engaged in the search for a way to end human “alienation,” and D’Annunzio saw the structure created by the Carta as a means of organizing a society in which human creativity would blossom in a way rarely seen in the story of mankind. It is by no means accidental that he employed the language of the Communes [Italian city-states of the 1200s] in his new constitution, for he wished to recreate in the regency of Fiume the ferment of activity that had produced the Renaissance. He hoped that this constitution would produce a new, unalienated man.” (Ledeen, pp. 168- 9) In reality, D’Annunzio was a degenerate monster, a coprophile, pervert, and psychopath — qualities that may have helped to determine Ledeen’s compulsive affinity for this hideous figure. The Venetian operative D’Annunzio, the “John the Baptist” of fascism in this century, must bear a great share of the responsibility for opening the door to the Nazi-communist chamber of horrors in the epoch during and after the First World War. Ledeen’s commitment to the creation of a universal fascist yoke has found its appropriate organizational expression in Project Democracy. MUSSOLINI’S CORPORATE STATE After the March on Rome in 1922, and especially after the consolidation of a full-blown dictatorship through the coup d’état of l925, the Kingdom of Italy saw the creation of the fascist corporate state. The promise of creating corporations figured prominently in Mussolini’s demagogy from the beginning of his campaign for the seizure of power, but the creation of the corporations and the transformation of the parliament in order to include them was a long and drawn-out process that was completed only in the late thirties at the eve of the outbreak of the Second World War. One of the reasons it took so long to found the corporations was the lack of agreement about what these artificial creations might in fact be, since they had to be invented ex novo . Mussolini in the end settled on the idea that each corporation was to represent, not a stratum of society, but rather a branch of industry. The essence of the fascist corporations was that they were a support and appendage of the"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 274 personal rule of Il Duce, and thus of the one-party fascist state. As one historian has observed: “The fundamental truth, however, is that the Fascist State claims the right to regulate economic as well as other aspects of life, and has aimed at accomplishing the former through the Corporate organization. The Dictatorship is the necessary rack and screw of the Corporate system; all the rest is subordinate machinery.”[Note 2] Mussolini rejected both the Marxist idea of class conflict as well as what he called economic liberalism. The corporate system was designed, in his view, to overcome the class struggle of the one and the exaggerated economic individualism of the other. All of this was supposed to mobilize and focus national energies in the service of the superior interest of the state as the overarching collectivity. In one speech, Il Duce summed up the three elements of revolutionary corporatism as a single party, a totalitarian state, and “the highest ideal tension.” In fact, Mussolini danced to the tune of Venetian financiers like Volpi di Misurata, Cini, and others. Mussolini situated the need for corporations in the context of the dissolution of the world capitalist system — an interesting parallel to the corporatist fascism of Project Democracy and the Trilateral Commission, which are explicitly proposed as necessities for a post- industrial era of scarce and diminishing resources. In 1933, Mussolini announced that the world depression (or the “American crisis,” as he also called it) had become a total crisis of the world capitalist system. He went on to distinguish three periods in the history of capitalism: “the dynamic, the static, and the declining.” According to Mussolini, the dynamic era of capitalism extended from the introduction of the widespread use of the steam engine to the opening of the Suez Canal in 1870; this period he saw as the time of unfettered free enterprise. After 1870, came a static phase, with the growth of trusts, the end of free competition, and smaller profit margins. The third or decadent phase is described by Mussolini as a kind of state capitalism. Mussolini described the system in these terms: “The outcome is the necessity for corporatism: Today we are burying economic liberalism, and the Corporation plays that part in the economic field, which the Grand Council and the Militia [the squadristi] do in the political. Corporatism means a disciplined, and therefore a controlled economy, since there can be no discipline which is not controlled. Corporatism overcomes Socialism as well as it does liberalism: it creates a new synthesis.” (Finer, pp. 501- 502)"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Project Democracy’s Program: the Fascist Corporate State 275 The juridical basis for the fascist corporations is established in the Charter of Labor of 1927, whose sixth article states: The corporations constitute the unitary organization of production and represent completely its interests. In view of this complete representation, the interests of production being national interests, the corporations are recognized by law as organs of the State. [Note 3] The regime created fascist labor unions for workers, which had the monopoly of representation of labor in the negotiation of the national labor contract for each category or branch of economic activity. The Confindustria was created as the sole syndicate of the employers. No labor contract was considered valid until it had been approved by the Ministry for Corporations. In 1934, Mussolini finally issued a decree-law creating 22 corporations for the principal sectors of the Italian economy. Each corporation was given a council, which was composed of equal numbers of representatives of the fascist labor union and the fascist employers’ organization for that sector, plus representatives of the National Fascist Party, the Ministry of Corporations, and consulting technocrats. The president of each corporation was generally a top official of the government or of the Fascist Party. The leading task of each corporation was the reconciliation of disputes between labor and management. Each corporation represented a “productive cycle” rather than an occupational category. A first group of corporations included agricultural, industrial, and commercial elements. These were the corporations for: cereals; garden products, flowers, and fruits; vineyards and wine; oils; beets and sugar; animal industries and fishing; wood; and textile products. A second group of eight corporations included only commercial and industrial elements. These were: metallurgy and mechanics; chemical industries; clothing and accessories; paper and the press; building construction; water, gas, and electricity; extractive industries; and glass and ceramics. A third group of corporations made up the service sector: insurance and credit; professions and arts; sea and air transportation; internal communications; show business; and tourism and hotels. In the early stages of the regime, corporate representatives were brought together at the national level in a National Council of Corporations, and a National Assembly of Corporations, which were later superseded by a Central Corporate Committee. All of these contained additional party and government representatives in addition"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 27 6 to the corporate delegates. In addition, Councils of Corporate Economy were set up in each province as a kind of fascist chamber of commerce, with all the corporations of the province plus local governments being represented. In 1938, after having proclaimed that he considered the Chamber of Deputies, which until that time had been the lower house of the Italian Parliament, as belonging to the alien residue of liberalism, Mussolini replaced that Chamber with the Chamber of the Fasces and Corporations (Camera dei Fasci e delle Corporazioni). This was composed of a number of delegates appointed by each of the corporations, plus other delegates appointed by the National Fascist Party. Mussolini summed up these institutional transformations with the following words: “We have constituted a Corporative and Fascist State, the State of national society, a State which concentrates, controls, harmonizes, and tempers the interests of all social classes, which are thereby protected in equal measure. Whereas, during the years of demo-liberal regime, labor looked with diffidence upon the State, and was, in fact, outside the State and against the State, and considered the State an enemy of every day and every hour, there is not one working Italian today who does not seek a place in his Corporation or syndical federation, who does not wish to be a living atom of that great, immense living organization which is the national Corporate State of Fascism.”(Field, p. 16) After the cataclysm of the Mussolini regime, former members of the fascist hierarchy who considered themselves in the syndicalist- corporate tradition, such as Giuseppe Bottai, accused Mussolini of having been instinctively inclined to preserve his personal dictatorship, rather than transform that dictatorship into a true corporatist system. From beginning to end, the corporations were in fact the merest paraphernalia of Il Duce’s one-party state. Although he actually functioned as a malleable puppet of Volpi di Misurata and the Venetian financiers, in the eyes of the world Mussolini stood atop the fascist edifice as Duce of Fascism and Head of Government, and the secretary of the National Fascist Party served at his pleasure. An important organ of this totalitarian dictatorship was the Grand Council of Fascism (Gran Consiglio del Fascismo), primarily an expression of the fascist party, but in its makeup a mixed organ composed of top officials of the National Fascist Party, government ministers, the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber, the"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"Project Democracy’s Program: the Fascist Corporate State 27 7 commander of the squadristi, and others. As long as the Chamber of Deputies lasted, it was the Grand Council which made up the single nationwide list of Fascist candidates which the voters were called upon to accept or reject as a single unitary slate. The Grand Council was also responsible for submitting to the King the names of persons who might be selected as Head of Government. It was this Grand Council which, in July 1943, decided to oust Mussolini. As will be shown later, the National Endowment for Democracy is not only corporatist, but its board of directors is intended to function as a kind of informal Grand Council of Fascism in the totalitarian one-party state that Project Democracy seeks to create in the United States. After seizing power, Mussolini institutionalized and domesticated his storm troopers, the squadristi, under the name of the Voluntary National Security Militia, which was an organ of the Fascist Party. To combat political resistance to his regime, Mussolini then set up Special Tribunals whose judges were all high officers of the squadristi militia. Perhaps Ledeen or other Project Democracy theorists can take this as a starting point for the reform of the U.S. federal judiciary. Mussolini claimed to justify his regime through the need for efficiency and getting things done effectively. The Second World War revealed the overwhelming logistical and military weakness of the fascist corporate state. Despite the failure of corporatism in its declared aims of generating economic and military power, corporatist forms have exercised an almost hypnotic fascination over certain financier cliques in times of grave economic crisis. As we will see, the Trilateral Commission is committed to a neo-corporate order for the United States. At this point in the argument, certain readers may become impatient with an argument that seems to them to be incongruous. Can it be that the business-suited bankers of the Trilateral Commission, the shirt-sleeve bureaucrats of the AFL-CIO, or even such figures as Oliver North share decisive elements of their ideology with a black- shirted, jack-booted, strutting fascist like Mussolini, with fez, dagger, and club, with jaw jutting over the balcony of Palazzo Venezia? Are not the present-day figures of Project Democracy too bland to qualify as fascists? Are they not just American pragmatists with views that may happen to differ from our own?"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 278 It may come as a surprise to many that Mussolini himself was a professed follower of American pragmatism. Among the thinkers who had made the greatest contribution to his own intellectual formation, Il Duce numbered first of all William James, the classic exponent of American pragmatism, whom he knew especially through the Italian writer Papini. Then came Machiavelli (for window-dressing, since he was certainly not a pragmatist and clearly not understood by Il Duce), followed by Nietzsche, an authentic proto-fascist who can be considered as representing a slightly different school of pragmatism. Then came the French anarcho-syndicalist, Georges Sorel, the theorist of purgative violence and also a declared pragmatist. All pragmatists are not necessarily fascists, but in the 20th century many have been, and there is no doubt that all fascists are pragmatists. In a crisis of civilization like the one of the 1980s, the fascists constitute the fastest-growing component of the pragmatic school. This makes it possible for individuals like Oliver North and Carl Gershman to embrace fascism as a simple practical expedient. In one of his speeches, Mussolini remarked: “The second foundation stone of Fascismo is represented by anti-demagogism and pragmatism.” William Yandell Elliott of Harvard University remarks in his study of post-World War I political irrationalism, entitled The Pragmatic Revolt in Politics : “For pragmatism, a myth is true so long as it works. Mussolini offers himself as the new Caesar.... If he can capture the imagination of Italians and inflame them with his dream, he feels that he can govern with consent.” (p. 341) Elliott, it should be recalled, was one of the principal teachers of Henry Kissinger. William James had posited this “working test of truth,” which was also reflected in Mussolini’s celebrated contempt for programs. When asked for a program, he replied: “Our program is simple: We wish to govern Italy. They ask us for programs, but there are already too many of them.” For Mussolini, program was a part of liberalism’s “government by talk,” which he was determined to extirpate. In 1932, Mussolini wrote: La mia dottrina era stata la dottrina dell’azione. Il fascismo nacque da un bisogno d’azione e fu azione. (My doctrine had been the doctrine of action. Fascism was born of the need for action, and was action.) Oliver North would presumably agree. THE TRILATERALS’ US CORPORATE STATE From the moment of its inception about a dozen years ago, the operational network known today as Project Democracy has had as its"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"Project Democracy’s Program: the Fascist Corporate State 279 goal the subversion of the United States constitutional order in favor of a one-party, totalitarian and corporatist fascist regime, combining the horrors of the historical precursors depicted so far. One aspect of these efforts by Project Democracy has involved the creation of an extensive and lawless invisible government, as has already been made clear in this report. But beyond all this, Project Democracy aims at definite changes in the structure of the government and institutions of the United States, of a kind so extensive that they could not be accomplished without a virtual obliteration of the Constitution. The starting point for this totalitarian plan was the Trilateral Commission, an organization created for the purpose of executing the policy of oligarchical and financier groupings making up the American, European, and Japanese branches of the banking elite. The Trilateral Commission was founded in the wake of Watergate and the oil crisis of 1973, events which the future Trilateral commissars had connived to create. One of the earliest projects of the Trilateral Commission was a study on the “ ungovernability” of modern democracy in an era of economic crisis and social upheaval. This project was directed by Zbigniew Brzezinski, then the director of the Trilateral Commission. One of the results of this project that later came into the public domain was a b ook entitled The Crisis of Democracy by Michel Crozier, Samuel P. Huntington, and Joji Watanuki. It is to be assumed that the published version of this study and its appendices is a very diluted rendering of the discussions that went on among the rapporteurs and the Trilateral commissars. The Crisis of Democracy was a part of the agenda at the yearly meeting of the Trilateral Commission that took place in Tokyo, Japan on May 31, 1975. This was the same Trilateral meeting at which the former governor of Georgia, J immy Carter, was presented by FIAT chief Gianni Agnelli, and appointed by the commissars to be the next President of the United States. The starting point of The Crisis of Democracy is the collapse of such economic progress as had characterized the 1960s, and the advent of the post-industrial society. Brzezinski’s introduction compares the atmosphere of 1975 with the early 1920s, when Oswald Spengler published his mystical Untergang des Abendlandes ,, The Decline of the West. The three authors start off their analysis by quoting Willy Brandt, as he was about to step down as German Federal Chancellor in 1974, saying, “Western Europe has only 20 or 30 more years of democracy left in it; after that it will slide, engineless and rudderless, under the surrounding sea of dictatorship,"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 280 and whether the dictation comes from a politburo or a junta will not make that much difference.” Then there is a quote from an unnamed senior British official to the effect that if the United Kingdom fails to solve the problem of simultaneous inflation and economic depression, “parliamentary democracy would ultimately be replaced by a dictatorship.” There is also a warning from Prime Minister Takeo Miki that “Japanese democracy will collapse” unless the confidence of the people in their political leaders can be restored. This is all related by the authors to the economic dimension of the crisis: This pessimism about the future of democracy has coincided with a parallel pessimism about the future of economic conditions. Economists have discovered the fifty-year Kondratieff cycle, according to which 1971 (like 1921) should have marked the beginning of a sustained economic downturn from which the industrialized capitalist world would not emerge until the end of the century. The implication is that just as the political developments of the 1920s and 1930s furnished the ironic and tragic aftermath of a war fought to make the world safe for democracy, so also the 1970s and 1980s might furnish a similarly ironic political aftermath to twenty years of sustained economic development designed in part to make the world prosperous enough for democracy. (pp. 2- 3) Added to this obvious implication that economic depression would prove fatal to democratic forms by creating the necessary preconditions for fascist mass movements was the related idea that the United States Constitution could be overthrown in the aftermath of military defeat by the Soviet Union or perhaps by another power. The Trilateral meeting in question, it should be recalled, was taking place just a few weeks after the fall of Saigon. The Trilateral authors make this point as follows: “With the most active foreign policy of any democratic country, the United States is far more vulnerable to defeats in that area than other democratic governments, which, attempting less, also risk less. Given the relative decline in its military, economic, and political influence, the United States is more likely to face serious military or diplomatic reverses during the coming years than at any previous time in its history. If this does occur, it could pose a traumatic shock to American democracy.” (p. 5) In addition to these crisis factors, the study also points to dynamics considered internal to the political process which are generating instability: “Yet, in recent years, the operations of the democratic"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"Project Democracy’s Program: the Fascist Corporate State 281 process do indeed appear to have generated a breakdown of traditional means of social control, a de-legitimation of political and other forms of authority, and an overload of demands on government exceeding its capacity to respond.”(p. 8) The study itself makes clear that the three Trilateral commissars are especially concerned about the economic demands made upon elected representatives by constituency groups which may contradict the austerity and primacy of debt service demanded by oligarchical financier factions. This theme dominates the chapter on the United States contributed by Samuel P. Huntington, who at various times has been a manager of the Harvard Center for International Affairs, the international network associated with Henry Kissinger. Huntington writes according to the canons of empirical social science, but the basic dictatorial intent nevertheless shines through. He describes the two great leaps in the expenditures of the U.S. federal government, the Defense Shift of the 1950s and the Welfare Shift of the 1960s. He concludes that after these two shifts had vastly increased federal spending, the student revolt of the 1960s plus Watergate combined to produce “a substantial increase in government activity and a substantial decrease in governmental authority. By the early 1970s Americans were progressively demanding and receiving more benefits from their government and yet having less confidence in their government than they had a decade earlier.” “The expansion of government activities produced doubts about the economic solvency of government; the decrease in governmental authority produced doubts about the political solvency of government.” (p. 64) Reading ex contrario, it emerges that Huntington’s ideal government would be an authoritarian regime capable of imposing drastic austerity. His problem is his despair that the U.S. government will fill the bill. Increased government spending is leading to high deficits, even as public confidence in government declines, says Huntington. He is especially concerned about the “decay of the party system,” with the decline in clear party identification by the majority of the citizenry, the rise of split-ticket voting, and a decrease in party loyalty from one election to the next. As for the political parties themselves, Huntington’s finding is that “the popular attitude towards parties combines both disapproval and contempt.” (p. 87) Huntington also sees a decline in the mass base of the parties, plus a decline in the power of party organization. This raises the specter of a successful"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 282 political challenge to the power of people like the members of Trilateral Commission: “The lesson of the 1960s was that American political parties were extraordinarily open and extraordinarily vulnerable organizations, in the sense that they could be easily penetrated, and even captured, by highly motivated and well- organized groups with a cause and a candidate.” (p. 89) Huntington is willing to explore the alternative that the political parties may have to be done away with: “It could be argued that political parties are a political form peculiarly suited to the needs of industrial society and that the movement of the United States into a post-industrial phase hence means the end of the party system as we have known it.” “In less developed countries, the principal alternative to party government is military government. Do the highly developed countries have a third alternative?” (p. 91) Huntington sees the entire government in crisis, with congressmen falling prey to the rising expectations of their constituents while the presidency is in decline. Part of the latter problem is that a presidential candidate needs to assemble an electoral coalition of voters in order to win the White House, but must then assemble a governing coalition of various power brokers. Huntington views the two processes as perhaps antithetical. The recommendations that conclude the analysis of the crisis in U.S. democracy include such pabulum as “moderation in democracy,” more authoritarianism, and the need for greater apathy on the part of the population. “Democracy is more of a threat to itself in the United States,” writes Huntington. The real conclusions reached by the Trilateral Commission were doubtless more far-reaching, as can be inferred from the appendices of the book. When the Crozier-Huntington-Watanuki study was presented to the commission, it was introduced by Ralf Dahrendorf, the head of the London School of Economics. The chief threat running through Dahrendorf’s remarks was that Huntington had neglected corporatist elements in his prescription. Dahrendorf’s argument deserves to be quoted at some length: Democratic governments find it difficult to cope with the power of extra-parliamentary institutions which determine by their decisions the life chances of as many (or in some cases more) people as the decisions of governments can possibly determine in many of our countries. Indeed, these extra-parliamentary"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"Project Democracy’s Program: the Fascist Corporate State 283 institutions often make governmental power look ridiculous. When I talk about extra-parliamentary institutions, I am essentially thinking of two powerful economic institutions — giant companies and large and powerful trade unions. The greater demand for participation, the removal of effective political spaces from the national to the international level, and the removal of the power to determine people’s life chances from political institutions to other institutions are all signs of what might be called the dissolution of the general political public which we assumed was the basis of real democratic institutions in the past. Instead of there being an effective political public in democratic countries from which representative institutions emerge and to which representative institutions are answerable, there is a fragmented public and in part a nonexistent public. There is a rather chaotic picture in the political communities of many democratic countries. My main point here is that as we think about a political public in our day, we cannot simply think of a political public of individual citizens exercising their common sense interests on the marketplace, as it were. In rethinking the notion of the political public, we have to accept the fact that most human beings today are both individual citizens and members of large organizations. We have to accept the fact that most individuals see their interests cared for not only by an immediate expression of their citizenship rights (or even by political parties which organize groups of interests) but also by organizations which at this moment act outside the immediate political framework and which will continue to act whether governments like it or not. And I believe, therefore, somewhat reluctantly, that in thinking about the political public of tomorrow we shall have to think of a public in which representative parliamentary institutions are somehow linked with institutions which in themselves are neither representative nor parliamentary. I think it is useful to discuss the exact meaning of something like an effective social contract, or perhaps a “Concerted Action” or “Conseil économique et social” for the political institutions of advanced democracies. I do not believe that free collective bargaining is an indispensable element of a free and democratic society. I do believe, however, that we have to recognize that people are organized in trade unions, that there are large enterprises, that"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 284 economic interests have got to be discussed somewhere, and that there has got to be a negotiation about some of the guidelines by which our economies are functioning. This discussion should be related to representative institutions. There may be a need for reconsidering some of our institutions in this light, not to convert our countries into corporate states, certainly not, but to convert them into countries which in a democratic fashion recognize some of the new developments which have made the effective political public so much less effective in recent years. For a reader who has followed the exposition up to this point, not much comment is necessary. Despite his very explicit disclaimer, Dahrendorf is indeed talking about a covert and overt institutional transformation toward a corporate state. We have seen several previous attempts to accomplish exactly what he is proposing here. One was D’Annunzio’s Consiglio dei Provvisori, and another was Mussolini’s Camera dei Fasci e delle Corporazioni. But the Trilateral Commission still needed a means of transition to corporatist rule. It was momentarily to propose it in the form of Project Democracy. The appendix to The Crisis of Democracy also contains a series of formal concluding statements by the Trilateral Commission at the close of debate on the ungovernability report. At a certain point, the text turns toward question of workers’ self-management, co- determination ( Mitbestimmung ) as practiced in the Federal Republic of Germany, and the need for new modes of organization to alleviate the tensions that characterize post-industrial society. At that point, a new heading is introduced, as follows: “7. Creation of New Institution for the Cooperative Promotion of Democracy. The effective working of democratic government in the Trilateral societies can now no longer be taken for granted. The increasing demands and pressures on democratic government and the crisis in governmental resources and public authority require more explicit collaboration. One might consider, therefore, means of securing support and resources from foundations, business corporations, labor unions, political parties, civic associations, and, where possible and appropriate, government agencies, for the creation of an institute for the strengthening of democratic institutions. The purpose of such an institute would be to stimulate collaborative studies of common problems involved in the operations of democracy in the Trilateral societies, to promote cooperation among institutions and groups with common concerns in this area among the Trilateral"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"Project Democracy’s Program: the Fascist Corporate State 285 regions, and to encourage the Trilateral societies to learn from each other’s experience how to make democracy function more effectively in their societies. There is much which each society can learn from the others. Such mutual learning experiences are familiar phenomena in the economic and military fields; they must also be encouraged in the political field. Such an institute could also serve a useful function in calling attention to questions of special urgency, as, for instance, the critical nature of the problems currently confronting democracy in Europe.” (p. 187) With that, Project Democracy was unleashed against the world. In the final discussion that followed Dahrendorf’s remarks, the task of the new institute was made clearer. One participant suggested that Dahrendorf’s idea of associating non-parliamentary groups with the parliamentary process ought to be seen in relation to international political systems, and not just in a national framework. At the close, “one Commissioner [Was it David Rockefeller?] expressed his support ‘very concretely’ for the proposed institute for the strengthening of democratic institutions.” (p. 203) TRANSFORMING THE POLITICAL PARTIES Project Democracy is thus by pedigree an international fascist- corporatist organization designed to supplant democratic constitutional republics with veiled and overt fascist regimes. It is a kind of bankers’ Comintern — the Comintern of Bukharin, to be sure. As some of the citations adduced here suggest, it appears that one of the first tasks contemplated for the nascent Project Democracy network was the fomenting of coups d’état in Western Europe, as was also indicated by abundant empirical evidence manifest at that time. What is the nature of Project Democracy’s planned institutional transformation for the United States? Project Democracy intends to complete the evolution of the Republican and Democratic parties, especially the Democrats, away from their previous status as mass- based political machines responsive to the demands of constituencies and regional and local interests. Under the pretext of increasing the cohesion and responsibility of the parties, they are to acquire dictatorial control over the votes and opinions of elected officials, as for example, congressmen. The two parties are to become increasingly remote from the citizenry, and subjected to an increasingly authoritarian top-down control. Candidates are to become more and more like party functionaries, and are to be chosen"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 28 6 by a tiny group of party leaders acting in synergy with the finance oligarchs. This will include presidential candidates most emphatically. Primary elections are to be gradually abolished in favor of a fascist-corporatist smoke-filled room. The specifically corporatist dimension of such a system in evolution from authoritarianism to totalitarianism is provided by the merger of the AFL-CIO top bureaucracy with the fused Democratic and Republican National Co mmittees and fundraising apparatus. Despite the decline in the relative weight of trade unions in the U.S. workforce, the AFL-CIO is still by far the largest membership organization in the United States. This kind of troika is accurately reflected on the board of the National Endowment for Democracy. The AFL-CIO, by virtue of its close interfaces with the State Department, the Agency for International Development, the Labor Department, the Commerce Department, the Special Trade Representative, and the intelligence community, is virtually a government agency, precisely in the way that Bukharin wanted trade unions to be. By closely controlling the financing of candidates, access to the media, party endorsement, candidate debates, and the related election apparatus, the backers of Project Democracy think that they can in effect choose the Congress and choose the President. In this proposed silent putsch by Project Democracy, the RNC/DNC/AFL-CIO lockstep would acquire sovereignty over the U.S. federal government, in much the same way that the Soviet Politburo and Central Committee Secretariat control the Soviet Council of Ministers and Supreme Soviet. For Project Democracy, it is much more convenient for sovereignty to be located in an informal combine of private organizations, which cannot be subjected to government oversight, Freedom of Information Act demands, or financial audit and accountability, but which can and do receive large amounts of official government funding, as well as the largesse conduited through Oliver North’s Swiss bank accounts. At the same time, Project Democracy is well aware of the value of maintaining a facade of respect for constitutional forms during the time in which the passage from authoritarianism to totalitarianism is being negotiated. It can be recalled that it took Mussolini some three years to go from head of the government to dictator, and still longer for the full institutional panoply of the totalitarian state to be set forth. In that transition, the suppression of opposition political groups and publishing enterprises was carried out gradually by squadristi and"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Project Democracy’s Program: the Fascist Corporate State 28 7 secret police. Today, these functions are assigned to the William Welds and the Oliver Revells. In the meantime, Project Democracy will find ways to denigrate and vilify the United States Constitution, even while going through the pretense of celebrating its anniversary. CORPORATIST PROPAGANDA In early 1975, Nicholas von Hoffman devoted his column in the Washington Post to revelations that certain prime financial supporters of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party have a “hidden agenda for American politics ... a planned economy ...state capitalism ... fascism without lampshade factories.” Hoffman stated that the then- President of the United Auto Workers, Leonard Woodcock, was “willing to surrender the economic planning to the mega-corporations.” In March 1975, Challenge magazine carried an article entitled “The Coming Corporatism,” by R.E. Pahl and J.T. Winkler. The article stated in part: “Corporatism is a distinct form of economic structure. It was recognized as such in the 1930s by people of diverse political backgrounds, before Hitler extinguished the enthusiasm which greeted Mussolini’s variant. The fact that our blinkered political vocabulary now sees the alternative pure forms of economy as simply “capitalism” or “socialism” is a consequence of the fact that the Axis powers lost the Second World War. “This ‘corporatism’ is a comprehensive economic system under which the state intensively channels predominantly privately owned business towards four goals, which have become increasingly explicit during the current economic crisis: Order, Unity, Nationalism, and ‘Success.’ “Those, then, are the four aims. Let us not mince words. Corporatism is fascism with a human face. What the parties are putting forward now is an acceptable face of fascism; indeed a masked version of it, because so far the more repugnant political and social aspects of the German and Italian regimes are absent or only present in diluted form.” The same year saw the creation of an Initiative Committee for National Economic Planning with a press conference attended by Woodcock, Robert Roosa, and Wassily Leontieff. Among the sponsors of ICNEP were J.K. Galbraith and Robert McNamara. At the same time, officials of the Swedish, German, British, and Italian parties of the Second International were expressing the idea that,"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 288 whereas in the last depression, the financiers had turned to fascist mass movements to impose corporatism and austerity, this time the social democrats could survive by showing that they were the most efficient agency for corporatist austerity. CORPORATISM IN THE 1988 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Signs are multiplying that with the present acceleration of economic collapse, corporatist agitation may become more widespread. One harbinger of such a trend is the highly ideologized presidential candidacy of former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt. In declaring his candidacy for President, Babbitt proposed a “gain- sharing” plan under which he claimed that by 1996 “two-thirds of American workers would directly share in the profits and losses of their own business.” When asked whether such a policy were not a return to corporatism, Babbitt answered that he preferred to call it “competitiveness” or “futurism,” and later admitted that he was not sure of the meaning of corporatism. Babbitt’s candidacy is designed to expose broad strata of the population to various parts of the Trilateral ideological inventory. The 1980 presidential candidacy of Trilateral Co mmission member Rep. John Anderson was also a vehicle for spewing out Malthusianism and anti-constitutional propaganda. Anderson’s platform charged that despite the advent of post-industrial society, the Republicans and Democrats were still too “consumption-oriented.” The platform stated: “The traditional parties were reasonably effective mechanisms for distributing the dividends of economic growth. But during a period in which the central task of government is to allocate burdens and orchestrate sacrifices, these parties have proved incapable of making the necessary hard choices. We are prepared to tell the American people what we must do, and allocate the burden in a manner sensitive to both economic efficiency and social equity.” Babbitt’s current rhetoric is strikingly similar. THE FUTURE: LOOKING TOWARDS THE UPSURGE OF 2010-2030 FROM 1981 Samuel Huntington, in his recent (1981) book American Politics , develops a perspective for the future development of the American political system in the framework of conflict between increasingly authoritarian and ultimately totalitarian state control, on the one hand, and an underlying American value system and world-outlook —"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"Project Democracy’s Program: the Fascist Corporate State 289 which he calls the “American Creed — on the other. In Huntington’s view, there is no doubt that the regime will become more oppressive: “An increasingly sophisticated economy and active involvement in world affairs seem likely to create stronger needs for hierarchy, bureaucracy, centralization of power, expertise, big government specifically, and big organizations generally.” (p. 228) But this will conflict with the ideological American Creed, based on liberty, equality, individualism, and democracy and rooted in “seventeenth-century Protestant moralism and eighteenth-century liberal rationalism.” (p. 229) Something has to give, says Huntington. On the one hand, there is a possibility that the American Creed could be junked, and “there are some signs that values are changing.” “In the 1960s and 1970s in both Europe and America, social scientists found evidence of the increasing prevalence of ‘post-bourgeois’ or ‘post-materialist’ values, particularly among younger cohorts. In a somewhat similar vein, George Lodge foresaw the displacement of Lockean, individualistic ideology in the United States by a ‘communitarian’ ideology, resembling in many aspects the traditional Japanese collective approach. Huntington predicts that the conflict between individualistic values and the centralized regime may explode early in the coming century specifically between 2010 and 2030, in a period of ferment and dislocation like the late 1960s: “If the periodicity of the past prevails, a major sustained creedal passion period will occur in the second and third decades of the twenty-first century.” At this time, he argues, “the oscillations among the responses could intensify in such a way as to threaten to destroy both ideals and institutions.” (p. 232) Such a process would be acted out as follows: “Lacking any concept of the state, lacking for most of its history both the centralized authority and the bureaucratic apparatus of the European state, the American polity has historically been a weak polity. It was designed to be so, and the traditional inheritance and social environment combined for years to support the framers’ intentions. In the twentieth century, foreign threats and domestic economic and social needs have generated pressures to develop stronger, more authoritative decision- making and decision-implementing institutions. Yet the continued presence of deeply felt moralistic sentiments among major groups in American society could continue to ensure weak and divided government, devoid of authority and unable to deal"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"Obama, The Postmodern Coup 290 satisfactorily with the economic, social and foreign challenges confronting the nation. Intensification of this conflict between history and progress could give rise to increasing frustration and increasingly violent oscillations between moralism and cynicism. American moralism ensures that government will never be truly efficacious; the realities of power ensure that government will never be truly democratic. “This situation could lead to a two-phase dialectic involving intensified efforts to reform government, followed by intensified frustration when those efforts produce not progress in a liberal- democratic direction, but obstacles to meeting perceived functional needs. The weakening of government in an effort to reform it could lead eventually to strong demands for the replacement of the weakened and ineffective institutions by more authoritarian structures more effectively designed to meet historical needs. Given the perversity of reform, moralistic extremism in the pursuit of liberal democracy could generate a strong tide toward authoritarian efficiency”. (p. 232) Huntington then quotes Plato’s celebrated passage on the way that the “culmination of liberty in democracy is precisely what prepares the way for the cruelest extreme of servitude under a despot.” The message is clear: sooner or later, all roads lead to Behemoth. FASCISM AS AN AFTERMATH OF MILITARY DEFEAT Nous sommes trahis ! cried the French in 1870 as they recoiled from defeat in war. For the Germans of 1918, it was the Dolchstosslegende , the stab in the back of the fighting army by the surrender of the politicians. For D’Annunzio and Mussolini, it was the vittoria mutilata , the inability of Orlando to impose Italy’s territorial and colonial demands in the imperialist haggling of Versailles. Each of these reproaches, whatever their historical merits might have been, became vital factors in engendering mass fascist mentality and mass fascist movements. Parallels exist between such figures as Oliver North and the arditi who accompanied D’Annunzio to Fiume. According to former National Security Council director Robert McFarlane, “Lt. Col. Oliver North’s experiences in the Vietnam War may have led him to secretly channel proceeds from the Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels while he was an NSC aide,” according to an article published"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Project Democracy’s Program: the Fascist Corporate State 291 in the Washington Times in March 1987. The article quotes McFarlane, interviewed while recovering from a suicide attempt, as follows: “For people who went through that, and Colonel North surely did, you come away with the profound sense of very intolerable failure. That is, a government must never give its word to people who may stand to lose their lives and then break faith. And I think it’s possible that in the last year we’ve seen a commitment made to human beings in Nicaragua that is being broken.” As we have seen, the filibustering expedition of D’Annunzio to Fiume was a kind of dress rehearsal for Italian fascism. In post- World War I Germany, it was a similar kind of filibustering activity, the military campaigns of the Baltic Freikorps against the Bolsheviks, that created a significant part of the fascist potential which later aggregated in the Nazi Party. For the fascism of Project Democracy, the close historical parallel is the filibustering in Central America around the Contra war. NOTES 1. See Ralph H.
