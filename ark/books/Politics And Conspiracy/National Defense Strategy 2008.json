Beyond our shores, America shoulders additiona l responsibilities on behalf of the world. For those struggling for a better life, there is and must be no stronger advocate than the United States. We remain a beacon of light for those in dark places, and for this reason we should remember that our ac tions and words signal the depth of our strength and resolve. For our friends and allies, as well as for our enemies and potential adversaries, our commitment to de mocratic values must be matched by our deeds. The spread of liberty both manifests our ideals and protects our interests. The United States, our allies, and our partners face a spectrum of challenges, including violent transna tional extremist networks, hostile states armed with weapons of mass destruction, rising regional powers, emerging space and cyber threats, natural and pandemic disasters, and a growing competition for resources. The Department of Defense must respon d to these challenges while anticipating and preparing for those of tomorrow. We must balance strategic risk across our responses, making the best use of the tool s at hand within the U.S. Government and among our international pa rtners. To succeed, we must harness and integrate all aspects of national power and work closely with a wide range of allies, friends and partners. We cannot prevail if we act alone. The President’s 2006 National Security Strategy (NSS) describes an approach founded on two pillars: promoting fre edom, justice, and human dignity by working to end tyranny, promote effec tive democracies, a nd extend prosperity; and confronting the challe nges of our time by leading a growing community of democracies. It seeks to foster a world of well-governed states that can meet the needs of their citizens and conduct themselves responsibly in the international system. This approach represents the best way to provide enduri ng security for the American people. The National Defense Strategy (NDS) serves as the Department’s capstone document in this long-term effort. It fl ows from the NSS and informs the National Military Strategy. It also provides a framework for ot her DoD strategic guidance, specifically on campaign and contingenc y planning, force development, and 1"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"intelligence. It reflects the results of the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and lessons learned from on-going operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. It addresses how the U.S. Armed Forces will fight and win America’s wars and how we seek to work with and through partner nations to shape opportunities in the international environment to enhance security and avert conflict. The NDS describes our overa rching goals and strategy. It outlines how DoD will support the objectives outlin ed in the NSS, including the need to strengthen alliances and build new partne rships to defeat global te rrorism and prevent attacks against us, our allies, and our friends; prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our friends with weapons of mass destru ction (WMD); work with others to defuse regional conflicts, incl uding conflict interven tion; and transform national security institutions to face the challenges of the 21 st century. The NDS acts on these objectives, evaluates the strate gic environment, challenges, and risks we must consider in achieving them, and maps the way forward. The Strategic Environment For the foreseeable future, this environm ent will be defined by a global struggle against a violent extremist id eology that seeks to overturn the international state system. Beyond this transnational struggl e, we face other threats, including a variety of irregular challenges, the quest by rogue states for nuclear weapons, and the rising military power of other states. These are long -term challenges. Success in dealing with them will require the orchestration of national and international power over years or decades to come. Violent extremist movements such as al-Qaeda and its asso ciates comprise a complex and urgent challenge. Like co mmunism and fascism before it, today’s violent extremist ideology rejects the rules and struct ures of the international system. Its adherents reject state sovereig nty, ignore borders, and attempt to deny self-determination and human dignity wherev er they gain powe r. These extremists opportunistically exploit re spect for these no rms for their own purposes, hiding behind international norms and national laws when it suits them, and attempting to subvert them when it does not . Combating these violent groups will require long- term, innovative approaches. The inability of many states to police themselves effectivel y or to work with their neighbors to ensure regional security represents a challenge to the international system. Armed sub-national groups, includi ng but not limited to those inspired by violent extremism, threaten the stability and legitimacy of key states. If left unchecked, such instab ility can spread and threaten regions of interest to the 2"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"United States, our allies, and friends. Insu rgent groups and othe r non-state actors frequently exploit local geographical, political, or social conditions to establish safe havens from which they can opera te with impunity. Ungoverned, under- governed, misgoverned, and contested areas offer fertile ground for such groups to exploit the gaps in governance capacity of local regimes to undermine local stability and regional security. Addre ssing this problem will require local partnerships and creative approaches to deny extremists the opportunity to gain footholds. Rogue states such as Iran and North Korea similarly th reaten international order. The Iranian regime sponsors terrorism and is attempting to disrupt the fledgling democracies in Iraq and Afghanistan. Ir an’s pursuit of nuclear technology and enrichment capabilities poses a serious challe nge to security in an already volatile region. The North Korean regime also poses a serious nuclear and missile proliferation concern for the U.S. and other responsible international stakeholders. The regime threatens the Republic of Ko rea with its military and its neighbors with its missiles. Moreover, North Korea cr eates instability with its illicit activity, such as counterfeiting U.S. currency and trafficking in narcotics, and brutal treatment of its own people. We must also consider the possibility of challenges by more powerful states. Some may actively seek to counter the Un ited States in some or all domains of traditional warfare or to gain an advant age by developing capab ilities that offset our own. Others may choose niche areas of military capability and competition in which they believe they can develop a st rategic or operational advantage. That some of these potential competitors also are partners in any number of diplomatic, commercial, and security efforts will only make these relationships more difficult to manage. China is one ascendant state with the potential for compe ting with the United States. For the foreseeable future, we will need to he dge against China’s growing military modernization and the impact of its strategic choices upon international security. It is likely that China will continue to expand its conventional military capabilities, emphasizing anti-access and area denial assets incl uding developing a full range of long-range strike, space, and information warfare capabilities. Our interaction with China will be long-term and multi-dimensional and will involve peacetime engagement between defense establishments as much as fielded combat capabilities. The objective of this e ffort is to mitigate near term challenges while preserving and enhancing U.S. national advantages over time. Russia’s retreat from openne ss and democracy could have significant security implications for the United States, our European allies, and our partners in other 3"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"regions. Russia has leveraged the revenu e from, and access to, its energy sources; asserted claims in the Arctic; and has cont inued to bully its ne ighbors, all of which are causes for concern. Russia also ha s begun to take a more active military stance, such as the renewal of long-rang e bomber flights, and has withdrawn from arms control and force reduction treaties, a nd even threatened to target countries hosting potential U.S. anti-missile bases. Furthermore, Moscow has signaled an increasing reliance on nuclear weapons as a foundation of its security. All of these actions suggest a Russia exploring rene wed influence, and seeking a greater international role. U.S. dominance in conventi onal warfare has given pr ospective adversaries, particularly non-state actors and their st ate sponsors, strong motivation to adopt asymmetric methods to counter our advantages. For this reason, we must display a mastery of irregular warfare comparable to that which we possess in conventional combat. Our adversaries also seek to deve lop or acquire catastrophic capabilities: chemical, biological, and es pecially nuclear weapons. In addition, they may develop disruptive technologies in an at tempt to offset U.S. advantages. For example, the development and prolifer ation of anti-access technology and weaponry is worrisome as it can restrict our future freedom of action. These challenges could come not only in the obvi ous forms we see today but also in less traditional forms of influe nce such as manipulating global opinion using mass communications venues and exploiting international commitments and legal avenues. Meeting these challenges requir e better and more diverse capabilities in both hard and soft power, and greater flexibility and skill in employing them. These modes of warfare may appear indivi dually or in combin ation, spanning the spectrum of warfare and intertwining hard and soft power. In some instances, we may not learn that a conflict is underway until it is well advanced and our options limited. We must develop better intelligence capabilities to detect, recognize, and analyze new forms of warfare as well as explore joint appr oaches and strategies to counter them. Increasingly, the Department will have to plan for a future s ecurity environment shaped by the interaction of powerful strategic trends. These trends suggest a range of plausible futures, some presenti ng major challenges and security risks. Over the next twenty years physical pr essures – population, resource, energy, climatic and environmental – could co mbine with rapid social, cultural, technological and geopolitical change to create greater uncertainty. This uncertainty is exacerbated by both the u nprecedented speed and scale of change, as well as by the unpredictable and complex interaction among the trends themselves. Globalization and growing ec onomic interdepende nce, while creating new levels of wealth and opportunity , also create a web of interrelated 4"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"vulnerabilities and spread risks even furthe r, increasing sensitivity to crises and shocks around the globe an d generating more uncertainty regarding their speed and effect. Current defense policy must account for th ese areas of uncertainty. As we plan, we must take account of the implications of demographic trends, particularly population growth in much of the develo ping world and the population deficit in much of the developed world. The interaction of these change s with existing and future resource, environmental, and clim ate pressures may generate new security challenges. Furthermore, as the relativ e balance of economic and military power between states shifts, some propelled forward by economic development and resource endowment, others held back by physical pressures or economic and political stagnation, new fears and insecur ities will arise, presenting new risks for the international community. These risks will require managing the di vergent needs of massively increasing energy demand to maintain economic devel opment and the need to tackle climate change. Collectively, these developmen ts pose a new range of challenges for states and societies. These trends will a ffect existing security concerns such as international terrorism and weapons proliferation. At the same time, overlaying these trends will be developments within science and technology, which, while presenting some potential thre ats, suggest a range of po sitive developments that may reduce many of the pressures and risk s suggested by physical trends. How these trends interact and the nature of th e shocks they might ge nerate is uncertain; the fact that they will influe nce the future security environment is not.  Whenever possible, the Department w ill position itself both to respond to and reduce uncertainty. This means we must continue to improve our understanding of trends, their interaction, and the range of risks the Department may be called upon to respond to or manage. We should act to reduce risks by shaping the development of trends through the deci sions we make regarding the equipment and capabilities we develop and the security cooperation, reassurance, dissuasion, deterrence, and operational activities we pursue. The Department should also develop the military capability and capacity to hedge agai nst uncertainty, and the institutional agility and flexibility to plan early and respond effectively alongside interdepartmental, non-governmen tal and international partners. The Strategic Framework Since World War II, the United States has acted as the primary force to maintain international security and stability, leading first th e West in the Cold War confrontation with the Soviet Union and, more recently, international efforts to 5"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"confront violent extremis m. This has been acco mplished through military, diplomatic, and economic means. Driving th ese efforts has been a set of enduring national interests and a vision of opportun ity and prosperity for the future. U.S. interests include protecting the nation an d our allies from attack or coercion, promoting international security to re duce conflict and foster economic growth, and securing the global commons and with them a ccess to world markets and resources. To pursue these interests, the U.S. has de veloped military capabilities and alliances and coalitions, participated in and suppor ted international security and economic institutions, used diplomacy and soft power to shape the behavior of individual states and the international system, and using force when necessary. These tools help inform the strategic framework with which the United States plans for the future, and he lp us achieve our ends. The security of the United States is tigh tly bound up with the security of the broader international system. As a result, our strategy seeks to build the capacity of fragile or vulnerable partners to withstand internal threats and external aggression while improving the capacity of the international system itself to withstand the challenge posed by rogue states and would-be hegemons. Objectives To support the NSS and prov ide enduring secu rity for the American people, the Department has five key objectives: • Defend the Homeland • Win the Long War • Promote Security • Deter Conflict • Win our Nation’s Wars Defend the Homeland The core responsibility of the Department of Defe nse is to defend the United States from attack upon its territory at home and to secure its interests abroad. The U.S. Armed Forces protect the physical integrity of th e country through an active layered defense. They also deter attacks upon it, directly and indirectly, through deployments at sea, in the air, on land, and in space. Howeve r, as the spreading web of globalization presen ts new opportunities and cha llenges, the importance of planning to protect the homeland against previously unexpected threats increases. Meeting these challenges also creates a te nsion between the need for security and 6"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"the requirements of openness in commerce and civil liberties. On the one hand, the flow of goods, services, pe ople, technology and inform ation grows every year, and with it the openness of Americ an society. On the other hand, terrorists and others wishing us harm seek to exploit that openness. As noted in the 2006 QDR, state actors no longer have a monopoly over the catastrophic use of violence. Small group s or individuals can harness chemical, biological, or even crude radiological or nuclear devices to cause extensive damage and harm. Similarly, they can atta ck vulnerable points in cyberspace and disrupt commerce and daily life in the United States, causing economic damage, compromising sensitive information and materials, an d interrupting critical services such as power and information networks. National security and domestic resources may be at risk, and the Departme nt must help respond to protect lives and national assets. The Department will c ontinue to be both bulwark and active protector in these areas. Yet, in the long run the Department of Defense is neither the best source of resources and capabilities nor the appropriate authority to shoulder these tasks. The comparative advantage, and applicable authorities, for action reside elsewhere in the U.S. Govern ment, at other levels of government, in the private sector, and with partner nations . DoD should expect an d plan to play a key supporting role in an interagency effort to combat these th reats, and to help develop new capacities and cap abilities, while protecting its own vulnerabilities. While defending the homeland in depth, th e Department must also maintain the capacity to support civil authorities in tim es of national emergency such as in the wake of catastrophic natural and man-ma de disasters. The Department will continue to maintain cons equence management capabilitie s and plan for their use to support government agenci es. Effective execution of such assistance, especially amid simultaneous, multi-jurisdictional di sasters, requires ever-closer working relationships with other departments and agencies, and at all levels of government. To help develop and cultivat e these working relationships, the Department will continue to support the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which is responsible for coordinating the Federal response to disasters. DoD must also reach out to non-governmental agencies and private sector entities that play a role in disaster response and recovery. Win the Long War For the foreseeable future, winning the Long War against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the U.S. We must defeat violent extremism as a threat to ou r way of life as a free and open society and foster an environment inhospitable to violent extremists and all those who support them. We face an extended series of campaigns to defeat violent extremist groups, 7"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"presently led by al-Qaeda and its associates. In concert with others, we seek to reduce support for violent extremism a nd encourage moderate voices, offering a positive alternative to the extremists’ vision for the future. Victory requires us to apply all elements of na tional power in partnershi p with old allies and new partners. Iraq and Afghanistan remain the central fronts in the struggle, but we cannot lose sight of the implications of fighting a long-term, episodic, multi-front, and multi-dimensional conflict more comp lex and diverse than the Cold War confrontation with communism. Success in Iraq and Afghanistan is crucial to winning this conflict, but it alone will not br ing victory. We face a clash of arms, a war of ideas, and an assistance effort th at will require patience and innovation. In concert with our partners, we must maintain a long-t erm commitment to undermining and reducing the sources of support for extremist groups, and to countering the ideologi cal totalitarian message s they build upon. We face a global struggle. Like communi sm and fascism before it, extremist ideology has transnational pretensions, and like its secular antecedents, it draws adherents from around the world. The vision it offers is in opposition to globalization and the expansion of free dom it brings. Paradoxically, violent extremist movements use the very instru ments of globalization – the unfettered flow of information and id eas, goods and services, cap ital, people, and technology – that they claim to reje ct to further their goals. Although driv en by this transnational ideology, our adversaries themselves ar e, in fact, a collection of regional and local extremist groups. Regional and local grievances help fuel the conflict, and it thrives in ungoverned, un der-governed, and mis-governed areas. This conflict is a prolonged irregular campaign, a violent struggle for legitimacy and influence over the population. The us e of force plays a role, yet military efforts to capture or kill terrorists are likely to be su bordinate to measures to promote local participation in govern ment and economic programs to spur development, as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies. For these reasons, arguably the most important military component of the struggle against vi olent extremists is not the fighting we do ourselves, but how well we help prepare our partne rs to defend and govern themselves. Working with and th rough local actors whenever possible to confront common security challenges is the best and most sustainable approach to combat violent extremism. Often our partners are be tter positioned to handl e a given problem because they understand th e local geography, social st ructures, and culture better than we do or ever could. In collabor ation with interagency and international partners we will assist vulnerable states and local populations as they seek to ameliorate the conditions that foster extremism and dism antle the structures that support and allow extremist groups to gr ow. We will adopt approaches tailored to 8"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"local conditions that will va ry considerably across regi ons. We will help foster security and aid local auth orities in building effective systems of representational government. By improving conditions, unde rmining the sources of support, and assisting in addressing root causes of turmoil, we will help states stabilize threatened areas. Countering the totalita rian ideological message of terrorist groups to help further undermine their potency will also require sensitive, sophisticated and integrated interagency and international efforts. The Department will support and facilitate these efforts. The struggle against violen t extremists will not end with a single battle or campaign. Rather, we will defeat them through the pa tient accumulation of quiet successes and the orchestration of all elements of national and international power. We will succeed by eliminati ng the ability of extremists to strike globally and catastrophically while also building the capa city and resolve of local governments to defeat them regionally. Victory will include discrediting extremist ideology, creating fissures between and among extr emist groups and reducing them to the level of nuisance groups that can be tracked and handled by law enforcement capabilities. Promote Security The best way to achieve secu rity is to prevent war when possible and to encourage peaceful change within the internati onal system. Our strategy emphasizes building the capacities of a broad spectrum of partners as the basis for long-term security. We must also seek to strengthen the resiliency of the international system to deal with conflict when it occurs. We must be prepar ed to deal with sudden disruptions, to help prevent them from escalating or endangering international security, and to find ways to bring them swiftly to a conclusion. Local and regional conflicts in particular remain a serious and immediate problem. They often spread and may exacerbate transnational problems such as trafficking in persons, drug-running, terrorism, and the illicit arms trade. Rogue states and extremist groups often seek to exploit the instability caused by regional conflict, and state collapse or the emergence of ungoverned areas may create safe havens for these groups. The prospect that inst ability and collapse in a strategic state could provide extremists acces s to weapons of mass destru ction or result in control of strategic resources is a particular concern. To preclude such calamities, we will help build the intern al capacities of countries at risk. We will work with and through like-minded states to help shrink the ungoverned areas of the world and ther eby deny extremists and other hostile 9"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"parties sanctuary. By helping others to police themselves and their regions, we will collectively address threats to the broader international system. We must also address the continuing need to build and support long-term international security. As the 2006 NSS underscores, relations with the most powerful countries of the world are central to our strategy. We seek to pursue U.S. interests within cooperative relationships , not adversarial ones, and have made great progress. For example, our relationship with India has evolved from an uneasy co-existence during th e Cold War to a growing pa rtnership today. We wish to use the opportunity of an absence of fundamental conflict between great powers to shape the future, and to prevent the re-emergence of great power rivalry. The United States welcomes the rise of a peaceful and prosperous China, and it encourages China to particip ate as a responsible stakeholder by taking on a greater share of burden for the stability, resilience, and growth of the in ternational system. However, much uncertainty su rrounds the future course China’s leaders will set for their country. Accordingly, the NSS states that “our strategy seeks to encourage China to ma ke the right strategic choices for its people, while we hedge against other possibilities.” A critical component of this strategy is the establishment and pursuit of continuous strategic dial ogue with China to build understanding, improve communi cation, and to reduce the risk of miscalculation. China continues to modernize and develo p military capabilities primarily focused on a Taiwan Strait conflict, but whic h could have app lication in other contingencies. The Departme nt will respond to China’ s expanding military power, and to the uncertainties over how it might be used, through sh aping and hedging. This approach tailors investment of substa ntial, but not infinite, resources in ways that favor key enduring U.S. strategic a dvantages. At the same time, we will continue to improve and refine our capabilities to respond to China if necessary. We will continue to press China to incr ease transparency in its defense budget expenditures, strategies, plan s and intentions. We will work with other elements of the U.S. Government to develop a co mprehensive strategy to shape China’s choices. In addition, Russia’s retreat from demo cracy and its increasing economic and political intimidation of its neighbors give cause for concern. We do not expect Russia to revert to outright global mil itary confrontation, but the risk of miscalculation or conflict ar ising out of economic coercion has increased. We also share interests w ith Russia, and can collaborat e with it in a variety of ways. We have multiple oppor tunities and venues to mold our security relationship and to cooperate – such as in counteri ng WMD proliferation an d extremist groups. 10"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"At the same time, we will seek other ways to encourage Russia to act as a constructive partner, while expressing our c oncerns over policies and aspects of its international behavior such as the sale of disruptive weapons technologies and interference in and coercion of its neighbors. Both China and Russia are important partners for the future and we seek to build collaborative and cooperative relationships with them. We will develop strategies across agencies, and intern ationally, to provide incentives for constructive behavior while also dissuading them from destabilizing actions. Deter Conflict Deterrence is key to preventing conflic t and enhancing security. It requires influencing the political and military choi ces of an adversary, dissuading it from taking an action by making its leaders unde rstand that either the cost of the action is too great, is of no use, or unnecessary. Deterrence also is based u pon credibility: the ability to prevent attack, respond decisively to an y attack so as to discourage even contemplating an attack upon us, a nd strike accurately when necessary. For nearly half a century, the United States approached its security focused on a single end: deterring the Soviet Union from attacking the United States and our allies in what could have escalated into a global thermonuclear catastrophe. To that purpose we built our de terrent upon a diverse and survivable nuclear force, coupled with a potent conventional capab ility, designed to co unter the military power of one adversary. Li kewise, our assumptions and calculations for shaping deterrence were based largely upon our unde rstanding of the dynamics and culture of the Soviet Union alone. All potential c onflict was subsumed and influenced by that confrontation and the fear of escala tion within it. Even so, there were limits. Military capabilities alone were, and are, no panacea to deter all conflict: despite the enormous strength of both the United States and the Soviet Union, conflicts arose; some were defused, while ot hers spilled over into local wars. In the contemporary strategic environment, the challenge is one of deterring or dissuading a range of potential adversaries from taking a variety of actions against the U.S. and our allies and interests. These adversaries could be states or non-state actors; they could use nucl ear, conventional, or unconve ntional weapons; and they could exploit terrorism, electronic, cybe r and other forms of warfare. Economic interdependence and the grow th of global communications further complicate the situation. Not only do they blur the types of threat s, they also exacerbate sensitivity to the effects of attacks and in some cases make it more difficult to attribute or trace them. Finally, the number of potential adversarie s, the breadth of 11"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"their capabilities, and the need to design approaches to deterrence for each, create new challenges. We must tailor deterrence to fit particular actors, situations, and forms of warfare. The same developments that add to the comp lexity of the challe nge also offer us a greater variety of capabilities and methods to deter or dissuade adversaries. This diversity of tools, military and non-military, allows us to create more plausible reactions to attacks in the eyes of opp onents and a more credible deterrence to them. In addition, changes in capabilities, especially new technologies, permit us to create increasingly credible defenses to convince would-be at tackers that their efforts are ultimately futile. Our ability to deter attack credibly also reassures th e American people and our allies of our commitment to defend them. For this reason, deterrence must remain grounded in demonstrat ed military capabilities that can respond to a br oad array of challenges to international security. For example, the United States will maintain its nuclear arsenal as a primary deterrent to nuclear attack , and the New Triad remains a cornerstone of strategic deterre nce. We must also continue to field conventional capabilitie s to augment or even replace nuclear weapons in order to provide our leaders a greater range of cr edible responses. Missile defenses not only deter an attack, but can defend against such an attack shou ld deterrence fail. Precision-guided munitions allow us great flexibility not only to react to attacks, but also to strike preemptiv ely when necessary to defend ourselves and our allies. Yet we must also recognize that deterrence has its limits, especially where our interests are ill-defined or the targets of our deterrence are difficult to influence. Deterrence may be impossible in cases where the value is not in the destruction of a target, but the attack and the very means of attack, as in terrorism. We must build both our ability to withstand attack – a fundamental and defensive aspect of deterrence – and improve our re siliency beyond an attack. An important change in planning for the myriad of futu re potential threats must be post-attack recovery and operational capacity. This, to o, helps demonstrate that such attacks are futile, as does our ability to respond with strength and effectiveness to attack. For the future, the global scope of problems, and the growing complexity of deterrence in new domains of conflict, w ill require an integrated interagency and international approach if we are to make use of all the tools available to us. We must consider which non-leth al actions constitute an a ttack on our sovereignty, and which may require the use of force in response. We must understand the potential for escalation from non-lethal to lethal confrontation, and learn to calculate and manage th e associated risks. 12"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Win our Nation’s Wars Despite our best efforts at prevention and deterrence, we must be prepared to act together with like minded states against st ates when they thre aten their neighbors, provide safe haven to terrorists, or pursue destabilizing weapons. Although improving the U.S. Armed Forces’ proficiency in irregular warfare is the Defense Department’s top priority, the United States does not have the luxury of preparing exclusively for such challenge s. Even though the likelih ood of interstate conflict has declined in recent years, we ignore it at our peril. Current circumstances in Southwest Asia and on the Korean Peni nsula, for example, demonstrate the continuing possibility of conf lict. When called upon, the Department must be positioned to defeat enemies employi ng a combination of capabilities, conventional and irregular, kinetic a nd non-kinetic, across the spectrum of conflict. We must maintain the edge in our conv entional forces. Rogue states will remain a th reat to U.S. regional inte rests. Iran and North Korea continue to exert coercive pressure in th eir respective regions, where each seek to challenge or reduce U.S. influence. Re sponding to and, as necessary, defeating these, and potentially other, rogue states will remain a major challenge. We must maintain the capabilities requi red to defeat state adve rsaries, including those armed with nuclear weapons. Achieving Our Objectives We will achieve our objectiv es by shaping the choices of key states, preventing adversaries from acquiring or using WMD, strengthening and expanding alliances and partnerships, securing U. S. strategic access and retaining freedom of action, and integrating and unifying our efforts. Shape the Choices of Key States Although the role of non-state actors in world affairs has increased, states will continue to be the basis of the international order. In cooperation with our allies and friends, the United States can help shape the intern ational environment, the behavior of actors, and the choices that st rategic states face in ways that foster accountability, cooperation, and mutual trust. Shaping choices contributes to achieving many of our objec tives. It is critical to defending the homeland by convincing key st ates that attacking the United States would be futile and ul timately self-defeating. Our de terrence posture is designed to persuade potential aggressors that they cannot meet their objectives through an 13"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"attack on the United States and that such actions would result in an overwhelming response. Our posture and capabilities also contribute to deterring conflict of other types, particularly with potential advers ary states. We can also promote security by helping shape the choices that strategic states make, encourag ing them to avoid destabilizing paths and adhering to international norms on the use of force, the promotion of peace a nd amity, and acting as good stewards of the public good within their own borders. We shall seek to anchor China and Russia as stakeholders in the system. Similarly, we look to India to assume greater responsibility as a stakeholder in the international system, commens urate with its growing ec onomic, military, and soft power. Prevent Adversaries from Acquiri ng or Using Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) There are few greater challenges than t hose posed by chemical, biological, and particularly nuclear weapons. Preventing the spread of these weapons, and their use, requires vigilance and obligates us to anticipate and counter threats. Whenever possible, we prefer non-military options to achieve this purpose. We combine non-proliferation efforts to deny these weapons and th eir components to our adversaries, active efforts to defe nd against and defeat WMD and missile threats before they are unleashed, and improved protection to mitigate the consequences of WMD use. We also seek to convince our adversaries that they cannot attain their goals with WMD, and thus should not acquire such weapons in the first place. However, as the NSS states, the United States will, if necessary, act preemptively in exercising its right of self-defense to forestall or prevent hostile acts by our adversaries. Reducing the proliferation of WMD a nd bolstering norms against their use contribute to defending the homeland by limiting the number of states that can directly threaten us and dissuading the pot ential transfer of these weapons to non- state actors. As we and our partners limit WMD pr oliferation, we will deny terrorists a potent weapon and contribute to bringing the fight against violent extremists to a successful c onclusion on U.S. terms. A number of hostile or potentially hostile states are actively seeking or have acquired WMD. Some may seek them for pr estige or deterrence; others may plan to use them. Preventing su ch regimes from acquiring or proliferating WMD, and the means to deliver them, contributes to promoting security. Fortunately, the ranks of the nuclear powers are still small, but they could grow in the next decade in th e absence of concerted action. Many more countries possess 14"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"chemical and biological weap ons programs – programs that are more difficult to detect, impede, or eliminate. These countries will continue to pursue WMD programs as a means to deter, coerce, and potentially use against adversaries. Shaping the behavior of additional states seeking or acquiring weapons of mass destruction will require an inte grated, international effort. Technological and information advances of th e last fifty years have led to the wide dissemination of WMD knowledge and lowe red barriers to entry. Relatively sophisticated chemical agents, and even crude biologic al agents, are within the reach of many non-state actors with a modicum of scientific knowledge. Non-state actors may acquire WMD, either through clandestine production, state- sponsorship, or theft. Also of concern is the potentia l for severe instability in WMD states and resulting loss of control of these weapons. In these cases, the United States, through a concerted interage ncy and partner nation effort, must be prepared to detect, tag and track, in tercept, and destroy WMD and related materials. We must also be prepared to act quickly to secure those weapons and materials in cases where a state loses cont rol of its weapons, especially nuclear devices. Should the worst happen, and we are attacked, we must be able to sustain operations during that attack and help mitigate the cons equences of WMD attacks at home or overseas. Strengthen and Expand Allia nces and Partnerships The United States also must strengthen an d expand alliances an d partnerships. The U.S. alliance system has been a cornerstone of peace and security for more than a generation and remains the key to our success, contributing significantly to achieving all U.S. objectives. Allies often possess capab ilities, skills, and knowledge we cannot duplicate. We should not limit ourselves to the relationships of the past. We must broade n our ideas to include partnerships for new situations or circumstances, calling on moderate voices in troubled regions and unexpected partners. In some cases, we may develop arrangements limited to specific objectives or goals, or even of limited duration. Although these arrangements will vary according to mutual interests, they should be built on respect, reciprocity, and transparency. The capacities of our partners vary across mi ssion areas. We will be able to rely on many partners for certain low-risk missions such as peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance, whereas comp lex counterinsurgency and high-end conventional operations are likely to draw on fewer partners with the capacity, will, and capability to act in support of mutual goals. We will support, train, advise and equip partner security forces to counter insurgencies, terrorism, proliferation, and other threats. We will assist other countries in improvi ng their capabilities 15"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"through security cooperation, just as we will learn valu able skills and information from others better situated to understand some of the complex challenges we face together. We must also work with longstanding friends and allies to transform their capabilities. Key to transformation is traini ng, education and, where appropriate, the transfer of defense artic les to build partner capacity. We must work to develop new ways of operating across the full spectr um of warfare. Our partnerships must be capable of applying milita ry and non-military power when and where needed – a prerequisite against an adapta ble transnational enemy. Secure U.S. strategi c access and retain freedom of action For more than sixty years, the United States has secured the global commons for the benefit of all. Global prosperity is contingent on the free flow of ideas, goods, and services. The enormous growth in trade has lifted millions of people out of poverty by making locally produced goods available on the global market. Low barriers to trade also benefit consumer s by reducing the cost of goods and allowing countries to specialize. None of this is possible without a basic belief that goods shipped through air or by se a, or information transmitted under the ocean or through space, will arrive at their destination safely. The development and proliferation of anti-ac cess technologies and tactics threatens to undermine this belief. The United States requires freedom of ac tion in the global commons and strategic access to important regions of the world to meet our national security needs. The well-being of the global economy is contingent on ready access to energy resources. Notwithstanding national efforts to reduce dependence on oil, current trends indicate an increasing reliance on petroleum products from areas of instability in the coming years, not reduced relia nce. The United States will continue to foster access to and flow of energy resources vital to the world economy. Further, the Department is exam ining its own energy demands and is taking action to reduce fuel demand wher e it will not negativel y affect operational capability. Such efforts w ill reduce DoD fuel costs and assist wider U.S. Government energy security and environmental objectives. We will continue to transform overseas U. S. military presence through global defense posture realignment, leveraging a more agile contin ental U.S. (CONUS)- based expeditionary total force and further developing a more relevant and flexible forward network of capabilities and arrang ements with allies and partners to ensure strategic access. 16"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Integrate and unify our ef forts: A new “Jointness” Our efforts require a unified approach to both planning and implementing policy. Iraq and Afghanistan remind us that m ilitary success alone is insufficient to achieve victory. We must not forget our hard-learned lessons or allow the important soft power capabilities developed because of them to atrophy or even disappear. Beyond security, essential i ngredients of long-term success include economic development, institution building, and the rule of law, as well as promoting internal reconcilia tion, good governance, provi ding basic services to the people, training and equi pping indigenous military a nd police forces, strategic communications. We as a nation must strengthen not on ly our military capabilities, but also reinvigorate other im portant elements of national power and develop the capability to integrate, tailo r, and apply these t ools as needed. We must tap the full strength of America and its people. The Department of Defense ha s taken on many of these burdens. Our forces have stepped up to the task of long-term reconstruction, development and governance. The U.S. Armed Forces will need to institutionalize and retain these capabilities, but this is no replacement for civilia n involvement and ex pertise. The United States must improve its ability to deploy civilian expertise rapidly, and continue to increase effectiveness by jo ining with organizations and people outside of government – untapped resources with e normous potential. We can make better use of the expertise of our universities and of industry to assist in reconstruction and long-term improvements to economic v itality and good governance. Greater civilian participation is necessary both to make military operations successful and to relieve stress on the men and women of the armed forces . Having permanent civilian capabilities available and using them early could also make it less likely that military forces w ill need to be deployed in the first place. We also need capab ilities to meet the ch allenges of the 21 st century. Strategic communications within the Department and across government is a good example. Although the United States i nvented modern public rela tions, we are unable to communicate to the world effectively who we are and what we stand for as a society and culture, about freedom and democracy, and about our goals and aspirations. This capability is and will be crucial not only fo r the Long War, but also for the consistency of our message on crucial security issues to our allies, adversaries, and the world. We will continue to work with other U.S. Departments and Agencies, state and local governments, partners and allies, and international and multilateral organizations to achieve our objectives. A whole-of-government approach is only possible when every government department and agency understands the core competencies, roles, missions, and capabilities of its partners and works together 17"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"to achieve common goals. Examples such as expandin g U.S. Southern Command’s interagency composition and th e establishment of U.S. Africa Command will point the way. In addition, we will support efforts to coordinate national security planning more effec tively, both within DoD and across other U.S. Departments and Agencies. We will continue to work to improve un derstanding and harmoni ze best practices amongst interagency partners. This must happen at every level from Washington, DC-based headquarters to th e field. DoD, in partners hip with DHS, also will continue to develop habitual relationships with state a nd local authoritie s to ensure we are positioned to respond when necessary and support civil authorities in times of emergency, where allo wable by law. Through these efforts we will significantly increase our collective abilities to defend the homeland. We will further develop and refine our own capabilities. We should continue to develop innovative capabilities, concept, and organizations. We will continue to rely on adaptive planning, on integration an d use of all government assets, and on flexibility and speed. Yet we must not only have a full spectrum of capabilities at our disposal, but also employ and tailo r any or all of them to a complex environment. These developments will re quire an expanded understanding of “jointness,” one that seamlessly combin es civil and military capabilities and options. Finally, we must consider further realigning Department structures, and interagency planning and response efforts, to better address these risks and to meet new needs. We will examine how integrated planning is conducted within the Department, and how to make better use of our own existing capacities. DoD Capabilities and Means Implementation of any strategy is pred icated on developing, maintaining and, where possible, expanding the means requi red to execute its objectives within budget constraints. Without the tools, we cannot do the job. The Department is well equipped for its primary missions, but it always seeks to improve and refine capabilities and effectiveness. The challenges before us will require resourcefulness and an integrated approach that wisely balances risks and assets, and that recognizes where we must impr ove, and where others are better suited to help implement aspects of the strategy. The Department will c ontinue to emphasize the area s identified in the 2006 QDR, specifically improvements in capabilitie s for defeating terrorist networks, defending the homeland in depth, shaping the choices of countries at strategic 18"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"crossroads, and preventing adversaries’ acquisition and use of weapons of mass destruction. Although these capabilitie s are not sufficient to address all the missions of the Department, they require particular attention. The Department’s greatest asset is the people who dedicate themselves to the mission. The Total Force distributes and balances skills across each of its constituent elements: the Ac tive Component, the Reserv e Component, the civilian workforce, and the pr ivate sector and contractor ba se. Each element relies on the other to accomplish the mission; none ca n act independently of the other to accomplish the mission. The force has been severely tasked betw een operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and fu lfilling other missions a nd assignments. Although we are already committed to st rengthening our forces, we also should seek to find more ways to retain and tap into the uniq ue skills and experience of the thousands of veterans and others who have se rved and who can provide valuable contributions to national security. We will continue to pursue the improvements in the total force identif ied in the 2006 QDR and elsewhere, including the expansion of special operations forces a nd ground forces and developing modular, adaptable joint forces. Strategic communications will play an in creasingly important role in a unified approach to national security. DoD, in pa rtnership with the Department of State, has begun to make strides in this area, and will continue to do so. However, we should recognize that this is a weakne ss across the U.S. Government, and that a coordinated effort must be made to impr ove the joint planning and implementation of strategic communications. Intelligence and information sharing have always been a vital component of national security. Reliable information an d analysis, quickly available, is an enduring challenge. As noted in the 2 006 QDR, DoD is pursuing improved intelligence capabilities across th e spectrum, such as de fense human intelligence focused on identifying and penetrating te rrorist networks and measurement and signature intelligence to identif y WMD and delivery systems. Technology and equipment are the tools of the Total Force, and we must give our people what they need, and the best res ources, to get the job done. First-class technology means investing in the right kinds of technology at the right time. Just as our adversaries adapt and develop new tactics, tec hniques, and procedures, we too must be nimble and creative. One area of particular focus is developing the means to locate, tag and track WMD com ponents. We also must continue to improve our acquisition and contracting re gulations, procedures, and oversight to ensure agile and timely procurement of critical equipment and materials for our forces. 19"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Organization also is a key to the DoD’s su ccess, especially as it brings together disparate capabilities and skills to wield as a unified and overpowering force. Concepts such as “net-centricity” can he lp guide DoD, linking components of the Department together and connecting organizations with complementary core competencies, forging the Tota l Force into more than the sum of it s parts. The goal is to break down barriers and transform industrial-era organizational structures into an information and knowledge-based enterprise. These concepts are not a panacea, and will require investments in people as much as in technology to realize the full potentia l of these initiatives. Strengthening our burgeoning system of alli ances and partnerships is essential to implementing our strategy. We have become more integrated with our allies and partners on the battlefield and elsewhere. Whether formal alliances such as NATO or newer partnerships such as the Pro liferation Security Initiative, they have proved their resiliency and adaptability. These relationships continue to evolve, ensuring their relevance as new cha llenges emerge. Our partners provide resources, knowledge, skills, and capabilities we cannot duplicate. Building these partnerships takes resources . DoD has worked with its interagency partners and Congress to expand the po rtfolio of security cooperation and partnership capacity building tools over the last seven years and will continue to do so. These tools are essential to succe ssful implementation of the strategy. We will also work with Congress and other stakeholders to address our significant concern with growing legal and regulatory re strictions that impede, and threaten to undermine, our military readiness. DoD will continue to implem ent global defense posture realignment, transforming from legacy base structures and forward-garrisoned forc es to an expeditionary force, providing greater flexibility to c ontend with uncertainty in a changing strategic environment. Managing Risk Implementing the National Defense Strate gy and its objectives requires balancing risks, and understanding the choices those risks imply. We cannot do everything, or function equally well acro ss the spectrum of conflict. Ultimately we must make choices. With limited resources, our strategy must address how we assess, mitigate, and respond to risk. Here we de fine risk in terms of th e potential for damage to national security combined with the probability of o ccurrence and a measurement of the consequences should the underlying risk remain unaddressed. We must 20"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"hedge against changes in the strategic environment that might invalidate the assumptions underpinning the strategy as we ll as address risks to the strategy. First, there are risks associat ed with the indirect approach that is fundamental to the Long War. We must recognize that partner contributions to future coalition operations will vary in size, compositi on, competence, and capability. Some partners will have the political will and the capacity and capability to make significant contributions across the spectr um of conflict. Other partners will demonstrate more restraint in the type of operation (e.g., counter-terrorism, stabilization, traditional combat operations) in which they will participate. We must balance the clear need for partners – the Long War is ultimately not winnable without them – with mission requirement s for effectiveness and efficiency. Additionally, the strategic shocks identif ied above could pote ntially change the rules of the game and require a fundame ntal re-appraisal of the strategy. Second, the strategy must account fo r four dimensions of risk: • Operational risks are those associated with th e current force executing the strategy successfully within acceptable human, material, financial, and strategic costs. • Future challenges risks are those associated with th e Department’s capacity to execute future missions succ essfully against an array of prospective future challengers. • Force management risks are those associated with managing military forces fulfilling the objectives described in this National Defense Strategy . The primary concern here is recruiting, reta ining, training, a nd equipping a force and sustaining its readiness. • Institutional risks are those associated with the capacity of new command, management, and business practices. Operational Risk To address the potential fo r multiple contingencies, the Department will develop a range of military options for the President, including means to de-escalate crises and reduce demand on forces where possible. Addressing operational risk requires clearly articulating the risks inherent in and the consequences of choosing among the options and proposing mitigation strategies. U.S. predominance in traditional warfare is not unchallenged, but is sustainable for the medium term given current trends. The 2006 QDR focused on non-traditional or irregular challenges. We will contin ue to focus our investments on building 21"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"capabilities to address these other challenge s, while examining areas where we can assume greater risk. Future Challenges Risk An underlying assumption in our understa nding of the strategic environment is that the predominant near-term challenges to the Un ited States will come from state and non-state actors us ing irregular and catastrophic capabilities. Although our advanced space and cyber-s pace assets give us unparalleled advantages on the traditional battlefield, they also entail vulnerabilities. China is developing technologies to disr upt our traditional advantages. Examples include development of anti-satellite capa bilities and cyber warfare. Other actors, particularly non-state actors, are developi ng asymmetric tactics, techniques, and procedures that seek to avoid situations where our advantages come into play. The Department will invest in hedging against the loss or disruption of our traditional advantages, not on ly through developing mitig ation strategies, but also by developing alternative or parallel means to the same end. This diversification parallelism is distinct from acquiring ove rmatch capabilities (whereby we have much more than an adversary of a simi lar capability). It will involve pursuing multiple routes to similar effects while ensuring that su ch capabilities are applicable across mult iple mission areas. Force Management Risk The people of our Total For ce are the greatest asset of the Department. Ensuring that each person has the opportunity to contribute to the maximum of their potential is critical to achieving DoD’s objectives and supporting U.S. national security. An all-volunteer force is th e foundation of the most professional and proficient fighting force in the world. It also underlines the necessity to innovate in providing opportunities for advancement and grow th. Our civilian and military workforce similarly possesses skills that are highly prized in the private sector, thus requiring a concerted strate gy to retain these professionals. Retaining well-trained, motivated military a nd civilian personnel is key. Financial incentives only go so far. Our military and civilian pers onnel elect to serve their country unselfishly. It is th e responsibility of our senior leaders to recognize that fact and provide the means for personne l to grow, develop new knowledge, and develop new skills. 22"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 23 Institutional Risk Since 2001, the Department has created new commands (integrating Space and Strategic Commands, establishing Northern and Africa Commands) and new governance structures. DoD is already a complex organization. We must guard against increasing organizational complex ity leading to redundancy, gaps, or overly bureaucratic decision-making processes. Conclusion The strategy contained in this document is the result of an assessment of the current and future strategic environment. The United States, and particularly the Department of Defense, will not win the Long War or successfully address other security challenges alone. Forging a new consensus for a livab le world requires constant effort and unity of purpose with our Allies and partners. The Department stands ready to fulfill its mission."}]
