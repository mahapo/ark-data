No one cares to spy on it, no newspapermen are present, no photographers interrupt, no representatives of a yellow journal harass or intimidate the members . It would be use- less . If a reporter found out what plans are discussed, what plots are made, what schemes proposed, no newspaper would publish the disclosures, sensational as they might be . Noth- ing is sacred to the American press but itself . And yet these secret meetings of our organized publishers rank among the most important actions against the general welfare of the American people ever taken (legally) by any small national group in our time . But since the press pub- lishes the news, true or false or half-way, about everything in the world except itself, the American public knows noth- ing about what the rulers of public opinion annually de- cide for it . Only rarely do the millions learn or sense the truth about the activities of this group of leaders . In the repudiation of the press in the 1936 election there was a symptom of the universal suspicion and growing anger of the public, but this awakening was made possible by the fact that millions were already pledged to the party the majority of newspapers attacked, and the radio was used extensively, and there were other means of breaking the press offensive . In social, rather than political, issues there is no means by which the public can defeat the dictation of the press . 3"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"4 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS The publishers' meetings are secret because their actions cannot bear the light of publicity . Three hundred and sixty days in the year the publishers speak editorially for open covenants openly arrived at, whether in international rela- tions or in the advertising business, but every April they lock the doors and make a hypocritical paradox out of their own ideals . We know that in the open meetings they approve annually of \"freedom of the press as the bulwark of our civilization,\" and that in the closed meetings they discuss ways and means of fighting labor and their own employees who demand higher wages or perhaps better light or decent toilet arrange- ments . We do know that in the open meetings they pledge themselves to honesty and truth and the whole bagful of tricks in the ethical code of their profession, and they also discuss the cost of paper, the ways to increase advertising and gain circulation, and other purely materialistic subjects which are necessary if any press, free or kept, is to survive . But it is somewhat of a shock to learn that in the closed ses- sions they defend the employment of child labor, they take united action against a Congressional measure which would keep drugmakers from poisoning or cheating the American people, and they gloat over their own strike-breaking de- partment which offers scabs not only to members but to anyone who wants to fight the unions . One of the most recent secret meetings was devoted to nothing but war on the American Newspaper Guild, the association of newspaper workers which offended the pub- lishers when it joined the American Federation of Labor and drove them into hysterics when it later joined the Committee for Industrial , Organization . In all American business and industry today there is probably no instance of such bitter- ness, such conflict, such hatred, such opposition, and such war to the throat as between the newspaper workers and the newspaper owners . The amusing angle to this story is that the publishers still print that cockeyed falsehood about the"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"THE HOUSE OF LORDS 5 interests of capital and labor being identical . It certainly isn't in their own line . What conspiratorial plans are made to fight labor at the secret sessions we can judge best by what happens . We have seen such united action as an attack on Congress when it considered passing the Wagner Labor Act which is regarded as a Magna Carta of the working people of America . We have watched the press of the country condemn it after it passed . And, moreover, we have seen the publishers openly defy the law, declare it unconstitutional, and, when the Guild took the test case to the Supreme Court and the law was declared constitutional, we have seen the publishers inaugurate a movement to repeal or alter or emasculate this law . We have seen the publishers declare the National Labor Relations Board unconstitutional long before the Supreme Court declared it constitutional . We have seen the publishers unite to fight any and every attempt to increase taxes on the rich and alleviate the burdens of the poor . All sorts of tran- scendental humanitarian poppycock has been invented by the highly paid editorial writers and rich columnists to hide this fundamental conflict of the Haves and Havenots in America . But the fact is becoming known to the public that the press lords of America are the champions of the former while still flying the pre-war flag of \"service to the common people .\" There are of course many men of the highest ideals in the membership . But so far as can be learned they have not been able in the past to gain their points even in the most flagrant cases of violation of journalistic ethics . The La Follette Civil Liberties Investigation Committee has given documentary evidence that four of the biggest newspapers in the country had employed spies or thugs, but no action was taken by the publishers' association . Some years ago one of its members was found guilty in a Federal court of theft . His news service had stolen the news"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"6 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS from another service . But he was not fired from either the publishers' association or the service which he robbed and of which he is still a member . Another newspaper was found guilty of blackmailing oil companies for a million dollars . And a third of suppressing the scandal for $92,000 . There was some talk of taking action . Twenty or more of the big newspapers of the country were found by a Congressional investigation to be secretly con- trolled by the power and paper trust . Colonel Robert Ewing, publisher of the New Orleans States, president of the Southern Newspaper Publisher Association, a component branch of the A . N . P . A ., offered, at the convention of the latter, a resolution condemning the power and paper trust's activities . It was tabled . S . E . Thomason, then of the Chicago Journal, went Colonel Ewing one better with a resolution that all the great publishers in America make public all their connections with power and paper trusts, with all the banks, and with all the powerful financial institutions which control the country . The resolution was defeated with a roar of laughter . On the other hand, when a speaker for the National Elec- tric Light Association-with its $25,000,000 a year fund for influencing newspapers-said at its convention that \"There we are, brothers under the skin, utility and newspaper battling shoulder to shoulder . Our most important contact is . . . the American Newspaper Publishers Association,\" the latter accepted the remark as a compliment . In fact every annual convention proves more fully than the last the statement made by William Allen White, now president of the editors' association, that the newspaper business is a business and nothing more . The code of ethics of the journalistic profession is no longer put into practice . But all the anti-social activities of big business have become the program of the A . N . P . A . In fact it is frequently diffi- cult to distinguish its program from that of the National"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"THE HOUSE OF LORDS 7 Association of Manufacturers and the United States Cham- ber of Commerce . Heywood Broun, president of the Guild, who attended several open and secret sessions one year, said he was shocked by the smallness \"of this collection of very small men so obviously drunk with a smug sense of power and self- righteousness,\" who \"get themselves up as the full and all- sufficient judges of what the public should get in the way of news and of opinion .\" He listened for days . \"The ghost of Thomas Jefferson was sent whirling along the flying trapeze as Bainbridge Colby, exhumed from heaven knows where, uttered dreary tory platitudes about big business and its sacred rights . I was struck by the fact that, with the mild exception of Glenn Frank, all the spokesmen and invited orators of the publishers were old men . And they did not talk of journalism but of the industry . If a man from Mars had happened in, I think he might have spent an hour and still . remained puzzled as to whether he had happened in upon a convention of bankers, cotton-mill owners, or the makers . of bathroom supplies . . . . \"The publishers decided that they would accept no sort of code of fair practice whatsoever . They decided not to disturb carrier boys between the ages of ten and twelve who are already on the job . They condemned the mild Copeland bill on foods and drugs . H . W . Flagg, of the Philadelphia Public Ledger, chairman of the Open Shop Committee, unofficially offered the services of his committee to all pub- lishers, members and non-members, for strike-breaking pur- poses . And so you see once more the publishers have saved the freedom of the press .\" When the National Electric Light Association was engaged in buying the good will of the American press, it also main- tained a lobby in Washington for the purpose of using Congressmen for its own commercial purposes . This lobby was never exposed or mentioned . Other lobbies, notably those which are not in any way"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"8 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS affiliated with advertising, have from time to time been the subject of newspaper attacks . They have given the word \"lobby\" a sinister connotation, associated with such words as \"propaganda\" and \"isms\" and other things called \"un- American .\" But for years there has been a powerful lobby at work in Washington which up to now has been more successful than any except possibly the American Legion lobby . This is the publishers' lobby . It not only is active in making laws, amending laws, and preventing laws, but it has the unique distinction-can it be because of the power of the press?-of recommending that the publishers break the law . Incidents and illustrations of this group's power are many and important . But before sampling those of New Deal time, I would like to mention an exposure of this lobby which can be found in \"62nd Congress, ist session, Senate Documents, Vol . 6, Reciprocity with Canada Hearings, Vol . 2,\" because this episode although belonging to another generation never- theless illuminates not only the means the organization still employs, but also furnishes a clue to subjects of later chapters . The United States, as many readers may remember, has from time to time been the scene of hefty debate over tariffs on foreign goods. The Republican press has been in favor, the Democratic press has been opposed to them, the indus- trialist North generally for protection, the agricultural South for free trade, the Republican newspaper propaganda insist- ing that prosperity and the full dinner pail-what memories these old-fashioned words bring up!-depended entirely upon the tariff wall keeping cheap foreign goods out and the American laborer contented in rich green pastures, the Democrat denying it all at every depression . At the very time the Republican newspapers were pub- lishing this drivel and propaganda they combined with the owners of Democratic newspapers in lobbying in Washing- ton for the purpose of getting print paper and wood pulp"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"THE HOUSE OF LORDS \t 9 exempt from a proposed severe tariff bill . The matter in- volved was a mere $5,000,000 per annum for the entire newspaper industry, no awe-inspiring sum in the face of a yearly advertising budget of one and a half to two billions, and the fact that more than one newspaper had net annual earnings of five millions or more . Yet for this sum at least half the entire press of the United States was willing to give up its editorial policies regarding tariff and join with its political enemies in a non-partisan bit of lobbying . Among those who called on the Secretary of State to de- mand free wood pulp and free print paper was Frank B . Noyes, of the Washington Star, one of the founders of the Associated Press, and its president up to April, 1938 . Within a few days after this visit the president of the A . N . P . A ., Herman Ridder, sent a letter to every publisher, member or not, which after mentioning a saving of five millions added that the bill, if ratified, would also save our forests and remove \"a tax upon knowledge\" ; therefore \"will you promptly communicate with your Senators and representa- tives in Congress and urge favorable action .\" So far the activities of the publishers' lobby had been both legal and ethical . But apparently the matter was not going through unopposed, for in the Congressional investigation there was introduced a copy of a confidential telegram which Ridder also sent, saying that \"it is of vital importance to the newspapers that their Washington correspondents be in- structed to treat favorably the Canadian reciprocity agree- ment . . . .\" This request was a violation of every code of ethics in the history of journalism . During the course of the debate it was proved that the \"tax upon knowledge\" was pure hypocrisy . It was purely a savings for publishers . The claim the reader would be bene- fited financially was proven false : it would take about thirty- three years for one average copy of a daily to consume a ton, and the duty of $3 .75 meant ten cents a year more for each subscriber . And when farmers spoke against the tariff"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"1 0 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS cut the Associated Press men took no notes, whereas those who spoke for it made the headlines . When Melville Stone, head of the A . P ., said the press was fair although ninety per- cent of the publishers were against the tariff, it was proven statistically that the A . P . itself was sending out six times as much pro as anti news, and Mr . Stone was forced to admit that it was due \"either to stupidity on the part of the people who were reporting . . . or ordinary weaknesses that attach to human beings .\" These human weaknesses eventually rob a nation of a free press as great editors will testify . They are the weaknesses of egotism, of power seeking, of greed for profits, which men in other businesses often admit but which most publishers hide under beautiful words about public service . However, in the actions of the publishers' lobby against all reform legislation in more recent times we can see these motives a little more clearly than in the hypocritical past . From the earliest days of the so-called New Deal, and immediately following the 1933 pro-Roosevelt parade in which the publishers marched under a friendly banner, their lobby has aimed at getting the press exempt from every law and regulation which affects other businesses and which might also affect their profits . The story is told that Bernard Shaw, leaving an Albert Hall meeting which he had ad- dressed, was stopped by a beggar who held out a tin can . \"Press!\" said Mr . Shaw, and moved on . Apocryphal as this story may be, it illustrates well the attitude of the American newspaper publishers . In reply to every attempt to apply legislation affecting unionization, child labor, hours, wages, sanitation, working conditions, or other social reforms upon them, they have excused themselves with Mr . Shaw's remark ; they have not only whispered, but bellowed \"Freedom of the Press!\" The President put them in their place in 1934 when the industrial codes, later outlawed, were hailed as the salvation of the nation. The publishers' lobby favored a code for every"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"THE HOUSE OF LORDS \t 11 - business except theirs . But since this could not be, they drew one up which was \"the most dishonest, weasel-worded and treacherous document\" * ever offered to General Johnson . The publishers' lobby code was so designed that it would permit them to escape all the obligations (for promoting prosperity) which they were urging upon all the rest of the nation . When General Johnson threw the lobby code aside, the lobby replied by publishing a false statement that it had been accepted . When this intimidation failed, the lobby demanded that Postmaster General Farley put pressure upon Johnson . When this also failed, the attack was continued with other weapons, one tabloid going so far as to publish an untrue story about the General and his party crashing a speakeasy . General Johnson went speaking throughout the country . He was bitter against the publishers, and especially the lobby . \"They are few in number, but ruthless in method,\" he declared . \"Some of them control powerful news- papers and they are using these papers to misrepresent every development of NRA . It is no longer possible to get a square deal in truth and accuracy . . . .\" But the betting in news- paper offices was ten to one that \"the big steamroller, as represented by the American Newspaper Publishers Asso- ciation, would crush General Johnson, the President himself, and everyone connected with the NRA .\" This steamroller is still crushing . In several instances, it is sad but true, the President has given in to the publishers ; and the latter repaid him by joining-Democrats and Independents with Repub- licans-in the vast 1936 campaign against his second election . In 1935 the publishers' lobby won four of its five cam- paigns in Washington, and barely lost the last, an exemption from the provision of the Wagner Labor Disputes Bill, where the Newspaper Guild was on the side of labor, as opposed to the publishers who represented the employers . * So reported by Washington Correspondent P . Y . Anderson ."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"1 2 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS During the Senate hearings Elisha Hanson, attorney for the A . N . P . A ., attacked the bill as a whole, on the ground that it would infringe freedom to print or fail to print what the publishers wished . In the House, the publishers got Representative William P . Connery (Dem ., Mass.) to add a proviso which was nothing more than the old \"Freedom of the Press\" clause always trotted out when profits are at stake . The Guild spokesman, however, exposed this maneuver, and the amendment was out when the bill passed . It is now well known that the publishers played the strong- est hand in defeating the Tugwell Bill . Nevertheless, when the first Copeland Bill, its mild, emasculated successor, was produced in Congress, the publishers joined the Proprietary Association of Drug Manufacturers in defeating it also . The reason for this sanguinary attack on a bill already weakened to please the drugmakers, was the publishers' insistence on clauses putting all the blame for violations on the manu- facturers and dealers, none on the advertising agencies and newspapers . Along came the Agricultural Adjustment Act, and along came the publishers with amendments, one definitely stating that no marketing order could be issued \"prohibiting, reg- ulating or restricting\" advertising, and providing that no processing tax can be fixed on material to be made into wood pulp, from which newsprint is manufactured . The Black Thirty-Hour-Week Bill was kept in Representa- tive Connery's labor committee until it emerged with exemp- tions for banks, newspapers and magazines . Finally, there was the Eastman Bus and Truck Bill which was sent to the President for signature . It gives the Interstate Commerce Commission power to regulate motor carriers, but makes four commodity exemptions, the first three being livestock, fish and agricultural products, the last being news- papers . When this list of 1935 achievements of the publishers' pressure lobby was announced the Guild Reporter said it"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"THE HOUSE OF LORDS \t 13 was \"overcome with admiration .\" Of course that provision in the last of the laws which sets maximum hours for truck drivers hauling papers in interstate commerce might well be interpreted as an attack on freedom of the press . Naturally, any attempt by Congress to tax wood pulp is a violation of the constitution which grants liberty to publishers . And of course if Congress insisted that the advertisers of worthless drugs tell the same truth in the newspapers which the 19o6 law requires them to tell on the labels, that would curtail sales, curtail advertising, curtail profits for publishers and therefore become the most dastardly attack on the American public's inherent right to a free press which our history has ever known . So you see, the lobby has a lot of work . V It may not, be ethical, or decent, or moral in the higher sense, but it is generally legal . The great publishers of Amer- ica have never been afraid to defy legality when it was to their own benefit to do so . Openly the House of Lords has always stood for law and order so far as others were con- cerned . Generally speaking the big press of the nation has always accused labor of favoring and originating violence throughout the long and bloody history of the struggle of the working people for a better life . The exact opposite is true . After the daily newspaper has screamed its charge against the unions, the impartial historian has found, too late to be of any practical use, that in some ninety cases out of a hundred it is the employer or the police or the enemies of labor who are guilty of favoring and initiating violence . And when it comes to lawbreaking or defiance of the law, actions which are generally charged only to criminals, the publishers have a great advantage when they do so because there can be no \"public outcry\" against them, no protest, no \"box populi,\" no \"wave of indignation,\" nor any of the"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"4 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS other movements they frequently invent, knowing they themselves are the only channel for such movements . Here are, for example, two forces which affect the news- papers-and their profits . Despite publishers' opposition the Wagner Act was passed, the National Labor Relations Board came into being . Manufacturers did not like it but they obeyed it . Not so the publishers . \"If,\" said Elisha Hanson, chief counsel for the A . N . P . A ., \"the NLRB issues an order in this case, Mr . Hearst will not comply with it .\" In October 1936 this same Hanson sent out a general statement to the publishers telling them not to obey the rulings of the same board because, he, Hanson, thought they were unconstitutional . \"Publishers from now on,\" he or- dered, \"should flatly refuse to have anything to do with the National Labor Relations Board other than to notify it it is without power under the constitution to interfere with their business . . . In so far as the newspaper business is concerned, I am convinced no order of the Board directed to a publisher requiring him to comply with a decision thereof will, if it is contested, be upheld in the courts .\" The order under discussion (the Watson case) was upheld . The NLRB law was upheld . In other lines of business the government and its laws have also been challenged-but not defied . Government laws and regulations have been obeyed pending the institution of suits to test constitutionality, but in no important instance has there been defiance, as in the case of the publishers . Replying to Hanson's orders to the publishers the Guild Reporter called the lawyer an anarchist . Of his opinion it said (October 15, 1936) : \"All concern for the general welfare, all respect for the right of Congress to establish public pol- icies which it deems to be essential for the country, have been abandoned in this document which its board sponsors .

Out with it!

The publishers' proposed code was \"treacherous and dishonest\" but legal ; but the subsequent \"dark maneuverings,\" said the Guild editorially, proved that \"the A . N . P.

There were seventeen instances of intimidation, coercion and actual discharge of employees for utilizing the clauses in the Wagner Act which permit unionization ; in six in- stances the publishers were accused of breaking the law by refusing to bargain with their employees ; in two instances the publishers were accused of forming company unions, all these episodes forming a record which the official organ of the newspaper writers called \"irresponsible, unscrupulous and contemptible .\" Among the newspapers against which charges were filed were (Gannett's) Knickerbocker Press and Albany News, Boston Herald, Boston Traveler, (McCormick's) Chicago Tribune, Detroit Times, (Hearst's) Los Angeles Examiner, the Associated Press in New York, (Hearst's) New York Daily Mirror, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Seattle Star .

It made a great sensation . It is as interesting an apologia pro sua vita as our generation has produced, and it serves also to explain the numerous seeming paradoxes and exasperating dis- crepancies which America's first, and now most important tabloid newspaper, presents . How great a sensation this rich young man caused by be- coming a Socialist and renouncing the financial and journal- istic system into which he was born, can be judged from the numerous versions of his confessions, which were reprinted throughout a decade and distributed by the tens of thou- sands, and the comment in the press of the time . When Cor- liss, the son of Thomas W . Lamont, partner of J . P . Morgan, espoused the cause of Soviet Russia two decades later there was comparative silence . The world was becoming accus- tomed to sons of wealth defending the enemies of wealth . \"I am talking about myself, the type of the idle, rich young man, not myself the individual . . . .

It can be traced . Some of it comes from the profits of a daily newspaper ; some of it comes from Chicago real estate ; some from the profits made by the Pennsylvania and other rail- roads ; some from the profits of the United States Steel Corporation ; some from the profits of the American Tobacco Company .\" Mr . Patterson then judges the Chicago real estate earnings by applying to it the Henry George single tax formula : \"The people who came to Chicago to work caused the in- crease in value-but I get the benefit of it .\" But the profits from the Pennsylvania Railroad, U . S . Steel and American Tobacco Company he admits are paid him not by fellow capitalists, but by the men who work and ride, the makers and users of steel and tobacco . \"The men who run the trains are underpaid for the work they do, and those who ship or travel overpay for the service they get . We capitalists get the margin in between .\" And Mr . Patterson continues : \"For instance, it takes to support me just about twenty times as much as it takes to support an average workingman or farmer . And the funny thing about it is that these workingmen and farmers work hard all year round, while I don't work at all . \"I have better food, better clothes, and better houses than the workers who supply me with money to spend . I can travel oftener . . . . I have horses to ride and drive, domestic servants . . . the best physicians . . . . My children will never go to work in a cotton mill or a sweatshop . \"In short, I lead a far more highly civilized life than the working people . I have offered me the choice of all the best things that man in his stay upon this earth has discovered, evolved or created . The working people do not have this choice offered them . There are left for them the shoddy things of life- hard work and small reward . I have little or no work and the earth's best for reward ."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"22 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS \"The work of the working people, and nothing else, produces the wealth, which, by some hocus-pocus arrangement, is trans- ferred to me, leaving them bare .

If every bond and stock certificate and every real estate abstract were burned today in a huge bonfire, the vacated titles of ownership falling naturally to the community, trains would pull out on schedule time tomorrow . . . . \"That my life is so much completer than the lives of the workers who support me has been excused on the ground that they are less 'cultivated,' and, therefore, less fitted to enjoy things which please me . But that seems a little like begging the ques- tion . . . . I don't think it was entirely natural aptitude that marked me out for a university education, since I remember that frequently I had to pay money to tutors to drill into my head information of a remarkably simple character . I was fond of a good time-and that I had . Of course, it took money, which was obligingly supplied, via my family, by the pressmen, the switchmen, the cigarette girls, the rolling-mill men, etc .\" When he got out of college Patterson went to work for the Chicago Tribune-\"I started at the bottom\"-at $15 a week, just as his college mates went into their fathers' Wall Street offices . \"But,\" he adds, \"I knew it was play-acting all the time, just as they did . I was not living on a $ i 5-a-week basis and they were not living on a $3-a-week basis . I wasn't afraid of losing my job . . . .

The allowance came from the pressmen, switchmen, cigarette girls, the other reporters, etc ., via my family .

If he is overpaid, some must be underpaid . \"Socialism urges the underpaid to unite and insist on receiving the full amount of the wealth they produce .\" This conclusion was not strong enough . In the later re- print for the Pocket Library of Socialism, No . 45, Patterson adds the following paragraphs : \"So it is with all capitalists . Insofar as they receive interest, profit and rent, they are economic idlers, taking toll of the labor of others and returning nothing ; insofar as they actively further business, by superintendence or otherwise, they are laborers, worthy in many cases of their hire . \"The wealth appropriated by capital through the agencies of rent, profit and interest is obviously appropriated from the working people, the creators of all wealth . Therefore it is to the working people that Socialism addresses itself, urging them to veto their own further exploitation .\" At the time the foregoing confession was written Socialism was still quite a respectable religion, there was little hyster- ical red-baiting in the press, and one could not really tell the descendant of Joseph Medill to go back to the country he came from if he was dissatisfied with the capitalist system in Chicago . However, young Patterson was attacked in the press, and he retaliated by calling it \"the capitalist press\" and show- ing how stupid it was in answering his arguments . He wrote in what I believe was the fourth and last reprint of his \"Con- fessions of a Drone\" : Since the foregoing appeared in the \"Independent\" many criticisms of it have appeared in the capitalist press . The burden * Students will find the four versions among the bound pamphlets in the New York Public Library : SFC, p . V , 57 and 58 ; SFC, p . V, 7o and* CX, p .

The article was written about the whole capitalist class, as explicitly mentioned in the first paragraph . The reason the whole capitalist class doesn't give its money and go to work is because it doesn't want to . It is quite satisfied with its present arrangement of luxury, dominion and idleness . As long as the working class is satisfied with its present arrange- ment of poverty, obedience and laboriousness, the present ar- rangement will continue . But whenever the working class wants to discontinue the present arrangement it can do so . It has the great majority . J . M . P . Patterson's career as a Socialist reached a 'considerable height with the publication of his novel, \"A Little Brother of the Rich\" two years later . In this book the rich are snobs, cads, crooks, and generally wicked people, and the poor are heroic and noble . But there is also an understanding of social issues . At the very beginning one Paul Potter receives a letter from Sylvia Castle of the Middle West saying, \"It seems to me best for your own sake that you should be free .\" Paul immediately replies \"I love you, dearly beloved, with all my heart and soul and strength and mind ; and I will marry you because it is ordained .\" Well, it was ordained for just a few minutes because just as he gets ready to start for the mail box Paul reads of the failure of the Castle bank in Indiana . So he agrees to end the engagement . Paul's caddishness is surpassed by that of his pal Carl Wilmerding IV, whose father, III, purchases for cash a decision from him to give up the woman he loves, lives with, and with whom he has a child he worships . There is one fine"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"PATTERSON-LORD OF TAELOTDIA \t 25 scene in which Wilmerding III lays down the ethics of a capitalist gentleman's relationship with women . He says, \"If a gentleman chooses to indulge himself, he does it like a gentleman . He finds some pretty woman for his left hand, who amuses him for a while, and when he is through, he pays her off and all is done . . . . He doesn't allow children to be born to him and he doesn't keep the thing up for four years with every apparent intention of keeping it up indefinitely . That is not worthy of you, nor of any other gentleman . It shows low tastes of which I am ashamed .\" Paul Potter does the dirty work of dissolving the Wilmer- ding IV liaison and gets a market tip netting $54,000, which his silly high society wife immediately spends in order to join the \"old-rich\" real aristocracy . We are then introduced to high society-and to a critic of the era who says of its women : \"They can't sing, they can't dance, they can't act, they can't paint, they can't sew, they can't cook, they can't educate . They are inept, unthorough, inconsequential, rudderless, compassless, drifting . They don't know life, because they have never lived life . They are like perpetual typhoid fever patients, supported always on rubber- water mattresses . Helpless, hapless, hopeless, nervous, dis- appointed, cloyed and cowardly, they exist a few years here, seeking to have all their living done for them by paid de- pendents . They delegate all their functions in life save one- and even that they don't do well or often .\" We meet later the \"Great Castleman,\" the famous Amer- ican actress who has triumphed in the plays of Ibsen and other giants of the new century, Gorky, Shaw, Sudermann and Hauptmann, and we meet in her the emerging modern young American woman . But to Paul Potter she is more importantly his old sweetheart, Sylvia Castle . They confess their love, their everlasting love . Soon enough, while the great Castleman is triumphing in London, Mrs .

Whereupon the heroine replies : \"You say you fear I might interfere with your social position .

I know it's all rotten and false, but it's too late . . . .\" Although the book ended on this tragic note, it was a sensational success . My copy is from the seventh edition ; it probably went into many more, it became one of the best sellers of the time, and it caused a great commotion . But not in literary dovecotes and lions' dens . The general public loved Patterson's novel but the high- brows of the time, the Socialist highbrows too, the very literary circle of which the author in his novel approved of, the novelists and playwrights of the new school, gave this little brother of the rich a rather haughty proletarian shoulder, and left him only the applause of those he did not care any- thing about . Thus began the souring-off process in the Socialistic career of young Patterson . I would not be surprised if this snobbery of the literary left lost the radical cause one of the most powerful publishers in America . There was of course the new responsibility of editing the Tribune . James Keeley was doing a great job . Everyone said that the Tribune would founder if Keeley ever carried out his threat to quit . Keeley was the pet of Joseph Medill's heirs, Mrs . Patterson and Mrs . McCormick, two old women who refused to let their sons enjoy any power . But Joe Patterson and R . R . McCormick found a clever way of seizing control . In my Tribune days the credit was always given the attorney, McCormick, for planning the coup, but Burton Rascoe gives it to Patterson . At any rate the two discovered that under the Medill will the Medill trust governed the paper, and that their two mothers who owned almost all the stock could only vote two proxies whereas printers and old friends of the founders also owned small blocks of stock each having a proxy . Patterson and McCormick discovered these owners in the Middle West"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"28 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS and in Boston . They presented their case . They got the proxies . And one year when Keeley was making a conven- tional farce of the board meeting, Patterson elected himself president and McCormick chairman . Without a moment to lose Patterson and McCormick moved into Keeley's office and took over editorship and management . They made of the Tribune a greater success than Keeley promised . The World War, acquaintance with the people-haters, Bernhardi and Nietzsche, and the demands of editing and publishing soon completed the change in Patterson's view- points on social problems . McCormick never had any . IF Patterson's New York Daily News is the first tabloid news- paper in America, and claims the largest circulation of any in the world . It employs 2,500 persons, has an annual pay- roll of six million dollars and is housed in a ten-million- dollar building which is one of the great achievements of modern architecture . The paper is also one of the largest profit-makers in the world . Tabloids were first successful in England . They are small and full of pictures ; in America they are usually sensational, although this can no longer be said of the Daily News . (The New York Evening Post for a short time experimented with the tabloid form, but remained conservative in type and tenor, and found that there was no consumer demand .) The elements, sex (love), money, and crime, are usually pre- dominant in mass circulation newspapers . The story goes that Patterson and Lord Northcliffe dis- cussed the press and the public, the latter contending that human nature being pretty much the same the world over, the Americans should take to the tabloid press ; but when Patterson countered with the suggestion that human nature being pretty much the same the world over, the British people should take to the American style of news on the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"PATTERSON-LORD OF TABLOIDIA \t 29 front page, and headlines proportionate to the event, North- cliffe did not accept this thesis . But Lord Beaverbrook did, and his Express beat Northcliffe's paper in London circula- tion . Patterson's News, launched on June 26, 1 g 1 g, averaged but 57,000 for its first full year . In 1920, it became estab- lished with 247,000 copies, and today it has 1,700,000 or more daily, and 3,ooo,ooo Sundays . It has printed a week-day edition of 112 pages and a Sunday edition of 156 . Ignorance, befuddlement and unfairness are apparent in the editorials on the war in Spain . For instance, on January 11, 1938, the thought was expressed that \"to those who sympathize with the poor, wretched people of Spain, who will lose and pay for the civil war no matter whether the Reds or the Fascists win, the news of the Fascist garrison's peaceable surrender at Teruel must be welcome news .\" Here the word \"Reds\" is used for the Loyalists, a libelous and misleading appellation which both the United Press and the Associated Press have warned against and which only Hearst and the Catholic hierarchy have repeated . There is no reason except ill will and a desire to spread propaganda (which is the exact opposite of the truth) which can motivate anyone who refers to the popular front in Spain as Com- munist or Red . In the Daily News editorial, moreover, there is the added confusion of lumping Fascists with the demo- cratic Spanish people, \"who will lose and pay for the civil war\" together . A Fascist victory must mean the exploita- tion of the Spanish people to pay for the war, because it would mean the restoration of the land and mine owners, the feudal, land-owning, stock-owning church and the ex- ploiters of the agrarian population into power, whereas the victory for the labor unions and other elements chiefly con- stituting the popular front will mean that the war-makers, the Fascists, the rich, the land owners, mine owners and ex- ploiters will have to pay for the war-not the victorious peo- ple . Since the news stories have already reported the means"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"30 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS by which the popular front is already enforcing such a social- revolutionary economic program, there is no excuse for this confusion . Still more unfair is the January 17, 1938, reference to Spain . After denying the view of ex-Ambassador Dodd that America should do something about preserving democracy which the dictators are destroying, the Daily News editorial says : \"Suppose England and the United States should go in to- gether to save Spain . There would be a harsh dispute to begin with among ourselves on whether to save Spain from the Fascists or from the Reds . When Spain was saved, would the Spaniards take democracy, or wouldn't they?\" Again the Hearst, and purely Hearst, falsehood of the conflict in Spain being between Fascism and Communism is accepted, whereas no honest man has ever disputed the fact that the Spanish republic is not Communist or Red, but a coalition which is overwhelmingly democratic . There were about 50,000 who voted the Communist ticket in the 1936 election, and the party in 1938 boasted 250,000-a quarter of a million men and women out of the 12,000,000 population then on the Loyalist side of the front . Patterson's Daily News has been no more liberal or fair toward China than toward Spain . On November 25, 1 937 , for example, it declared editorially : \"LOOKS AS IF CHINA'S LICKED\" While \"we feel gloomy over the impending Chinese de- feat,\" the editorial concluded, \"it takes good soldiers to win a war . The Chinese haven't enough good soldiers . . . . And the Chinese seem fated by nature to be a subject people . They always have been kicked around by their rulers, for- eign or Chinese . The world is composed of natural-born masters and natural-born servants .\" (This is the Nietzsche Sklavenmoral touch .)"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"PATTERSON-LORD OF TABLOIDIA \t 31 After announcing this social-political philosophy which is at variance with the findings of the greatest thinkers of all time, the Daily News turns to the field it knows best : real- istic commerce . \"If Japan wins,\" it says, \"it will probably build up a powerful mainland empire in China . With that empire we should do business . All the business we can, re- gardless of our disapproval of the way the land was ac- quired . . . .\" About a month later the American gunboat Panay was sunk . The Daily News said editorially \"The Chinese are licked,\" but it also said two other things : it said in plain English that the Panay was convoying three Standard Oil Company vessels supplying oil to either Chinese planes or Chinese civilians and it admitted that \"we have long backed up our business people and missionaries in China with armed force,\" recommending that we \"scuttle out of China .\" Isolationism at any price is the editorial policy of the Daily News . But when it comes to Mexico, there is no longer a question of sincerity, good will, or obscurantism . It is the editorial proof that the fine Socialistic fervor that once coursed in Joe Patterson's humanitarian blood is very, very quiescent . Here again, as in the Times, the Herald Tribune, the Sun, the Hearst press, and Harry Chandler's Los Angeles Times, the old battle of human rights versus property is decided in favor of property with all the high-sounding sophistries, euphemisms and propagandist inaccuracies which money can command . The president of Mexico is continually attacked . \"Car- denas Asks For It\" is the editorial heading on March 3, 1938, which begins with the story that Italian Bolsheviks seized the factories in 1920 and \"Mussolini's March on Rome put an end to that, for better or worse .\" I am pretty sick and tired of exploding this myth . I think that every intelligent man and woman in America knows that Mussolini did nothing of the kind and that he wrote"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"32 LORDS OF THE PRESS in June 1921 that \"Bolshevism is dead\" in Italy . But because it suits an editorial purpose, a well-known untruth is paraded to point a moral . The crux of the editorial follows : \"Mexican oil development has not been brought about by American or British or Dutch imperialists walking in with big guns and black-snake whips to yank guitar-playing natives out of a state of primitive purity and chain them to derricks and tank cars . The foreigners bought their way into Mexico's oil fields with the consent of previous Mexican governments . They have paid Mexico royalties on produc- tion .\" Every reliable authority on Mexico has given the proof of the gigantic fraud by which the oil lands were stolen from the Mexican people and the bloodshed and murder by which they have been held and exploited by American, British and Dutch interests . Every person who knows anything about Mexico knows about this business, but somehow it never enters the editorial offices of the jingo newspapers . When Hearst and Harry Chandler demand invasion of Mexico the reason is apparent : both are large land, mine and property owners there and fear socialization . But why should Joe Patterson publish such anti-Mexican propaganda? The larg- est American company operating in Mexico is the Huesteca Petroleum Company (one of the Doheny group) . In the suit of Huesteca versus the, Compania Mexicana de Com- bustibile it was testified that American corporations hired gunmen to murder the four Mexican owners of a well they wanted ; that the last of the owners was shot, but not killed, and that the corporation sent a physician who poisoned the wounded man . \"Probably ninety percent of the titles of the Huesteca company are usurpations,\" one of the documents in the case reads . Probably ninety percent of all the oil titles held by foreigners in Mexico are usurpations, and illegal . But, continues the Daily News on March 31st, \"the United States cannot afford to let Mr . Cardenas get by with his steal of Mexican oil . We use the word `steal' advisedly . About $500,000,000 has been invested in Mexican oil de-"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"PATTERSON-LORD OF TABLOIDIA \t 33 velopment ; and of this amount Mexicans put up only one percent . . . .\" Within a day or two after this declaration the American Secretary of State declared the Cardenas plan legal . It is not a steal . It is actually the carrying out of the 1917 constitution which restores the stolen mineral wealth to the nation and to the people-all the people-instead of the corporations . The spectacle of that great imperialist nation, Tory Britain, . protesting Cardenas' plan for repayment while refusing to pay her own debts, failed to impress Patterson's paper . Apparently private property, and not human life, is the utmost value in this materialistic world . I do not know how sincere Cardenas is ; I have been in Mexico and praised Calles' plan which turned out to be nothing but another looting expedition, and I have seen other noted Mexican leaders betray their people for money, but on the face of it at this moment it is apparent that Cardenas is trying to do justice to the Mexican people . He is trying to do something that the author of \"Confessions of a Drone\" was hoping would be done in 1906 . But in the editorial column pub- lished on May 23, 1938, by the author of the \"Confessions\" the red flag is pinned on President Cardenas . He is accused of acting on Trotsky's advice \"to put over a Red readjust- ment .\" And, Patterson's paper concludes, \"We don't see how our government can afford to side with or encourage Cardenas, as our liberals and radicals are insisting it shall . Cardenas grabbed other people's oil wells . . . .\" And this is very bad for the British and our own navy . . . . The Drone has now become metamorphosed . The little brother of the rich has become one of the lords of British 'and American imperialism .

M . cars and who were fired that day, should be retained . On February 6, 1938, maldistribution of wealth is dealt with . I will not quote either editorial . It is true that the Daily News is aimed at the less than fourteen-year-old mind but that is no reason for editorials being written by economic illiterates . On the other hand the editorial writers of this same news- paper once they are free to step out of the labyrinth of economics and international politics, where they are lost through ignorance or ill will, are fearless in their attack on public injustices and even the hypocrisy of fellow publishers . The News, for example, is one of the three or four papers of the country which has declared the publishers' use of the term \"freedom of the press\" a pious fraud ; it is one of the few newspapers which has denounced the A . N . P . A . for its dirty work in continuing child labor, and it is probably the only newspaper which has exposed and demanded the aboli- tion of the press subsidy by the United States government . Probably the bravest thing the News has done has been its editorial defiance of the pressure of the Catholic Church . This pressure is one of the most important forces in Amer- ican life, and the only one about which secrecy is generally maintained, no newspaper being brave enough to discuss it, although all fear it and believe that the problem should be dragged into the open and made publicly known . In January, 1938, the News realizing that the annual child labor amendment would again be defeated, blamed the Catholic bishops of the state, and especially Bishop Edmund F . Gibbons, of Albany ; it derided the propaganda which called the freeing of children \"regimentation\" or \"youth control\" and called the bishops \"misled .\" \"Nearly all radicals and many liberals,\" it continued, \"maintain that the Cath- olic hierarchy in this country tends to be more and more conservative ; in some cases reactionary . Insofar as this is true, the explanation would seem to lie in the fact that many of"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"PATTERSON-LORD OF TABLOIDIA 35 these ecclesiastics are elderly gentlemen who administer the properties of their dioceses, both in real estate and in se- curities-a function which would tend to give some of them the cast of mind of the conservative business man .\" To criticize the Catholic Church is to invite a boycott, the withdrawal of advertising, loss in circulation and in rev- enue . It is the same when a newspaper prints news favorable to the labor movement . Nevertheless it was the News which in the spring of 1937 dedicated the page opposite its edito- rials to a fair discussion of both sides of the labor problem . The \"Economic Battle Page\" was the logical successor to the \"Presidential Battle Page\" which had in 1936 given Demo- crats and Republicans equal space to make and answer arguments . This is one of the most honest things that has happened in American newspaper history, and in a concluding chapter a challenge to the American press is based upon its willing- ness to open its columns to both sides of political and eco- nomic questions . Throughout the Roosevelt administration the News has been one of the few papers exposing the hypocrisy of many of the campaigns against the President and his policies . Roosevelt was for taxation but publishers, being human be- ings, were opposed to paying . Most notable koosevelt-haters are Colonel McCormick of the Chicago Tribune and the unspeakable Hearst . These men and the majority of pub- lishers moved heaven and earth and ninety percent of the presses to attack the administration's taxation policy, using every argument which endangered pocketbooks and bought brains could produce, but Patterson said bluntly that almost the entire opposition to the President's taxation program arose from the selfish motives of the publishers : they are wealthy men, they feel that their money is menaced by pro- posed taxation, and they have therefore worked themselves up into the hysterical state of mind which confuses public welfare and their personal financial welfare ."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"36 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS When the 1938 Reorganization Bill was defeated the New York Times followed its usual custom of asking the leading papers of the country to give their editorial views . The general public of course never knows which views are accepted, which thrown into the waste-basket . But the News has not hesitated to break another journalistic taboo, which is to keep quiet about the ethics of fellow newspapers . It attacked the Times, saying : We're annoyed with the New York Times-which always asks us for advance proofs of our editorials on New Deal develop- ments, then consistently fails to print the editorial or any part thereof . The Times, however, prints the Herald Tribune edi- torial or part of it on the same subject . Don't misunderstand us ; we admire the Times greatly, and think it is one of the master newspapers of the world . But in this small and annoying particular, it is misrepresenting on occasion the reaction of the New York morning press to phases of the New Deal . Maybe the Times feels that the News is not a newspaper . That doesn't bother us . We've been contempted by experts . But after all, the News currently has three times the circulation of the Times and five times that of the Herald Tribune . If the Times pretends to collect cross sections of press opinion on important national affairs and print them for its readers' full information, it ought to include the News opinion-or it ought not to tele- phone over to our newspaper shop for advance proofs . Equally frank is Patterson regarding the publication of dirt which was once almost a monopoly of the Hearst press and which has lately been charged to the tabloid press . At the end of the notorious Browning case, which reached the nadir of filth when the Macfadden Graphic published \"com- posographs\" picturing the elderly Browning and the youth- ful \"Peaches,\" the Daily News said editorially : Far be it from us to pin a lily on our coat .

We hate bureaucracy . We hate the suppression of free speech . But unless the minds of the children of New York are to be drenched in obscenity it seems to us that censorship of the press as well as of the theater must come . . . . There are many sorts of fake news items in the world press : the accidental fakes which all the vigilance in the world cannot prevent, the willful fakes which are con- nected with editorial policy, and semi-fakes which can be argued for a lifetime . The matter of news-faking is never discussed in newspapers . But Patterson in this field is also an iconoclast . Said the News (April 28, 1936) : We're afraid it was a fake . . . . we printed a story from a New England correspondent saying that $20,000 in Lindbergh ransom bills had recently turned up in Albany and in various Massachusetts towns . We are convinced now that the story was a fake . . . . We are sorry to have published the story . We mention it in this public manner because we want to make it clear that this newspaper does not knowingly or intentionally fake news . We think any newspaper that does fake news is foolish . It is so easy to expose a fake news story, and as soon as the public finds out about it the paper that published the fake loses some reader confidence . Repeat the process often enough, and the paper loses the confidence of all the readers except the natural-born and incurable suckers . We want our readers to know that the news published in this paper is always true to the best of our knowledge . Nevertheless, on the following September 4th the News devoted almost its entire front page to the following sensa- tion : PLOT TO KILL F . D . R . NIPPED L . I .

R .\" and the story said that \"an alien radical's, plot . . . was nipped . . . .\" In the New York Times, that same morning, there was a mere quarter column story on an inside page . There was no mention of a plot to assassinate the President . But, on the other hand, there was the statement that \"among articles found in the shack, it was reported, were Communist litera- ture and several copies of the Moscow News .\" By evening there was no plot to kill the President, no \"Red,\" no Communists, no Moscow News-nothing but an old man suffering \"apparently from a persecution mania\" as the Post truthfully reported . But neither the News nor the Times apologized . This is one of thousands of episodes which illustrates the case against the American press today . It is no longer a matter of mere sensationalism, of yellow journalism, which so perturbed our fathers ; it is now more a matter of distor- tion, coloration, a recklessness, if not a sinister intention, to blame aliens, Reds, Communists-and in other instances, labor, liberals and progressives-for violence, plottings and all the ills of a disturbed epoch . V In the cases of the Hearsts, the McCormicks and the rest of the reactionary majority of the A . N . P .

Patterson still likes to pull down his slouch hat, pull up his coat collar, play the workingman, go into the streets, mingle with common people, and find out what they do and what they want . He does not go slumming, like his sister Eleanor ; he goes because of that old Socialistic urge . \"He has always had a social conscience ; he is by nature, by action and by conviction democratic and equalitarian"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"PATTERSON-LORD OF TABLOIDIA \t 39 . . . \" writes Burton Rascoe,* who has known \"J .

His most charming quality is that of trying to live up to his principles . And half the time he does not know what his real feelings are, so numerous are they, so complex and so checked and leashed by obligations to his conscience, to his employees, to the handful of heirs of the Chicago Tribune properties, to his belief in his mis- sion in the world and to his innate, half-repressed, half-sat- isfied quest for a full, free life of admirable action and true noblesse oblige .\" Patterson passed through the Northcliffe phase when he too thought he could be either a great power in politics or, fail- ing that, the secret manipulator of the mannikins who play in the front pages of the nation's press . Patterson's slavery to the Northcliffe complex has not been long or important . He has seen service for a year in the Illinois House of Representa- tives but he later quit his job as commissioner of public works in Chicago when he learned that he could not beat gang politicians . The Northcliffe phase of direct action was knocked out by dirty politics, and the second Northcliffe phase, that of being the secret manipulator, has not super- seded his old democratic Marxian experiences . In 1983 he went in as an ordinary reporter to interview the head of a New York bank on which there was a run . The great banker said the bank was sound . Patterson agreed . But suddenly he was back in his old soap-box days of Chicago Socialism . He turned on the banker and gave him a tongue- lashing on the evils of the capitalist system . *In his autobiography, \"Before I Forget,\" Doubleday-Doran, 1937 ."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"40 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS J .

The News is one of the richest newspapers in America and its publisher could well afford to defy all the pressures which prevent our country from having a free press . He does defy more of them than ninety-nine percent of his colleagues . But that is not enough . And it is a great pity . The matter of money is the chief obstacle to a free press, and no one has been more outspoken than Joseph Medill Patterson in exposing just that fact about his fellow publishers . And it is not a matter of money that keeps Patterson from producing not only a great news- paper but a free newspaper . A great free newspaper demands if not a great mind at least a social sense back of it, and Patter- son has only good intentions ; otherwise he is confused . He is just as courageous now as he was thirty years ago when he defied the social-financial milieu into which he was born, when he became a Socialist. He has not grown reactionary as the majority of publishers, editors and famous columnists do when they gain fame, money and social standing . But somewhere between 19o8 and 1916 there was a moral detour, and ever since then the Patterson psyche has been traveling nowhere amidst great confusion and spectacular headlines . Somewhere between his ivory tower and his soap box there is still a chance that Joe Patterson will find himself ."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"CHAPTER g Power of the Middle West COLONEL ROBERT RUTHERFORD MCCORMICK is the only American press lord whom I know fairly well . I was em- ployed by the Army edition of the Chicago Tribune for a short time in 1917, and by the Chicago Tribune Foreign News Service from 1 g 1 g to 1928 . I had never been to Chicago . Colonel McCormick required a weekly letter from each of his foreign service men and two or three times a year held a conference in a European capital, when he impressed us all by his willingness to listen to the views of his correspondents . He was modest, friendly, easy to get along with, and appar- ently one of the few press lords who had escaped the Na- poleon-Northcliffe power obsession . To us of the foreign service the daily proclamation that the Tribune was \"The World's Greatest Newspaper\" was a daily joke . In the old days we had in addition to the Man- chester Guardian and the London Times, the Frankfurter Zeitung and the Corriere della Sera, the latter two alas now perverted by totalitarian systems . We also had a faint sus- picion that the New York World, the St . Louis Post-Dispatch, the Baltimore Sun, the Kansas City Star and the New York Times might dispute the claim . When we asked our Chicago colleagues for the basis on which it was made they usually mentioned the campaigns against \"Boss\" Thompson and the fact the Tribune could not be bought by advertising or other interests . Today most newspapermen, including numerous Tribune employees agree that if a vote were taken for the title \"The 41"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"42 LORDS OF THE PRESS World's Worst Newspaper,\" with the Fascist press hors concours, the ultimate choice probably would lie between one of the Hearst journals and the Chicago Tribune . In fact in the mass demonstrations against the Hearst and McCor- mick sheets on election day 1936 it was becoming evident that the more hated of the two was the Tribune . My relations with Colonel McCormick and the Tribune were always good . On only one occasion was I aware that orders on how and what to write were given in much the same manner as the Goebbels, Ciano and Hearst propaganda bureaus issue daily orders . I received from Chicago a request for a cable on the failure of government owned and operated railroads . Duplicates had been sent to all correspondents and so far as I know the responses confirmed the implication . I knew nothing about the German railroads . I was not aware that Colonel McCormick was opposed to the continua- tion of government operation of the American railroads after the war and was bolstering his view with foreign illus- trations . The information I obtained proved fairly well that the German government railroads were a success and I so cabled . The next day I received a long message, this time from the Paris office, instructing me exactly in what I was to say, to wit : that the German railroad system was a failure, that the public was angry, that passengers paid too much, that freight rates were too high, that governmental bureaucracy was simply terrible, and that the whole idea of governmental rivalry with private money-making was simply not to the good . I could have taken these instructions, signed them and sent them back as a news story . It was just exactly what was wanted . But as this was the one and only case in which I realized that I was being intimidated and driven into that easy classification known as a \"journalistic prostitute,\" I made a thorough inquiry into the railroad business, and finding that my first cable was more than justified, I wrote a tremendously long story giving facts and figures trium-"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"POWER OF THE MIDDLE WEST \t 43 phantly proving that government ownership and operation was a thousand times preferable to private enterprise, and that it would be magnificent for all countries, including the United States, to take a lesson from Republican Germany . Need I tell my readers that my cablegram was never pub . lished? Moreover, in 1923, when I was finishing my visit to Russia, a colleague from the Paris office, temporarily presiding in Berlin, found to his venal delight that the German state rail- roads were bankrupt-to the tune of millions of quintillions -and promptly sent a story to that effect . It made the front page . What the story did not explain was the fact of inflation -the daily catastrophic change in the value of the mark, which fell from four to four quintillion to the dollar-and which only for a few months caused a fictitious or book- keeping show of failure . This same colleague had several years earlier visited Russia for the purpose of writing a series of articles de- nouncing the Soviet system . But every day of his stay con- vinced him of the value of the system he was sent to attack . On arriving in Riga he began the first of a series of cautious cablegrams expressing his change of attitude, but despite care and diplomacy, he was caught writing contrary to the Tribune's anti-Russian policy and ordered to Paris . There he was placed against the wall . He was told to change his tune, or else . . . . He tried to compromise with his journal- istic ethics by offering to refrain from writing anything at all about Russia, but the Tribune bosses were not that easy . They not only insisted that he write, but that he write against Russia, and the poor devil, gray-haired, tired, his future unprotected and a family clamoring for bread, was forced to betray his friends, himself, and all the ethics of the profession for the price of his butter .

But much more vicious than these cases is the majority of foreign correspondents who never have to be placed against the wall, who are never told what to write and how to write it, but who know from contact with the great minds of the press lords or from the simple deduction that the bosses are in big business and the news must be slanted accordingly, or from the general intangible atmosphere which prevails every- where, what they can do and what they must never do . The most stupid boast in the history of present-day journalism is that of the writer who says \"I have never been given orders ; I am free to do as I like .\" The German railroad order was the only one I received .in my ten years with the Tribune . I was nominally head of the Berlin bureau although I spent about two years in Italy, two years in Russia, a year with the French armies in Syria, and another year in the Balkans . On arriving in Germany with the American Army of Occupation on December 1 3 , 1918, I found that my sympathies were strongly for the victims of both the German monarchy and the Versailles Treaty, and this sympathy I brought to Berlin when I took over the office in ig2o . The Tribune had been pro-German before we got into the war, and did not carry over the hatred which it helped create after we entered it . There was there- fore nothing I could write about Germany which would offend the editors .

I was born and brought up in the liber- tarian tradition and my whole quarrel with Soviet Russia- which certainly had more important quarrels on its hands at the time-concerned freedom for oppositional minorities, which had helped smash Tsarism, but which refused to accept the October Revolution . My contentions were based on my as- sumption that Russia was no longer threatened from without . I was told that the war was not over, that \"the bourgeois capitalist nations\" were plotting to smash the Soviet state, that Russia was surrounded by conspirators, that all the apparent anti-democratic and anti-libertarian measures still in force were necessitated by this unseen state of war which Russians felt then existed . How true that is can be seen today in the Berlin-Rome axis, and the open conspiracy of the Fascist nations and Tory Britain to destroy Soviet Russia . But to me all looked peace- ful, so I pooh-hooed the idea and departed from Moscow to write a series of articles saying that democracy was dead in Russia, that the Red terror continued to take a bloody toll, and that the Third Internationale was a Red plot to seize the world . No one on the Tribune ordered me to write these stories in this way, nor was the intangible power present directing me to write in accordance with the Red-baiting policy of the owner of the paper .

Shortly afterward the White Russian appeared with docu- ments about a Red plot in Buenos Aires for which he wanted $5,000 . He compromised I believe for fifty . At any rate the story was accepted and published . Several years later when H . R . Knickerbocker exposed the White Russian forgery factory in Berlin it was revealed that the story was a complete fraud . This is but one of thousands of instances . A paper pub- lishes what it wants to publish . If the story had been about a White plot against the Reds, and if the documents had been true (not forged) the Chicago Tribune would not have been interested, although the locale might have been as intriguing as Evanston, Illinois . Outside of the German and Russian questions there were none in Europe which might cause difficulties between corre- spondent and publisher .

There are many more illustrative episodes . The reader may gain the impression from them that the Chicago Tribune is not as bad as it has been painted, and perhaps after all it should not be given worst place among American news- papers . The fact is that I have written considerably about my personal experiences to show that there is no personal feeling in the matter of criticizing this powerful newspaper and its publisher .

Today its enmity to the vast majority which constitutes the laboring class is cloaked in many kinds of hypocrisy, but there was once a time when the Tribune was more honestly the organ of the rich, the employers, and the exploiters and when it de- manded the shooting down of workingmen who wanted a better world for themselves, and recommended starvation for those whom the greed of the industrial system kept from exercising their \"right to work .\" Joseph Medill, it is true, was against slavery, and for"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"48 LORDS OF THE PRESS Lincoln . He supported the President in his bitter fight against the Supreme Court, not sparing the English language in his attack on the nine old men of his time, but when panic, the inevitable result of war, followed in 1873, and the country was overrun with the unemployed, whom the news- papers called \"tramps,\" the Chicago Tribune * had a unique plan of dealing with them, \"where one is not a member of the Humane Society .\" It was this : \"To put a little strychnine or arsenic in the meat and other supplies furnished the tramps . This produces death within a comparatively short period of time, is a warning to other tramps to keep out of the neighborhood, puts the coroner in good humor, and saves one's chickens and other portable property from con- stant depredation .\" In the great railroad strike of 1877 the Tribune edito- rially approved the police plan not to fire a warning round over the heads of the workingmen but to aim low . \"Chicago is too far advanced to permit her bad elements to interfere with her interests,\" the Tribune wrote, and urged the for- mation of vigilantes to supplement the police and militia . Ten days after the Tribune editorial favoring the murder by poison of unemployed, a mass meeting was held where Albert Parsons denounced the capitalist press for its attack on the working people, and particularly the Tribune which he declared always evaded the labor question by branding a mass meeting of workers as a gathering of Communists . At that time men worked twelve to fourteen hours a day and, said Parsons, the bosses took five-sixths of the profits . The use of new machinery was to blame . Wages were being re- duced and men laid off everywhere .

On July 25th the Tribune reported that \"Capitalists would offer any sum to see the leaders . . . strung up to a telegraph pole .\" On the very afternoon in which this hope for hanging was expressed the police attacked a gathering of 3,000 workers at Halsted and Sixteenth Streets, killing two and wounding many . Over the story of this massacre the Chicago Tribune put the headlines : RED WAR Desperate Contest Between Rioters and Police on Halsted Street An Assembly of the Communists Swiftly Smashed by the Police In this news story the Tribune referred to the peaceful workmen as thieves and riffraff, cutthroats and bandits, who showed \"all the elements of extreme viciousness incident to riots .\" Throughout this epoch of unrest, the climax of which was the Haymarket bombing, the newspapers of Chicago, and principally the Tribune, were the chief instigators of class hatred, intolerance and warfare . Labor then did not exert any pressure on newspapers, and advertisers did not appeal to the poorer people . The press in those days made no pre- tenses . It was for the rich and against the poor . Time after time the Chicago Tribune urged the author- ities to break up workers' meetings with violence, with gun- fire, and if necessary with dynamite . Police Captain John Bondfield frequently sent his men to beat up workingmen and arrest speakers because Mayor Harrison refused to call for Federal troops to do so .

Whoever set off the bomb spilled more labor blood than police blood . But the newspapers eagerly started the Red-baiting hysteria ; they yelled for bloody revenge, they faked news abut dis- coveries of plots and dynamite everywhere, they tried the case against the Chicago anarchists, not one of whom was guilty of the bomb throwing, found all guilty, sentenced all to death . The atmosphere was hysterical ; it was made so by the press, and the leader in rabble rousing was Joseph Medill, who despite the historical fact that the Illinois industrial worker of his time had at his disposal an annual sum of $81 compared to the state's appropriations for indi- vidual paupers of $95, sententiously announced that the poor had only to blame \"their own improvidence and misdirected efforts .\" Half a century passed before the Haymarket affair could be judged impartially, the executed labor leaders raised to martyrs in the cause of justice and progress, and the news- papers of the time given their full share of the blame for the massacre . It took considerably less time, thanks to a news reel, to come to an honest judgment on the Memorial Day Massacre of 1937 outside the Chicago plant of the Republic Steel Company, and here again it was the notorious labor- hating Chicago Tribune whose conduct was more repre- hensible than all the other newspapers of the country .

But the Chicago massacre was filmed by the Paramount company and a description of the private showing of the film before the La Follette Civil Liberties Committee, reported in the St .

The La Follette committee proved that police officials lied both at the time of the massacre and at the Washington hearings, but the Tribune remained faithful to the police .

A happy combination of Roosevelt-baiting and Red-bait- ing was attempted by the Tribune in August, 1986, when it reported sensationally (but under a Riga dateline) \"that Moscow has ordered `Reds' in the United States to back Roosevelt against Landon .\" To this story the Chicago Daily Times, only supporter of the President, replied with a front-page editorial saying : \"If the Tribune, or any other newspaper, can prove to the"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"56 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS satisfaction of the American Society of Newspaper Editors and the American Newspaper Publishers Association that the Tribune's dispatch from Donald Day, dated Riga, Latvia, August 8th, with its heading, is true, the Times will donate $5,000 to the work of the Freedom of the Press Committee of the American Newspaper Publishers Association\" of which Colonel McCormick is the head, body and feet . Moscow called the story a fake . Colonel McCormick refused to make a statement . He never took up the challenge. But, acting under the freedom of the press for publishers, he ordered one of his cartoonists -who today are almost unique in upholding the tradition of prostitution of talents in newspaper offices-to draw a pic- ture of Soviet Russia shouting orders to American Reds to \"Stop Landon .\" And Landon's partner, Colonel Knox of the Chicago Daily News, published an editorial a week after the $5,000 challenge for veracity had been made, in which it was said that \"in plain English, the Communist Interna- tional at Moscow has authorized American Communists to vote for Roosevelt, in order to play up to other American radical groups and to defeat Landon and Knox .\" Needless to say Hearst played up the same hoax . Colonel McCormick's sympathy with the reactionaries and the Red-baiters is also shown in his association with the Sentinels of the Republic, with Harry A . Jung, and his en- dorsement of Mrs . Dilling . When Senator Black's committee investigating lobbying took up the Sentinels of the Republic it exposed, as the chief backer, a family named Pitcairn, and a series of letters .

It is also the land in which the publisher of a newspaper that violates all the canons of journalism is the Lord Pro- tector of the Freedom of the Press . Sincerity, Truthfulness, Accuracy, Impartiality, Fair Play-these canons never thun- der on the Tribune .

Beck, a letter which Editor & Publisher, applauding, quoted under the heading :"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"POWER OF THE MIDDLE WEST COL .

It demanded \"com- plete unbiased reports with an effort toward equal coverage subject to news value .\" But the letter also states that Roose- velt in his first term \"tried to control the (Washington) correspondents\" and it concludes with the remark that \"there will be so much Roosevelt news created by his com- missars that it will be necessary to see that Landon gets a fair share of that total . But the Roosevelt stories must be adequate and must be written without any animus against him .\" What followed is pretty well known to everyone . Every day the Tribune editorial page was a biased attack on Roose- velt with the heading \"Turn the Rascals Out\" ; every day the Tribune telephone operators said \"Good morning . Chicago Tribune . There're only forty-three (or less) days left in which to save the American way of life .\" Every day truthful- ness, accuracy, impartiality, fair play and decency were flouted in the most vicious campaign against the President . On October 24, 1936 Editor & Publisher (which by the way draws a considerable amount of its revenue from Chicago Tribune advertising) courageously enough reported that the Chicago Daily Times had published the story of how the Tribune had faked a photograph and a news item in its attempt to hurt Roosevelt . The President had visited Chicago . He had ridden through the streets, and he had spoken . But the Tribune, whose pub- lisher is the spokesman for the freedom of the press, found that the public was not as enthusiastic as some imagined . It published a picture of a street filled with Roosevelt buttons apparently discarded by hundreds of persons to show their antagonism to the President .

Toward the end of the campaign President Roosevelt's name did not figure in the news for days on end . Everyone knows that the campaign was one of the filthiest in American history, but few outside Chicago know how much responsi- bility for making it so lies with the Tribune . On the day following the 1936 elections even Mr . Hearst tried to make amends and cover up his stupidity, but the Tribune was unrepentant . It began the campaign which it now continues against every liberal and progressive measure which the administration has proposed . Wrote William T .

The Chicago Tribune is the most vicious and unscrupulous newspaper in the United States today .\" Under the Medill Trust Colonel McCormick and Joseph Medill Patterson have become equal millionaires, and have increased their millions through their successful conduct of the Tribune and the New York Daily News . Three or four million dollars net profit a year has been a recent average ; in 1933, when most newspapers were pretty deep in the red, Chicago reported $2,goo,ooo and New York (with the feature syndicate's profits included) $3,800,000 net ; in boom years the profit has been $10,000,000 . McCormick and Patterson are so rich they could afford to provide America with two great newspapers equal and per- haps surpassing the Manchester Guardian . Patterson in fact does have a sort of social conscience, he is evidently a man of good will, and without having a Messianic complex he has a desire to help his fellow men . On the other hand in a period of ten years I have never heard McCormick express any concern for any one, and no actions of his newspaper have betrayed either a social conscience or even a social understanding .

It claimed it was doing a public service . But the few who knew the facts believe that the entire cru- sade was caused by the Tribune's disinclination to pay what the board thought a fair price for the land on which the Tribune downtown building stood . The Tribune crusade against Senator Black becoming a Supreme Court justice was said to be in the public interest . The public of course does not know that Black had pre- viously attacked the Tribune . Here is the Congressional Record report . Senator Wheeler had just explained how sub- sidizers of the Liberty League made contributions in the form of loans so that the losses could be written off the income tax returns . Senator Black then said : \"Of course it is necessary to invent many new methods . The Chicago Tribune several weeks ago were required to pay back some three or four hundred thousand dollars by reason of the fact that they had had some kind of a . corporation, and they had manipulated and managed it around until they thought they were not obliged to pay . . . . Perhaps they thought they could keep on doing that until there would be some administration which would not make them pay it back . \"Mr .

Ickes, at North- western University, declared that he suspected Colonel Mc- Cormick of \"suffering from political frustration,\" and added : \"I assert the fact to be that the Chicago Tribune, in giving expression to the envy and malice that poisons the mind of its publisher, has slandered the President of the United States ; that it has deliberately made misstatements of fact with respect to his acts and purposes . Its news has been colored by insinuations, innuendoes and falsehoods . \"It is interesting to note that Colonel McCormick is now content to sit at the feet of his rival publisher, William Randolph Hearst, and eagerly pick up whatever journalistic crumbs may fall from that gentleman's table . The Tribune is erupting Hearstian front-page editorials . Every one of these ponderous and pontifical pronouncements that I have read has been based upon a false premise or has drawn a false conclusion . \"Colonel McCormick published a front-page editorial on October i i th, which sought to create the impression that Mr . Roosevelt and other members of his administration are `allies' of the Communist party . This bogey-man with which to frighten the moronic mind was first raised by Mr .

The campaign to bring the horse back to the farm is a whim of the horse-loving Colonel, and although the McCormick cousins who manufacture farm tractors and the various automobile makers did not like it very much, there was no advertising boycott of the Tribune .

It is extremely difficult to come to a conclusion on the motivation of the McCormick Tribune . Although the Colo- nel may be politically frustrated, it cannot be said he suffers one of the Roy Howard, Paul Block, Hearst and Northcliffe complexes ; he is too shy of contact with human beings and too arrogant in his dislike of the people ever to think of be- coming a public figure, nor does he enjoy secret manipula- tion of political events . Power, money, fame, egotism, do not seem to be the Colonel's motives in making his newspaper what it is, and revenge may be the reason for the personal feuds with certain notable men . The Tribune used to adver- tise that it \"is not a philanthropic institution . Nor is it a religious or a political institution . It is a commercial institu- tion,\" and the Colonel himself has said that \"there is venality in almost everyone's life,\" but both statements also fail to explain the Tribune completely . The matter is perhaps one a psychologist should investi- gate ; but the fact that confronts the Illinois public is that it must get its morning news from either the unspeakable Hearst or \"from that unspeakable Chicago Tribune that even the newspapers themselves condemn,\" as it was recently referred to in the Congressional Record ."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 Little Lord Northcliffe PAUL BLOCK is a little man with a big complex . Like Northcliffe, Hearst, and numerous others, some in high positions of sane respect, others in forgotten hoosegows, Paul Block has a nicely polished Napoleonic egotism . This ego runs to things big . He cannot sleep in a little room, he cannot ride in an ordinary sleeper, or in a small automobile . When he stops over in a city he rents a suite of three to seven rooms for himself alone, he has his own private coach to attach to regular trains, and his automobile is the biggest made . Paul Block, like his numerous colleagues, loves publicity . He loves his picture in the paper, loves to see his name in print, loves to read about himself, and when no one puts his picture in the papers, and no one writes about him, he buys space in papers throughout the country, and publishes his editorials broadcast, with his signature in nice big letters, the most readable part of the advertisements . He also insists in basking in the flashlight . He is always present when the photographers let go their bombs, and if he is not the object of their bombing, he must be second high man . On the occasion when Hoover, as President, paid a visit to Newark, Mr . Block in his easy neo-Napoleonic way, called up his city editor and said \"Get me into the President's car for the parade tomorrow afternoon .\" But neither the city editor nor anyone else could get Paul Block into the Hoover 65"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"66 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS car, and yet no one dared defy the pre-Waterloo dictator in the main office .

The reporter told the captain, and the captain detailed five men . At exactly the moment when the parade reached the Newark building, the reporter shouted \"Make way for Paul Block-Make way for Paul Block\" and five policemen, with Block in the center of a flying wedge, broke through the crowds on the street . As they rushed the Presidential car, at the head of the procession, the United States Secret Service operatives for a moment thought it a plot to assassinate the chief executive . Even the blue police uniforms did not disarm them . \"Make way for Paul Block,\" shouted the reporter . The wedge got to the Hoover car . But Hoover would not stop . For a second the wedge, with Block in the center, re- mained in the middle of the street .

This is not the first instance in which Paul Block got what he went after . Every reporter who has worked around the country knows many towns in which there are these little press lords who exercise their authority in this fashion . As a rule they cause more laughter than harm . Paul Block is the only publisher in America closely asso- ciated with William Randolph Hearst . In 1936 the New York Post called him a Hearst stooge, which he let pass, but in 1938, during the excitement over the appointment of Senator Black to the Supreme Court when Robert S . Allen wrote that \"the expose of justice Hugo Black's one-time membership in the Ku Klux Klan was a deliberate con- spiracy . . . . Parties to the conspiracy were the Hearst stooge Paul Block\" and others, Block sued Allen and the Nation for $900,000 libel damages . Block and Hearst have engaged in numerous newspaper deals . Time claimed (April 4, 1938) that \"partly with Hearst money, Mr . Block acquired nine substantial dailies by 1931,\" and for many years before becoming a publisher Paul Block Associates handled Hearst advertising . In 1927 Block and Hearst invaded Pittsburgh and the result was a slaughter of the press . In recent times the Leader and Dispatch had already been destroyed as rivals, and now Block bought the Post and Sun from the trustee of the late president of the Farmers National Bank and Hearst bought the Gazette-Times and Chronicle-Telegraph, two previously amalgamated news- papers owned by the Oliver family, which was associated with the steel industry and the Senate . The Post-Gazette became the unique Pittsburgh morning newspaper, and the Sun-Telegraph became the unique rival for the Scripps- Howard Press in the evening .

Hearst retained a `considerable amount of stock' in the Post-Gazette on which Block had an option .\" In 1931 Hearst announced that the Los Angeles Express would be merged with his Evening Herald, to be known as the Evening Herald & Express . He said \"It was I who pre- vailed upon Mr . Block to enter the Los Angeles newspaper field . . . . As a competitor of mine in other cities I had learned to admire and esteem him highly . We are also pleased to announce that Mr . Block will become a director of the Herald & Express .\" In the following year Mr . Block's name came up in the case of the Mayor of New York, when testimony was given that the two had a joint stock exchange account . The New York Evening Post * reported the case as follows : \"Paul Block, newspaper publisher and intimate of Mayor Walker, prefers to wait until he is called by Samuel Seabury, chief counsel of the Hofstadter Investigation Committee be- fore making an explanation of the joint account which he and Mayor Walker shared from February, 1927, to August, 1929, and from which the Mayor cleared $246,692 .76 with- out the investment of a cent on his own part, as the Mayor testified before the committee yesterday .\" The paper quoted a \"person in a position to speak with authority\" to the effect that Block received no favors in re- turn, and added : \"Mr .

Neverthe- less about seven weeks before election day Mr . Block let the Hearst American publish a scoop interview in which he said : \"I have never felt more certain of anything in my life than the defeat of President Roosevelt . By mid-October people will wonder why they ever had any doubt about it . \"Roosevelt will be defeated by two things-high taxes and increased cost of living .

He once wrote to Arthur Elliot Sproul who asked for his autobiography, that his hobbies were \"newspapers and friendships .\" He said he had never started a newspaper . \"I have another ambition which I probably will never fulfil, mostly because I cannot afford it, and probably am not capable of it, namely to start the publication of a newspaper .

The success story in brief is that of a New Hampshire Yankee lad who had to quit Dartmouth on account of his health . He went West in the days the West still called . Eventually he became a \"circulation hustler\" for a Los Angeles newspaper, came to the notice of Colonel Harrison Gray Otis who owned the Los Angeles Times, became gen- eral manager of the paper, married the boss's daughter, in- herited the Times, the ranches, the Mexican acres, the millions, and the policies . In those days circulation routes were bought and sold, and with his first money Chandler acquired a Times route with 1,4oo names and supervised the delivery of papers . With the approval of this newspaper he later acquired the circula- tion route of the Herald, and also of the Express . There came a quarrel between Otis and his partner, H . H . Boyce, who then started the Morning Tribune as a rival, and began to cut down on the income of the Times . And then it was that Chandler made the plan by which he became fa- mous . As he himself boasts : \"I went to General Otis and told him the situation . He said I couldn't do it . I told him I could and not only that , ;1"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"72 LORDS OF THE PRESS but for the Times' sake I should . My scheme was to starve out the Tribune . With two of the three morning papers' distribution systems under my control, it would be simple to play them together against the Tribune . If a Times sub- scriber quit we could swing him to the Herald, whereas he might have gone to the Tribune if left alone . If a Herald subscriber quit we could swing him to the Times . Of course, no one but General Otis would know of my connection . The Herald routes were to be handled through a dummy .\" The scheme, which is legal and shrewd and supposedly good business, succeeded in two years in crowding out the Tribune . Boyce never knew what ruined him . When he was forced to sell out, he got no more than five cents on the dollar . Colonel Otis had tried to buy the defunct rival, but someone under an assumed name had succeeded in getting in on the ground floor . Otis was discussing the matter with Chandler, when Chandler admitted it was he who was now the owner of the Tribune . After that it was natural that Otis made Chandler his manager and finally his successor . Harry Chandler continued Otis' policy of attacking labor, his antagonism to the Mexican republic, his general ob- scurantism . Otis made a policy of perverting the news con- cerning labor . He published every item which could be twisted and colored to misrepresent the trades unions and all movements by working people throughout the world which aimed at a better life for themselves and their chil- dren . Otis, of course, had a reason for his mad hatred . His paper had been bombed in the midst of a labor war . But Chandler continued the policy of labor-baiting, and also Otis' antagonism to the Mexican republic, and in fact all of Otis' reactionary and obscurantist ideas . And yet, according to Editor & Publisher, \"The Chandlers, a visitor at the Times plant learns, are `fine people with old time ideas .\"' Humanitarians, from time immemorial, have dreamed of the emancipation of men and women from the drudgery of"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"CALIFORNIA PRESS AND LANDLORD \t 73 daily work . The machine and power age of today has made that possible . With the ultimate development of machinery and the elimination of profits for a few owners, it will be possible to provide all the food, shelter, clothing and even luxuries for the entire American population, with the reduc- tion of the working week to ten or less hours . At the present moment there are 13,000,000 persons who have not the op- portunity to work even one hour a day ; under the ideal system everyone will work only a few hours, and all will have economic security and leisure for physical and mental im- provement . But so reactionary is the Los Angeles Times editorial mind that even a shortening of working hours is disapproved . \"The inevitable result of too much spare time in the case of at least the majority of the workers,\" the Times edito- rializes, \"would be to steer them into the only diversions they know-pool, poker, drinking and petty agitation over fancied grievance . . . . It would be a tragedy to wreck the whole economic program for a few hours more `leisure hours'- that nobody would know what to do with .\" Evidently Los Angeles Times editors have never done a day's physical labor in their lives . Being the enemy of labor, Harry Chandler has been the enemy of the Newspaper Guild since it began as an A . F . of L . affiliate, and more intensely since it joined the C . I . O . On September 22, 1935, the Los Angeles Times published from Portland, Oregon, a news story which is notable for its misstatements regarding the Guild . Most newspapers make at least a pretense of confining their unfair reporting, mis- statements, and anti-labor bias to the editorial page . The Times states in its news columns that \"Seattle radical organ- izers are at work here . The Newspaper Guild, one of whose -purposes is to control news of radical activities by `advising' editors, has about twenty members in one office .\" The news item boasts that recent Portland strikes have been \"promptly i"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"7 4 LORDS OF THE PRESS nipped in the bud . . .\" and hints that \"should the provoca- tion be sufficient\" the governor was anxious to see \"just how good the National Guard is .\" So violent did Chandler become in his tirades against Seattle labor dominated by Dave Beck that he painted a picture of the city going to rats and ruin . This was too much for Hearst's Post-Intelligencer where the Guild strike was on . Publisher John Boettiger, defending Seattle, accused Chan- dler of being \"grossly unfair and misleading\" and \"hitting below the belt .\" The criticism is significant in that it comes from a Hearst paper . At Christmas time, 1937, the clerks of the May Depart- ment Store who had been trying to get more than thirty cents an hour and some improvement in working conditions- without of course the support of the press-thought it oppor- tune to go on strike . The Los Angeles papers, led by the Times, headlined this demand for better wages as \"Assassina- tion of Santa Claus\" and \"Murder of the Spirit of Christmas .\" The liberal News participated in this anti-union campaign . All these newspapers were carrying a full page of May De- partment Store advertising at the time . Naturally enough a few newspapermen thought there was a financial connection between back-page ads, editorial support and front-page hysterics . Old man Otis had 650,000 acres of land in North Mexico which he got from Diaz, the dictator, at the time Diaz was pocketing the money and literally and figuratively selling out his country . When Diaz was overthrown Otis couldn't get his cattle out in time . He immediately began a campaign for the annexation of Northern Mexico . Failing in that, he favored the formation of an independent North Mexican Republic, a buffer state, in which his cattle lands would be safe from the Carranza reforms .

He and his associates built Hollywood, founded a vast agricultural colony at Calexico which produced $18 ; 000,000 worth of cotton in 1919. He owns a 281,ooo-acre ranch in Los Angeles and Kern Counties stocked with fine cattle, a 340,000-acre hunting preserve in Colorado, an in- terest in another 500,000-acre sporting preserve in New Mexico, is officer or director in thirty-five California corpora- tions, including oil, shipping, banking . The whisper, 'Chan- dler's in it,' signifies a good thing to most California business- men .\" Throughout the valleys where Chandler and his associates own and control California crops there is terrorism and the nearest approach to Fascism in the United States (outside the Hague Domain in New Jersey) . There is child labor and even peonage . There is starvation in the midst of plenty . There is vigilantism, tarring and feathering, bloodshed and violence . There is also big money for the Chandler crowd . No one has ever heard Chandler say anything which could be interpreted even vaguely as humanitarian, altruistic, liberal or progressively intelligent . But there must be some- thing in him outside the shrewd Yankee trader who slyly put a rival out of business so he could buy the ruins at five cents on the dollar and become a big shot . If you ask Los Angeles Times employees about the boss they answer that last Christ- mas he distributed a bonus of $197,000 among them . Some- how the question of money and human dignity get badly mixed up in Los Angeles ."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 Lord Howard and His Empire THE repudiation of the Hearst press, now general, is the climax of decades of criticism and doubt ; the attack with rotten eggs, stones and curses against the Chicago Tribune and other reactionary Chicago papers on election night was a sudden outbreak of long repressed mass disillusionment and indignation . These facts indicate that the American people are following Europeans in realizing that the press is a powerful force affecting their lives, and that frequently it is an inimical force . The time has not yet come when the enlightened, liberal and progressive American public will be ready to throw stones at the windows of the Scripps-Howard newspapers, call Howard the names they called Colonel McCormick, and boycott his merchandise-but the time surely has come when all of us who are interested in a free press-and not the publishers' association commercial idea of freedom of the press-should no longer fool ourselves by counting among the liberal and progressive forces in Americaa the entire Howard outfit : the twenty-four papers, the United Press, the N . E . A . feature syndicate, the radio stations, forming what President Coolidge called \"a world power, influential beyond the dreams of any of its founders .\" To all these enterprises the time apparently has come for liberal-minded men to say hail and farewell . Individual newspapers, especially those in the more progressive Middle West and Far West, seem to follow the old Scripps ideal, but the management itself has gone conservative . 76"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"LORD HOWARD AND HIS EMPIRE \t 77 When Edward Wyllis Scripps founded the Penny Press (now the Cleveland Press) in 1879 he had to borrow the money . Today the empire Howard controls is worth about $100,000,000 (of which $28,000,000 is real estate) plus an- other $ I o,ooo,ooo for good will . About a third of this empire was built up by Scripps who became a multimillionaire with- out ever losing his integrity . He realized from the first day that it was almost impossible to have a free press unless advertising was practically eliminated . He wrote Lincoln Steffens he intended to prove it was possible \"that the people can have a free press, not only without having it subsidized or endowed, but a free press that will not only support but magnificently reward those who conduct its various units .\" Steffens found him sincere and not cynical . Steffens said that Scripps \"avoided other rich men so as to escape being one ; he knew the danger his riches carried for himself, for his papers and for his seeing .\" Throughout his lifetime Scripps stuck to his ideals, which were : public service, positive jus- tice as between man and man as men, the promotion of the equality of opportunity, the putting into the homes of workers who had little time to read of honest, fearless thought in clean and concise form, impartiality incorruptible by social, political or financial influence, and the square deal all round without fear or favor . United Press men for a generation said Scripps endowed the newspaper institution with a soul . They spoke of the Unipress soul without blushing . The \"soul\" of this empire died in 1926 . Robert Paine Scripps, the frustrated, sensitive son of the founder, became the largest stockholder and apparently the inheritor of the liberal tradition . He said of the Scripps- Howard chain of newspapers : \"The dictionary definition that appeals to me as applying to the kind of newspapers that my associates and I are trying to produce runs this way : `Befitting or worthy of a man of free birth ; free, not servile or mean ; not narrow or contracted in view ; broadminded,"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"78 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS free from bigotry ; not bound by orthodox forms in political or religious philosophy .' I would add economic to political and religious, so as to embrace all of the principal phases of life in this developing society of ours .\" In Bob Scripps the liberal spirit, if not the \"soul\" of liber- alism, flickered intermittently for a little while . None doubted Bob's sincerity but all realized that the other part- ner, Roy Wilson Howard, who in 1912 had become head of the United Press and in 1922 made a partner in the Scripps empire, was now its dominating leader and would-be dic- tator . This is the same Roy Howard who told the Chamber of Commerce of Denver on the occasion of a banquet given him to honor the establishment of a Scripps-Howard news- paper that \"We are coming to Denver neither with a tin cup nor a lead pipe . We will live with and in this community and not on or off it . We are nobody's big brother, wayward sister or poor relation . We come here simply as news mer- chants . We are here to sell advertising and sell it at a rate profitable to those who buy it . But first we must produce a newspaper with news appeal that will result in a circulation and to make that advertising effective . We shall run no lottery .\" Here in the statements of intentions we have a pretty fair history of the rise and fall of the Scripps-Howard press . The elder Scripps twice tried ad-less newspapers because he knew that no free press can ever exist which owes a first allegiance to business ; he supported labor unions in general and raised money for picketers, and he was not afraid to dedicate his press to the workingmen . The younger Scripps lived in the shadow of his fatal illness but he wanted a press befitting a nation of free men . And the present head of all the news- papers, news services, radio stations and other means of manufacturing public opinion in America, says \"We are here to sell advertising .\" That all-revealing statement was made more than a decade"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"LORD HOWARD AND HIS EMPIRE \t 79 ago . Then, as Silas Bent reported, Scripps-Howard men were \"fighting editors,\" and \"these papers not only fight on their own account but put their strength joyfully behind other fighters .\" Even today we hear of Ohio and other journals carrying on a crusade against corrupt politics or for a better economic world, but with the disappearance of the Scripps family from the directorate as well as the Scripps \"soul,\" the fighting spirit is also disappearing, and many \"crusades\" recently engaged in become open to a search for a financial or political personal advantage as vital cause . No such doubts clouded the Scripps era . The Grim Reaper has played the role of Santa Claus for Roy Howard . He has delivered him a new journalistic em- pire unspoiled by traditional journalistic idealism . Free at last from the Scripps bonds, from the utopian idea of a newspaper defying advertising and business, Roy Howard has begun to follow Hearst in Red-baiting and labor-baiting . He has begun the suppression of his highly paid columnists, has altered their views, and he has gradu- ally changed the policies of his papers from liberal to phony- liberal and eventually to a more honest anti-liberalism . He has done so at a critical time in our history when everyone with a minimum of intelligence, not only writers, is taking sides, and when it is easier to see the right side on which there is always butter, than the left, which is not only un- buttered but perhaps not enough to sustain existence . People take sides, and in the process a large number change view- points, so that it is fast becoming impossible to see the liter- ary and journalistic woods because of the thousands of lost leaders hiding among the renegade trees . But in the case of Roy Howard no Browning can sing of his leaving us just for a handful of silver or for a riband to stick in his coat . Money and power, as shall be explained later, are the dominating motives in this man's existence, but it is not a matter of thirty pieces or, in fact, lost leader- ship. Roy Howard, the Scripps partner, as a leader of liberal"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"80 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS thought and progressive politics in America, is and has been an accepted myth . Had he been that it would be easy to say he sold out, he abandoned his followers, he betrayed the usual newspaper slogan of Truth, Honesty, Public Service, the Welfare of the Common People . But Roy Howard cannot be accused because he has never belonged to the Scripps movement with which he has always been associated and to which his only relationship was journalistic marriage . It is the public which made the mis- take of confounding a marriage of convenience with a union of liberal minds . The Scripps-Howard \"outfit\" did have an ideal, a program which it respected, and a crusading spirit, but no one can accuse Roy Howard of giving more than a Bronx cheer sort of adherence t o .i t during the Scripps life- time . The Scripps \"soul\" and the Howard police reporter's soul co-existed for decades without influencing each other . From his youth Howard devoted himself to making money and gaining power . Only so long as the old Scripps brand of liberalism paid, did he stick to it . After all, every news- paper and every affiliated enterprise which Scripps dedicated to \"the common people\" had paid six percent per annum or more and there was no reason to change the policy . Not for a long time . The change, which is now obvious, did not come, as many, including Howard employees, believe, with his opposition to the Roosevelt administration reforms, the NRA, the ill- fated (and hypocritical) publishers' code, the NLRB, the Wagner Act and other social-economic developments which directly affected the pocketbooks of publishers and drove them in a raging stampede against the New Deal . Actually the change came ten years earlier and was the result of the campaign of the elder La Follette for the Presidency . The Scripps-Howard editors were for Robert La Follette in 1924 . Their selection was natural, in harmony with Scripps family liberalism, but Howard went along reluc- tantly . No one expected La Follette to win, but it was a good"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"LORD HOWARD AND HIS EMPIRE \t 81 fight . The Scripps-Howard press had to its credit a fine show- ing in all its towns and a real victory in Cleveland where the Press, the largest and most powerful of the journals-until the formation of the World-Telegram-carried the city for the Progressives . The shouts and editorials of triumph made Scripps- Howard men feel good-all but Mr . Howard . He was not looking at the election returns, he was looking at the box office . Business, advertisers (the supporters of the Republican and Democratic parties) had attacked the chain in its vulner- able spot, the till, and the Cleveland Press had lost a tre- mendous number of advertisements and a lot of money . Howard learned in 1924 that it does not pay, in dollars and cents, to be liberal . He learned then what all publishers know now, that there is little money in the liberal center, no money whatever in the liberal left, boycott and blackmail for the radical left, and that the big money is on the right, in the conservative, tory, and finally in the Fascist right . It took Howard a longer time than most newspaper publishers to find this out because up to then he had seen Scripps mak- ing millions under the banner of liberalism . Scripps-Howard editors are supposed to have the right to vote on their choice for President, and in 1928 the majority declared themselves liberally on the side of Al Smith, but Howard was for Hoover, and it did not take much maneu- vering to bring the editors into line with the boss . The chain supported Hoover . Four years later it would have been suicidal to renew the support and Howard very wisely went over to Roosevelt, to whom he remained faithful until Rooseveltian legislation, alienating the affection of most big business, made an enemy of between seventy and eighty-five percent of the press in 1936 and at least ten percent more in 1938 . In the final ten percent the most powerful element was Howard's twenty-four newspapers . And now it must be noted that Roy Howard has also been playing a behind-the-scenes role in American politics . Up"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"82 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS to the time of the war, and for some years after it, he had been content with being a newspaperman . He still considers himself a \"working reporter\" and would not hesitate to cover a fire if he found himself exclusively present . But Howard is also one of many newspaper editors and publishers who suffers from the Northcliffe complex . Northcliffe himself suffered from Napoleonic delusions and went entirely insane . Let me digress for a moment to say that while sane he wrote enthusiastic recommendations for a journalistic union, and after he went crazy he wrote violent attacks on the union, which the anti-Newspaper Guild forces, including Editor & Publisher, are quoting to- day, apparently not knowing the later quotations are the ravings of a man about to die . Northcliffe, the Napoleonic publisher, wanted to rule Britain, and the greatest disap- pointment of his life was not being named prime minister in wartime . But the Northcliffe phase which American editors copy is the make-or-break power behind the scenes, the role Northcliffe always excelled in and boasted most about, and whose chief hero and victim was Lord Kitchener . Like Northcliffe, in the anonymous phase, Howard also is trying to make himself and his press so powerful that he can name Presidents and plot the course of administrations, with no one but his mirror to applaud him . He had tried, in 1932, to name as Democratic candidate for President his own company's attorney, Newton D . Baker, which would have allied him with the Wall Street movement to stop Roosevelt, and with Tammany, and a year later he was attacking Tam- many in his support of La Guardia . This was pure oppor- tunism . However, it is more and more in the field of labor that Roy Howard pursues his Northcliffian-if not Hearstian- way . He is no longer content with publishing newspapers- and everyone knows that one of the greatest powers in the world lies in the hands of those men who have the right to pick and choose even truthful news-but he must play a part"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"LORD HOWARD AND HIS EMPIRE \t 83 in pulling strings and shaping events, invisible like all gods . National politics was fun, fed the ego, and held out hope of profit, but ever since the labor movement began to open its political eyes, and especially from the day labor became a financial issue in editorial offices, Howard has been a maker as well as a teller of the news . He instigated, for example, the blast against the Screen Writers' Guild which Rupert Hughes signed in May, 1936 . Hollywood Variety takes the credit for this exposure of hidden activities and secret diplomacy which now character- ize Howard methods . The Hughes pronunciamento is not only stale today, but its stupidity proven by passing time . What is important is the fact that Howard not only ordered it but suggested its tenor . He had telegraphed a request for 50o to iooo words from Hughes stating that \"Only about twenty-five words printed here - your statement - Screen Guild's closed shop policy would create writers' Soviet . . . this attempt hogtie and standardize creative writing .\" He likens the Screen Writers with the Newspaper Guild saying \"net effect\" of their success \"would be Guild dictatorship of American press on parity with Communist, Fascist or Nazi unilateral press dictatorship abroad . Difference be here Guild would dictate policies owners retain responsibility and foot bills . . . . Would like you incidentally point out menace to democratic institutions of attempting limit editorial ex- pression to proponents of any one school of political or eco- nomic thought .\" When Hughes obliged, Howard repaid him by a telegram of thanks which concluded : \"Am asking the press associa- tions to watch your efforts tonight which I think are of vital importance to real liberty of the writing craft and honest to God freedom of expression .\" Hughes got the head- lines, but the Screen Guild got a raw deal, and this seems to be part of the publishers' idea of \"honest to God freedom .\" The episode cannot be dismissed as picayune : it illumi- nates in fact the entire new economic and political policy of"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"84 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS Roy Howard, the triple policy of attacking labor, of manu- facturing news, and of working the deus ex machina racket . The four-year-war which Howard has waged against the Newspaper Guild is likewise no intramural affair, but part of the general policy . When the Guild was started it was the natural expectation of all concerned that the Scripps-Howard outfit would be the first to recognize it . It is true that the minimum wages demanded would go harder with this organization than with most others because-as I can testify from personal experi- ence on the United Press-newspapermen were paid in three kinds of coin, two of which were neither negotiable nor good for taxes . These were first the privilege of working for a liberal service and therefore escaping the old-fashioned charge of being \"servants of vested interests\" or as the phrase went up to the 1920's, \"prostitutes of the press\"-and second, the \"by-line .\" Thus Westbrook Pegler in 1917 wrote war correspondence at a minimum wage but via his signed stories got a good-paying job with the Chicago Tribune, from which the United Press had to buy him back at an enormous salary . But we thought highly of Scripps-Howard then because it did not suppress the news, or pervert the news, and we frequently refused better money from reaction- ary papers . The Guild minimums were not excessive ; the Guild pro- gram seemed to be just the thing for the Scripps-Howard outfit to make its own . But 1934 ended without any results and February, 1935, began three years of shadow-boxing, stalling, and straddling for which Roy Howard alone is blamed . Hearst is considered a straight-forward, square-deal- ing, pleasant, liberal-minded, fair dealer compared to the evasive Howard . So far as New York is concerned, the situation was dramat- ically exposed in mid-summer 1935 when the Post, announc- ing its complete recognition of the Guild, published an editorial openly suspecting the World-Telegram of hypocrisy"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"LORD HOWARD AND HIS EMPIRE \t 85 in its fight to change the Wagner Labor Bill and its attitude toward the newspapermen's organization . This editorial gave notice that the Post was willing to take the place of the World-Telegram as the one liberal newspaper of the metrop- olis, and that the wheel-horse of Scripps-Howard liberalism was decidedly on the opposite road . A year later Howard was still issuing statements and mak- ing charges which the New Republic showed were nothing but straw men and inventions, and it exposed the fact that Howard had circulated his fellow publishers with these unfair diatribes . Hearst had used them as a warning to his employees given by a \"liberal .\" Howard's idea was to bargain with his own men ; in other words, he favored the company union, which labor and the liberal press then de- nounced and which has since been held unlawful by the Supreme Court of the United States . (In the midst of all this headline making by Howard it may be noted that pay raises from about $2 .50 to $5 a week were quietly made to United Press men without their asking for them .) In April, 1937, the World-Telegram signed a contract with the Guild covering wages, hours and working conditions but omitting the preferential shop-or, as the majority of pub- lishers inaccurately called it, the closed shop . In October, when United Press men voted 277 to 84 for joining up with the Guild, the Guild Reporter said the vote meant that \"the publishers have failed to impress Unipressers with their falsehoods about the Guild threat to freedom of the press .\" From now on it was a pretty straight war of thousands of Scripps-Howard employees against Mr . Howard, and \"false- hoods\" is one of the mild terms now frequently heard . Ostensibly it was a conflict about the five-day week, mini- mum wages, lay-offs, pay-cuts, and all the other troubles which affect the hundred-million-dollar Howard empire just as they affect the two-billion-dollar Ford empire . And so we come to 1938 when the Guild by bitter experience has"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"86 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS learned that its chief enemy is Roy Howard . And the Guild also sees the intriguing fingers of its enemy in many affairs and notably in its first metropolitan test of strength, the Brooklyn Eagle strike, when Jonathan Eddy, executive vice- president of the Guild, accused the big publishers of sup- porting the Eagle's Mr . Goodfellow for the purpose of break- ing the unionization movement in New York . \"Mr . Howard,\" Eddy wrote in the Guild Reporter (January g, 1938) \"is probably the greatest of the adepts at stirring up weaker (I refrain from saying `weak-minded') publishers to pull his chestnuts out of the fire . . . .

Howard has now taken several of these steps ."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 The Light That Failed EMPLOYEES of the Scripps-Howard newspapers throughout the United States were the first to realize that the Howard policy had won, that changes were being made, that the swing to reaction was definite . The public did not know much about it . There were and still are liberal and progres- sive editorials alternating with reactionary and obscurantist editorials, and frequently the spirit of \"Lusty\" Scripps per- vades the news columns too . When Howard engaged Benjamin Stolberg to write a series of articles purporting to expose the C . I . O . by charg- ing Communist intrigue or control of the new great liberal labor movement, the organization's spokesmen replied by calling Stolberg a \"poison-penman,\" the Communist organs labeled him \"America's No . i literary stool-pigeon,\" and Robert Forsythe coined the phrase \"parlor fink .\" Mr . Stol- berg was deeply hurt and very angry, especially over the general accusation that he was a \"renegade Socialist .\" He contends he wrote the articles to help certain C . I . O . leaders, his friends, purge the movement of the Communists in time . But that is not our concern here . Our concern is the motive of Mr . Howard . Howard advertised Stolberg as a radical who would tell the \"inside story\" of the C . I . 0 ., the con- notation being that he would attack, and attack he did . Now, of course, under the American tradition every man has the right to speak and publish, although that right can- not be well exercised when it opposes a corrupt political machine such as those in Jersey City or Newark, or Fascist 87"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"88 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS groups such as the American Legion of Terre Haute and Tampa, and in thousands of other cases . Nevertheless Mr . Stolberg has the right to criticize and Mr . Howard the right to attack . And their critics certainly have the right to ques- tion the ethics of both . Mr . Stolberg's only possible excuse for doing these articles for Howard would be that he was unaware that Howard today is-in the same class as Mr . Hearst. I cannot imagine any ethical writer doing such a series for a Hearst newspaper . It may be good business to have a literary agent sell one's output without consideration of the character of the journal which will publish it, but it is another to sell oneself to Mr . Hearst for the purpose of de- faming a labor movement . There is an ethic of place as well as an ethic of words . If Mr. Stolberg did not realize he was being made the usual Howardian cat's-paw, and that the dif- ference between Howard and Hearst today is frequently only in size of type, it would be nice to hear him make a public explanation . The Stolberg series marked the emergence of Howard as one of the leaders in the anti-labor movement in America . The fitting accolade was given by Tom Girdler who was delighted to find \"a radical like Benjamin Stolberg . . . point- ing to the insidious Communistic influences in the C . I . 0 .\" as revealed in the Scripps-Howard press . The Girdlers and Weirs and Liberty Leaguers everywhere approved Stolberg and Howard, but there were, as expected, numerous protests and demands for retractions and correction from the unions . How did Mr . Howard reply to the latter? Did he grant them the inviolable right of redress which is inherent in freedom of the press? Did he even make a pretense of pub- lishing the rebuttal? The answer is, yes . He made a pretense . In every city where one of the twenty-four Scripps-Howard papers is published there was a chance to test the code of ethics of the press . In New York City for example, Michael J. Quill, international president of the Transport Workers Union of America, informed Lee B . Wood, executive editor"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"THE LIGHT THAT FAILED \t 89 of the World-Telegram that Stolberg twisted facts and pub- lished \"vicious and obvious distortions and untruths .\" Quill continued : \"We request that you publish this letter . . . .

At a time when the progressive labor movement is waging a serious fight for organizational unity, economic security, industrial democracy and political liberty, its ene- mies are expected to produce their Girdlers, Hagues, Bergoffs and Stolbergs . . . . Your paper has chosen to share the dis- grace of the Hearst press, serving as a channel for their hatred of labor and progress . If the World-Telegram does not make amends for the series of articles by Mr . Stolberg, it will re- main condemned in the eyes and in the minds of its readers . . . as being guilty of suppressing the truth and of disseminat- ing calumnies, lies and misstatements about the American labor movement and its most progressive leaders and institu- tions .\" Mr . Wood (or Mr . Howard, or both) refused to give the C . I . 0 . the space requested . And worse than that, they printed only a part of Quill's letter, suppressing the demand for space and the paragraphs cited above . In San Francisco Mr . Howard's News has always enjoyed the support of labor and with enthusiasm after the 1934 strike . When its managing editor, Frank A . Clarvoe, received the Stolberg series he cautiously prefixed the announcement that \"The San Francisco News and other Scripps-Howard newspapers are publishing the Stolberg story of the C . I . 0 . as a matter of historical interest .\" But even that was not enough . The Stolberg articles dealing with the Pacific coast differed from the originals . In the World-Telegram, for instance, Mr . Stolberg came to this conclusion about the situation on the coast : \"The resulting bitterness is incredible . It broke up the powerful Maritime Federation of the Pacific, which today is on its last legs .\""},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"90 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS Perhaps the union there is centipedal . At any rate in the News the Stolberg verdict of history is different . It reads : \"The resulting bitterness is incredible . It threatens to break up the powerful Maritime Federation of the Pacific .\" (There is no mention of last legs, not even penultimate ones .) There are an additional score of instances in which sup- posed facts and stated opinions are changed or deleted in California . When Stolberg accuses Bridges of being \"de- vious,\" of \"playing both ends against the middle,\" of fighting the C . I . 0 ., and California unions of being \"up in arms against Bridges\" and John L . Lewis \"showing signs of re- gretting\" the appointment of Bridges, all these references are missing in California . Obviously one of these two Howard papers is not publishing the facts, uncolored . In Toledo, Ohio, John Brophy, national director of the C . I . 0., told a huge meeting that \"an erstwhile liberal chain of newspapers which has capitalized over the years on a reputation of being liberal and progressive . . . hires a rene- gade radical to do the dirty work of besmirching the labor movement,\" the labor movement must \"serve notice to the newspapers which discredit labor .\" This speech was delivered on January 21, 1938 . It certainly was news in Toledo, but Howard's News-Bee, which carefully reported the meeting, suppressed all criticism of Stolberg and the Howard chain .* Whether an Ohio speech is still news in New York is open to question . If the World-Telegram had never printed a line about it no professional newspaperman would have found fault . But what happened in New York was this : the World- Telegram did not print the news on the 22nd, the 23rd, or the 24th . But on the night of the 25th, after numerous C . I . O . and other publications had accused it of suppressing the news, the World-Telegram carried a few paragraphs . Here is one of them : * The Toledo News-Bee suspended publication and the Akron Times-Press was sold in August, 1988 ."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Brophy's Speech : \"These papers claim to be liberal .

In Akron the Industrial Union Council went on record \"condemning the recent series of articles by Benjamin Stol- berg in the Akron Times-Press and other Scripps-Howard newspapers as prejudiced, distorted and inaccurate\" and charged that their publication was prompted by Mr . Roy Howard's intense hatred of the C . I . 0 . in general and the American Newspaper Guild in particular . Elsewhere similar actions were taken . In the C . I . 0 . press the comparison between Hearst and Howard was made fre- quently, with the intimation that the labor boycott, which has caused Mr . Hearst a considerable financial as well as moral headache, might sometime be invoked against Hearst's would-be successor . But Mr . Howard has not been frightened . In fact it would not surprise anyone in the newspaper game to learn that the chain's advertising solicitors are using this threat from the C . I . 0 . as a means of selling more space to big business . Red-baiting is also a means to good business . In the case of Simon W . Gerson, a reporter on the Communist Daily Worker, appointed to a city job by Borough President Stan- ley M . Isaacs because of his fitness and despite his political associations, the World-Telegram indulged in the usual Hearst style of journalism . In the office of the paper the order was given to \"get\" Gerson . There was no longer a pre- tense at publishing straight news, there was a crusade on, and news was manufactured in just the way Hearst, waging a"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"92 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS campaign against imaginary \"Reds\" in the schools and col- leges of America for several years, got his reporters to try every known trick, to fabricate a story where none existed . But apparently the Howard boys have not yet learned all the Hearst tricks, their journalistic hearts may not be in their work, and their journalistic tongues are surely in their cheeks . About the most sensational item which Mr. Wood was able to show Mr . Howard was one saying that \"two months before his appointment . . . Gerson wrote an article in which he urged the Communist party to continue an active recruiting drive after election, it was discovered today .\" One of Mr . Wood's great discoveries . And this is followed by another sensational discovery, namely, that Gerson is \"under fire by the American Legion and numerous other patriotic, civic and religious groups .\" For some twenty years the Scripps-Howard papers were among the few which from time to time showed up the ex- cesses of the Legion, its provocation of violence, its denial of civil rights to minorities, but today it cheers the same organization which is notoriously the stooge of big business and according to General Smedley Butler the biggest strike- breaking agency in .America . The \"religious groups\" are not mentioned, because the Howard sheet knows it will do its baiting campaign no good to say that certain reactionary Catholic organizations and publications are in this business . Nor are the professional patriots named, because in almost all cases such patriotic organizations are found to be the subsidiaries of labor-hating big business organizations . Everyone who knows anything at all about politics knows that Red-baiting is not just Red-baiting : it is the first and sometimes the last but always the most important weapon of reaction .

The policy of \"pinning the red label\" on one's adversaries, which was also adopted by American business, and notably by the National Electric Light Associa- tion's fight against public ownership, is now a Howard policy in fighting the progressive labor movement . He has not yet reached the dictatorial heights of attacking all labor and all liberalism as Red and subversive, but he is undoubtedly well on the road . An indication can be seen in the distorted reporting of all recent campaigns in which labor, the labor parties, and es- pecially the progressive C . I . 0 ., has participated, and the general attack on pro-labor legislation . Thus, in recent months, the Scripps-Howard papers in many cities have burst into violent attacks on secondary picketing-that is, picketing of advertisers, which is a matter much closer to the news- paper pocketbook than picketing in general-and all the pro- labor legislation which has marked the halting march of the New Deal . In all the recent election tests the Scripps-Howard head- lines and the Hearst headlines could well have been substi- tuted, because they tell the same story of \"C . I . O . Plowed Under,\" \"Lewis Rebuffed in Bid for Power,\" \"Labor Turns in Pennsylvania\" and \"New Deal Repudiated .\" Should the New Deal, labor or the C . I . O . make any progress some- where, that fact is not suppressed but so minimized that the lay reader will not be impressed by it . He is either muddled or misled or left ignorant of the facts, when the facts are available to every reporter . The World-Telegram headline \"C . I . O . Candidate Trails Martin in Oregon Vote,\" May 21st, was soon enough cor- rected when Hess defeated Martin .

Lewis' hope that \"he could scowl his way to political power .\" The election, the paper suspects, \"is a turning point in America's labor movement, a turning away from the false path of politics and back toward unionism's true objectives .\" The facts are that a swing of 33,000 votes would have elected C . I . O .'s Kennedy . The fact is that Kennedy carried the entire state of Pennsylvania except the two reactionary cities, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, where the old \"corrupt and contented\" Republican and Democratic party machines have seldom been routed . Kennedy carried the rural popula- tion but did not do too well in his own mining towns where he felt the antagonism of the A . F . of L . But generally speak- ing the labor movement in politics, despite all its defeats, is getting along remarkably well, and ten times faster than the British Labor Party went in its long fight for power . The Scripps-Howard press can speak of nothing but labor defeats, but an inquiring reporter at the United States Cham- ber of Commerce or the National Association of Manu- facturers will hear quite a different story about the march of labor into national politics . Big business is scared . But it is willing to face the situation rather than distort the news about it . IF The test of a free press is its resistance to pressures . Money, usually in the form of advertising, is still in my opinion the medium of greatest pressure, but, on the other side, reader pressure is becoming more and more apparent . There are racial, religious and patriotic groups as well as political groups which either directly influence the press or by the very fact of their existence scare our editors into euphemism, hypocrisy or silence .

Today the labor pressure on newspapers is growing, and will become powerful when labor grows more aware of the fact that the press has in most cases been its greatest enemy while pre- tending to be its greatest friend . But the biggest pressure group in the nation today is Catholic . When Heywood Broun was fired from the old World ten years ago it was for writing a piece beginning \"There ought to be a place in New York City for a liberal newspaper\" and ending with a description of selfish pressure groups which make cowards of editors and destroy the courage and tenacity of the press . \"Admitting the danger of generalities,\" con- cludes Broun, \"I would contend that the Irish are the cry- babies of the Western World . Even the mildest quip will set them off into resolutions and protests . And still more pre- carious is the position of the New York newspaper man who ventures any criticism of the Catholic Church . There is not a single New York editor who does not live in mortal terror of the power of this group . . . . If the Church can bluff its way into a preferred position the fault lies not with the Catholics but with the editors .\" Ten years ago the Catholic Church was on the defensive . Today it is on the aggressive, and there is ten times the fear of it there was a decade ago . Father Curran, of the Inter- national Catholic Truth Society (God save the mark), changed the policy of one newspaper because he controlled $20,000 of business (New Republic, December 30, 1936) and had the effrontery to boast of this outrageous attack on the freedom of the press. But it is general Catholic pressure, not $20,000, which frightens if it does not wholly corrupt many other newspapers . It was no surprise, then, to see Roy Howard's newspapers suppress Pegler's column (Spring 1938) in which this pug-"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"96 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS nacious writer, himself educated in a Jesuit school, very rightly attacked Franco . The Catholic Church in America with few exceptions, has supported that child murderer, and two cardinals have defended Franco-Hayes prayed for him- at a time the Pope openly demanded that Franco stop the murder of civilians . \"If I were a Spaniard who had seen Franco's missionary work among the children I might see him in hell but never in church,\" concluded Pegler in the column the Scripps-Howard papers did not have the courage to publish . Fellow newspapermen sympathize with Howard in the Pegler case, because every reporter knows how deep and vicious is the hatred which press criticism of any religious sect always causes . The World-Telegram is no braver than the old World, which lived and died a liberal newspaper, in withstanding Catholic pressure-or other pressures for that matter-and no one expects any American publisher to do otherwise . But it is quite a different matter when the Howard papers begin suppressing their columnists because of liberal views which differ from that of our silk-hatted and white- spatted Napoleon . Most of the daily columnists are conservative and reaction- ary, a necessary requirement for getting into the big money . Most of them speak as oracles of Reason, Common Sense, Good Sense, and of course, straight American Liberalism . Only once in a while do they write that way too . In many newspapers which buy several of the notable columns there is usually an editorial foreword absolving the publisher of sharing in the views of the writer . In Mr . Howard's papers there is no such foreword, but there is, on the other hand, considerable suppression . Thus when General Hugh S . Johnson, for once forsaking obscu- rantist fields, writes of John L . Lewis-that same Lewis of the C . I . O . of which the Howard-hated Newspaper Guild is a part-that he is \"one of the best\" and that the American people \"would be better off if more of our leaders in both"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"THE LIGHT THAT FAILED \t 97 political and business fields were more like John Lewis,\" Mr . Howard promptly suppresses General Johnson . The public of course did not know of this . But a still greater mystery is General Johnson's statement about a week after this suppression in which he claimed he is uncensored . On April 28, 1938, he boasted that although he had split with Roosevelt he had not joined forces with the Roosevelt- haters, and added : \"I don't have to . In the freedom of the American press, which still prevails, and the liberalism of the Scripps-Howard newspapers of which I am an exponent, I am permitted to say whatever I please . I may be backed up against the front door . . . but I have at least the assurance that what is said here is influenced by nobody . I wouldn't trade my job for anybody's . It couldn't happen in any other country . That is why I think the relatively new institution of columns is worth while . I read all my contemporaries . . . .\" But apparently not his own . At least not the suppressed columns . Heywood Broun, one of the few syndicated non-reaction- aries, is not only suppressed from time to time for expressing ideas which Howard doesn't approve, but his daily copy is actually censored by Lee Wood . So crude is the Wood pencil that World-Telegram employees have numerous samples of paragraphs which don't make sense because Wood has not censored well, and also another \"Before and After\" series in which Wood (or Howard) has mowed Broun down between the first and second editions . Raymond Clapper, Washington columnist, and Dorothy Dunbar Bromley (who has just left Scripps-Howard for the more congenial atmosphere of the Post) have also been sup- pressed for expressing the mildest of liberal ideas, and even the artists have felt the reactionary whip . In fact the troubles which Kirby and Wortman have had may illustrate perhaps better than the news columns the fact that Roy Howard has developed an anti-social conscience . When a Wortman pic- ture is suppressed because a strike breaker says \"even a good"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"98 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS scab can't find work now,\" such action must put the sup- pressor in the class of scab employers . And according to the Nation, Rollin Kirby, a very forceful cartoonist who thor- oughly believes in middle-of-the-road liberalism, has been forced to share in Howard's anti-Gerson Red-baiting cam- paign by drawing a picture \"for which he later apologized in a letter to a friend .\" The public never knows about news censorship . But when columns are omitted even laymen begin to ask questions, and the letters are beginning to worry Howard . He has been forced to make personal replies . Here is one of his typical explanations : If by the terms \"curtailed or blocked out\" you mean to in- quire whether columnists writing for the World-Telegram are having their matter submitted to a censorship calculated to controversial statements or statements in opposition to the editorial policy of the paper, will say that the answer is no . The World-Telegram fias available for its use each day the signed product of some twenty-five columnists whose stuff is contracted for by the paper . Space limitations make impossible use of any given day of much more than half of this stuff . In the selection of that matter used the same test of quality, importance, interest and readability is applied as in the case of all other editorial matter . . . . . . . As publishers of an independent paper, which is our objective, the World-Telegram welcomes the presentation of conflicting ideas and viewpoints, the presentation of which we regard as the most desirable function of a truly independent press, which must be the foundation of an intelligently function- ing democratic system . It is no use going to the length of refuting this statement .

For editors and pub- lishers the choice is hard because the newspaper business has become a big business, and the basis of big business is loot and not laurels . The greatest documentary exposure of the financial cor- ruption of the majority of the newspapers of America is the seventy-two-volume report of the Federal Trade Commission which accuses the National Electric Light Association, the propaganda and bribery department of the public utilities, of poisoning the mind of the entire people through its $25 ; ooo,ooo a year newspaper advertising fund . The N . E. L . A . at its annual conventions boasted that it had \"reached\" four- fifths of the press, but this figure may be slightly exaggerated . They did \"reach\" a majority .

Don't be afraid of the expense . The public pays the expense .\" The head of this organization, which the Federal Trade Commission so thoroughly exposed, was Merlin H . Ayles- worth . When the N .

The Forward was founded in 1897 . In the previous year Daniel de Leon in Chicago split the Socialist and labor move- ment by moving far to the left, whereupon Meyer London, Dr . Isaac Hourwich, Abe Cahan and a few others organized the Social Democratic Party and began publishing the For- ward as a counter attack to De Leon's Arbeiterzeitung . No stocks and bonds were issued . A board of nine man- agers formed the Forward Association of 20o persons. Only members of the Socialist Party can be elected to the govern- ing board when they are approved by a two-third majority of its members . No one can invest in the paper, and there are no dividends . But there is an enormous profit . In good times it runs up to a quarter of a million dollars a year . This money has been used to make the Forward a better paper, to pub- lish a Chicago edition, to help great men in need, and in the distant past to help the labor movement in the United States . In other words it once gave its readers, mostly trade union men, the money it made from advertising and from their sub- scriptions . Mr . Cahan did not remain as editor once the paper was started . He quit in order to write novels, but in 19o2, when the circulation was only 7,000 he was asked to save it from ruin . He called the board together and berated it for filling the paper with polemics, with Marxian dialectics, with nothing but abuse of the capitalists, and with a lot of propaganda .

It is perhaps a job for a psychologist to explain the be- havior pattern of the publisher of America's most important and powerful newspaper, to relate education, environment and upbringing of the man to his confession of liberalism, his delusion in believing that he is producing a great liberal journal, his transcendental failure to do so and his magnifi- cent success materially . As a reporter it is merely my job to try to get at the facts, and the most interesting in my opinion is the fact that the publisher believes in his own liberalism . No liberal in the past or today has ever con- sidered the Times or its owners as fellow travelers . The evi- dence has been against them . A test for not only a liberal press but a free press can be made by an examination of its news on labor . It is not required that a newspaper claiming to be liberal should also be pro-labor, although that exists among magazines, and would not be held against newspapers . When, however, a newspaper slants its news or its headlines or selects news and plays up news which is inimical to labor, it can be said that that newspaper certainly is not liberal ; it may not even be fair . As for Red-baiting, that attitude puts the Hearst stigmata on a newspaper and requires no more condemna- tion . How then shall we judge events of May, 1938, when big business, which the La Follette committee had proven the enemy of labor, and William Allen White had admitted engaged in class warfare with labor, began to demand the revision or repeal of the Wagner Act, the annihilation of the National Labor Relations Board, the outlawing of secondary picketing-and perhaps all picketing-and sit-down strikes, and in short the repeal of all the gains labor had made not only under Roosevelt II but in a century .

A resolution \"tentatively adopted by the Chamber of Commerce\" for an investigation of the National Labor Relations Act made the front page of the Times with a three-line head .

S . MUST STOP VIOLENCE BY UNIONS, SAYS KNUDSEN . The Times the next day (May 6th) again front paged the story LABOR ACT REPEAL ASKED BY CHAMBER which was followed on June 3rd with a front page story ROOSEVELT IS REPORTED PLANNING REVISION OF NATIONAL LABOR ACT . This last story was immediately denied, but all are overplayed anti-labor news items . Meanwhile the Supreme Court had decided several cases in favor of the law . In the Mackay case the court recognized the \"continuity of employment\" while workers are on strike . The Times said editorially that certain provisions of the Wagner Act had been held legal, but \"The country, it seems clear, is coming more and more to recognize that it is the Wagner Act itself, rather than merely its administration by the Labor Board, that is fundamentally in need of change .\" If by the country the Times means its clients and supporters, the editorial is a fact ; if it means five million organized workers, every liberal thinking man, it is talking nonsense . However, it is a tragic fact that the anti-labor press of the country has built up quite a powerful revisionist following even among ignorant workingmen for whose bene- fit the law was made . Nor is this the first instance in which a majority of newspapers has so influenced public opinion that the people have acted against their own good or selfish interests .

And now that labor has taken to picketing advertisers the Times joins with the cheap newspapers in a concerted battle to outlaw this weapon . The Times bias goes over into its letter department .

I have never been able to find an American who ad- mitted himself a Fascist but this is obviously the Fascist mentality and the Fascist method . After all it was \"squadrismo,\" or the violent arm of Mussolini's Fascist Movement, which smashed strikes and picketing and the co-operative movement in Italy, while in the employ of the employers' associations . I am indeed surprised to find so much Fascist mentality in America proclaim- ing itself American . Grant Singleton . New York, November 28, 1937 . The Times had no room for pro-labor letters, but it found room for a story headed \"J . L . Lewis to Move Near White House,\" beginning, \"John L . Lewis will move three blocks nearer to the White House Monday .\" This story, it must be admitted, is a good story in the Hearst style . It means noth- ing . But a Hearst writer could make a sensation out of ru- mors of Lewis' alleged desire for political power, and the Times makes the insinuation . Again, on the occasion of a Lewis broadcast in which he spoke of \"The slaughter of workers paralleling the massacres of Ludlow and Homestead,\" the Times asked editorially why he did not include Herrin . Why should he? The La Follette committee had supplied the evidence (which the doubting Times puts in quotation marks) of massacres of workingmen by police and by company forces . The fact that workmen had once fought among themselves is totally ir- relevant : that was not part of the labor struggle . Anti-labor and Red-baiting go together . The Times is anti-labor, and there is a lot of evidence with which to build up a case of Red-baiting . Here is an example .

One cannot imagine the Democratic Times ever referring to a Republican organiza- tion as engaged in arson .

The fact was that a pyromaniac, a boy named Warren Cramer, confessed setting twenty-four fires for fun . Again the Times (October 14, 1936) had a scoop with a wild tale about hundreds of Communists running wild in the textile district . Commissioner Valentine, who in his time had conducted numerous \"Red\" raids, called the stories \"a lot of bunk .\" The Times kept quiet .

Lindbergh, Sr. It has dropped its Red-baiting campaign against Russia . But it somehow cannot escape fits of Red- baiting . The test will come soon because labor is inevitably going left and business corporations, as well as cheap jack politicians, purposely confuse militant labor with Red ide- ology . One of the tests by which a reader can tell whether the press is not only liberal or conservative, but fair to its cus- tomers, is the manner in which it reports Congressional and Federal trade commission investigations . Throughout our history-and we have only to think back to those of most recent date, notably the Teapot Dome, the Nye Munitions and the La Follette Civil Liberties investiga- tions-these extramural activities by committees of the Sen- ate and the House have unearthed tremendous scandals, the worst corruption, the most flagrant examples of injustice and law breaking, and they have also supplied the press with many of its most prolonged sensations . It would have been natural to suppose that the news- papers, many of which also engage in attacking vice, cor- ruption and law breaking, and all of which protest their aim is to serve the American public by telling it the truthful facts of public life, would have welcomed all Congressional investigations and notably those which supplied the biggest headlines .

The press has not been friendly . Senator Wheeler, during the Black lobby investigation, invited his colleagues not to \"get too excited about what the newspapers say about these investigations and investigating committees,\" suggesting that an examination be made of the cartoons and editorials which were published about Senator Walsh which would show \"that the press of the country was almost unanimously against the committee and strongly denounced my colleague . Yet after the investigation was over and after the situation had been exposed and it was known that Fall had accepted money from Doheny, then the same respectable press which had denounced Senator Walsh during the time the investiga- tion was going on, after the public had been aroused by the exposures made by the committee, all proclaimed Senator Walsh as a great man . \"Likewise in the so-called Daugherty investigation, which I helped to conduct, every paper in the United States, almost without exception-both the old guard Democratic papers and the Old Guard Republican papers-denounced me, de- nounced the investigation, and wrote editorials upholding and supporting Harry M .

Until after the investi- gation got to the point where the papers could not any longer stand it, that continued ; and eventually they were compelled to switch over . \"As a matter of fact, during the investigation the Associ- ated Press would carry what the committee brought out during the hearings, and above that they would carry every night a story as to what Daugherty said, and what his com- ment was upon the committee's hearings .

I know of no big newspaper in America which has so bad and consistent a record in opposing investigations . I cannot imagine why this is so except perhaps the fact that every investigation exposes the corruption of men and organ- izations who represent power and riches and the Times is fundamentally the paper of the people of the same class of society . I have already told in \"Freedom of the Press\" how Mr .

He discussed at length the \"Morgan credits\" and the tie-up with the State Department . Finally he read the famous Page telegram which warned of a great panic because \"the approaching crisis has gone beyond the ability of Morgan\" and urged \"our going to war\" as \"the only way in which our present pre-eminent trade position can be maintained and a panic averted .\" \"And so,\" concluded Senator Nye, \"into the war we went .

This paper had said (February 9, 1936) under the heading \"An Inquiry Ends Well\" that Nye had predicted he would prove inter alia that the Morgan firm \"in order to save its own loans, had used its powerful influence to induce the Washington government to take this country into the struggle against Germany .\" The Times adds : \"The prolonged and searching investigation utterly failed to prove that there was any real foundation for these charges . . . .

Senator Nye elec- trified a large audience by publicly denying the Times state- ments and views . Morgan was not cleared ; there was no whitewash ; there was no jovial note of congratulation but a formal diplomatic handshake, and exactly every item the Times said was not proven had been proven . \"There appeared one day last week,\" said Senator Nye to an audience which applauded him and booed Morgan and the Times, \"in the greatest independent newspaper in the country, the story that our examination of the Morgan part- ners was concluded with a handshaking all around and a general agreement we had wound up by whitewashing the Morgan interest . . . . \"There is not a single member of the Senate committee of inquiry that believes the inquiry has afforded a clean bill of health to the House of Morgan . \"It would not be fair to say that the House of Morgan took us to war to save their investment in the Allies, but the record of facts makes it altogether fair to say that these bankers were in the heart and center of a system that made our going to war inevitable .\" Essentially this was the report of the committee . It found that the House of Morgan held a key position to influence government policy in the first years of the war and while it did not \"drag\" the country in, it helped steer the nation into a position which made its entry inevitable. Two histo- rians who are expert on this subject agree .

Harry Elmer Barnes, who believes that the Communists must have shouted with joyous derision when the Morgan testimony ended, says that the evidence produced by the Nye committee and Baker's latest volume on Wilson \"make it perfectly clear that no single factor was so powerful in bringing the United States into the World War as the bankers' pressure on the government to permit the extension of unlimited credit to the Allies .\" Obviously there is no personal devil . Obviously it is not J . P . Morgan who took America into the war, but something even bigger than Morgan, and that something of course is a combination of big business, finance capital, and the profit motive . Since it is a fact that the Morgan House has no financial interest or any control over the Times it is only fair to infer that it is the Times' general interest in the same ideals which Morgan represents which drove it editorially to the limit of distortion and unfairness in discussing the Nye investigation . Coincident with that event was a series of letters begun by the Morgan partner, Thomas Lamont, which sought to exonerate the bankers . I can state on my own authority that the Times suppressed numerous letters taking issue with Lamont and published over a long period many letters sup- porting him, all of which Morgan republished and dis- tributed . Some of the letters dealt with a matter of historical fact : did or did not Woodrow Wilson in his St . Louis speech in July, 1 g 1 g, admit that \"'this was an industrial and com- mercial war .\" I had first come across this statement in \"Falsehood in Wartime,\" by Lord Ponsonby, and verified it in the columns of the New York Times of September 6, 1g1g, where the story is on the front page and the text on page 2, column 4 .

The solution, however, was not gratifying to those who want to preserve the myth of patriotism about the World War and who are fearful of having economic truth published . On April 8, 1936, the Times made an occasion for again denouncing investigations in general . It said that \"in the long run the abuse of powers of investigation carries pre- cisely as great risk for the `radical' or the `liberal' as for the `reactionary' or the `conservative .' Today it is the `power trust' or the `bankers' lobby' that faces an investigating committee which makes its own rules and intimidates its witnesses . Tomorrow it may be a Socialist newspaper or a strike committee .\" The investigation of the power trust, it so happens, brought out the evidence of the $25,000,000-a-year bribe fund to corrupt the American press .

But I would not accuse the Times of venality . Neither would I say that it is just a dozen coincidences that in a dozen cases the same paper has been defending men and corporations who are the outstanding symbols of the big business system, and who are almost always guilty of unsocial acts . Surely it is no exaggeration to say that the Times policy in all these instances has been that of a reactionary paper . The liberal press, notably the New Republic and . Nation, have in all these instances accused the Times of unfairness . I bring this matter to the attention of Mr . Sulzberger as ref- utation to his claim, made to me personally, that the Times is a liberal newspaper . It is not . It is a reactionary newspaper . Moreover, it is at times even worse than reactionary . At times it is obscurantist . Mr . Sulzberger repeats Mr . Ochs' statement that the press is not venal . The point need not be argued so far as it affects the Times . The Times is not venal . It does not sup- press news at the request of advertisers, it does not violate the ethics of journalism for pay, and it frequently prints news which both advertisers in the Times and the wealthy class with which the Times is associated would have pre- ferred to have suppressed . How then account for the following facts-for the few examples which I quote out of a dossier of several hundred, all gathered since 1935 when the Times was criticized in \"Freedom of the Press\"? On the morning of November 25, 1937, readers who bought both the soi-disant Democratic Times and the Re- publican Herald Tribune found these items Herald Tribune : \t Times : CHRYSLER CUTS \t Chrysler Cuts Work .

The Times story was a single-line head, followed by three or four inches of news, and completely buried alive on page 32, bottom . If the Herald Tribune can be accused of overplaying the story because of its hatred for the administration, the Times on the other hand can justly be accused of semi-suppression of an important news item . Whether this was done out of friendship for the administration or respect to a big adver- tiser we do not know . But the episode is typical . Continuing the comparison of the \"liberal\" Times and the tory Herald Tribune, here are two more startling instances . One concerns the arrest and imprisonment of Heywood Broun, president of the Newspaper Guild, during a strike in Milwaukee . Both papers carry the same Associated Press report . But the Times did not have courage to include this paragraph : \"Anyone who thinks we have a free press is not a wise news- paper reader,\" he (Broun) said . \"Newspapers are the first line of defense of entrenched capital and William Randolph Hearst is the epitome, the symbol of entrenched greed in the United States .\" Of course this statement may have been cut for lack of space l In reporting the suicide of George C . Hanson, famed American diplomatic \"trouble-shooter\" and former consul general in Moscow, the Times had about twice as much room as the Herald Tribune to reprint Hanson's last letter, first published in the Bridgeport Times-Star in which \"he accused New York bankers of meddling in State Department affairs for their own advantage .\" But the Times suppressed the name of the bank ."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Times : The sources and motivation of these charges I can only con- clude are not disinterested .

I would hesitate to believe that the Chase National Bank is attempting to interfere with American government appoint- ments . . . . May Day is always a difficult time for the Times . On that day rather than Labor Day organized labor generally marches in New York City, and the left wing elements of labor usu- ally predominate . In 1936 the Times reported 40,000 MARCH HERE IN MAY DAY PARADE, QUIETEST IN YEARS, whereas the Post, favorable to labor, reported that between 200,000 and 250,000 marched . May Day 1938 was even worse for the New York Times . Mr . Ernest Meyer of the Post suggested that the tabulators should have gotten together on this because the results were : Times, 50,000 ; Sunday News, over Ioo,ooo ; Herald Tribune, between 50,000 and ioo,ooo, and the Communist Daily Worker a triumphant 200,000 . Mr . Meyer said that the matter was of no tremendous significance because \"Among papers of such various shades of political slant, one cannot expect a united front of adding machines .\" In December, 1937, the Federated Press, the Guild Re- porter and the New York Post joined in accusing the Times of suppressing that part of the speech by Marriner S . Eccles, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, in which he ex- pressed opposition to the repeal of the undistributed profits and capital gains taxes, two things which both Mr . Sulz- berger and the Times editorial policy are bitterly decided upon . It is interesting to note that both the Associated Press and the United Press placed Eccles' remarks on profits and gains first but the Times leading paragraph said : \"Labor"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"134 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS and industry were warned today . . . that restrictive practices raising cost . . . were responsible for the present decline . . . .\" It is also interesting to note that other newspapers opposed to the administration and the taxes carried fair headlines . Here are some examples compared to the Times : Baltimore Sun : Eccles Urges Retention of Profit Tax Principle . Washington Post : Save Principle of Profits Tax, Eccles Pleads . New York Times : Eccles Urges Cut in Building Costs . (1) In all primary voting and elections since the labor move- ment began to enter politics the Times has also had con- siderable difficulty in reporting the facts and commenting on them fairly . In Pennsylvania in May, 1938, for instance, the headlines and editorials of the bluestocking Times and yellow Hearst sheets were almost identical . Apparently their anti-C . I . 0 . policies do coincide . But comparing the Times with the pro-administration Post it is obvious that one of the two is far from being fair or accurate . The Times headline was : PENNSYLVANIA RESULTS BLOW TO NEW DEAL AND ITS CHIEFS ; REPUBLICANS SEE NEW HOPE Lewis Prestige Hit . and editorially the Times said : \"Another C . I . 0 . campaign has come a cropper . . . . The attempt to use industrial union- ism as a means of acquiring political power has failed inglo- riously . Mr . Lewis has been rebuffed by the Democratic voters . . . his candidates ran behind even in some of the coal-mining districts . . . .\" The Post, denouncing the \"pitiful efforts of the tory press to find a New Deal defeat in the Pennsylvania election,\" put forth these claims :"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"THE AMERICAN THUNDERER \t 135 The New Deal gained ground : . . . no vestige of a new Deal reverse can be found . . . .

(Other unions did not support C . I . 0 .) The New York Daily News has already exposed the Times \"Opinion of the Press\" department for failure to print the News editorials after asking for them repeatedly . A similar charge against the Times could be made regarding its letter department . It is not conducted fairly . I have mentioned this fact to Mr . Sulzberger and found he is under the impres- sion that there is no gerrymandering going on in those columns, but from personal experience as well as the reports of numerous persons I can produce considerable evidence that the same sort of editing, of selection and of suppression, goes on in this harmless (?) field as elsewhere . Needless to say the majority of letters published are innocuous, favorable to the policies of the Times, or generally reactionary . Liberal letter writers have the utmost difficulty in crashing the Times . Is Mr . Sulzberger aware of the fact that Malcolm Cowley, of the New Republic ; John Langdon-Davies, the noted British writer ; Lillian Hellman, James Waterman Wise, Richard Watts, Jr ., of the Herald Tribune ; H . V . Kaltenborn, and others have been refused permission to answer Ellery Sedgwick in the letter columns of the Times? Then there is the matter of delay . The Times news columns called the International Labor Defense \"a Communist left- wing organization .\" Its head, former Congressman Vito Marcantonio, immediately wrote to say : \"This statement is incorrect . The I . L. D . is not affiliated with any political"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"136 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS party nor does it inquire into the political affiliations of any of its (300,000) members . . . .\" Ethically this statement should have been given the same space and place as the original story . It certainly should have been published the next morning . But the Times letter editor kept it seven days until its timeliness was over . Under Mr . Ochs the Times valiantly defended the Amer- ican oil interests and attacked the liberal-labor reformist anti-dictatorial regime of Carranza, Obregon and Calles . It did not demand invasion and annexation, as the Chicago Tribune did, but it upheld the dollar sign just as vigorously . Mr . Ochs probably did not know that one of his correspond- ents in Mexico City was accused by the Mexican government of telegraphing biased anti-Mexican news because he had been refused an oil concession . In 1927 Mr . Charles Merz, who had collaborated with Walter Lippmann seven years earlier in exposing the per- verted news and downright lies about the Russian Soviets in their first three years, made a survey of the news from Mex- ico . He showed that the Times story, \"Spread of Disorders Alarms Mexico,\" was nothing but a murder and two holdups in three days, a record far below Chicago's . When the oil laws were put into effect the Times headline was \"Mexico Is Pictured on Brink of Revolt .\" January 24, 1927, the Times had a story of a big effort to overthrow the regime which was nothing but a statement from Adolfo de La Huerta who was in exile in the United States . On March 31, 1938, under the liberal Sulzberger regime, I find this story : PEOPLE OF MEXICO HELD MISLED ON OIL . The Cardenas government had finally put into effect the constitutional rights of 1917, which Calles made a bluff of enforcing in 1927 . British and American oil interests whose holdings had been proven ninety percent usurpations, and who were now legally dispossessed, were attempting to use the Foreign Office and the State Department and to threaten with armies and navies if their private property was harmed ."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"THE AMERICAN THUNDERER 137 It was the old story of private property vs . human rights and as usual all the material interests, including of course the press, were aligned against human interests . Fortunately, however, the Roosevelt administration is not playing the game of the British foreign office as regards Mexico . But the Times is still anti-Mexican . Under the headline quoted which does not say who \"holds\" the Mexican people \"misled on oil,\" the Times news columns after stating that there is a censorship and that the people do not know the facts adds that \"This is the con- clusion reached by oil companies here yesterday .\" There is no further indication of what oil companies or what officials . The story remains anonymous . It is moreover tendentious and purely propagandistic, as any members of the Institute for Propaganda Analysis at Columbia University can testify . It ranks with Hearst's anti-Mexican tainted news . The Guild Reporter calls attention of all American news- papermen to the fact that the Times headline HIGH COURT PASSES CLOSED SHOP ISSUE on March 1, 1938, was absolutely correct and that in a late edition this head was changed to TRANSIT WORKERS LOSE IN HIGH COURT which (says the Re- porter) \"created a false impression .\" Dorothy Dunbar Bromley tells the story of the Keep Amer- ica Out of War congress of i,ooo delegates in Washington at which American diplomatic intrigue with British tories was incidentally exposed . The Associated Press sent out the news . The Times is of course pledged to Anglo-American friend- ship .* It failed to mention the event for three days . The Herald Tribune did publish a story following cabled requests from noted participants . The Times also likes to minimize scholastic peace move- ments . Its April 26, 1936, editorial said that the anti-war dem- onstrations that year \"were not so large and impressive as had been predicted,\" whereas the facts announced later • \t But it is not connected with British interests, as is frequently charged ."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"138 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS showed that 500,000 had participated, or double the number of 1935 and considerably more than predicted by student organizers . For a final example of the handling, or rather mishan- dling, of news here is the instance of a famous speech by Senator Borah . Credit must be given the Times for publish- ing Borah's statement that \"the most revolting instance of mass murder in all history\" was that committed by the Cath- olic General Franco who sent his aviators to kill innocent women and children in Guernica . \"Guernica,\" he added, \"was not a single instance, it was simply a culmination of a long line of unspeakable atrocities\" by the Spanish Clerico- Fascists and their German and Italian fellow -murderers . Credit must also be given the Times for publishing that part of Senator Borah's statement in which he avers that the advo- cates of Fascism are insidious, subtle and powerful+in Amer- ica ; that Fascism \"has far more supporters in this -country than Communism and they are much more active and much more adroit,\" but the fact still remains that the Herald Trib- une published the following paragraph and the Times did not . It read : The centralization of wealth and the centralization of political power go hand in hand to form the basis for Fascism . Here, in other words, was an instance where the'tremen- dous pressure being put forth by the American Catholic hierarchy to suppress all news unfavorable to Franco, whom even the Pope himself has rebuked for his massacres, has failed to operate, whereas \"wealth\" and \"power\" which have no official or organized pressure group working in the Times office, but which nevertheless pervade the very air, were effective in editing the news .

It represents an in- vestment of millions, a gross income of between twenty and thirty million dollars a year, and a net profit,of several mil-"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"THE AMERICAN THUNDERER \t 139 lions a year . But that fact is not as important as the fact that in addition to being a big business organization it is the organ of big business . To be liberal a newspaper need not be the enemy of big business but it must at least be free to criticize . The Times has never attempted that . It takes the part of attorney for big business . Whatever laws are the enemies of big business are the ene- mies of the Times ; whatever actions are favorable to big busi- ness receive the applause of the Times . It opposes every Congressional -investigation . It opposes the laws which the American Federation of Labor and the Committee for Indus- trial Organization favor, and when the Chamber of Com- merce and the National Association of Manufacturers express a wish the Times turns a somersault . Can all these things be coincidences? Every employee in every department knows that the Times is the organ of big business . When the editor of the letters department destroys ninety-nine percent of the letters favor- ing picketing and fills his column with letters ninety-nine percent of which oppose picketing he is not doing so under instructions from Mr . Sulzberger or Colonel Adler . He is doing so because he is a smart man and knows where the capi- talistic butter is churned . Very rarely is the bias flagrant . The lay reader may not notice it at all . The Times for example can give nice space to Tom Girdler, one of labor's chief enemies (\"Girdler Says Foes of Capitalism Err\"-June 5, 1938), and no space to more important minds . The Times has tried to explain away its failure to publish the news of the impending failure of the Bank of United States but it had nothing to say when \"Guy Fawkes\" in the New Yorker caught it protecting the successor to Charles E . Mitchell at the National City Bank by mis- quoting him .

In concluding my criticism of the New York Times in \"Freedom of the Press,\" I said that : \"A wonderful opportu- nity presents itself to Messrs . Arthur Hays Sulzberger and Julius Ochs Adler whose names now grace the masthead of the Times : if they have the character and courage and an en- lightened intelligence they can easily surpass their predeces- sor . They must not, as so many Times men do, merely wor- ship at the shrine of Adolph Ochs . Ochs did many things to make the Times the most important paper in, America, and that is no mean accomplishment ; but there are still vast im- provements to be made, not so much in quality of news but under the headings of the Canons of Journalism : Sincerity, Truthfulness, Impartiality, Fair Play . I hope to see the Times some day as great as it is important .\" I think that the Times today is a greater and more influen- tial newspaper than it was under Ochs . One reason for its advancement is the retreat of many other great newspapers . The number of journals which want to be great, instead of great money makers, grows fewer every day . The pressures increase . Fear increases . Political activity of publishers in- creases . The free and independent journals decrease . The Times, despite all its faults,, grows more powerful because while it is not the liberal leader its owners say it is, it is not retreating with the majority of rich newspapers .

Dewart's name is rarely seen in his or anyone else's newspaper . He is an avoider of publicity . He has no political ambitions, does not want to rule anyone nor enjoy secret power behind the scenes . He is content to make money . On one occasion, however, Dewart was very much in the news . He was recently listed among the numerous multi- millionaires in America accused by a Senate committee of setting up holding companies for the purpose of avoiding taxation . (It was surprising how many administration-hating tax-hating newspaper owners there were in that list .) Dewart replied with a front-page statement in his own 142"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"THE \"SUN\" GROWS COLD \t 143 paper which was not without prejudice . It stated that the Sun was incorporated in Albany in 1926 with 30,000 shares of preferred (or A) stock and 20,000 second preferred (or B) stock, par value $1 oo a share and 1 oo,ooo shares of common . Dewart had bought the paper from the Metropolitan Museum of Art to whom the arch newspaper wrecker Frank Munsey had willed it . Employees of the Sun were permitted to buy preferred stock at eight percent, and 350 now own some . The second preferred and common stock have never paid dividends . \"The facts,\" concludes the Dewart statement, \"are repeated here so simply that anybody with a greater intellec- tual capacity than a Mongolian idiot can understand them . Even a treasury expert should grasp the truth about The New York Sun Inc . . . .\" Three days later Under Secretary of the Treasury Roswell Magill informed the Congressional Tax Avoidance Investi- gating Committee that tax experts were \"absolutely correct\" in listing the New York Sun Inc . as a personal holding company . (He made the same statement about Consolidated Publishers, Inc ., a Paul Block company .) \"We of course can- not tell what the motives of the owners were in organizing these companies,\" Magill said, \"we know only what the re- sult was : substantial savings on taxes .\" Besides the Dewarts-William T ., William T ., Jr ., and Thomas W .-the following persons own one percent of the Sun stock or more : Frank M . O'Brien, editor ; Keats Speed, managing editor ; Edwin S . Friendly, business manager ; Franz Schneider, Jr ., Gilbert T . Hodges, Herbert B . Fair- child, Edwin A . Sutphin, and Robert H . Davis . The C . W . H . Corporation owns all of the stock owned by all the pre- viously mentioned Dewarts plus Mary W . and Mary De- wart .

He states that \"The Sun execu- tives are understood to have obtained the money to buy the"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"144 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS paper for a reputed $11,000,000 in the form of a loan, a large part of which is still said to be outstanding, from the Guaranty Trust Company .

P . Morgan list of privileged characters who could buy Morgan offerings cheaply . He bought iooo shares of Morgan's Standard Brands and many other stocks while financial editor of the Sun, enough to make a profit of almost $6o,ooo . The Sun, says Lundberg, is regarded as a Morgan house organ . No one in Wall Street disputes that charge . In appearance the Sun is the . most conservative newspaper in the metropolis . But this sobriety of type, this restraint with headlines, does not mean that Dewart cannot beat Hearst at his own game . For example, the well-known chain tax hoax of the 1936 Presidential campaign . It was during the Republican propaganda attack in which regimentation and dictatorship were charged to the Democrats that John D . M . Hamilton accused the Social Security Board-which by the way had been sponsored by both parties-with plan- ning to tag and chain every workingman and woman in America . There was no truth to the story of course . But the photographs of men wearing chains and license tags with numbers, one of the greatest newspaper hoaxes in history, is generally discredited to Hearst, whereas the Sun was equally if not more guilty . In fact the Nation charges the Sun with first publication . Its November 2 issue had as head- line \"New Deal Will Tag Workers .\" The Sun used two photographs, one of the metal tag itself and one showing a tagged worker . The difference between the Sun and numer- ous corrupt newspapers which used the photographs was that the Sun used probability in its captions, the yellow press used certainty . The Sun said : \"Such a tag has been prepared"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"THE \"SUN\" GROWS COLD \t 1 45 and submitted to the Social Security Board for approval,\" the totally corrupt press inferred the tag was already ap- proved . Throughout the campaign the Sun ran a \"`boondoggling\" department . It chose an activity of the New Deal daily for attack or derision . It ridiculed the expenditure of ten thou- sand dollars for a dam at Boulder, Colorado, because it would take a tidal wave more than a mile high to reach the town . An investigation showed that raging floods had men- aced the town every spring . It ridiculed the expenditure of money to renovate reference books in libraries . It sneered at every public welfare undertaking . Two years later an impartial survey of work from land reclamation and power plant construction to sewerage systems installation-not to mention the salvation of human material in the CCC, PWA and WPA-testified to the magnificent achievements of the Sun's boondoggling . Probably the nadir of the ridiculous was reached by the conservative Sun in a story which indignantly told how one man tried to pull a Landon, sunflower button off another's lapel . A big head and almost a column textl That was not yellow journalism, Hearst style, but something new in blue- stocking sensationalism . The Sun also accepted a paid advertisement from a cock- eyed cartoonist named Percy Crosby who stated that \"a vote for Roosevelt in 1936 is a vote for bloodshed in 1937\" ; who called the President the keeper of a \"Washington reptile house\" ; and who concluded : \"The time may come when de- fense is imminent ; that time when we must fight for our very homes . If such time comes . . . then it would seem that the best philosophy under such a condition would be : NEVER WOUND A SNAKE, BUT KILL IT .\" For printing this adver- tisement the Sun was paid $3,200 . The Wall Street bankers and brokers commuting to Mont- clair, New Jersey, and Bronxville, New York, read the Sun almost exclusively . I have traveled in coaches where ninety"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"1 46 LORDS OF THE PRESS percent of the passengers were of this type and a large part of the conversation was wish-fulfillment. I have heard bankers openly advocating the assassination of the President . Such hatred, publicly expressed, such bloodthirstiness, I have never heard in the trenches . Perhaps a mob of Southern gentlemen intent on lynching speak that way when they are drunk and hysterical . But these men are the aristocrats of America-at least the commercial aristocrats . They are mem- bers of the same class whom Heywood Broun describes as listening to one of Roosevelt's fireside chats and using language which he could not reprint in his daily column . In the letter columns of the Sun one can find some of this obscurantism and hatred . There the men who sit at radios and curse the administration of our nation can voice their opinions, provided of course they do not violate the law . They must restrain themselves . So every day with almost no exceptions there are letters abusing Roosevelt, Wallace, Ickes, Hopkins, and all the New Dealers in every printable term . If, as a test, a reader should every day for a month-as a journalism student has done-send in a letter in praise of a New Deal action, he will find that none will be printed . In the Sun the reader will find a letter saying that \"labor is tired of strife caused by the one-sided Wagner Act .\" Labor, in other words, is tired of the Magna Carta of labor . In the Sun letters defend Mayor Hague of Jersey City . Just before the Supreme Court declared leaflet distribution part of the freedom of the press, one John Eoghan Kelly wrote a letter to the Sun defending the forceful deportation of \"outsiders\" who had come to the Jersey town \"interfering with legiti- mate business .\" Efforts at unionization become \"Commu- nistic intrusion,\" and labor becomes \"Reds .\" The demand for civil rights is called \"simian chatter\" in a three-quarter- column letter in the Sun which says free speech is not denied in Jersey City because C .

A letter protesting that leaflets have the same rights as copies of the Sun was not printed . If you bait the Reds you make the Sun letter columns ; if you uphold the Constitution and the Supreme Court in favor of a baited minority, you do not . Where Hearst is vulgar, the Sun is bluestocking in its Red- baiting . Like Hearst, Dewart is for the Fascists in Spain . The Sun headlines and the Hearst headlines speak of the Loyalists as \"Reds,\" whereas no newspaper in the world which can make any claim to journalistic ethics has ever done so . The Sun reporters are stockholders . They share the anti- labor bias of their bosses . The Newspaper Guild has made no headway in their reactionary stronghold . In its place there is the Sun Editorial Employees Union, a makeshift organized when the Wagner Act made 'a company union illegal . Numerous concessions were made by Dewart-but Sun employees refuse to recognize that it was the Guild's suc- cess as a powerful national body which forced the conces- sions . However, Dewart, thanks to this union and the stock- holding feature, has succeeded in isolating his men . No sound of the march of progress can enter the ivory towers on which the sun never sets . Generally speaking it may be said with fairness that the Sun is the leading anti-labor newspaper in the East . In the West the Los Angeles Times had an established law to pub- lish all news inimical to labor and to labor unions and to suppress all news favorable to unions or to the liberal-labor movement . Under General Otis it was without doubt the most perverted big newspaper in America . On the Sun there is no general order to blacken labor but any reading of headlines and stories will show that of all the New York newspapers the Sun is most consistently inimical in every way . If, for example, there is a dispute among the taxi drivers and acid is thrown, the Sun headline does not accuse a rival union or a non-union man, but it accuses labor. \"Labor"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"1 4 8 LORDS OF THE PRESS Vandals Attack 41 Cabs\" reads the two-column front-page heading on a relatively unimportant item in the May 6, 1938, issue . \"Labor Vandals Deface House\" reads an item in the November 22, 1937, issue . The juxtaposition of labor and vandalism creates more than an implication . In truth there is no justification in the stories themselves for the headlines . Vandalism has been committed . In no in- stance are the vandals known, and the reporters who wrote the stories, although unfriendly, are not faking . In the first instance the victim is the Allied Taxicab System, but only the headline suggests who the aggressor is . When on the following day Eugene Connolly, director of the Transport Workers Union, taxicab division, protested the Sun's head- line and stated that \"anti-union fleet operators have in the past resorted to such tactics (acid throwing) in an attempt to turn public sentiment against the union but in this instance the acid thrown may well have been committed by racketeers trying to muscle in to convince operators they need gangster protection,\" the Sun did not publish the story . In the case of the house defaced by twelve splotches of red aniline dye the Sun told sympathetically the story of a Doctor Welton who claimed he treated the poor free and was hurt by the fact anyone should attack his non-union, picketed, $20,000 redecorating job . An even better example of colored, half-true, prejudiced, tendentious and propaganda news was the Sun coverage of the Seattle labor situation in 1936 . The employees of the Hearst Post-Intelligencer had walked out for good cause and the paper suspended peacefully . There was no violence . Everyone knew that if violence could be provoked it would help Hearst . But the New York Sun actually published a news item which was an approval of planned violence .

In this same dispatch it is reported that a new daily paper is planned in the Northwest . Liberal and progressive forces were behind it . But the Sun, without any evidence, begins by calling the proposed rival to Hearst \"a Communist- affiliated newspaper,\" proceeds to \"the projected radical Communist organ\" which is an untruth and concludes with \"the new Communist daily,\" which is a falsehood . In its summary of the situation on October loth the Sun headline said, \"The Forces of Law Still Abet New Deal Rack- eteers,\" and the story opened with a remark about \"New Deal labor racketeering forces .\" The writer, Guy W . Beardsley, then attempts to link the New Deal with Communists, then predicts that \"This is Republican weather along the Pacific coast\" and quotes a professional straw vote proving \"that there is a decided swing to Landon\" and gives his own opin- ion that \"Hearst made many Republican votes throughout the state the day the New Deal racketeers closed his news- paper and every day it stays closed Republican prospects throughout the state get brighter .\" The election proved the whole Sun story ridiculous .

This was untrue because it was a physi- cal impossibility . As Heywood Broun reported, the \"hall was filled, but 15,000 persons would be a fair estimate as to its capacity .\" The Sun always slants the news in favor of the most reactionary mayor of the country . The item headed \"U . S . Committed to Open Shop Labor Policy\" is a phony . The United States is not committed to an open shop labor policy . The other two items are typical cases of the Sun using any and all items as whips against labor and especially against the C . I . O . Never friendly to the American Federation of Labor, the Sun now employs their reactionary leaders whenever it can to abuse the more pro- gressive union . How far prejudice and unfairness can be carried were illustrated when the Sun took a full page advertisement in the Daily News to advertise a story headlined THE MOST HORRIFYING MURDERS OF THE CENTURY IN AMERICA which turned out to be an account of a fight between miners in a labor war of fifteen years ago . It was known as the Herrin massacre . The purpose of the Sun rehash of stale news was merely to harm John L . Lewis who is head of the miners' union . The Sun is so rabidly anti-labor that it goes in for crusad- ing .

It exposes, for example (issue of November 17, 1937), the fact that \"labor reaps its first fruits since election of La Guardia .\" In this story it is said that the estimates of a tunnel contract exceed the original by $7,000,000 ; \"that sum represents the first fruits plucked by labor\" due to an in- creased wage scale . The Sun claims the wage scale will be higher than elsewhere and \"because of the labor costs the tunnel will stand the city's taxpayers approximately thirty percent more than had been anticipated .\" It will cost those taxpayers who have found no way of dodging taxes . In the issue of April 18, 1938, the Sun boasts of the firing of a Negro C .

In establishing \"The Voice of Business\" edition, Dewart declared that \"Many of us have been led to believe that serious and constructive journalism is losing ground, that playing up the frivolities and foibles of humanity is the formula of the day . Well, here is the answer, written in a manner to give heart to the newspapermen of America . . . . It is a lesson which should not be lost on those who would worship the false gods of journalism .\" The special edition runs to about 150 pages and is a magnificent advertising scheme because it gives steel corpora- tions, cannon makers, bridge builders and great utilities which have nothing to sell direct to the public a chance to spend money in what is known as \"good-will advertising .\" Who can tell whether it earns the good will of the public? But it certainly does of the publisher .

The eminent philosopher continues : \"You and I know from actual experience that nine out of ten of the poor, among whom we were reared in this city, remained so because of their refusal to accept their oppor- tunities and because of their own vices .

It does not, like the majority of newspapers, pretend to be the friend of the common peo- ple, the upholder of the rights of the workingman, the de- fender of civil liberties and American democracy . The Sun is the organ of Wall Street, and in Wall Street money rights stand above human rights . Such honesty is amazing in this journalistic transition era, this third stage of newspaper history in America, where busi- ness rather than traditional idealism has become the end as well as the means . Being the voice of business the Sun naturally adopts the policy of business . Business today is openly anti-reform, anti- administration, anti-labor, anti-Wagner Act, anti-union (espe- cially the militant unions), anti-co-operatives and generally anti-social . There is no press law, no moral obligation or established custom by which a conservative newspaper becomes a tory newspaper, a tory becomes reactionary, and a reactionary be- comes mean, intolerant, prejudiced, so that all its actions are biased and unfair and its achievements the perversion of men's minds, but in actual practice that is usually the case in every nation in the world . Even the great conservative London Times has on many occasions been caught slanting and coloring the news, while lately its conservatism has led it right up to Hitler's back door where it has joined with the conservative British \"statesmen\" in licking the boots of Fascism. The Sun would not feel uncomfortable if the Hague style of Fascism were to cross over from New Jersey . In newspaper circles the Sun is regarded as a tragedy . It was once the journalists' journal . The impress of Dana, the publisher who said,, \"What the good Lord lets happen I am not ashamed to print,\" prevailed for a long time, even under Munsey the Wrecker .

DAVID STERN is one of a tiny minority of owners in America who really wants to publish a free newspaper . From bitter costly experiments he has learned what most of his colleagues have not even been interested in, namely, that freedom is quite impossible . But he is a very reasonable and realistic human being, and he has frequently said that he intends to publish as free a newspaper as possible, without going into the red . \"Lusty\" Scripps said and did the same thing. But that was a generation ago when liberalism still paid dividends . Mr . Stern knows just who the enemies of his dream are . He knows that to run a free newspaper it is necessary to pub- lish news which advertisers will not like . He is a strong be- liever in strong editorials, and an editorial stand on almost any question outside the viciousness of the man-eating shark and the Bengal tiger means antagonism from pressure groups, advertising agencies, big business, and the great gods of finance . Mr . Stern has therefore faced the choice of publishing as liberal and free a newspaper as possible, with the necessary compromises, thereby breaking even or making money, and publishing a completely free newspaper for a short time and having to go out of business because of a sit-down strike of advertisers, finance and big business in general . A completely free newspaper, for example, might compare the Ford, Chevrolet and Plymouth cars, just as Consumers Union does, and as a result lose two-thirds of its automobile 155"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"156 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS advertising ; or it might publish a scientific report on poison in cigarettes and lose all its tobacco advertising; or it might investigate wages in department stores, and lose so much ad- vertising that it would have to suspend even if it had a mil- lion dollars behind it and a million readers . Such things are out. No newspaper in America will ever compare automobiles from the consumers' viewpoint, and the Christian Science Monitor is probably the only metropolitan daily which will tell the truth about tobacco . And department stores, the main source of city advertising, are the most sacred of sacred cows in journalism . On one occasion, however, Mr . Stern has even lassoed and thrown that animal-and incidentally shown up the suppres- sion of news by the Philadelphia Evening Bulle,tin .and the Philadelphia Inquirer .* The employees of Gimbels, Straw- bridge & Clothier, Lit Brothers, Snellenburgs and Frank & Seder had gone out on strike just when the five stores were gaudy for the Thanksgiving and Christmas trade . Union rec- ognition, better working conditions, and more wages were demanded, one of the pickets' placards announcing that .sales- men cannot live on $12 a week . Trucks were overturned, de- liveries were stopped, hundreds of customers refused to enter the struck stores and went to Wanamakers, and a million dollars' worth of business was lost . One official c alled .i t a \"miniature revolution,\" but revolution or no, it was a front- page news story if ever there was one . To those defenders of the American press who claim that department store advertising no longer influences newspapers I present the fact that Stern's Philadelphia Record was the only paper which for a week refused to suppress the news of this strike . Stern has consistently tried to publish all the news and also to crusade in the public's behalf .

He immediately began exposing the corrupt political boss . The town sat up . Corrupt New Jersey politics sat up, too . Attempts were made to buy Stern off, but he continued his campaign . \"I wouldn't sell for all the money in the world,\" he said . But he sold the paper for $25,000 and was thereby enabled to buy a bigger paper in a bigger town and start bigger crusades . In 192o he got the Camden Courier . Camden had been in the hands of a corrupt political machine for twenty years, a machine so corrupt and entrenched that it had passed through the great muckraking era which began with the century and which Lincoln Steffens fathered . The best citizens of Cam- den were among the crooks . When Stern entered the Camden Club he says that \"everybody stopped talking because they had all been cursing me .\" He hired expert municipal accountants . He found that \"Camden had the lowest per capita expenditure for the health service of any similar city in the East . . . and the high- est infant mortality rate, the lowest allowance for visiting nurses and health work, with hundreds of thousands of dol- lars spent wasted on political drones .\" He spent from Christ- mas night to New Year's Eve making a drama out of the statis- tics . The result was sensational . \"It took me three years to go from Public Enemy No . 1 to chief champion of the people of Camden,\" Stern says of his experience . In December, 1933, he took over the apparently moribund New York Evening Post . He said to his staff : \"I want to run a newspaperman's newspaper . If you like it the public will like it . . . . \"I am for the Newspaper Guild . I am for controlled credit inflation .\" It is said he paid $300,000 .

This is the system the publishers"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"158 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS used in Pittsburgh to reduce rivalry, and it is the system being employed in more and more cities . And when Stern outmaneuvered them, the evening paper publishers, who had a \"co-operative\" trucking system for paper delivery, served notice on Stern that the Post would be dropped . This meant a raise in the cost of suburban distribution of 400 percent . This was the salute which the great \"co-operative\" publishers of the great metropolis gave their colleague . Just before entering New York, Mr . Stern wrote a defense of the editorial page in which he pointed out the fact that the 1929 depression had awakened the people, that they were \"hungry for courageous analysis and definite guidance .\" He continued : \"The sad truth is that many newspapers have not shown courage in serving sincerely and intelligently this new army of serious readers because of wholly imaginary inhibitions- because of a fear of offending that was wholly unwarranted . The average newspaper is twice as free as it ever dares to be . \"I have been a newspaper publisher for twenty-five years, and have owned six newspapers in various parts of the coun- try . I have never been approached with an offer of money for editorial support, nor has any banker to whom I owed money ever attempted a squeeze play . I am in the humiliating posi- tion of the woman who was insulted because she had not been insulted . \"Too many newspapers suffer from the fear complex . They are not only afraid to offend important interests, but they are afraid of writing over the heads of their readers . They `edit down .' \"I have found that it is impossible to write over the heads of the readers, if the writing is sincere, and in simple lan- guage . . . . \"Not half a dozen papers in the country make a practice of running daring editorials on the front page, where such editorials rightly belong .\" In 1935, when the Post was attracting the support of all"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"STERN'S FIGHT FOR LIBERALISM \t 159 liberal and intelligent elements, Mr .

You can't fool the public any more than you can fool the children at home . . . . \"Sooner or later an editor who is insincere reveals himself, and the public senses that insincerity with an intuition as quick and uncanny as that of a child .\" (But it took the public forty-five years to begin the boycott of the Hearst press .)

A ., on the advice of attorney Hanson, had de- clared the law unconstitutional, Mr . Stern denounced this action . He realizes what all newspaper owners know, that the press is a great force, for good or evil, for reaction or progress .

It was at a time this paper was running a Red scare, and linking the administration with Reds . The Tribune man asked Stern to explain . Stern re- plied : \"You tell Bertie (McCormick) that he is seeing things under the bed . . . . Lip service from autocratic steel barons and Red-baiting publishers is no honor to Zenger .\" McCormick, who is the head of the freedom of the press committee of the A . N . P .

Said the Chicago Tribune : \"A Federal judge has issued an injunction to restrain Mayor Frank Hague and his Jersey City police from stop- ping the display of the New York Post on Jersey City news- stands . Perhaps some of our readers expect us to sound off about the gallantry of the little New York newspaper in de- fending the freedom of the press against a rapacious politi- cian . If so they are going to be disappointed .\" The reason? Because the Post supported the Roosevelt administration at the time the publishers were trying to write a code, \"the most dishonest, weasel-worded and treacherous document\" ever offered to General Johnson . Stern replied editorially that the publishers' code \"had no more to do with freedom of the press than the State laws regulating the hours of women workers, fire laws calling for adequate staircases and traffics laws compelling newspaper trucks, like all others, to stay on the right side of the street .\" But, he asked, \"did American publishers join in the great effort that most of business was making?

The series was occasioned by a letter from E . K . Merat, of the Advanced School of Education of Columbia University . Mr . Merat is a Persian but his interest in truth in the news exceeds that of at least ninety-nine percent of the American people. Mr . Merat asked the entire New York press whether news is separate from opinion ; if the papers permit their editorial policy to affect their news policy ; if they allow editorial sentiments and opinions to influence the news and the presentation of news in the news columns, or whether the two policies are kept separate . The New York Times, World-Telegram and Daily Worker replied, but Mr . Merat considered their answers confidential . The New York Herald Tribune, Sun, Daily News and Jour- nal & American did not reply . The Post was the only paper to publish the correspondence . Said the chief Stern organ : \"We don't know who has been handing you this line about `the theory of American journalism that news is separate from opinion,' but we'll bet it wasn't a working newspaper man . . . .

And Item 4 wasn't in the paper .\" But still more important is the Post investigation of what happens in the Republican, tory and self-styled liberal press of New York City when there is a news story extremely at variance with the general anti-New Deal policies of the press . For years the papers have published the released sum- maries sent them by Fortune, the big business magazine . At the end of May, 1938, after five years of pounding by the press, it was found that the popularity of the President was holding firm, \"that the chances of any important number of Mr . Roosevelt's men will be defeated in the primaries this year are very thin,\" that 54 .7 percent of the people back Roosevelt and only 34 .4 percent disapprove .

In time of re- volt, as distinguished from a war of nation against nation, it is extremely difficult for journalists to get both sides of the story, but the news from Spain was told honestly or with in- tended honesty . There were many honest errors and omis- sions . The fact that Germany and Italy were part of the con- spiracy to destroy the Spanish Republic was not known at the beginning . But it was obvious that the plot included only the officers of the army and the leaders of the Catholic and Fascist elements, notably Robles, the Catholic, and Ler- roux, the reactionary, whose regime had been upset by the elections of February, 1936, the generals Sanjurjo, Mola, Queipo de Llano and Franco . The rebellion was put down generally throughout Spain in the first few weeks . Although the generals took eighty or ninety percent of the military with them, the armed popula- tion was able to retake the seized barracks and public build- ings in all the principal cities except Burgos, Seville, Sala- manca and a few others . It was obvious that an overwhelming majority of the people-and Spain is ninety-nine and nine- tenths Catholic although there are millions of anti-clericals- were for the republic and against the Clerico-Fascist rebels . Certainly no one can doubt that the trades unions, which have more than 5,000,000 members, were and are a hundred percent against the rebels . By the end of July, 1936, however, Franco was able, with the aid of Italian airplanes and German equipment from the ship Kamerun, to land Moors from Africa, equip them, and march on Toledo and Madrid, stopping in the working- men's sectors of Badajoz and Seville en route to murder many thousands .

The other was the fact, which the repub- lic has admitted, that in the first weeks of street fighting in the civil war, when there was no authority, no central power directing the Loyalists, anti-clerical and anti-Catholic ele- ments killed numerous priests . Some of these priests were killed in the churches in which arms were found and which were used as strong points by the Clerico-Fascist forces . Some were killed by outraged peasants who claimed that the church engaged in usury in the land . Some were killed for other reasons . But not one priest was killed by the republican gov- ernment, and from the moment the government restored its power it has protected churchmen and churches . The American press got its first facts fairly straight . Its errors were unintentional .

It would seem however, that the 'rebels' are made up of all factions opposed to Communism, and the 'Popular Front' party is made up of Communists, anarcho-syndicalists, and the more radical Socialists . This group is fanatically deter- mined to completely destroy the Church and it is for this group that the Record wished 'more power .' Catholics rightly have resented this . Catholics moreover, cannot consistently support-even to the extent of two cents a day-a paper that supports Communism . The Record owes an apology, or at least an explanation, to its Catholic readers .\" This Catholic newspaper's description of the Popular Front is false . The majority of the Popular Front is not com- posed of Communists, anarcho-syndicalists and Socialists, but liberals, republicans and democrats . The Popular Front is not \"fanatically determined to completely destroy the Church .\" It is, however, determined not to permit the res- toration of the Roman Catholic Church to temporal power -which was ended in 1931-nor to permit it ever again to control education in Spain . It is determined to treat the Roman Catholic Church in just the same manner the United States treats the Roman Catholic Church . How effective the boycott against the Stern paper was I do not know . But every newspaperman knows that the most powerful pressure group in America today is the Roman Catholic Church . I do not know whether it succeeded in curtailing the Record circulation or inflicting a financial blow through the withdrawal of advertising by Catholic busi- ness men . But on August 10, 1936, Publisher Stern addressed the following humble letter to Cardinal Dougherty : * Editor & Publisher, August 22, 1936 ."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"STERN'S FIGHT FOR LIBERALISM \t 169 \"On Wednesday July 29th we ran an editorial entitled NOW THE SPANISH REGIME LOSES ITS HEAD . . . .

I need not tell you that the Philadelphia Record stands four-square for religious freedom and tolerance and is bitterly opposed to Communism, Fascism or any form of government which denies its citizens complete protection in their worship . \"You have always been fair to the Record . I would very much appreciate your advice as to what I should or should not do in the matter .\" Cardinal Dougherty accepted the apology . He wrote : \"It is a pleasure to hear from you that, when this editorial was published, the Record was not aware that the so-called Rebel, or Rightist party, in Spain was really battling for re- ligious rights ; and that as soon as you learned this, you pub- lished a second editorial to offset the impression derived from the first editorial . \"Your further assurance that the Record stands four-square for religious freedom and tolerance and is opposed to Com- munism is also gratifying .\" I believe that every newspaperman in America who really values freedom of the press, no matter what his religious beliefs may be, will deplore this episode, and especially the Record's genuflections .

We have Father Curran's boast that he changed the policy of a Brooklyn newspaper through the $20,000 worth of print- ing or advertising business he controls there . And now we behold the publisher of a chain of four news- papers, four of the very tiny minority of liberal, free, inde- pendent newspapers left in America, bowing before the pres- sure of the Church when in fact his editorials on Spain had been true, honest, favorable to the anti-Fascist movement in Spain and applauded by all fair, liberal and intelligent men . Caught between the advertising pressure of big business on the one hand, and the political pressure of a religious or- ganization on the other, the New York Post, Philadelphia Record, Camden Courier and Camden Post have had to make the usual compromises . I know of no better illustration of the fact that there is no completely free press in America . When Stern bought the New York Post there was consid- erable metropolitan rejoicing . It was at a time the World- Telegram, grown rich and conscious of its power, had begun to shed pretensions of liberalism, and the hope of survival of the old New York World spirit was dead . But Stern had been preceded by the fame of his Philadelphia Record and a real liberal newspaper was expected . In this New York was not disappointed . There was a time, however, when Ernest Gruening, editor for only a few months, resigned amidst rumors which caused great question- ing, but the matters involved were the usual difficulties with advertisers and financial backers of the paper . People were more than willing to give the new liberal journal a better than even break ."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"STERN'S FIGHT FOR LIBERALISM \t 171 The circulation rose from some 40,000 to loo,00o in the first year of Stern management, doubled the next year, rose to 300,000 in the third, a phenomenal growth even with con- tests and book bargains discounted, and proving that the metropolis appreciated journalism which aimed at the old World and the Manchester Guardian standards . In 1936, when I went to Spain with Post credentials, I sent Harry Saylor, the editor, a series of stories aimed to tell the fundamental truth about the whole situation . One of the articles dealt severely with the part the Catholic Church was playing in the civil war . It was then twenty-seven years since I had started in journalism, by which time I had learned the first lesson, namely, that one must never write on controver- sial subjects, the first of which was religion, and that one must never report even the truth in any case in which the Catholic hierarchy might be offended . Nevertheless I tested every word, believed every word in this article which quoted pro-Loyalist expressions from the great, cultured, intelligent Catholic leaders, and sent the story to the Post . The Post published the story word for word . I know of few such instances of journalistic courage in dealing with a ta- booed subject . I stress this fact because of the disastrous Record episode . Sometime in 1937, however, a change seemed to come over the liberal viewpoint of the New York Post . It is difficult to say just when and how it happened, just as it is difficult even today to make too general an accusation inasmuch as several writers whose editorials gave the Post its reputation for liber- alism, are still writing liberal editorials, which now alternate with weaker, straddling and at times reactionary editorials . The Post is still in an ambiguous state . There is still hope it will return to the liberal fold . Whether or not negotiations with the Newspaper Guild were the main cause of the change, or merely touched it off, is not known to me, and may not be known to any man, not even Mr .

In fact Heywood Broun *k not only puts the Post among the reactionary Red-baiting newspapers, but gives the gold cup and blue ribbons to its publisher . \"Once,\" he writes, \"there was a liberal paper in New York City and now there is none . . . .

As they charged across the finish line it was evident that Stern had won by a head . A photograph will have to be taken to determine place and show positions, because they could cover Hearst, Roy Howard and Ogden Reid with a blanket . And not a bad idea at that .\" When did the Post enter the race? On October 5, 1 937, when the President excoriated the aggressor nations which were shedding blood and preparing to rush the world into another general war, the Post published the photographs of the heads of the lawless nations, and included that of Stalin with Hitler, Mussolini and the Mikado . No other newspaper, not even the professional Red-baiters which never hesitate to falsify news and pictures, followed the Post . Its readers, finding no reference to Russia and no implication in the President's words, probably believed that an error had been made . The Post in fact admitted it had erred . While I was willing to give the Post the benefit of a doubt in this episode, I was shocked by an editorial in the issue of December 2, 1937, on THE RIGHT TO PICKET-AND ITS ABUSE . On that or the following day every newspaper in New York City published an editorial against picketing . That too is a significant fact . In Russia it is said that the press is controlled * New Republic, March g, 1938 ."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"STERN'S FIGHT FOR LIBERALISM 173 by the government, and in Italy and Germany we know that there are daily orders on every editorial and news item of any importance, but in free America, where not even big business is supposed to have any sinister relationship at all with the free press, here was one instance where every paper spoke as if in echo to a master's voice, a dictator's voice . On this subject the Post and the Sun ran almost identical editorials . The Sun, however, did not try to make out that its attack on picketing was in the interests of labor . The Sun makes no pretenses of being liberal or of favoring labor . The Post said it believed, \"that the right to picket is one of the fundamental rights of labor,\" which it is, \"but . . And from now on it will be noted that there were many \"we- believe-in-this-but . . .\" editorials appearing in the Post . In this case the \"but\" was followed by the belief, \"that, like other rights, it may be abused,\" and the hope is expressed that labor will be careful . We are living in a time when the Chicago police murder ten unarmed peaceful pickets and the Spanish civil war has become largely a war of the employers against the labor unions and poor peasants, but the Post ad- vises caution where a year ago it advised audacity . \"Even more obnoxious,\" continues the editorial, \"is the use of pickets in what the courts have called and often con- demned as `secondary boycotts .' These are cases in which a man is picketed, not because he has a dispute with his em- ployees or with a union, but because he is doing business with some one else who may have a dispute with employees or a union .\" The fact behind the entire press campaign against picket- ing and notably \"secondary picketing\" is that these methods hurt business . The Newspaper Guild, striking at the Brook- lyn Eagle, made notable use of this new weapon . It attacked the Eagle through its advertisers : it sent its men, reporters and others whom Brooklyn liked and trusted, to the depart- ment stores and other large advertisers . These pickets carried placards urging the public not to deal with shops advertising"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"174 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS in a newspaper which labor held unfair to its employees . The Guild Reporter published a weekly list of stores, cigarette companies, and other advertisers with the recommendation they be boycotted . It is therefore easy to see that labor had discovered an effective weapon which incidentally hit news- paper revenue, the financial support of the press, harder than any weapon used for a century . The fact that the Sun, Herald Tribune, Times and Hearst press threw dignified tantrums when their pocketbooks were touched surprised no one ; the fact that the Times and Daily News also attacked picketing was no great shock ; but there was distinctly a journalistic tremor when the Post joined the others . This editorial may mark the change . News stories and edi- torials in which the Guild and its methods, the war in Spain, unions in general and especially a reactionary demand that they be incorporated so that they can be emasculated, have followed, and have caused the most loyal Post readers to squirm . Among the 260,000 circulation which the paper had added were all shades of liberals and radicals . On February 15, 1938, the Post deliberately set out to drive the extreme left wing out of its ranks . Its purge came in the form of an editorial, two columns wide, on page 1, under the heading STALIN TAKES OFF HIS MASK . It was based on a letter in which the Soviet leader urged, \"We must also increase and strengthen international proletarian ties of the working class of the U . S . S . R . with the working class of bourgeois coun- tries . We must organize political help of the working class of bourgeois countries to the working class of our country in case of military attack . . . .\" There was nothing sensational and certainly nothing new in the statement . But the Post said there could be but one interpretation : \"American workers MusT, according to Stalin, be prepared to fight for Soviet Russia when he wants them .\" And on the 18th, defending itself from the attacks of many readers, many of them non-"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"STERN'S FIGHT FOR LIBERALISM \t 1'75 Communists, the Post repeated its view that \"the `united front'-union of liberals with Communists against Fascists- is a greater threat to democracy than the frontal attack of reactionaries .\" With this view anyone who has been in Spain must disagree . Although the Communists are a minor part of the population of republican Spain, numbering only 50,000 men when the war broke out, they have supplied a great proportion of the best troops and fought better than any other political faction in the country, without claiming credit or attempting to take over the command of the army or the government from the majority liberals and democrats who control both . The publication of this editorial did more to upset the Post editorial and news staff than any event under the Stern regime . So far as I know there are no Communists on this paper-as there are secretly on the Times and larger journals -but all the liberals felt that the day of Red-baiting had arrived and some questioned the wisdom of remaining with a paper following the Hearstian line . It was at this time that Broun read Stern out of the liberal ranks . \"He was all for trade unionism until it took a bite at his own budget,\" said Broun . \"When the C . I . 0 . was a bright dream J . David Stern applauded . When it became a successful reality it scared the hell out of him . . . . The soul of Stern was shocked when Stalin suggested that the workers of the world might have a stake in winning out against war . To J . David Stern that was subversive and undemocratic . . . . Stern is the most tired of all the tired liberals . . . . He wants to hit the hay and forget most of the causes he previously espoused . It is not unknown for a paper's policy to vary according to its cir- culation .\" I do not agree about the tiredness, nor about the influence of circulation, because the Post has not yet reached World- Telegram heights and money . I believe the episode is another illustration of the Stern policy of operating as liberal a news- paper as the money interests will allow . Apparently there had"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"176 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS been a clamping down on policy by certain interests, a threat to the financial future of the Post which had to be answered by a gesture of Red-baiting, and the compromise had to be made . It was the same sort of necessary surrender which the Record had made to the Catholic Church . The reactionaries on the Post staff must have felt victori- ous because on the 22nd of that February when the Times, World-Telegram and Herald Tribune united in hailing the Soviet arctic expedition, a brilliant, successful exploit which will take a permanent place in heroic traditions, the Post said editorially : \"Those Russian scientists who can't be coaxed off the ice floe on which they have drifted for eight months may be smart . \"Having a radio, they may have heard rumors of the whole- sale liquidations of big shots in Moscow . Having scientific minds, they may have put two and two together and con- cluded that the more famous one becomes in Russia the more likely one is to be liquidated . And, having the primitive in- stinct of self-preservation, maybe they've concluded that an ice floe may be a pretty comfortable spot, after all .\" This editorial disappeared in the second edition . It was even too raw for the editors of the Post . In the Daily Worker it was called a \"crime against science, human progress and journalistic decency,\" never to be forgotten or forgiven by the American people . The American people of course know nothing about this . And most of the readers of the first edi- tion did not give a hoot . But we may be justified in asking whether either the advertisers or the intangible forces which drive newspapers out of the liberal and progressive camp really, expect Red-baiting editorials to prove to their finan- cial backers that they are in the money camp .

The Colonel, with the help of numerous Chicago bankers, steel masters, and other corporation heads, had gotten owner- ship of the Chicago Daily News in 1931 . He was determined \"to round out his life with a great achievement . He dreamed of making it the best newspaper in the English-speaking world ; best in style, information, opinion and appearance .\" We have this on the authority of Raymond Gram Swing, who for many years represented the Daily News in Europe and who knows the Chicago publisher well . Mr . Swing also learned at the dawn of 1936, that the employees of the paper were enthusiastic supporters of their chief, and they were especially proud of the fact that he never made the News a personal organ during the campaign and never perverted it to party uses, as did his rival publishers but political friends Hearst and McCormick . Knox had enough sense of humor to permit one of his star writers, Howard Vincent O'Brien, to criticize his candidacy in his own newspaper . Such things could not happen among the humorless Hearsts and Mc- Cormicks . O'Brien said in his News column that if his boss were Pres- ident he was convinced Knox \"would do things that are utterly abhorrent to him now, and perforce leave undone practically all the things he now advocates .\" And Swing 177"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"1']H \t LORDS OF THE PRESS points out that Knox, veteran of two wars, making a strong bid for the Legion vote despite the fact he had in his non- political days sternly opposed the bonus for the veterans, \"found as candidate that it might as well be paid, if it could be out of funds already appropriated . Whether he would be as quick 'to rationalize the suppression of academic freedom and `the perennial quest for truth' to please the Legion re- mains to be seen .\" Throughout 1936 the change was seen . The Colonel, who had refrained from joining McCormick and Hearst in their Red-baiting hysteria and witch hunt at the University of Chicago, now indulged in those hobbies . In one address he declared that \"the most irreligious atmosphere in America today is in the meeting of radical Socialists who would substi- tute planned economy and socialistic philosophy for our free institutions .\" When the President said he welcomed the hatred of those American business men who oppose his re- election, Colonel Knox thought this helped class warfare of which \"America is tired .\" Of the President's promise to mas- ter the forces of reaction, Colonel Knox said such talk, utterly foreign to the American system, \"fits in perfectly with the Fascist or Communist philosophy of Europe .\" In Pittsfield, Massachusetts, he said his campaign was not a fight against the Democratic party but against \"alien and un-American elements\" which he said had seized the party . In Toledo, Ohio, he said, \"I hate to see union labor entering politics after forty years of making its own way .\" The Toledo speech, incidentally, was answered by James L . McDevitt, executive director of Labor's Non-Partisan League, who said : \"When Colonel Knox said his Chicago Daily News was loo percent union he was making a delib- erate misstatement of fact . He has no contract with the American Newspaper Guild, a union of editorial employees affiliated with the American Federation of Labor . \"He insulted labor's intelligence when he said it has sold its birthright for a mess of pottage .

Johnson replied that the candidate had made nine statements in one paragraph which were \"false and made with intent to deceive .\" He accused the Colonel of a \"rhinoceros-hided disregard for even the appearance of fair- ness .\" The Colonel continued to call the Roosevelt \"measures\" \"pink pills\" and accuse the Democratic party of having \"writ- ten into law wholly or in part the twelve principal planks of the Socialistic platform .\" In the eyes of Norman Thomas not a single Socialist measure had been adopted ; it was purely another Knoxian attempt at Red-baiting . And since the Colonel as a political candidate had to make the necessary gesture in favor of labor, which even Fascist leaders make before they come into power and destroy the unions, the Newspaper Guild took advantage of the situation by asking him to recognize the movement for collective bar- gaining, higher wages, and better journalism . Mr . Broun wrote Mr . Knox saying that the Guild must take in all papers, disregarding the fact some pay wages better than the mini- mum demanded . Mr . Broun also wrote Knox that to the Guild's surprise \"your editorial department employees are afraid to join . . . . They admit they fear reprisals from the management . They fear the announcement of the formation of a unit . . . will bring swift reaction from the management in the way of abrupt dismissals .\" Colonel Knox was asked to make a public statement of policy .

The insinu-"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"1$0 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS ation that any employee of the Daily News has been intimi- dated . . . is entirely without foundation .\" He then upbraids Broun for failing \"to recognize `intimidation' as the standard alibi for failure to organize\" and concludes with a bitter criticism of the Guild by urging \"that you look into the real reason for the failure of the Guild to click in Chicago . My guess is that intimidation hasn't anything to do with it, but rather that the hard-boiled, individualistic and realistic men who staff the Chicago papers don't see the benefits .\" The Guild however insisted it had found News men in- timidated and a similar situation existing on other Chicago papers where the owners, arrogant press lords, were in the habit of referring to their \"loyal\" employees in much the same way medieval lords referred to their faithful serfs . The highly paid employees, it must be admitted, were mostly \"loyal .\" As the press swung in behind Landon and Knox, its meth- ods and motives were criticized only in the liberal weeklies, to which the big politicians paid no attention . But when Filene, the Boston merchant, philanthropist and heavy ad- vertiser, made a public exposure of the situation it was Colonel Knox who took it upon himself to defend the press . \"In America,\" said Filene, \"at least theoretically, the peo- ple rule . . . . And yet, in a great national crisis in which our national administration working for better distribution of wealth, has somehow come into conflict with the great finan- cial and business interests, it turns out that our newspapers- the very source of the average voter's information and educa- tion-are usually owned and controlled by these same special interests .\" Said Colonel Knox, whose entry into metropolitan journal- ism had come about through the financial backing of Dawes, Avery, the head of American Foundries, and other corpora- tions : \"In his home city of Boston does Mr .

Filene but call the roll of the outstanding news- papers the country over-the Sun of Baltimore, the Star and Post of Washington, the Buffalo News, the Detroit News and Free Press, the Plain-Dealer of Cleveland, the Times-Star and Enquirer of Cincinnati, the Chicago Tribune and the Chi- cago Daily News, the Milwaukee Journal and Minneapolis Journal and Tribune, the Pioneer Press of St . Paul, the Omaha World, the Kansas City Star, the Los Angeles Times, the San Francisco Chronicle, the Seattle Times, the Portland Oregonian, the Spokesman-Review of Spokane, to name but a few of them-does Mr . Filene contend that these great newspapers are owned or controlled by the `special interests'? \"He surely knows that there are no newspapers more com- pletely independent of any form of financial duress than those included in the great Hearst, Scripps-Howard, Block and Gannett chains, and the Booth group here in Michigan .\" Mr . Knox claimed that the reason the American press at- tacked the President was disillusion over the Newspaper Code, the President's violation of his promises, and the fact that \"under the dominating influence of a group of radicals\" he had \"embarked upon a course far away from an American form of government and toward a dictatorial government .\" (This of course is nonsense, but nonsense is ninety percent of political campaign talk .) \"All these things and many others-lost for Mr . Roosevelt his hold on the majority of men in the Washington press"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"182 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS gallery,\" concludes Knox . (The very opposite is the truth .) \"It was their disillusionment in the President, and in his New Deal, that caused the majority of newspapers to become critical .\" This last statement was proven absolutely false by the scientific and unquestioned survey which Leo C . Rosten made for the Social Science Research Council and which will be discussed at length later . The truth is that the great major- ity of Washington correspondents stood by the President then and do so now and moreover that the majority of Roosevelt- baiting newspapers have correspondents in Washington whose views are contrary to editorial policy and who in many proven instances have to write against their convictions . But this does not answer Knox's main contention . He asks whether the big newspapers are controlled by the \"special interests .\" The answer is that in many cases they are and that in most cases-the exceptions are few-they are part and parcel of the special interests, and that Filene was absolutely right . Or are we to believe that the fact that the social and economic policies-and in many cases the political policies- of the newspapers and the big business interests are identical are just several thousand coincidents? There can be no other general answer . Colonel Knox has been noted for his courage, sincerity and forthrightness . He became a newspaperman through the let- ters he wrote back from Tampa and Santiago, Cuba, where he was a Rough Rider with Colonel Roosevelt, and he never got over his admiration of that man . He made good as a reporter on the Grand Rapids Herald and went into the business end . In 1902, with the help of a printer he acquired the Lake Superior Journal, borrowing a thousand dollars to make up the fifteen hundred he had to put up as his share . As a publisher he was honest and cou- rageous, fighting vice, gambling and civic corruption .

It was the era of crusading and muckraking journalism and Knox made good at it . He sold the paper for $50,000 in 1912 . In the World War he was a major of artillery and returned a lieutenant colonel . He made a success of his Manchester newspaper and soon controlled the press of the town . In 1926 Hearst asked him to pull the Boston American and Boston Advertiser out of the red, and he did so without ever being tainted by contact with Hearst, as is the fate of the majority of Hearst executives . But he was a very shrewd hard-headed Yankee trader and Fortune reports that in 193o Hearst, who has a more sentimental nature, and whose whole life had been vast and lavish, had secretly restored wage cuts which Knox ordered . Knox quit . He was ready to retire . He had made half a million dollars working for Hearst and saved almost all of it . He was ready to take it easy . Then came the sudden death of Walter Strong and the chance of a lifetime . Knox came to Chicago fired with the ideal of publishing a great newspaper . I think that every publisher who starts as a reporter has the same dream-the hope of equaling or even outdoing the Manchester Guardian in' America . At least that is what many of his employees, associates and friends say . But I have my doubts . I cannot conceive of a great paper without a liberal policy, and the entire history of the owner and publisher of the Chicago Daily News ever since the end of the muckraking era and Theodore Roosevelt progressivism, has been made on the road between conserva- tism and reaction . For example, Colonel Knox opposed Con- gressional investigations . In the early days they were either caused by newspaper exposes-as for example that of the Armour, Swift and other packing houses after Sinclair pub- lished \"The Jungle\"-or they were approved and headlined by the newspapers . Now Knox says, \"I say to you deliberately that most of these investigations are designed by the New"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"184 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS Dealers to draw red herrings across the trail of their real in- tentions . Their intentions are to discredit private industry so these New Dealers may encounter a minimum resistance and later, it may well be, seize private property on the Marxian philosophy of government ownership .\" Can the fact that an Armour Packing Company director is also a Daily News director have anything to do with such views? Is it just another coincidence? Colonel Knox has spoken over an NBC hookup under the auspices of The Crusaders, an anti-labor semi-Fascist organ- ization . Chicago Daily News directors are Max Epstein, of American Transportation Company, who had contributed money to Harry Jung's American Vigilant Intelligence Fed- eration ; J . E . Otis, of the Central Trust Company of Illinois, director of utilities, banks and the Dawes Pure Oil Com- pany ; John Stuart, president of Quaker Oats and director of the union-hating International Harvester ; George E . Scott, president of the American Steel Foundries, and Sewell Lee Avery, of U . S . Gypsum, Montgomery Ward and the Ameri- can Liberty League . These men are the proof that the Daily News is not con- trolled by business interests ; it is merely directed by the men of big business . Ever since the 1936 campaign ended Colonel Knox has continued to express in daily life and in the Daily News the same illiberal abuse of the administration which the labor- fighting industrialists have expressed . In 1988 he attacked the new Farm Act, the Wagner Labor Act, and the Social Secu- rity Act . He urged the suspension of social security taxation in order to restore \"the American way,\" and said \"The one sure way to bring Fascism to this country is through pro- longed government spending of large sums of borrowed money .\" Of the Daily News of a generation ago Will Irwin said it was \"an honest newspaper, first, last and all the time . . . .

Both of course are conservative, and the best upholders of the well known status quo . And since the Herald Tribune does not claim to be a lib- eral newspaper the same yardsticks of criticism which must justly and ethically be applied to the Times cannot be used in this investigation . On the other hand the Herald Tribune sponsors annually a public forum in which not only a free press, but an ideal press is one of the chief topics for national discussion . This forum is one of the finest achievements of liberalism in America, if not in the world . To Mr . and Mrs . Ogden Reid, owners of the paper, and especially to Mrs . William Brown Meloney, who has directed the forum for years, the nation owes a gold medal . The Herald Tribune forum is so liberal and fairminded that it permits the severest opponents to air their views . Mrs . Meloney, for example, has asked me to speak my criticism of the American press (including of course the Times and the Herald Tribune) to her audience and a national hookup over the radio . If I were not such a coward about facing an audience and a microphone I would have been permitted to outline at a meeting sponsored by the Herald Tribune the 186"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"THE \"HERALD TRIBUNE,\" CUBA AND FASCISM 187 various strictures of the Herald Tribune which compose this chapter . My main contention of course is that the Herald Tribune is a class newspaper, that it is the organ of a small, powerful, and rich minority, and therefore hardly a newspaper at all, if by newspaper we take the definitions the newspapers them- selves have written from their earliest days to the formula- tion of the various codes of ethics recently . On the other hand I prefer an honest bias to the pretensions of say the Hearst press which announces \"public service\" as a newspaper ob- jective when it may mean service to public utility corpora- tions, as the Black Lobbying Commission investigation indicated . The Herald Tribune openly serves money, wealth, power, and the interests Henry George first called \"vested\" and which Roosevelt I called special privilege . It does not serve the people . It makes no such pretensions . It is the organ of the ruling class, and the ruling class in almost every nation is opposed to the people it rules . Several years ago I mentioned the will of the late Mrs . Whitelaw Reid leaving the owners of the present Herald Tribune more than $16,ooo,ooo in stocks and bonds, and I remarked that \"every move the American government made toward intervention in Cuba and Mexico affected Whitelaw Reid's and Mrs . Reid's Mexican and Cuban investments . Every adverse policy of the public utility commissions or President F . D . Roosevelt is a blow to the utility portfolio of the Reid estate .\" I am now able to illustrate this criticism with rather sensational historical facts . One episode concerns a big business, the other the Cuban government . The National Biscuit Company strike of 1935 was not much different from other strikes, except in this particular, that it got less mention in the newspapers than any similar event . The National Biscuit Company is a big advertiser, and every publisher and advertising man, and even liberals who contend that advertising no longer suppresses news, should"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"188 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS make a survey of what happened when the makers of Uneeda Biscuit locked out 6,ooo employees in five of their manufac- turing cities . What happened is simply this : the news was in most in- stances completely suppressed ; in a few instances there were tiny items, half buried ; in cases where there was violence, the attack was blamed on labor . Suppression, burial, distortion, falsification, were the rule, so far as the free press was con- cerned . One of the acts of violence occurred when scabbing work- men tried to ship some merchandise . Trucks were over- turned . Blows were struck . This made an interesting picture which all the services took and distributed . But apparently the National Biscuit Company did not want its name men- tioned even in an item which accused its striking employees of vandalism because no newspaper with the exception of the Hearst Mirror published a print . The Mirror picture had the words \"National Biscuit Company\" which were on the trucks painted out . And this occurred during the managing editorship of Stanley Walker who had just come over from the Herald Tribune . As for the silence of the latter paper, the strikers and the liberal press explained it by the fact that Ogden L . Mills, director of the biscuit company, was a relative of the Reids and a holder of Herald Tribune stock . But apparently no one knew at the time that the $16,ooo,ooo Reid portfolio of stocks and bonds had as its biggest item 84,250 shares of Bis- cuit common, then worth $5,971,218 . In other words, the Reids were probably the largest individual stockholders of the company where the strike was being waged . The Reid portfolio also contained 11,995 shares of Atchi- son, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad shares worth two million dollars, and one may deduce a pro-railroad policy from that fact . Great public utilities, then and now engaged in what is known as a \"death grapple\" with the Roosevelt administra- tion, are represented by such items as American Power &"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"THE \"HERALD TRIBUNE,\" CUBA AND FASCISM 189 Light (897 shares), Commonwealth Edison (2,120 shares), Consolidated Gas of N .

Then there were Cuban and Mexican bonds, oil and mining concessions, and 8,300 shares of Cerro de Pasco copper . The estate had been valued at $34,518,119, but from 1918 to 1929 Mrs . Whitelaw Reid had been giving her son and daughter securities and properties of almost equal value to that left in the will . At any rate it is obvious that the same persons who owned the Herald Tribune were also owners of some $20,000,000 to $25,000,000 or more of stocks and bonds in American utilities, railroads and other forms of big busi- ness and in Mexican and Cuban properties . Whether or not the news in the Herald Tribune was cut to the bias of every corporation, as in the case of the National Biscuit Company, one cannot tell . But it is as obvious as the multiplication table that the social and economic and politi- cal viewpoints of the big corporations in which the Reids have interests and their Herald Tribune are one and the same . Nor can one say with certainty that it was the Reid interest in the reactionary Cuban regime which resulted lately in the biggest ethical scandal in metropolitan journalism . VP One of the most familiar-and most specious-defenses of the American press is to compare it to the European press . The French press is notoriously venal ; the British press to- day publishes more and worse fraudulent medical advertising than our papers did before the passage of food and drug legislation ; the Fascist press is perverted beyond description . Our press, on the whole, is not as corrupt, venal, or per- verted . That's fine ."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"190 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS I sometimes think it better to have a corrupt press, like the French, where book reviews, art criticism, blurbs about mer- chandise and statesmen are paid for in cash and where every- one knows that every item has its price, than the American press where it is impossible to bribe a book reviewer, a theater or movie or opera or art critic, where products and people as a rule cannot buy favorable reading notices at advertising rates, and where nevertheless, without bribery and corruption an almost similar treatment of people, things and events occurs . I never tire of quoting Humbert Wolfe's verse about the integrity of the British journalist whom you cannot hope to bribe or twist : \"But seeing what the man will do unbribed, there's no occasion to .\" Ninety percent of the American publishers unbribed support tory and reac- tionary men and ideas, fight reform and progress, attack lib- eralism while pretending to be liberal-and this reactionary philosophy permeates every branch of the paper, including even the book review sections and art criticism . Peter Blume, for example, was recently attacked not for his canvas but for his picture of Mussolini as a jack-in-the-box . Reactionary art critics did not like the social significance of a work of art . Occasionally something occurs openly in American jour- nalism which reminds us of those things we denounce so strongly in the venal European press . The American public of course knows nothing about the Chicago Tribune Paris edition whose advertising department wrote probably the most disgraceful chapter in modern American journalistic history . Its agents actually promised the foreign offices of Fascist nations to support their policies in return for adver- tising . I know very well that Colonel McCormick in faraway Chicago was not aware that solicitors, many of them for- eigners, were using the name and credentials of the Chicago Tribune when all they were after was $50 for the Paris edi- tion of the same newspaper, but the fact remains that the Paris business office knew of this and encouraged it, and it"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"THE \"HERALD TRIBUNE,\" CUBA AND FASCISM 191 would not require much search on the part of the publisher and editors in Chicago to establish the reason for Fascist Portuguese, Fascist Spanish and other editions and special Roumanian, Polish and other pages devoted entirely to praise of reactionary regimes and ideas . The motive was money- and not big money at that . In many respects the Chicago Tribune Paris edition was a piker compared to the venal French contemporaries, but no less venal . If one were to ask American reporters, school of journal- ism professors, advertising men or others who follow journal- istic events closely what was the most shocking single episode in recent history, there is no doubt that the answer would be : the publication of the New York Herald Tribune Cuban ad- vertising section as news matter on November 21, 1937 . It shocked even the New York Times . On that Sunday the Herald Tribune carried a Section XII of forty pages of glorification of the Cuban regime . The front page had on it the following legend : CUBA TODAY Land of Peace and Progress (This section, devoted to the Government and Industry of Cuba, is written and presented by friends of Cuba) There was no indication that the whole thing was propa- ganda, and paid advertising . The purpose was to misinform the American people about a regime which all fair, open- minded, honest reports call harsh, repressive, or dictatorial and even terroristic .

On page 4 occurs as violent a transgression of ethics as has been noted by professors and pupils in the history of journal- ism schools . On the face of it it appears to be an endorsement of the Batista regime made especially for the Herald Tribune section and the important news that our President plans to revisit the island . Actually it was nothing of the sort . Some one had taken news items and statements of the past, pasted them together, carefully eliminated the old dates, and made an ambiguous item out of it for the purpose of fooling the reader .

Even if marked \"paid advertisement\" it would have been unethical ; it would have proven again the viciousness of the advertising system . But appearing as editorial matter it was a million times as vicious and as reprehensible . Moreover, thanks to the publication by the Guild Reporter of a confidential memorandum sent by Don Bridge, adver- tising director of the Times, to his staff, we have an exposure of one of the finest pieces of hypocrisy which has marked the downward path of the conservative press of America . The Herald Tribune, having published the supplement as edi- torial matter, later insisted that it' be credited by the Pub- lishers Association of New York with 40,000 lines of paid advertising in the same instance . In other words the Herald Tribune, after having fooled its readers by not labeling a paid advertisement as such, later desired the credit which 40,000 lines makes in its standing as an advertising medium, and therefore admitted' the truth to the trade . Mr . Sulzberger of the Times was greatly shocked by what he termed the \"dis- loyalty\" of a member of his staff in making the Bridge letter public, nevertheless it was a public service which the Guild Reporter appreciated . The letter, a real journalistic expose, told how the Publishers Association held a special meeting \"to protest against measuring the Cuba Today section . . . as paid advertising . Every newspaper present except the Herald Tribune vigorously opposed the measurement by Media Records of paid-for news matter as bona fide adver- tising . . . .

There are of course considerable differences, although every man who is a Fascist is ipso facto a conservative, and the reverse is not nec- essarily true . It is true, however, that the man who founded Fascism defined it as reactionary and anti-liberal .* The Herald Tribune is not Fascist . But it would not have great difficulties making peace with a future Fascist regime . Such a change in government would come about through the machinations of a demagogue, the march of a veterans' or- ganization such as the American Legion, subventioned by reactionary associations of manufacturers and commerce, in- stitutes such as financed Fascism in Italy and Germany . The Herald Tribune can be said to be the voice in America of the National Association of Manufacturers and the United States Chamber of Commerce . In this newspaper you can read letters saying that \"never- theless, a case can be made out for Fascism\" (June 1, 1987) and great stories of Mussolini's accomplishments (December 28, 1937) .

In the Spanish civil war the New York Herald Tribune has been as fair as most newspapers, and frequently its strong editorials against the bloody Spanish Fascists have been notable .

The public misses these fine points in the everyday battle of freedom of the press, but there is not a newspaper- man in Paris who does not know that these things happen . The Paris edition of the Chicago Tribune, now absorbed by the Herald, was pro-Fascist for the simple reason that Fascist European regimes advertise, democracies do not . Thus Primo de Rivera, first Fascist dictator of Spain, made a con- tract with almost all the newspapers published in Paris which was conditioned by active editorial support of his system . The advertisements did not say, \"Buy a bottle of Fascism today ; it's good for what ails you .\" What they did say was that Spain was a fine country for tourists, that the new hotels were good, that the mountains were superb . Some people call this \"institutional advertising,\" others call it bribery . Mussolini and Italy did the same kind of advertising in the Paris Tribune . So did Pilsudski and Poland, likewise the Roumanians, and the Portuguese, and other Fascist dictators . So every time I went on a trip to the Balkans or visited a dictator country, I found that an advertising man from the Chicago Tribune had preceded me and sewed up the adver- tising there, promising that the Tribune editorial policy would be directed in favor of the particular brand of Fascism prevalent . I must add, to be absolutely correct, that I do not believe that the editorial department of the Chicago Tribune in Chicago knew about these goings on .

It may be the clean youth and imagination of a Charles Lindbergh calling upon men of good will to join him in a party of law and order . It may be the sagacity and experience of a Henry Ford, summoning men to match the organization of the underworld with a still more potent organization . In every part of the country men are waiting for the call, and when it is heard, there will be a roar of assent from a million throats . The elements are assembled for the formation of this kind of Fascism in the United States, composed of householders, heads of families and taxpayers . The stage is set . When in 1938 Hitler established Fascism in Germany and in 1934 purged his party with bloodshed and murder, the Paris Herald took the matter in its stride . It retained the official government advertising, including one or, two swas- tikas strewn among the items . I know of no other American publication which publishes the swastika daily . When Franco began his mutiny, the course of the paper, now amalgamated with the Chicago Tribune and inheriting the worst feature of both, was simplicity itself . Primo de Rivera, the first Fascist dictator, had been a liberal adver- tiser : it was natural to suppose that Franco, the self-admitted Fascist pretender to the dictatorial throne, would also ad- vertise liberally in the Paris Herald Tribune . And so he was supported . From the editorial staff of the Paris Herald Tribune I learn that the city editor censors or kills all anti-Fascist letters sent in by readers, and publishes all pro-Franco letters . Just to test out this statement I sent in several letters under many names, but none was used . (It is true that a letter signed by my own name as correspondent of the New York Post protesting numerous lies in the letter department was used by this paper, but equally important letters sent by prominent persons, as for example, Robert Briffault, author"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"200 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS of \"Europa,\" were suppressed .) I know that the \"letters to the editor\" department is not very important: the important fact is that orders on what to use and what to suppress have been given by those in authority . The editorial staff further informs me that in case the city editor overlooks an anti- Fascist letter, it is killed in proof by managing editor Hawkins, and should he fail, the final stabbing is done by the editor and general manager, Mr . Hills himself . He has given the orders to one Louis Harl, an Irish Catholic philo- Fascist journalist who is permitted to edit and censor the news on Spain . A curious sideline on this dirty business of coloring the news to suit the Fascists was furnished to me by Minifie, the correspondent of the New York Herald Tribune in Spain . James M . Minifie is one of the best, a truly objective journal- ist who writes without bias and color and who tells the truth, let the chips fall where they may . Mr . Minifie noticed the coloring of the news on Spain, wondered about the U . P . dispatches being biased in his own paper, but said nothing until one day he began to notice that someone, presumably Harl, was writing in \"Reds\" for \"Loyalists\" in his own cables . But that was not all . He tells me that whole items were changed, that parts were suppressed, that sometimes the exact opposite was printed of what he had written in the Paris, never in the New York edition . At first Minifie tried to fight it out . He demanded that his stuff be published as written, but somehow this didn't work . It might have been stupidity, it might have been sabotage . Probably the latter . At any rate here we have the astounding spectacle of a well-known journalist giving instructions to one of the two newspapers published by his own organiza- tion never under any circumstances to use his material be- cause cause he could not trust it to use it honestly . \"What do you think caused the manhandling of your stuff in the Paris office?\" I asked Minifie when I first met"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"THE \"HERALD TRIBUNE,\" CUBA AND FASCISM 201 him in Valencia, one night just after the sirens had stopped calling alarm for an air raid . \"Pressure groups,\" he replied . \"There are plenty of Amer- ican legionnaires in Paris on the Fascist side, also pro-Fascist church organizations . I have seen letters they have sent to Hills saying I am a Red just because I was sending news from Madrid . In fact a certain Sister R- demanded that the Paris H . T . stop publishing any news from the govern- ment side, her idea of objectivity being news exclusively from the Fascist side .\" It is a fact that the Paris Herald Tribune stopped publish- ing even the official Madrid-Valencia government com- munique on the progress of the war . I make this statement from an examination of the paper from January to May, 1937, when I saw it every day . On the other hand the Paris edition publishes fake news about republican Spain . I make this statement because I have clipped some of these fakes . Here is one for example which is the story of how Companys, the president of Catalonia, has fled from Barcelona to a haven in France . It is true that the first place this fake appeared was in the London Daily Mail, but that does not alter the fact it was still a fake when the Herald Tribune republished it . The Paris edition suppressed the most important parts of the sensational speech on Spain which Taylor, the Chicago Tribune correspondent with Franco, made before the Ameri- can Chamber of Commerce, of which editor Laurence Hills is a shining light . It is true that the chamber and the report- ers who covered the speechmaking expected a bitter attack on the Spanish republic from the man who had been with the Fascists ; they were not prepared to hear someone on that side and a Catholic too, call Franco a mad dog and refer to his soldiers as murderers .

In this building there is a Franco agency which occupies the best part of an entire floor . It is a fact therefore that one of the largest rent payers of the Paris Herald Tribune is the Franco Fascist agency . I do not believe that the dollars of rental paid would amount to one-hundredth of one percent in the budget of the Reid family which owns the New York Herald Tribune, but I do know that the Paris edition budget depends largely on build- ing rental, and that the Franco payments to the newspaper are very important ."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 Gannett : Chain Lord THROUGHOUT the world journalists have risen to power .

The nomination of Frank Knox, it has been said in public political speeches, caused abysmal chagrin to his Chicago col- league, Colonel McCormick . I do not know whether this is so . But Frank Knox's candidacy, despite its failure, has caused a great buzzing of hornets in all the bonnets of big and little publishers, and chiefly in the dovecote of the country chain owner, Frank E . Gannett . He too has been afflicted with the Northcliffe complex .

In fact the situation poses the ques- tion whether or not most publishers, realizing the power of the press, do not at some time in their lives succumb to the desire to exercise it for their own advancement or satisfac- tions . Curiously enough in years gone by Frank Gannett used to deliver a pronunciamento against publishers in politics . Frank Ernest Gannett is sincere, humanitarian, a man of good intentions, and one of the most confused persons in public life today . As millionaire owners of the press go, he is one of the minor lords, his fortune being valued at a mere $12,500,000 . He has great plans for devoting it to the welfare of his fellow men . He has announced that public service rather than private profits would be the program of his papers . His chain, which once reached a maximum of nineteen, is concentrated mostly in New York State, and the best known papers are the Knickerbocker Press in Albany and the Rochester Times- Union and Rochester Democrat & Chronicle . Gannett has provided for a foundation which will control the ownership of the common stock in all his papers . After dividends on preferred, which will be held largely by employees and ex- ecutives, have been paid, the remaining profits will be available for \"public charitable, educational and general philanthropic causes and purposes .\" The board of directors, self-perpetuating, will consist of eleven persons of whom at least eight must be newspapermen, and each director must hold at least 10o shares of stock . The consolidated net profit of the Gannett company in 1937 was $1,123,085 and in 1936, $1,026,150 . In 1935 Gannett also announced that The Agriculturist, his farm paper, would be directed by a man chosen by the readers, profits to be turned into a fellowship fund for re- search . When he went to high school in Bristol, New York, where he was born on September 15, 1876, young Gannett made"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"206 LORDS OF THE PRESS some money as a bartender's helper in the local hotel and the result was his almost fanatical prohibitionist attitude . \"After watching booze ruin men,\" he says, \"I made up my mind that if I ever got a chance I would fight it .\" He fought . The prohibition amendment was a great personal triumph, the repeal a sad day, but when beer returned and the question of alcohol advertising agitated many publishers, he said, \"I must recognize . . . that a newspaper is a semi-public institu- tion . No matter what my personal views may be I have come to appreciate that it may be dangerous to exclude advertising not in conflict with the law . . . . It threatens . . . free speech and a free press, which are precious liberties .\" So it looked for a while as if private profits would triumph over idealism, but it turned out differently . The childhood conviction did triumph . Gannett again barred liquor adver- tising in his papers . The war also taught Mr . Gannett something . He has been militantly anti-militarist . He is a member of the executive board of the National Council for the Prevention of War . In 1935 Gannett was elected a director of the Associated Press to succeed Adolph Ochs . At that time he held seventeen franchises for that many journals and it was generally agreed that he would be the spokesman of the small newspaper in the great organization . In the press associations Gannett is said to be the best versed economist in the profession . Editor & Publisher reports that \"book upon book in the elaborate office-library in his Rochester home testify to the thorough study of economic problems Mr . Gannett has made in re- cent years .\" Apparently this economist believes in cyclical re- covery . \"Believing that the depression was due largely to a collapse in prices caused by the increasing value of gold, Mr . Gannett is vitally concerned with the effect of a man- aged dollar .\" The economist is quoted as saying : \"America is practically the same as it was in 1929 . We have the same re- sources, the same (etc ., etc .) . . . . Readjust prices and we will go forward rapidly toward prosperity . Prices affect our lives"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"GANNETT : CHAIN LORD \t 207 profoundly . . . . Depression and booms are just great fluctu- ations in prices . . . .\" Years ago Gannett announced that it was his policy \"never to buy a paper where the policy has to be changed .\" It was not until midsummer in 1936 that this publisher joined the vast majority of his colleagues who for diverse reasons, chiefly financial (as the New York Daily News showed), indulged in one of the most prejudiced, unfair, and unethical campaigns in our history . \"I am personally very fond of President Roosevelt,\" said Gannett . \"We have been friends for thirty years but I can't go along with him on his ideas of govern- ment . . . . I can't stand for his planned economy, centraliza- tion of power and extravagant use of public moneys .\" From now on Gannett was launched on the dubious waters of party politics . He still continued to publish the statement that \"the Gannett newspapers are dedicated to the welfare of all the people . Theirs is the pledge to publish each day clean, wholesome, educational and entertaining newspapers . Knowing no selfish interests, no entangling obligations, each newspaper within this group can be, and is, fair, just and tolerant, ever sympathetic with the unfortunate and eager to present all sides of any question . Each of these newspapers has ever before it the ideal of Lincoln, to be for and of the People .\" And the Knickerbocker Press still announced its purpose was \"Fully, honestly, accurately and intelligently to inform the public .\" The slogan of the group still was \"The integrity of a Gannett newspaper must never be questioned .\" But questioned it was . The altruist and humanitarian Gannett came into conflict with the employer Gannett, and the newspapermen who were organizing soon found out which of the two they were deal- ing with . There were problems of journalistic ethics and problems of hiring, firing and paying of wages . Gannett was anti-Roosevelt on the Supreme Court issue . The reporters may have been pro-Roosevelt but they at least were ethical : they wrote the news as news . Albany Central Federation of"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"2o8 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS Labor unanimously endorsed the President . This of course was fairly big local news and Albany newspapers were ex- pected to play it up . At the same time two small items came in over the telegraph desk from Schenectady and from Little Falls . They were reports that lawyers' associations had dis- approved of the President . On February 18, 1937, the Knickerbocker Press ran its story with the following head : TWO BAR GROUPS RAP COURT MOVE Mohawk Valley Lawyers Express Disapproval of Proposal . Tacked on to out-of-town items was the vastly more impor- tant local story in favor of the Roosevelt plan . The reporters were angry . They declared that the labor council story had been written separately but the editors had buried it . That whole morning the telephone calls to the evening Gannett paper, the Albany News, brought protests from labor unions . And so, despite the fact that the news was already stale, hav- ing appeared in a morning paper, the News played it up first on page 4, then page 2, with an eight-column banner heading . And when the newspaper writers suggested that a clause in the new contract should permit them to write \"a full, ac- curate, truthful and fair presentation of the facts,\" the man- agement said such a proposal would be virtually an insult to Frank Gannett and the integrity of his newspapers . In January, 1938, the Tri-City Newspaper Guild at a labor board hearing charged the Gannett firm with using stool- pigeons, strike breakers, and finks during a printers' strike, and with the discriminatory discharge of Guild members, no less than twenty-seven of the twenty-nine persons fired when the Press and News were amalgamated being members of the organization . The Guild accused the editors and publishers of a three-year campaign aimed at breaking one of the strong-"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"GANNETT : CHAIN LORD \t 209 est newspaper groups in the country . The Gannett firm of course denied that unfair labor practices had been employed, but it could not deny the firing of twenty-nine men . Nor the fact that Mr . Gannett was planning to devote his millions for charitable purposes-after he died . Also, shortly after this wholesale discharge of employees, Gannett went deep into political waters with a recovery plan in which profit sharing of capital and labor was one of the main points . It would, he said, \"establish confidence between labor and capital and promote friendly relations and bring about real co-operation for the production of more wealth .\" One can justly ask whether this was mere mental confusion or Machiavellianism . At home Mr . Gannett was fighting labor, firing his men, but at the Union League Club of Chi- cago he was speaking for sharing the wealth of production with labor . The rest of Gannett's political credo was mostly pro-big business . It consists of the following points : I . Abolish sur- plus profit tax and capital gains tax . 2 . Abandon economy of scarcity . g . Encourage business and help make business profit- able . 4 . Encourage distribution of profits among workers . 5 . Cut down government expenses . 6 . Lessen taxation be- cause it burdens all . 7 . Study English system of labor rela- tions and adopt English system of compulsory arbitration . 8 . Establish honest monetary system . g . Set up long-term planning board to handle public works, high-speed toll roads . I o . Set up central information bureau on production and consumption in order to help business stabilize production .

His first move was to write $5,000 prominent men to help his drive against the reform of the Supreme Court, his second was to fight the Reorganization Bill . This fight, as is now generally known, was directed not so much against a neces- sary measure as against the Roosevelt idea of government by reform . Gannett sent every editor in the country an appeal to help the National Committee to Uphold Constitutional Government, as he called his organization . Most editors who replied were favorable . An exception was William T . Evjue of the Progressive who wrote Gannett that \"he and the crowd surrounding him are actuated by special interest in fighting Roosevelt . . . .

Among those who denied the Senate's power to issue sub- poenas duces tecum and to ask indiscreet questions was Gan- nett's manager of the committee, a certain Dr . Edward A . Rumely, a wartime pro-German propagandist who with the aid of pro-Germans bought the New York Evening Mail for the purpose of presenting the Kaiser's cause . Mussolini had sold out to the French foreign office and thousands of editors and publishers everywhere were being bought by either the Kaiser or the Northcliffe commission, but it was unfortunate for Doctor Rumely that he was on the wrong side because he was convicted of trading with the enemy and sentenced to serve a year and a day in the Federal penitentiary in Atlanta . Among the measures Rumely admitted his committee fought against was the first wages and hours bill . Senator Minton in a radio address said, \"Don't be misled by Mr .

Minton and fellow Senators demanded the facts about the men and money behind Gannett, but the humanitarian re- plied by shouting \"Fascist dictatorship\" and \"Stalin OGPU\" at the inquisitors . The truth never came out . It is known that a huge sum was spent and that the Reorganization Bill, which conservative weekly Time admitted was \"a straight- forward attempt to increase efficiency,\" and could not be presented as \"an effort on the part of Franklin Roosevelt to make himself dictator\" was defeated by a combination of publishers and politicians, notably Gannett, Roy Howard, William Randolph Hearst, Paul Block, Dorothy Thompson, Father Coughlin, and other reactionary forces whose claim was exactly that which Time had denied . Gannett accepted his laurels like a modest hero . He made a radio speech in which he fixed the responsibility for the depression on the Roosevelt administration and called the Wagner Act (the Magna Carta of labor in America) \"a potent factor in promoting strife\" which had discouraged produc- tion . This short history of Frank E. Gannett shows that he has fought his own employees, used his newspapers to present his personal views, made use of all the usual typographical de- vices of playing news up or down, that he has made his chain the expression of a narrow and prejudiced policy, that he has never supported liberal measures, and that he has on the other hand advocated ideas inimical to labor . Years earlier he had been in debt heavily to the power and paper trust but within forty-eight hours after an exposure by Federal authorities he switched the loans to a bank .

It gets its Christian Science Monitor for its 2,817 (latest World Almanac figures) Chris- tian Scientists, its Transcript for its Brahmins, its Globe, Post, Herald and Traveler for its bourgeoisie, and its Record and American for those whose mentality hardly rises above the Hearst or comic strip level .

But unlike New York, Boston has no liberal or even semi-liberal newspapers, and it is therefore easier to resort to the crudest methods without fear of colleagual criticism or exposure . Hearst papers in Boston are notorious for \"making\" of the news . Public opinion frequently is influenced by stories which originate not in events but in the minds of editors . On the Hearst papers, says the Institute for Propaganda Analysis, it is the incompetent reporter, indeed, \"who can- not arouse public opinion to fever pitch at twenty minutes' notice, and with only the help of the nearest telephone book .\" The system is simple .

Of course the other newspapers do the same thing when they ride their pet hobby horses into the political arena . In the Hearst press the same trickery is used in the gen- eral Red-baiting campaign in every town . It is very easy to call up the head of the American Legion, the leading Daugh- ter of the American Revolution, the loudest Knight of Co- lumbus or other Catholic organization with which Hearst has worked ever since he married a Catholic, and start a Red scare . The fact that most of the endorsers of Hearst scares made fools of themselves when the campaigns against col- leges, college professors, labor organizations and individuals have been exposed, and Hearst-sponsored legislation has been found to be as stupid as it was sinister, has never de- terred the \"patriots\" from endorsing . In Boston the old-style venality, so usually denied by pub- lishers, still flourishes in the old-style way, with the public utilities, the department stores, the beer manufacturers, and other interests suppressing news right and left-chiefly right . Most of the papers do a little Red-baiting now and then, but the Hearst Boston American leads the pack . Since there is no real liberal paper to criticize it, as there is in other cities, the Hearst sheet is more reckless and vicious in its methods . One of its tricks is to manufacture the news .

The appoint- ment of Granville Hicks to a fellowship at Harvard Uni- versity was an example . Hicks is one of the leading literary critics in America . He happens to belong to the Communist party, just as other literary figures and Harvard professors happen to belong to the Republican and Democratic parties . Under the law of the land these three parties are equal in everything, and membership in one or the other cannot be a bar to the enjoyment of everything the Constitution guar- antees citizens . This fact, however, is either unknown to or ignored by Hearst editors. And Hearst reporters, who are forever apologizing for the \"dirty\" things they have to do in the Hearst service-the hounding of Lindbergh is the best example-instigated actions in Boston in an effort to drive Hicks out of Harvard . Boston American reporters got twenty members of the Grand Army of the Republic to protest, and then reported the protest as \"spontaneous .\" They also in- fluenced the Watertown Lodge of Elks to take similar action . The national commander of the American Legion, Daniel J . Doherty, whom decent and intelligent well-wishers of the Legion expected to put an end to its long records of Red- baiting, joined the Hearst movement . But even that was not enough for Hearst . Someone on the American got the brilliant idea that there should be a student revolt . Accordingly the reporters were sent out to stir one up . They circulated in Harvard Yard with petitions, asking all and sundry to attach their names . But even the conservative lads who people Harvard now- adays are getting too wise to play the stooges for Hearst news- papers, and very few lent their rich and aristocratic names to the American's representative .

And that was the end of Hearst trickery in that affair . However, on the second of May the Hearst press in Boston notably and in New York and elsewhere to some extent, had another chance for sensational Red-baiting . The news fact concerned an attack on three nuns near Sts . Peter and Paul Cathedral in Providence . It is a fact that Bishop Francis P . Keough told the press he \"suspected\" the attack to be due to a campaign by Communists, a charge for which he had no ground whatsoever except his own hatred of Communists . However, the slanderous charge made by a high clergyman gave that section of the press which also engages in Red- baiting an opportunity to do so and lay the blame on a per- son of some standing in the community . The Hearst head- lines were disgraceful . The story was proven false . And the next day when Phil Frankfeld, secretary of the Massachusetts Communist party, protested the \"false, deliberately mis- leading and slanderous charge,\" there was no mention of that in most Hearst papers . The Boston Transcript For many years the Boston Transcript has had the reputa- tion of being the journal of the Brahmins ; in more recent times it has become a little more popular in its headlines and makeup, but it is still the only newspaper which one can pick up and read a head such as the following : INERTES, IGNAVE FUIMUS : OPERAE PRETIUM FUIT De Praeteritorum Memoria per Annos Quator in Collegio Harvardiensi"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"218 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS Underneath, in the issue of June 24, 1937, followed the Harvard Commencement Latin oration by Laird McK .

Some years ago when Dr . Charles Harrington, health officer, investigated the breweries and found that beer was being adulterated with salicylic and fluoric acids, he suc- ceeded in getting jury indictments . Hearst published the facts because he was starting a campaign for circulation .

In both instances the Boston papers and notably the Transcript carried beer advertisements of these concerns . In the first instance the Transcript published a list of indict- ments, cutting out the name of the advertiser . Three days after the Harvard Beer indictment, moreover, the good old Transcript carried the first of a series of larger- than-usual advertisements which proclaimed \"Harvard Beer, i,ooo per cent Pure .\" Today I doubt the possibility of Harvard Beer or any other advertiser being able to suppress an important news item in the Transcript .

However, there is some hope that the reorganization (September 1938) will be fol- lowed by a more liberal policy . The Christian Science Monitor The Christian Science Monitor is unique . It is the only national newspaper we have-the New York Times has a national influence and can be called a national newspaper on that account, but it is not published for national circula- tion as is the Monitor . The latter is also a non-commercial enterprise . It is therefore one of the few papers which can call itself free . The only chains it wears is that of the church which subsidizes it . A circulation of about 125,000 is nothing compared to any of the mob newspapers, but nevertheless the Monitor is probably as powerful an organ as a combination of papers serving many millions . Every subscriber to the Christian Science journal can be put down as a man or woman belong- ing to the upper brackets in the income tax returns ; of con- siderable culture and intelligence, and an influence in local or national affairs . There are practically no poor Christian Scientists in America, and none with the low I . Q . which make up the readership of the yellow press . Oswald Garrison Villard who wrote an essay on the Monitor many years ago said he was \"hopeful that in the future struggle between the two great groups of thought in America, between the powers of privilege and the masses of the people,\" this paper's voice \"will be heard on the side of the masses rather than of the privileged,\" but that day has not yet arrived .

The paper was established \"to publish the real news of the world in clean, wholesome manner, de- void of the sensation methods . . . . No exploitation or illus- tration of vice or crime, but the aim of the editors will be to issue a paper which will be welcomed in every home where purity and refinement are cherished ideals .\" Christian Science itself is expounded in only a few columns on one page . The rest of the paper is a newspaper . There are of course tremendous censorships at work, not the least of which are against fraudulent advertising . There is no drug advertising whatever of course, and none of the phony sales by department and other stores which contribute so much of the revenue of the commercial newspaper .

Rose closes his criticism with an apostrophe . He ex- claims : \"If these three things could be eliminated from the thoughts and motives of mankind . . . 1\" It is impossible to imagine any advertising man except the Monitor's expressing such an ideal thought . In its news columns the Monitor has always given space to peace in the midst of all wars . In 1935 it covered the Italian attack on Ethiopia thoroughly and fairly . It published an editorial the first day saying : \"In reporting as a news- paper the story of warlike measures or war, the Monitor as a Christian Science publication, also bespeaks its readers' at- tention to the fact of peace .\" More analytically than most papers it published the basic causes of the war and showed the part the munitions trade is playing throughout the world . In national and local politics the Monitor is independent . This means independent in the dictionary sense, not in the sense of a great number of our newspapers which so style themselves despite an unbroken record of subservience to the political machines, both Democratic and Republican . The Monitor is sold on its merits . The church does not ask anyone to buy it . Many non-Scientists also believe it is the ideal newspaper of our time and of all times .

The Boston Daily Record Guild thereupon countersigned a letter from Harry Benwell in which he said : \"I am going to mind my own damn business . . . . The late Mr . Leider may have been a hero but the fact he gave his life fighting for Spanish Communists is nothing for Ameri- can newspapermen to get excited about . . . . It seems to me it is going to be difficult to put ourselves over with publishers if we openly align ourselves with Reds whose avowed pur- pose it is to overturn capitalism . . . .\" In December, 1937, the Daily Record and the American Guilds quit the national organization and joined the Amer- ican Federation of Labor . Telegrams from the Hearst Mirror and Journal-American units in New York asking Boston to remain in the C . I . 0 . were left unanswered .

When the WPA guidebook published the mildest sort of factual statement about the Sacco-Vanzetti case-the judicial murder of two radicals whose innocence has been proven beyond the shadow of question-the Boston press, excepting of course the intelligent Monitor, grew hysterical at what it considered an insult to the great com- monwealth of Massachusetts .

Is there no good news at all, they may ask . Is there no hope for a better day and a better press? The answer is that there is really cause for optimism . It is the answer based on the case history of William Randolph Hearst, the first of the great press lords, ruler of a $220,000 ; 000 domain, against whom an enlightened people has at last voiced its anger and disgust . From California to New York, labor and liberals, the unions and the universities, notable men including the President and Senators and the head of the Society of Newspaper Editors, hundreds of organizations and thousands of men and women who are the leaders of the intelligent minority, have taken a forthright stand against Hearst . There has been a great boycott of his newspapers, his magazines, his newsreels and his radio stations . There has been repudiation in Congress, in the press, on the platform and from the pulpit . The episode is one of the most hearten- ing in the history of American journalism . For more than a generation Hearst posed as \"the friend of the people\" and many believed him . The Hearst communi- cation system reached at least 30,000,000 people-he claimed that many readers for his newspapers, and many more mil- lions for his magazines, newsreels and radio broadcasts . His power was supposedly tremendous . But less than five years 227"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"228 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS ago certain leaders made the charge that Hearst actually is the enemy of the people . In recent days he has been called the nation's No . i enemy, a place previously held by Al Capone and Dillinger . The latter two, the reader need not be reminded, were connected with bootlegging and murder, whereas Mr . Hearst has been connected merely with in- fluencing the minds of the common people . It is of course difficult to say just when the counter-attack began . It must not be forgotten that Hearst has been repudiated before ; he was twice hanged in effigy by angry mobs, once when a demented person shot President McKin- ley after the Hearst papers had published vicious editorials against the President, and a verse about the bullet which had shot a governor speeding its way to Washington ; the second time when he espoused the German cause before Wilson led his pacifist nation into the useless World War . These popular uprisings against Hearst did not affect his empire . Nothing is as fickle as the public, nothing as forgetful, nothing as easily misled . But the third, or present attack on Hearst, is made up of something more than emotion and hysteria . It is first and most important of all, a labor union attack„ in which American Federation of Labor, C . I . 0 ., and in- dependent labor organizations are united . It is also an at- tack from the schools and colleges of the country . It was in 1936 an attack from political leaders also, but that is the sort of reaction which may mean absolutely nothing in the end . The strength of the war against Hearst is the labor and intellectual union against him . The most important individual blow was that struck by two private citizens, Bernard J . Reis, the certified public accountant and author of an enlightening book on crooked finances called \"False Security,\" and Paul Kern, civil service commissioner of New York City . Mr . Hearst had applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to float $22,500,000 in bonds for Hearst Publications and $13 ; 000,000 for Hearst Magazines . Mr . Reis, who can read"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"FAREWELL : LORD OF SAN SIMEON \t 229 financial statements between the lines better than most men, objected to a lot of things . He did not like Hearst Publica- tions listing as assets $38,000,000 for good will, franchises, reference libraries ; he did not like the fact that four Hearst magazines lose money and six dailies made less in 1936 than ten years earlier ; he particularly questioned the financial record of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and Chicago Evening Examiner ; he did not like circulation losses on six news- papers which he suspected were due to the growing boycott . Reis and Kern, two public-spirited citizens, filed a brief . They claimed in it that if the money were raised by S . E . C . permission most of it was to be used to purchase a castle in Wales, at a half million more than its assessed valuation, and the good will of a magazine they claimed was losing money ; they also charged that the registration statement failed to dis- close the fact almost four million dollars were intended to repay loans which Hearst personally guaranteed . They were joined by 'Labor Research Association in a protest which alleged that profits of Hearst Magazines, Inc ., were diverted to holding companies and through them to Mr . Hearst . No public hearings were held . The application for the bond issues was withdrawn . And so in 1937 Hearst began a series of consolidations of newspapers in which many were killed off, and a general retrenchment in which thousands of employees were fired . On December 31, 1937, most of the newspapers of the country suppressed the fact that there was a trial in United States District Court in New York in which a receiver for Hearst Consolidated Publications, Inc ., was asked and also an accounting . The plaintiff was a stockholder named Rudolph Kohlroser . Another turning point in Hearst history was his victory in 1934 when the San Francisco general strike was defeated .

The press announced it was a victory for public opinion, for the people, as against the Reds, but the labor unions passed resolutions for a boycott . Hearst, was singled out for marked attention . The \"I Don't Read Hearst\"'sticker was ruled off letters by order of Postmaster General Farley but it could not be ruled out of people's minds . In Bridges' seamen's union it is a crime to be caught dead or alive with a Hearst paper in one's possession . As a result you will find Bridges called a Moscow agent in the Hearst newspapers . By 1936 there was a Peoples Committee Against Hearst functioning and Oswald Garrison Villard reported 112 American Federation of Labor unions were members of the trades-union committee fighting the publisher . The Farmer Labor Progressive Federation, meeting in Oshkosh, Wis- consin, passed a resolution to boycott Hearst in which he was called \"Labor's Enemy No . i .\" In numerous meetings in Seattle pending the Post-Intelligencer strike Hearst was known as American Menace No . i .

Ross, of the University of Wisconsin ; Prof . Frederick L . Schuman, of Chicago . Hearst reporters in nu- merous instances have been sent as students to interview pro- fessors or to take courses for the purpose of writing Red- baiting articles . When these reporters found nothing to write about they falsified . In several cases they later confessed . In the case of Professor Schuman he protested misrepre- sentation in a report in the Chicago Herald-Examiner and incidentally informed the editor that some quotations on dictatorship which all the Hearst papers attributed to Lenin were probably false as there was no trace of them in the collected works of the Russian leader . Hearst ordered an in- vestigation . Charles Wheeler was sent . He conceded mis- quoting the Chicago professor and admitted the invention of the Lenin quotation . Professor Schuman asked him how such things could be and quotes Wheeler's reply : \"We just do what the Old Man orders . One week he orders a campaign against rats . The next week he orders a campaign against dope peddlers . Pretty soon he's going to campaign against college professors . It's all the bunk but orders are orders .\" Charles Wheeler, Hearst reporter, appeared to be a decent fellow . But shortly afterward Professor Schuman delivered a lecture which Wheeler covered for the Hearst press . This item is described by Professor Schuman as containing state- ments which were purely products of Mr . Wheeler's imagi- nation . \"On March 16, 1935,\" continues the professor, \"the Herald-Examiner-with Hearst papers elsewhere copying- published an editorial, 'Schuman of Chicago,' which took"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"232 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS out of their context two of Mr .

This strategy is exactly comparable to that of the Nazi press in Germany between 1920 and 1933 . Mr . Hearst has evidently been taking lessons from Goring, Goebbels, Rosen- berg, and Hitler . No individual can defend himself effec- tively from these assaults . If American universities and colleges are to be spared the fate which has befallen such institutions in Germany, if American scholars and educators are to be protected from Fascist bludgeoning of this type, if American traditions of freedom are to survive, Mr . Hearst must be recognized as the propagandist and forerunner of American Hitlerism and must be met with a united counter- attack by all Americans who still value their liberties .\" In 1936 the American Federation of Teachers passed a resolution demanding a boycott of Hearst as \"the outstand- ing jingoist of the country\" and a \"constant enemy of aca- demic freedom,\" and finally and more important, as the \"chief exponent of Fascism in the United States .\" The 1936 political campaign also had something to do with the universal discredit in which Hearst found himself in November of that year . However, politics make strange bed- fellows, and politicians pass from bed to bed without public disapproval . There is for example a certain Alfred Emanuel Smith, a reactionary, a member of the American Liberty League, a millionaire, a Red-baiter, a discredited liberal . In his youth he was on the other side of the fence .

And I know the color of his liver and it is whiter, if that could be, than the driven snow .\" He continued to denounce the Hearst newspapers for publish- ing \"deliberate lies,\" and for \"the gravest abuse of the power of the press in the history of this country .\" For thirty minutes Governor Smith of the State of New York denounced the publisher who was such a power in Tammany Hall, and concluded by asking the people of \"this city, this state, and this country . . . to get rid of this pestilence that walks in the darkness .\" Today Millionaire Smith and Millionaire Hearst have everything in common and each other's endorsement . Perhaps another of the little group of leading Democratic politicians of that era will not emulate Smith the renegade . Franklin Delano Roosevelt who once had the support of Hearst, was forced in the 1936 campaign to issue a state- ment against \"a certain notorious newspaper owner\" who tried to \"make it appear that the President accepts the sup- port of alien organizations hostile to the American form of government . These articles are conceived in malice and born of political spite . They are deliberately framed to give a false impression-in other words to `frame' the American people . . . .\" F . D . Roosevelt thus added his damnation of Hearst to that of Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt, among Presidents . In Congress there were field days when Senator (now Justice) Black was conducting his lobby investigation into Hearst and Associated Gas affairs .

Boston with its cheap politicians, its narrow-minded masses, its prejudices against art and liter- ature, and its domination by a few banks and corporations, can no longer be expected to produce magnificent enlight- ened mass-circulation newspapers, but the Northwest-Ore- gon, Washington, Idaho and Montana-where the liberal spirit finds most favorable soil, ought as a corollary, to pro- duce newspapers at least as liberal as its politics . The spirit of equality and democracy lingers over from covered wagon days and is reflected in much of the liberal legislation of those states .

Similarly, Oregon instituted the direct election of United States Senators before that principle was embodied in the Federal Constitution . The recall of public officials, minimum wage laws, maximum hours of labor, public own- ership of hydroelectric power, old-age pensions : all of these found fertile soil in the vast Northwest . From the Northwest have come such enlightened Senators as the late Harry Lane, who with five others voted against America's declaration of war . Thomas J . Walsh and William E .

By and large, the Congressional delegations of these states are far more liberal than the national average, and nowhere-except perhaps in the Solid South-has the President stronger backing than in the states surrounding Puget Sound . Everyone in the Northwest will admit that it is a progres- sive region . Even Oregon's \"nine-foot-hotel-bed-sheet law\" is sheepishly hailed as a forward step in sanitation . But none of the residents attribute the liberal policies of the Pacific Northwest to the influence of the press . Progress has been made in spite of the newspapers, not because of them . Today few newspapers in the four states have any vestige of the pioneering spirit that marked the old independent editors who set up handpresses and typecases alongside the stage relay station or land office . The papers of the Northwest, with pathetically few exceptions, fight all reforms as tena- ciously as the chain-ridden press of New England .

Each time the sales tax was licked, and each time by a bigger margin . The influence of the editorial page- pride of the elders of the fourth estate-has waned in the Northwest . A flickering bright spot in the fog of journalistic commer- cialization is the few weeklies that maintain the tradition of old when editors set their own type and wrote their own editorials .

The slightest offense by any liberal or progressive is seized upon greedily by the majority of the newspapers of this great, progressive part of the country . When an automobile driven by Harry Bridges killed a boy in an accident, the mis- hap was blazoned in screaming headlines . Bridges was later cleared of blame . But when the young scion of Portland's wealthiest department store family was convicted of a felony in a California court, the people of the city did not learn about it through their newspapers . The vigilant defenders of the freedom of the press were too busy to print that news . It was published in other cities, where that particular depart- ment store, the largest in Portland, did not buy advertising . The most active of Oregon's newspapers politically is the Oregon Journal . Its principal owner is Philip L . Jackson, known about town as \"Phil .\" He inherited the paper from his father, who built it into a powerful publication by being for \"Battling Bob\" La Follette and Harry Lane and Tom Walsh and other progressives in public life . But \"Phil\" in- herited only the paper and not these enlightened tendencies . He is a playboy sort of fellow who loves to play at being \"admiral\" at various regattas held to publicize commercial- ized beach and lake resorts . The journal could not find space to tell its readers what happened to the son of the great department-store family, but it always manages to devote plenty of space to a picture of \"Admiral Phil\" surrounded by the toothsome beauties who comprise his lovely crew . Various other of \"Phil's\" enlightened deeds, such as giving a water cart to the University football team, a professional outfit largely recruited from other states, are amply publi- cized in the newspaper he inherited .

But as the President stead- ily adopted liberal policies, the sham ended . \"Phil\" made the paper's real hero Governor Charles H . Martin, probably the most reactionary man ever to hold public office in the Far West . After being elected by posing as a friend of President Roosevelt, Martin, a retired major-general, turned into a virtual autocrat . He inferentially commended the handling of labor problems by Hitler and Mussolini ; he advised the state police to move against labor pickets and \"beat hell out of 'em\" and \"crack their damn heads\" and he assailed the New Deal with such temperate language as remarking he would like \"to kick the pants off the National Labor Rela- tions Board .\" The Journal made this hero its own, and con- veniently neglected to print Martin's advice to a sheriffs' convention : \"The Italians wouldn't submit ; they organized their Black- shirts . The Germans wouldn't submit ; so they had their Brownshirts and Hitler . I don't think the Americans will submit .\" When Martin ran for renomination in the Democratic primaries recently, the Journal descended to new depths of journalistic indecency . The rumor spread around the state that President Roosevelt was about to thrust at the milita- ristic Governor who had run out on the New Deal . Martin's furious denial was smeared at the top of page i . The President's thrust at Martin a few days later was shoved into an inconspicuous head . Ralph Watson, \"Phil's\" slavishly reactionary political writer, was turned loose to smear Henry Hess, the progressive nominee .

On election day Hess won decisively . Newspapers are always looking for scoops . But not when the scoop augurs well for liberalism . The Portland News- Telegram, of the Scripps-Canfield chain, buys the \"Washing- ton Merry-Go-Round\" column by the widely known liberal writers, Drew Pearson and Robert S . Allen. Shortly before the Martin-Hess election, their column predicted that the New Deal was washed up with Martin's reactionary policies . It was a clean beat, and preceded by nearly a week a direct attack on Martin led by the President, Secretary Ickes and Senator Norris . It was a national scoop . The News-Telegram killed it in Portland . The people of Oregon would never have known about the column had not the Oregonian, a rival newspaper, seen it elsewhere and reprinted it . The News- Telegram is one of the Northwest's most militant defenders of the freedom of the press ; its editor, Tom Shea, is a former football game official . The Oregonian, at Portland, is one of the strange news- papers on America's last frontier . It is extremely unobjective and biased in its attitude toward the New Deal . But it also is one of the few papers in the country that sincerely cham- pions the liberties of the underdog . It led a campaign which resulted finally in the Supreme Court decision outlawing Oregon's abortive Criminal Syndicalism law . It also has been more outspoken than any other paper on the Pacific Coast in its defense of the Spanish Loyalists . The Oregonian sponsored a crusade in Portland which resulted in the cur- tailment and abolition of that city's vicious police Red- squad . In both editorials and feature stories the paper showed that the Red-squad was financed by leading lumber barons and anti-union employers who wanted to prevent the organization of their employees . The editor of the Oregonian is a liberal of the old school named Paul Kelty . He fears that the New Deal has taken away liberty, and he"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"248 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS looks back to the day that is gone-the day when a merchant owning a corner store could thrive and succeed and prosper and become a successful man . Kelty works with the Civil Liberties Union in Portland, and vigilante activities always draw his fire . His editorials lambasting the Dies Committee were the best in the Far West along that line . The Ore- gonian also conducts its news columns objectively and re- fuses to make them propaganda for special interests . For the past decade or so the Oregonian has been held under a trust . Now the trust is coming to an end, and the ownership of the paper will revert to a group of wealthy families . They seem to have their eyes on the main chance, and already have enlisted the services of the eminent ex- Hearst efficiency expert, Guy T . Visknisski, who is expected to make a lot of recommendations which may improve the paper as a commercial venture but certainly not as a pur- veyor of information . IF The high hopes for a liberal journalistic force in the Northwest which were occasioned by the appointment of the President's son-in-law as editor of the Seattle Post-Intelli- gencer, have given way to pessimism and sour laughter . Incidentally, the first persons who expressed their doubts about John Boettiger were his employees . The newspaper writers have had difficulties with their new boss, and it is their opinion that any employer who cannot make a satis- factory deal with his men and win their friendship is no friend of labor, and therefore his position as a progressive and a liberal must be ambiguous . Hearst chose Boettiger after the 1936 election . Boettiger had been one of the Chicago Tribune's Washington New Deal baiting crew ; apparently he was fighting Franklin D . Roosevelt while courting Anna Roosevelt Dahl, but once given the editorship of the Post-Intelligencer, it was expected"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"NORTHWEST : LIBERAL DESPITE THE PRESS 249 that there would be a change in Boettiger's political view- point . Unfortunately, however, Boettiger made his first alliances with Dave Beck, the American Federation of Labor Boss, and Mayor Dore, two of the most powerful enemies of the progressive labor movement in America . In his new book, \"Our Promised Land,\" which magnifi- cently tells the story of the Northwest, Richard L . Neu- berger explains the failure of the new editor to live up to liberal expectations . Boettiger, writes Neuberger, \"has been in frequent skirmishes with the National Labor Relations Board because of his refusals to bargain with the American Newspaper Guild . Each time he appears before the board some of Seattle's citizens muse on the curious fact that he is the son-in-law of the most important advocate of collective bargaining in the nation's history .\" A lumberjack wrote in the Timber Worker that he had encountered hard-boiled bosses in the woods but none tougher than the President's son-in-law . Whether Dave Beck took Boettiger into camp or vice versa, is unimportant, but \"the two are now boon companions and apparently it pays,\" reported the Washing- ton Merry-Go-Round, and the Guild Reporter noted that when Pegler wrote some columns attacking Beck's kind of labor movement they were \"omitted and distorted in Boetti- ger's paper .\" Neuberger gives most amusing details of how both Boetti- ger and his wife, writing her \"Homemakers\" section under the name Anna Roosevelt, exploit both the President and Mrs . Eleanor Roosevelt in their news and feature columns, but when it comes to real support to the important policies and reforms which the President initiates or the First Lady advocates, the Boettigers, who cannot of course join the anti- New Deal press in howling, content themselves with sup- port which is \"scarcely perfunctory .\" Two great topics agitate the progressive Northwest, electric power and lumber .* It is to the public benefit that power * Miss Ellen McGrath of Seattle has written a long report for me of which the following pages are a part ."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"250 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS remain publicly owned, and that the lumber companies do not destroy all the timber, but if the policies of newspapers are studied, it will be found that they are usually on the side of the privately owned electric light and timber corporations . The most recent example of timber control of Washing- ton newspapers, outside routine strike news coverage which is not peculiar to Washington, is the position they took in the Olympic National Park question . Conservationists wanted to save the last stand of giant fir and hemlock in the West, but lumbermen looked with avaricious eyes upon those giant trees, some 40 feet in circumference, centuries old when Columbus discovered America . The newspapers lined up solidly . Including the timber in the park they said editorially, was not for the public welfare . Ickes was misquoted, and when he protested, Boettiger at- tacked Ickes, but later he incorporated in his own banquet speech some phrases made by the Secretary of the Interior . The darkest chapters in the history of Washington State, the Centralia and Everett massacres, are properly laid at the door of the timber men's fight against union organization of sawmills and logging camps . Both massacres were white- washed by the press . In Centralia vigilantes including members of an American Legion post lynched a member of the Industrial Workers of the World after torturing him for a day and night .

On this basis they assure the people that they must be acting in the public interest else those particular papers would not be against them .

Stahlman proclaims himself a friend of labor when all his actions prove him to be the enemy of labor . He resents that classification . In one of his press association orations he called \"editorial dis- honesty\" an editorial in an unnamed paper which said Stahl- man is \"one of the most rabid open-shoppers in the coun- try .\" Recently liberal weeklies have published a photostat of a letter in which Stahlman's Banner asks that non-union men only be sent for jobs in the typographical department . He cannot deny that his paper broke the union there, refused to employ union men, fought the unions and maintained an anti-union editorial policy, but he gets angry when he is called an \"open-shopper .\" The Nashville Banner locked out its employees in 1929 and imported a gang of strikebreakers . The management re- fused to hire composing room workers without first checking their pasts for evidence of pro-union tendencies . Union men had no chance .

But the latter newspaper dropped eight men from its editorial department and eight or ten from its business and circulation departments, and the Banner also discharged many employees . But that was not news . Nor was it news for the Editor & Publisher and other spokesmen of the owners that the commercial arrangements of the two rival newspapers in an important southern city also put the dominant business interests in control of all the means of journalistic power, as the Guild Reporter pointed out . \"The coalition,\" it said, \"includes notably men promi- nent in the power and utilities industries-the TVA fight is hot in Nashville-and in banking, in addition to the news- paper industry itself .

He had also been a director of the Tennessee Electric Light Company, and it may be a coincidence that Stahlman has been friendly to this public utility . It is interesting to note that in an attempt to get the Tennessean back, its former owner filed a brief in which it is stated * that \"Defendant avers that on account of the position of said Paul M .

The way the two newspapers and big business went about it was so crude that its innate hypocrisy over- whelmed it . The idea was announced by Banker Brown at a Chamber of Commerce meeting ; it was proposed to issue a \"call to righteousness\" in which the leading ministers, the Chamber of Commerce, and the two newspapers would co- operate for the purpose of stilling the labor unrest in the loo leading industrial plants of the section . The Banner and Tennessean did not publish this fact, of course, but issued the religious appeal later without mentioning the ulterior motive . But the C .

Louis Post-Dis- patch . It was intended to be the most optimistic of the few chapters devoted to the brighter chambers in the House of Lords . The defeat of Hearst, the strictures on the present situation by William Allen White, were to be followed by the story of prosperity and absolute freedom in a great news- paper, namely, the P .-D . When the World died in 1931 journalists tried to appor- tion the blame : some said it was due to Ralph Pulitzer be- cause he had not inherited either his father's talents or en- thusiasm and because he preferred to play the role of absentee landlord, devoting himself to his clubs or his country home ; others laid the blame on Herbert Bayard Swope, the executive editor, who apparently had a deeper interest in Wall Street and Park Avenue than in Park Row, and still others blamed Walter Lippmann, the chief editorial writer, who was becoming a master of straddling and there- fore losing for the paper its great reputation of fearlessness, courage, and forthrightness . The World may not have been the great newspaper which we think it today, but it was something to measure the press by, just as the Manchester Guardian, which also is not without its faults and weaknesses, is used as a standard for 264"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"\"POST-DISPATCH,\" OR ABSENTEE LANDLORDISM 265 Europe . In America, when the World passed out, there was satisfaction in knowing that the Pulitzer tradition would be carried on in the Post-Dispatch . And it was carried on . As late as a year ago the only thing I intended to deplore was the fact that the Post-Dispatch was physically in St . Louis, that despite the fact that it was great and fearless and free, it was provincial, that America being what it is geographi- cally, it is impossible for a newspaper, although it may be the greatest in the country, to exercise a great power if its circulation is confined to a Middle-Western state . The St . Louis Post-Dispatch, transferred to New York or perhaps Washington, would have been the most important news- paper in America . I regret to state that considerable doubt, if not consider- able disillusion, has entered the situation . Under Joseph Pulitzer's will his youngest son, Herbert, was given six-tenths of the estate-the great publisher be- lieved in a myth which he thought scientific truth, namely, that the child of late years inherited the greater mental and physical vigor-while Ralph and Joseph Pulitzer got two- tenths and one-tenth respectively, the last tenth being a gift to the executives of the Post-Dispatch staff . Herbert tried his hand at journalism . In 1921, when Russia was open, he went as World correspondent and later worked in the World office in New York . But it was defi- nitely not his metier . Ralph ran the World, and ran it to death . Joseph made a great success of the Post-Dispatch . Herbert and Ralph never visited St . Louis . Joseph lived there, but in recent years he spent half his time in his country home at Bar Harbor . As Maine goes so go the natives of Maine . In October, 1936, within a few days of the great election, Joseph Pulitzer returned to St . Louis to give the Post-Dispatch a final Landon spurt . That was the sentiment of Bar Harbor . It was the yacht club sentiment, the absentee landlord sentiment . Some time earlier the Post-Dispatch had abandoned the"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"266 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS Democratic party policy, ceased its support of President Roosevelt and the New Deal, but unlike the Baltimore Sun it did not straddle the issue of supporting Landon fervently . It also raised the shout that the President was growing dictatorial, it accused him of dangerously centraliz- ing governmental power over the economic life of the country . \"To what extent the absentee owners dictate the policies of the paper,\" writes Paul Y . Anderson, \"has always been a mystery to its employees . There is no doubt however, that all three brothers concurred in the decision to desert the New Deal . Since that time the policy of the paper has steadily become more conservative-more on the side of property rights and the vested interests .\" In fact the aban- donment of liberalism occurred two years earlier, in 1934, Anderson states, when the late Clark McAdams was de- moted as editor of the editorial page . McAdams was a liberal and a crusader . He was ioo percent for the New Deal . The Brothers Pulitzer in their yachts, their clubs and their palaces, had begun to waver . V If it is wrong to create personal devils, it may be just as bad to make personal heroes . Newspapers are not only the prolongation of the characters of their owners, but of the forces which are stronger than men, and when they are good, or bad, liberal or conservative, pro-public or pro-public utility, it is due to a combination of many things, material and psychological and what not . For many decades the Post-Dispatch was an ideal news- paper. Whatever mistakes it made were human errors, of which journals as well as men are capable ; they were not actions dictated by an owner serving outside interests or, at the very best, his own egotism . Venality never entered the doors of the editorial sanctum ."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"\"POST-DISPATCH, \" OR ABSENTEE LANDLORDISM 267 The best proof that the Post-Dispatch was a free news- paper was the angry report of the Missouri head of the propaganda bureau operated by the National Electric Light Association, in which he complained that he had not been able to corrupt this newspaper . He did claim that he had \"reached\" all the other daily and weekly publications in the state, some 700, and failed only in this one instance . It is probable that there were a few other publications which refused part of the $25,000,000 a year public utility corrup- tion fund, but it is unquestioned that the Post-Dispatch angrily threw the propagandists and their money out of the office . (In the case of several Chicago, New York and other great dailies the N . E. L . A . probably did not corrupt by buying advertising space, but their propaganda was used willingly by editors . This is not corruption, this is part of the big business finance system under which we live .) Refusal to be bribed is negative : the Post-Dispatch went after the corrupting elements ; it fought them in every field in which they existed, from national politics to petty rack- eteering . Take Teapot Dome, for instance . I have given credit to Carl Magee of Albuquerque for unearthing the scandal when he followed his feud with Secretary Fall . Magee un- earthed the scandal but it was the Post-Dispatch which forced the investigation of the Ohio gang by producing enough evidence to make the attempt by the New York Times, Washington Post, Philadelphia Public Ledger and other con- servative big business newspapers to squash it look ridicu- lous . It was Paul Y . Anderson, Washington correspondent of the Post-Dispatch, who gave the Teapot Dome scandal air after the Ohio gang had succeeded in silencing the first re- ports of vast corruption . It was also Mr . Anderson who in 1927 exposed the State Department for fostering a Red scare in Mexico on behalf of the American oil corporations which wanted an excuse for invasion and inevitable war and an-"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"268 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS nexation . It was also Anderson who exposed the Chicago police as guilty - of massacre in the notorious Republic Steel Company Memorial Day rioting which the Chicago Tribune had defended . And it was John Rogers who exposed Lingle, the Chicago Tribune reporter, as a racketeer, and it was Rogers who helped get the evidence in many other great exposes . I could go on for pages telling stories of what reporters of the Post-Dispatch have done, all the way from exposing the political corruption such as the Pendergast machine, the Kelly machine, the Hague machine, down to some local kidnaping which involved no political party and no big money . The Ku Klux Klan was exposed by the Pulitzer papers first . Federal Judge George W . English was im- peached by the Post-Dispatch . And something of a like na- ture was happening every week in St . Louis . All this work-it got the Post-Dispatch the reputation of being the outstanding \"crusading\" newspaper in America, but its managing editor denies the predicate-adjective-was done under the direction of Oliver K . Bovard . \"Honor where honor is due,\" Anderson wrote as a valedictory to the most famous managing editor in America ; \"for most of the distinc- tions which have come to Post-Dispatch men, Bovard is en- titled to a large share of the credit . He would show a reporter how to pull off a terrific story-and then insist that the re- porter be given a salary increase for pulling it . . . . If there was anything on which he set more store than professional skill-good craftsmanship-it was truth . And when I say `truth' I also mean precision and exactitude to the limit of human performance . He would fire a man for failing to get a middle initial-or getting it wrong . In the larger aspects of truth he was even more severe .\" Bovard made it his business to eliminate the barriers be- tween news and truth . It is news, for example, that a Ku Klux Klan parade took place, or that Kluxers burned a"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"\"POST-DISPATCH,\" OR ABSENTEE LANDLORDISM 269 fiery cross, or that they committed a certain crime . That is all surface news . Behind it is the news of who the leaders are, how they organize, what financial interests are involved, what their objectives are, what the social, economic and political significances are . And in Bovard's opinion the news behind the news was the real story, the true story . The newspaper that went out attacking corruption was all right, it was a crusading newspaper, it did the public a service . But the newspaper that disregarded all the corrupting forces, notably the big money, and in addition to the surface facts published the hidden facts, the cause of the effect, that was a true newspaper, and not at all a crusading newspaper . That was Bovard's idea, and he made it work for almost forty years . The more he saw of the pressures which change policies, the more determined he was to keep away from all contact with men and forces which might influence his one policy : to tell the real story . He saw fellow editors joining clubs, flitting about in society, he saw a noted columnist playing polo, he found a noted colleague giving more attention to his Wall Street investments than his editorial page, and it made him more determined than ever to steer clear of en- tangling alliances . He avoided associations \"which might embarrass him in his single-minded determination to get and print all the news .\" For a quarter of a century Bovard, says Anderson, exercised as much influence on the daily lives of St . Louisans as any individual in the city . He also exercised an influence on the journalism of the nation . IF If honor goes to Bovard for the great work for which two of his reporters won Pulitzer prizes and for publishing a really free and uncensored newspaper-uncensored by pub- lishers, advertisers, or the spirit of the times-then in turn"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"270 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS there must be honor for the owners of a big property which can permit this freedom . Therefore the three Pulitzer sons, Herbert, Ralph and Joseph, and especially Joseph who is editor and publisher, were deserving . of great honor . But after thirty years of stamping his character and ideals on the Post-Dispatch, O . K . Bovard on the first of August, 1938, posted a notice on the bulletin board saying : \"To the staff : With regret I have to tell you that I have resigned because of irreconcilable differences of opinion with Mr . Pulitzer as to the general conduct of the paper, and am leav- ing the office August 13th . I recognize and respect the rights and responsibilities of ownership and make no complaint . I salute you, a splendid body of men and an exceptional newspaper staff . . . .\" On another occasion Bovard had also electrified his staff with one of his bulletin board notices . On election night, 1936, when the electoral vote avalanche spoke for Roosevelt, he wrote this announcement : The Country \t 523 The Country Club \t 8 Can there possibly be any relationship between these two bulletin board notices of 1936 and 1938? Anderson, who now represents the St . Louis Star-Times in Washington, says that \"in recent years Bovard has been taking a deep interest in politics and economics, he has studied the great economists not forgetting one named Karl Marx, and he has made several visits to Russia to see how the theory was working out . \"During these years members of the Post-Dispatch staff received a distinct impression that Joseph Pulitzer was torn by conflicting emotions-apprehension over the deepening `radicalism' of his managing editor, and fear that the paper could not survive without him .\" Mr . Pulitzer referred to \"honest differences of opinion\" when he accepted Bovard's"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"\"POST-DISPATCH,\" OR ABSENTEE LANDLORDISM 271 resignation, which referred to \"irreconcilable differences of opinion with Mr . Pulitzer .\" No other statement was forth- coming . But Mr . Anderson says \"the nature of those differ- ences is no secret . They are economic and political .\" The Post-Dispatch has grown more and more concerned with property rights and the vested interests . Naturally honest differences of opinion have become irreconcilable differ- ences, and the most distinguished managing editor in Amer- ica resigned because he could no longer maintain his policy, which was inimical to the special interests . The tragedy is all the greater because in all discussions of a free press up to now it was customary to point to the Post-Dispatch as the almost unique example of prosperity accompanying a policy of public welfare . Following Mr . Bovard's resignation the entire staff rushed into the Newspaper Guild . Previously a large number of reporters, owing to some mistaken sense of loyalty, had re- frained from joining . To New York Guildsmen Bovard made a statement which had a thundering effect throughout the country . \"It's inevitable, why discuss it,\" he said of the Guild shop . As for the Guild itself, he said it \"has proved a good thing for newspapermen . The need for it was obvious . I think it may also prove to be a good thing for newspapers . The ideals of newspapers which the mass of newspapermen hold are high . Because of this I look for the Guild to become in time influential in elevating the tone of the press as a whole ; to aid in making it more journalistic and less com- mercial .\" On his way to Europe for his first real holiday in forty years, Bovard was captured by my friend Kyle Crichton and taken to my apartment where we argued freedom of the press until 4 A .

Bovard went away still maintaining that it is possible under the present economic system to run a wholly free newspaper which will make money despite all social, economic and other pressures .

He is not a press lord . He is a small-town editor and pub- lisher . It is perhaps the most unfortunate thing in our modern newspaper history that White chose to remain in Kansas . If he had accepted an editorship in New York, or Chicago, or St . Louis, and produced a national newspaper as honest, sincere, liberal and altogether free as his Emporia Gazette, it would have been the greatest achievement of our journalistic times . As it is, William Allen White himself is a national figure, but his newspaper has no influence outside Kansas . Em- poria's gain is America's loss . What are Mr . White's views on the newspaper problem in America today? He believes that the press has become too commercial, he sees that it is losing its influence because it is not keeping faith with the people, he notes the conflict of labor and capital, and finds that capitalism has gotten control of our press . In fact Mr . White at times goes further in his criticism and strictures on our press and our press lords, than the present writer, and since he is the president of the Society of Newspaper Editors and dean of American publishers, it might pay us to listen to his exact words . The Curse of Wealth In a letter to Alfred McK . Lee for his history of American journalism, Mr . White says the real threat to freedom of the 272"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"WILLIAM ALLEN WHITE : ANTI-PRESS LORD 273 press lies in the publishers themselves . He continues : \"Too often the publisher of an American newspaper has made his money in some other calling than journalism . He is a rich man seeking power and prestige . He has the country club complex . The business manager of this absentee owner quickly is afflicted with the country club point of view . Soon the managing editor's wife puts him in the country club, and then the city editor's wife nags him into it . And they all get the unconscious arrogance of conscious wealth . Therefore it is hard to get a modern American newspaper to go the distance necessary to print all the news about many topics . \" . . . On the whole, sooner or later in the long run, the American people do get the truth . But they often get it when it is cold potatoes, and does them no good .\" Mr . Lee suggests that \"Some would substitute, in the case of employees, the `conscious arrogance of expected wealth' for the `unconscious arrogance of conscious wealth .' It would be a little more accurate .\" This conscious arrogance of expected wealth is particu- larly noticeable in the Scripps-Howard United Press organ- ization . Favors the Newspaper Guild Most of the publishers hate the Newspaper Guild, and fight labor unionization generally . Mr . White takes an op- posite stand : \"I believe the union principle is right, and I don't feel the coming of the union, even a vertical union, in the news- paper business, will affect the freedom of the press . \"As a matter of fact, it will be God's unmixed blessing if the newspaper owner who generally buys a newspaper for social or business reasons, can feel at the back of his neck the hot breath of the disapproval of the force when he gets too class-conscious, when he goes too obviously country-clubby,"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"274 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS and too strongly pro-clearing-house and chamber of com- merce in his proprietary attitude . . . . \"After all, Jesus had the goods on the rich man . . . .\" Of the conflict between the press House of Lords and the Guild, Mr . White says : \"It is a typical conflict . It is the conflict between ownership and public interest . It is the gist of all the issues that will come up during your whole life . There is something, indeed there is much, to be said for ownership, but ownership without a considerable considera- tion of public interest, is probably going to be decided by the American people to be an archaic hangover from feudalism .\" Free Press Enemy: Commercialism Mr . White was the first of the owners to admit that com- mercialism means the ruin of a free press . When Munsey (who wrecked many great papers which were inimical to big money) died in 1925, White wrote : \"Frank Munsey, the great publisher, is dead . \"Frank Munsey contributed to the journalism of his day the talent of a meat packer, the morals of a money changer and the manners of an undertaker . He and his kind have about succeeded in transforming a once-noble profession into an eight percent security . \"May he rest in trust .\" For the past decade Mr . White has spoken more and more bitterly and openly against the money power in journalism . He is almost unique among publishers in admitting that the press is not only commercial, but a part of the ruling capital- ist world . In the past thirty years, he says, newspapers \"have veered from their traditional position as leaders of public opinion into mere peddlers and purveyors of news . . . the newspapers have become commercial enterprises and hence fall into the current which is merging commercial enter- prises along mercantile lines . \"As the newspapers' interest has become a mercantile or"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"WILLIAM ALLEN WHITE : ANTI-PRESS LORD 275 industrial proposition, the dangers of commercial corruption of the press become greater and greater . The power trust of course is buying the newspapers in order to control the old vestige of leadership, the remaining fragment of professional status that still remains in the newspaper business . \"As a commercial enterprise the newspaper is yielding good returns for investment . \"But as a political weapon it is worth to self-seeking serv- ice corporations hundreds of dollars in under-cover influence where it is worth dollars in direct returns . If this country turns from a democracy into a Hamiltonian plutocracy, it will be because the moral sense, moral intelligence, and moral courage of the American people are sapped at the roots by insidiously corrupt plutocratic influence undermin- ing the sources of courage and intelligence which have been so ably represented by the American press in other genera- tions . \"Unless democracy is indignant at the encroachments of plutocracy, democracy cannot fight . When plutocracy destroys the sources of information which should make indignation, plutocracy has paralyzed democracy . But it is no sudden thing . It is a part of the tendency of the times . I do not know the answer .\" The reader may note a progression of thought in the foregoing quotations from the writings and speeches of the foremost journalistic figure in America . William Allen White is no longer a young man ; he has in fact grown gray in the service, and although he has not grown rich, he has at least become comfortably well off, and it would be more natural to find him growing more and more conservative in his views . In 1936, when he supported a fellow Kansan named Alf Landon for the Presidency there were in fact many who saw it as a sign of the old reactionary spirit which comes with comfort and gray hairs . But all these suppositions are not true . As he has grown older Mr . White has grown more free-minded-his enemies"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"276 \t LORDS OF THE PRESS would call it radical, but that really does not matter-on the subject of American journalism . And in 1938, while this book was being written, Mr . White who had just been elected president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors said, in an address to the students of the Wharton School of . the University of Pennsylvania, many things about our lords of the press which equal and perhaps surpass in severity all the criticisms made in this book . The Menace Is Capital Publishing is a business, he began, a legitimate business, \"which in certain of its higher realms may be reasonably called big business .\" He traced its three distinct periods . The first was pre-Civil War years when a printer or anyone with a few dollars could publish a newspaper . Fifty years ago or so publishing became a \"profession,\" but money was needed to indulge in it, not much, but a little, and the editor be- longed to the ruling class ; he was a free man, ran a free press, \"restricted only by his courage, his honesty, and his intelli- gence . No outside influence restrained his powers .\" The machine age arrived with the turn of the century . Advertising became one of the big influences in America, and \"the trade which had become a profession turned into a business, and there it is today .\" It now requires capital to start and run newspapers, even in small towns . And now Mr . White comes to the crux of the newspaper problem : \"Capital today or tomorrow always has a lively sense of its own advantage . Capital is instinctively, for all the noble intentions of us capitalists, class-conscious . It is that class- consciousness which is discrediting the press of the world today, particularly the press of the English-speaking democ- racies . \"Any newspaper in any American town represents a con- siderable lot of capital for the size of the town . The owners of newspaper investments, whether they be bankers, stock-"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"WILLIAM ALLEN WHITE : ANTI-PRESS LORD 277 holders of a corporation or individuals, feel a rather keen sense of financial responsibility and they pass their anxiety along to newspaper operatives whether these operatives be superintendents known as managing editors, foremen known as city editors, or mere wage earners known as editorial writers, copy desk men, reporters or what not . \"The sense of property goes thrilling down the line . It produces a slant and a bias that in time becomes-uncon- sciously and probably in all honesty is-a prejudice against any man or anything or any cause that seriously affects the right, title and interest of any other capital, however in- vested . . . . \"We editors realize that we have lost caste with the Amer- ican people . We are on the bad books of the public esteem . \"Labor as a class distrusts us . It wouldn't distrust us with- out reason . The labor press sneers at us-that is to say, those class-conscious newspapers that are circulated entirely in what is known as labor circles . . . . The deficiencies of Amer- ican journals in treating the news of what we might as well frankly if regretfully call the class struggle in this country are found largely in unconscious political attitudes . It is so easy to `policy' the news . Indeed, it is hard not to policy the news when the news is affected with a vital bread-and-butter interest to the capitalist who controls a newspaper, great or small . And strangely enough, capital is so fluid that a threat to the safety of any investment seems to be a threat to all invest- ments . Therefore newspapers which represent sizeable in- vestments are tempted to shy off and shiver when in Con- gress, in the legislature, or in the City Hall a man or a group threatens an investigation in any kind of patent medicine, in any kind of holding company, in any kind of misbranded food, in any kind of railroad security, in any kind of banking affiliate, good or bad . \"It is not longer the advertiser who puts on the pressure . It is not even the boss back of the pay roll who begins to"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"27$ \t LORDS OF THE PRESS quake . It is the whole middle and upper structure of society . Sooner or later the truth about any social abuse is gladly received by the middle class and by those who own and con- trol newspaper investments . But off the bat, the newspapers representing the innate conservatism of property interests which crystallize middle-class psychology are sometimes un- fair in their treatment of men or movements that threaten to disturb property in any form . \"Which is only another way of saying that every new day produces its own peculiar threats to liberty . . . . The new menace to the freedom of the press, aa menace in this country vastly more acute than the menace from government, may come through the pressure not of one group of advertisers, but of a wide sector of newspaper advertisers . Newspaper advertising is now placed somewhat if not largely, through nationwide advertising agencies . Some of these agencies have lately become advisers of great industrial corporations, which also advertise . These advertising agencies undertake to pro- tect their clients from what the clients and agents may re- gard as real dangers from inimical social, political, or indus- trial influences . As advisers the advertising agencies may exercise unbelievably powerful pressure upon newspapers . There is grave danger that in the coming decade, as social, industrial and economic problems become more and more acute, this capacity for organized control of newspaper opin- ions through the political advisers of national advertisers who in turn are paid to control public opinion may consti- tute a new threat to the freedom of the press . . . .\" Mr . White interrupts his indictment with references to what he considers another \"black mark against editorial judgment,\" the overplaying of sensational news to please the circulation department, which he considers \"as dangerous as the advertising department In menacing the ultimate freedom of the press .\" The opposite side of this picture is the underplaying of constructive news, such as, for example, the"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"WILLIAM ALLEN WHITE : ANTI-PRESS LORD 279 Scandinavian Neutrality Pact . It is true that it is a desire for Circulation, which means more advertising, which means more money, that motivates this handling of news, but in this writer's opinion this is a situation which is easily re- mediable since it is not forced upon the publisher by outside pressure . It is merely a gesture to the mob . Mr . White con- cludes : \"The problem of the American newspaper today is to open its channels to new social ideals and to insure fair treatment for any reformer who is obviously honest, reason- ably intelligent and backed by any considerable minority of the public . How can this be done? How can the news- papers become open-minded? I don't know .

The two highest categories of staff men remain the Washington and the foreign correspondents . These are also well paid, but whereas the Washington corre- spondent is generally as much a slave of editorial policy as editorial writers at home, the foreign correspondent is with- out doubt the freest man on any newspaper . Two reasons for this freedom are (a) the general ignorance of the editor and publisher about affairs European and (b) the don't-give-a-damn policy of newspapers about foreign events . Of course times are changing in journalism as elsewhere, . and one cannot accuse the New York Times or the Chicago Daily News foreign services of ever maintaining such an atti- tude. But it was pretty general when foreign services came into being just after the war . Raymond Gram Swing, who was a foreign correspondent before the war, says that the Chicago . Daily News bureaus in Europe were established chiefly to advertise the paper, to furnish a rest room, reading room and convenient toilet facilities for visiting Chicagoans, and a place to register their names . Swing cabled this list every day . It was his main work . In early 1914 he wrote a 283"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"284 \t SERVANTS OF THE LORDS series of articles about the war clouds in Europe, practically predicting that war was inevitable before the end of summer, but these stories were cut down until nothing but a sort of tourist guide to interesting capitals remained . When he pro- tested his editor told him that back in Chicago they con- sidered the whole matter preposterous : they had previously heard nothing about the British, German and French rearma- ment programs, they refused to see militarism in the German order for two army corps-which was the signal of a coming war-and they did not believe in scaring their readers with bolt-from-the-blue type of stories . Thereby Swing's reputa- tion as a major prophet was killed aborning . A great number of the first members of our foreign services were men who had been in the army . Some were excellent journalists but many were glorified police reporters . On the Chicago Tribune a premium was actually paid for ignorance . I remember in the early ig20's when I asked our director why he had chosen Mr . A to succeed me in the capital of X, he replied : \"Because A is the only reporter we have who doesn't speak the language . He knows nothing about the country . In fact he is the only man we have who has never visited Europe . So you see he will be unaffected by the propaganda and intrigues of those foreigners . What we want is the real American viewpoint .\" In the middle '3o's the Mr .

The world is their oyster cocktail and the best seller list their club room .

R . Knicker- bocker, Dorothy Thompson, Edgar Ansel and Paul Scott Mowrer, William Henry Chamberlin, Louis Fischer, Eugene Lyons, Anna Louise Strong and others uttered historical or sensational remarks on Germany and Russia, while Larry Rue, the first foreign correspondent to fly his own airplane, told of Afghanistan, and Mrs. Marguerite Harrison confessed she was an American secret service operative while mas- querading as representative of the Baltimore Sun and Asso- ciated Press . All these men and women were my colleagues . For fifteen years I worked with them in Europe, and now as I read their best selling books I too am carried away by the excitement, physical or mental, the spirit of adventure, the thrill of history in the making, and at times the tropical romantic pages which have brought such unprecedented popularity to the noblesse of the reportorial profession, the foreign cor- respondents . If these books affect me in this way, how much more fascinating must they appear to the lay reader? And what a heroic portrait they must give of the authorsl Yet, strange as it may sound in realistic days, this knightly stained glass picture is not entirely false . This is the colorful panel begun by Floyd Gibbons in wartime, exhibited on the stage by Sam and Bella Spewack of the old New York World, touched up today by Negley Farson, who might have stepped right out of the crossed works of Richard Harding Davis and 0 . Henry . In other words, this is the picture of the glorified reporter . Between him and the journalist there is no sharp way of differentiating, inasmuch as most newspapermen on foreign service go through both phases, sometimes revert, frequently remain both . To illustrate, there was the famous Genoa con- ference when the Bolshevik diplomats made their first ap- pearance in western Europe, in mysterious official silence . Well, there were more than 450 journalists at this confer- ence, most of them in spats and canes, and all of them stood"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"286 \t SERVANTS OF THE LORDS around acting respectfully . But there were two New York reporters freshly arrived among them and they did what every reporter and no journalist would ever do : one of them crashed through the third day's diplomatic parade to the convention hall, seized Chicherin by the coat, and extracted the first interview with a Russian, and the other by hook or crook, probably the latter, got a world scoop on the Russian- German treaty . For reporters on European service, manners and ethics, unwritten codes and diplomatic protocol, are of no more importance than they are at home, and they pursue their prey in the manner they made notorious in the Lind- bergh honeymoon affair . In fact for them Europe is no more than one glorified police court . But for most of the time and for the majority of newspaper men abroad all life is not running to a fire, nor even to a revolution . The reporters in time become journalists . The Walter Duranty, catapulted out of Cambridge University and the Paris office of the Times, into a life of scoops, the Dorothy Thompson of the King Karl of Hungary adventure, the Jimmy Sheean of the Riffi No Man's Land, inevitably join the non-adventuring Mowrers and Chamberlins and Fischers in serious contemplation of the European scene and the prosaic work which marks the journalist as compared to the adventurer-reporter . At the risk of destroying all illu- sions, I have summed up under seven headings the main activities of practically all American journalists in partibus infidelium . i . Ear Biting . This is not the most important source of news but the recommended first step . It consists of getting oriented by pumping dry your colleagues who live in the capital and know the country well, the term ear biting being the invention I believe of that same Mr . Spewack who broke up the Genoa conference and retired to Broadway and Holly- wood . (Incidentally the most famous ear biter in Europe in my time was the journalist Isaac Marcosson who has glori- fied for American hero-seekers the three leading charlatans of"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS \t 287 Europe : Hugo Stinnes, Ivar Kreuger, and our old colleague, B . Mussolini .) 2 . The Press of the Country . Although some claim only seventy-five percent and others say that ninety-five percent of the foreign news sent to America comes out of the news- papers in countries where correspondents are stationed, it is acknowledged that this press is the source of most of it . In Berlin my assistant and I read forty papers a day, including the leading Hamburg, Frankfurt, Cologne, Munich and Dresden dailies, and got most of our news from them . In London you do not even have to trouble much about trans- lating . g . News Services . Although the Associated Press has tied knots around all the official and semi-official news agencies, most every journalist buys one or more rival services, and also hires a parliamentary reporter, and string men in the provinces-the latter erroneously so called after theAmerican prototype who keep a string of their dispatches and - are paid space rates . 4 . Handouts . Although European governments do not do much handing out of \"news,\" a major Washington activity, the press bureaus furnish considerable usable material, ob- tain statements which later appear as interviews, and gen- erally supply a fair part of your cable crop . 5 . Scoops . Bought and paid for . You may remember that Mr . Hearst and one of his reporters named Horan were ex- pelled from France after publishing a world scoop about a Franco-British naval agreement . That document was pur- chased . You will not remember the world scoop on Admiral Scheer's report on the Battle of Jutland to the Kaiser ; that item cost me only $50 in gold . Exclusive interviews with Lloyd George at certain times were part of a contract, and once when I begged Professor Einstein for a statement he agreed, provided the Tribune donated $25 to the Palestine fund . Lindbergh and Byrd flew the Atlantic for the Times ; King Tut's tomb was opened for the London Times, the first"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"288 \t SERVANTS OF THE LORDS Zeppelin trip to America belonged to the Hearst service, and a dozen of the big stories and scoops of recent times, including Queen Marie, were bought and paid for by the North American Newspaper Alliance . 6 . Think Pieces . Despite forty newspapers, the various news services, the bought scoops and the stuff from the for- eign office, the time comes frequently, in fact several days a week, when there is no news or when the situation is in such flux that no definite bulletin news can be made out of it . Whereupon the foreign correspondent sits lightly down and taps two hundred or a thousand words out of his head . These are known as think pieces . The layman can detect them easily by watching for the stock phrases : \"I learn on good authority\" (a favorite with the British type of journalist) ; \"In official circles it was said\" ; \"A usually reliable source informs your correspondent\" ; \"In diplomatic circles it was the opinion that . . .\" ; \"Persons close to -the government be- lieve . . .\" ; and, when all else fails, an even more anonymous : \"It is reported . . . .\" These phrases are not to be confused with \"the official spokesman\" of the White House, who is usually the President himself . In European dispatches they may sometimes repre- sent that very minor official who is detailed to the North American division of the foreign office, but more likely the qualifying phrases are the self-styled creations of the cor- respondent himself . And for this very reason they become important . Take for example the cables from Mr . Duranty . This cor- respondent has now reached a position when he can put his best pronoun forward and say \"I,\" but it has been an un- written rule among American newspapermen to hang the news on some one else . \"No one gives a damn what you think,\" is the way one of my editors once put it to me . So you write your own think pieces with the phrase \"in high circles\" and it is immediately regarded with the proper awe by the receiving end . Of course I cannot tell how many of"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS \t 289 the Duranty cables which contained these qualifying lines were out of high circles and how many out of his mind, but rereading them I find that they were always intelligent, frequently brilliant, and never tendentious . Consider, on the other hand, the think pieces of Mr . Duranty's colleague in Rome . Last October, for instance, Mussolini was facing a blockade whereupon the Cortesi think piece informed us that \"the European situation is con- sidered here to have become critical . . . . It is interpreted as evidence that Britain is ready to go to war . . . . The belief that the present deadlock is inevitably leading toward a European war consequently is gaining ground .\" Now this is a fair example of tendentious reporting ; it is a think piece either originated in the Cortesi head or planted there by the propagandists of the foreign office . Even more tenden- tious is the July 5, 1935, cable saying that \"Official circles scoff the very idea of an economic blockade of Italy\" and \"other Italian circles are inclined to make light of the British government's reported intention to propose an eco- nomic blockade\" and again, \"It is not believed by these groups that Britain ever would take the initiative on such dangerous ground .\" Of course what you have here is the typewriter of Cortesi but the voice is that of the Duce . In the view of the fait accompli these items sound not only ridicu- lous but appear reprehensible . 7 . \"Original Work\"-by Native Assistants . The foreign correspondent, on taking over a European capital, usually surrounds himself with assistants, American and native . Sometimes the work of the American is signed but usually it is unsigned and frequently it is credited to the head of the bureau . Natives of course get no recognition . But very often when there is a scoop or a fine piece of \"original\" work pro- duced by one of them it is blazoned and headlined with the illustrious name of the, American correspondent who is the head of the bureau . (Having stated orally for a decade that a large number of my masterpieces were the work of my"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"290 \t SERVANTS OF THE LORDS American assistant, Miss Sigrid Schultz, I now hasten be- latedly to say so in print .) IF These seven headings I believe account for ninety percent of the time and work of a foreign correspondent . They place him heavily at a desk in an office, reading newspapers, watch- ing the news ticker or the flimsy brought in from the news bureau, dickering with some notable over the price of a scoop, editing the translated pieces, rewriting the stories supplied by assistants and natives, and writing \"situation\" stories which. may be intelligent or vicious propaganda, de- pending upon the many factors which cannot be detailed here . At any rate this ninety percent of the journalist's life is routine work, leaving only ten percent for war, revolution, coup d'etat, violence, and romantic adventure which occupy ninety percent of the volumes of personal history, memoirs and autobiography which in the course of time make their best-seller appearances . Very naturally their authors are too good judges of human interest , to ask their readers to spend time on the dull everyday office work when there is so much to tell about kings and dictators, rebels and charlatans, plots, the rise and fall of dynasties, 'the armed march of economic and social philosophies-the thrilling tithe (prodnolog to you, my Moscow colleagues) of the harvest of the years . This is what the life of foreign correspondents has been like ever since the great expansion which occurred during and as a result of the World War . Up to that time the few who comprised the corps (outside the news agency men) were considered a luxury, but in i g i g not only all the New York morning newspapers but the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Daily News, Christian Science Monitor and Philadelphia Ledger, extended or established services and the Brooklyn Eagle, Baltimore Sun, Detroit News, Detroit Free Press, Newark"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS \t 291 News and other important papers sent one or more per- manent correspondents to Europe . While it is true that not many of these men and women who became the nobility of American journalism were chosen originally because of their ignorance and provincial- ism, as in the case of my successor at X, it is equally true that few of us were especially fitted for the job . Several of us were accidents : we were in the army, or we happened to be in Europe, or we pulled the best strings in the home office because we considered the foreign assignment an adventure or good fun or a chance to see the world on an expense account . There were few Mowrers, Durantys and Chamber- lins among the lot, more Gibbonses and Rues and Farsons . The majority, it is safe to say, were reporters, not journalists, and we never had a thought in the world outside the pro- duction of news . (I speak of course for only the twenty capitals where I have been stationed .) Some of my col- leagues drank themselves to death, several reformed, some made love to each other's wives, one committed suicide, several were married and divorced or psychoanalyzed, most of them shot dice and played poker, one made a fortune in foreign real estate, two wrote poetry, one collected shoes, nearly all tried their hands at plays and novels-in short, they were very much the same group as the American diplomatic, consular, military and commercial groups to be found in all foreign countries . They were no more cowardly or bold than other workmen who live in economic insecurity, although they gave a swag- gering appearance of brave freedom . Because Europe is terra incognita, because the owners of the papers are ignorant about Europe and careless, they rarely instruct the foreign correspondents, as they do the Washington or local men . The journalists therefore do much as they please .

Up to recently Bolshevism alone among foreign happenings re- ceived any attention from the newspaper proprietors ; it was recognized early as a threat to possessions and profits and every newspaper worker who could see on which side his bread was buttered 3000 miles away, knew how to handle that subject . If he was so dumb as to think he could treat Bolshevism as fairly as other European phenomena, as one of my colleagues did, he soon found out better . The gentle- man in question had been converted after three months at the shrine of Lenin, and reconverted almost instantaneously at the Western Union cable office in Paris at 4 P. M . on a tepid August afternoon . Generally speaking, the majority of foreign correspond- ents in my time were men who took no sides, who did \"straight\" reporting, spent most of their time in their offices, wrote few think pieces, kept themselves neutral in all politi- cal storms, never entered entangling alliances (except amo- rous) in European countries, and maintained pretty well the American provincial attitude of sneering down upon every- thing foreign . If, in the early days, the correspondents made trips to Rome or Moscow the result might well have been headed : The Richard Harding Davis Boys Discover Fascism or The Richard Harding Davis Boys Inside the Kremlin . But, reading the numerous important and valuable books of the foreign correspondents, it is apparent that everything is different now . Obviously and almost without exception the men who have been cabling about Bolshevism and Fascism, the collapse of the capitalist system, wars and revo- lutions, have really been thinking about them . They seem suddenly to have discovered that there are economic forces at work in a world whose adventurous surface they have re- ported ; they not only have found a social conscience loose in Europe, but they seem to have sounded themselves and also found it within . They have apparently advanced from"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS \t 293 reporters of symptoms to interpreters of cause and effect . At least in their books . Rather than explain this phenomenon I would just wel- come it as another sign of the times, another proof that the first to recognize a sinking social system and move to higher ground is the intelligent minority . But this much I must say : that although from 1917 to just recently the foreign correspondents never appeared to have been shaken by the cataclysmic Karl Marxian thunders, they were never in their lives misled by the false summer lightnings of the shyster professional economists who wrote pieces to the publishers' orders for their daily newspapers at home . Whereas here in America the left still shouts to the writers \"Descend from your ivory towers,\" in Europe nowadays there is no longer the call to the journalists : \"Beat it out of the Adlon Barl\" The journalistic noblesse seems to have come of age since that day when the linguistically crippled, the socially irresponsible, the economically illiterate were thought the best representatives in foreign lands and when Ring Lardner was sent by his Chicago newspaper to write \"The comic side of the World War .\""},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 The Washington Galley Slaves LIRE the foreign correspondent, the Washington represent- ative of a newspaper is privileged to write think pieces . He is in the nation's capital not merely to report actual happen- ings-the news services will see to that-but to interpret events for all the people . In other words the Washington correspondent is really a semi-editorial writer . And, since no owner would appoint a man to Washington unless he could rely upon him to continue the home edi- torial policy, and because correspondents know that they cannot write contrary to the social, political and economic prejudices or philosophies of their bosses and get away with it for long, it had become an \"accepted supposition in the trade that the Washington correspondents were servile, con- tented galley slaves, sycophants, the worst yes-men of all . But apparently times have changed in Washington just as they have in the foreign service . In the 1936 campaign the lay reader might have found cause for thought in the report, made in a Democratic party paper of course, that the overwhelming majority of the cor- respondents traveling with both Landon and Roosevelt, most of them writing Republican or pro-Landon news, would vote for the re-election of the President . (In New York at the time it was reported that almost the entire Herald Tribune staff would vote for the man this paper was attacking .)

Newspapermen themselves were not fooled . They knew that most Washington news is cut to fit editorial policy, that despite the fact the capital representative is \"reliable\" and would not openly or subversively write the truth in defiance of his boss, there are nevertheless numerous instances of dis- tortion and suppression of their telegrams, that news is fre- quently colored, sometimes faked in the home office, and that a great number of Washington correspondents are cynics who do not themselves believe in much of the bun- combe they send and which their publishers use to fool the American people . The profession has always known that . But there has been no scientific test of this common knowledge, until Leo C .

Either the Washington correspondents themselves dis- tort the news, or 2 . That their news is distorted, by order, in the home offices . The study of the Washington press corps was made largely through a series of questionnaires submitted by Mr . Rosten . Here is a sample question and result . He asked : What is the most fair and reliable newspaper in America? Ninety-nine Washington correspondents answered . The great majority did not include the newspaper for which they worked among the fair and reliable ones . The poll showed : New York Times, 64 first choices, 16 second, 9 third, or 8g mentions, scoring 747 points, and winning by a mile . Baltimore Sun, 284 points, in \"show .\" Christian Science Monitor, go points, in \"place .\" Scripps-Howard papers, 85 points . St . Louis Post-Dispatch, 84 points . The present writer cannot quite figure out the vote for the St . Louis Post-Dispatch which has always been considered one of the most fair and honest papers in America, and which has frequently been given first place in lay and journalistic polls . But when it comes to the vote on the least fair and reliable newspapers in the United States, the vote is startling . Ninety-three Washington correspondents were willing to go on record on this one, and the vote was : Hearst newspapers ; 59 first choice, 2o second, and 8 third, mak- ing 714 points . Chicago Tribune, 24 first mentions, 37 second, 1o third or 455 points . Los Angeles Times, 103 points .

Another outstanding fact is that the Washington corre- spondents were unanimous in naming the three leading reac- tionary, Red-baiting papers as the three most unfair and most unreliable . Perhaps this too was a coincidence) Another sensational disclosure regarding Hearst news in general was the voting on press agencies . Ninety-seven jour- nalists were willing to go on record as to their choice among the Associated Press, United Press (Scripps-Howard), Inter- national News Service (Hearst) and Universal Service (Hearst) and this was the result : This shows, strangely enough, that the United Press, which is a private business concern and therefore might naturally run its news service to suit its owners, is considered better than the Associated Press, which is the great co-operative of the American newspaper publishers and which is sup- posed to be more honest than Caesar's wife and a darn sight more virtuous .

The author in a footnote explains that nine A . P . men, seven U . P ., five I . N .

Of 85 who answered the question, 63 .5 percent declared they were voting for the President . In other words a large part if not the majority of the Washington corps was writing pro-Landon news for pro-Landon newspapers and voting pro-Roosevelt . Only 21 .7 percent believed in the old program of rugged individualism . Eighty percent voted for some form of government control of big business .

The reader may remember the old Blue Eagle, the famous or infamous NRA, the great days of the parades and the codes, and the decision of the Supreme Court which ended that dramatic and colorful episode in our history . The newspaper code was the one on which the President stumbled . Up to then the going was unimpeded . The newspapers raised the issue of \"Freedom of the Press,\" claiming that while codes are all right in the chicken busi- ness (which proved just the reverse, later) they were not to be thought of in publishing . Listen then to how the Washington press corps played its part during the code battle . Mr . Rosten says : \"Some of the correspondents acted as agents for their publishers in getting information, sounding out opinions, suggesting to Congress- men what the preferences of the publishers were . Many of them were under an obligation to sound the `Freedom of the Press' alarm . Many believed the code was bad .

This is probably the most self-revealing statement of the great political press corps of America and one of the most appalling indictments of the newspaper publishers . 5 . Related to the foregoing question was one asking whether the newspaper press of America published fair or distorted stories about the Tugwell Pure Food and Drug Bill . This measure, it may be remembered, was largely an effort to compel manufacturers or processors of food and drugs to advertise them as carefully as they labeled them (under the Harrison Pure Food and Drug Bill of 1906) . It is no secret that the newspapers knifed and murdered this bill-and knifed Mr . Tugwell as well . But while the newspapers universally denounced the meas- ure, their foremost writers, the Washington correspondents, voted 46 .2 percent to the effect that their newspapers were unfair and distorted the news about it .

Of seventy-two who replied, forty or 55 .5 percent said \"Yes .\" Thirty or 41 .6 percent said \"No,\" and only two were uncertain . Policy means many things . But it does not mean truth . One correspondent explained he watched how stories were played up and revised his \"slant\" on the news accordingly . The statement was made that it was impossible to be objective when one read the editorials in his own paper and sensed its policy . Sixty percent voted this true .

Sokolsky's book has not been subsidized by the National Association of Manufacturers, it should have been .\" The Nation reviewer either had inside information or a prophetic soul ."},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"THE WAGES OF REACTION \t 321 In 1936 we find Sokolsky running a column on the Herald Tribune and syndicating it to twenty-five other papers . On April 2o, 1936, he calls his colleague Dorothy Thompson to task for getting excited about thugs who break strikes and the 200 detective agencies which intimidate laborers from joining unions . \"Who hired these agencies? Why not give the names of the agencies?\" he asks bravely . The answer is that the members of the N . A . M . employ both him and the thugs, as was revealed in due time . A week later he attacks Heber Blankenhorn, La Follette committee expert, for daring to say that industry employs detectives, spies and strike- breakers . Sokolsky calls this statement a publicity trick, a circus trick . The statement should not be allowed to stand . Sokolsky calls on Blankenhorn to prove it or shut up . Well, it was proved 100 percent . And in the course of the La Fol- lette proving, came the exposure of Sokolsky . In August, 1936, this agent for the steel institute and the manufacturers began writing for the Atlantic Monthly (then under the editorship of a man named Ellery Sedgwick who ended a long literary life by becoming the chief defender of the child-murderer Franco in Spain) . \"I speak as a con- servative,\" wrote Sokolsky . \"In my youth I ran the gamut of revolutionary movements . Anarchist, pacifist, I . W. W . sympathizer, I have sought a better, a more commodious life, not only for myself, but for all men . . . . Let no man think of me as a tory .. . . a heartless marauder in a predatory world . For I have nothing to defend . I have nothing of the goods of this world but what I earn and consume today .\" This was about the time Sokolsky told me he had arrived penniless from China and had now salted away more than $15,000 in the bank . In all his magazine articles Sokolsky masquerades as a penniless liberal, the true American who believes in freedom for all, and while he seems to attack Fascism with the equal vigor he belabors Communism, he is actually using both merely as foils to show the benefit of the American big business system ."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"322 \t SERVANTS OF THE LORDS But he has now become a prominent figure in our journal- ism . He is worth the attention of the liberal press . And he gets it . An editorial in the New York Post recalls that during the Manchurian crisis Sokolsky \"seemed anxious for the world to understand Japan's `civilizing' mission in China,\" and now he has become a labor expert whose articles are \"reprinted by the manufacturers' associations and Hawaiian pineapple interests and distributed broadcast to fill editors' wastebaskets .\" But when Sokolsky attacks John L . Lewis and the C . I . O . and speaks about a Communist, Socialist, C . I . O . plot to elect Lewis President in 1940, the Post brings up contrary proof from the Wall Street Journal, which also laughs at Sokolsky, and concludes with the advice that \"Mr . Sokolsky had better peddle his red herrings elsewhere . Even the Wall Street market insists on fresh fish these days .\" Much stronger advice is given the lesser of Sokoisky's employers, the Herald Tribune, by the Nation (October 24, 1936) . If the Herald Tribune had taken it it would not now be standing naked to its enemies . The Nation said : \"The New York Herald Tribune is a conservative newspaper, dig- nified, well edited, and lively . The liberal reader may feel that Walter Lippmann has gone over to the enemy with altogether too much gusto, or that Dorothy Thompson's sympathies lie too far to the right to be consistent with her experience in Hitler's Germany . As for Mark Sullivan, he is almost an appealing figure as he stands roundly in the ranks of Red-baiters much more vicious than himself, still striking out at Tugwell with his trusty cutlass . Even a `Red' would scarcely accuse these writers of being worse than conserva- tive or reactionary . There is, however, one burned-out star in the Herald Tribune's galaxy which should be replaced before it short-circuits the whole string . We refer to George E . Sokolsky . On October 19th Mr . Sokolsky wrote an article on the American Labor Party . Maintaining his old pretense of being an 'expert' on labor and radicalism (some of his best friends are radicalsl), he cooked up a mess of misrepre-"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"THE WAGES OF REACTION \t 323 sentation, labor-, Jew-, and alien-baiting which Sokolsky himself has seldom surpassed . We feel that the Herald Tribune, aside from soiling its pages, is keeping apart two minds that run as one . Isn't it possible that Mr . Sokolsky could be auctioned off to William Randolph Hearst? He long ago reached the stage of journalistic ripeness which usually precedes that fall .\" But the Herald Tribune continued to peddle the red herrings for which Sokolsky is getting paid double or more by the manufacturers' associations . The propagandist con- tinued to attack labor and the New Deal and to charge it and Lewis, \"spearhead of the revolutionary movement in labor,\" with plotting the overthrow of the government . When the Newspaper Guild went from the A . F . of L .- \"that body of death\"-to the C . I . 0 ., the Herald Tribune permitted Sokolsky to publish one of his wildest, most non- sensical and vicious propaganda pieces . It is also, incidentally, a public plea by Sokolsky for honest, unbiased journalism- a free press talk by a man secretly being paid by a private organization of industrialists while practicing the open pro- fession of journalism . Sokolsky says : \"A government can only be as democratic as its press is free .\" This has been said before . \"And now the Guild has switched from the A . F . of L . to the C . I . 0 . That is altogether different . Here is not just a union of mutual protection . Here is the agency of revolution .\" The Guild passed the lie to Sokolsky . The plutogogue then declares he has noticed certain things happening in the press and asks, \"Are these slips honest errors of judgment or does a Guild member poison the paper for which he works?\" He then predicts that if Lewis succeeds in getting the C . I . 0 . established among news writers, \"he will go after the press,\" and \"then this will happen : The C .

Benjamin Stol- berg-who later sold to Roy Howard the series of articles in which the Moscow herring was dragged all through the C . I . O .-was still writing for the Nation . He had written : \"Another reactionary free-lance writer is George Sokolsky . . . a rather tragic-comic figure, for with his Eastern European Jewish background he ought to know better than to incite the vigilante spirit . Big business enterprises distribute nu- merous reprints of his articles .\" Sokolsky replied, \"The fact that I prefer E . T .

But Sokolsky went on with his propaganda . In November, 1937, he ridiculed the work of the Institute for Propaganda Analysis and sought to liken himself to some of the greatest men of America and the best known columnists . He wrote \"I personally am a confirmed propagandist . . . . Uncle Charley (Prof . Charles A . Beard) is a mighty propagandist . . . . And another on that list is James T . Shotwell . . . . Among current propagandists the four I like best are Walter Lippmann, Dorothy Thompson, Westbrook Pegler and Boake Carter . . . .\" One may well wonder whether the four colleagues like Mr . Sokolsky . In December the La Follette committee investigating cor- rupt practices and anti-labor activities on the part of corpo- rations announced it would probe the, National- Association of Manufacturers . The Peoples Press hinted that Sokolsky and several others who had just addressed the N . A . M . con- vention, \"the Congress of American Industry,\" in New York, would be called . At that congress Sokolsky had spoken . The press paid no attention to him-with the exception of that \"voice of business,\" the Sun, which had a double column headline : SEES MONSTERS IN WAGNER ACT Sokolsky Says It Created Discontent and Fear -Calls Wage-Hour Bill Paralyzing The word was getting around in journalistic circles that the La Follette committee had the goods on Sokolsky . It would show that while he appeared as a columnist along with Lippmann, Dorothy Thompson, Mark Sullivan and other in the Herald Tribune, he was actually on the payroll of the steel corporations and the manufacturers .

In January, 1938, Sokolsky shook hands and forgave Ben Stolberg for his last year's criticism . \"Ben regarded me, and I suppose he still does, as a writing slave of the independent steel companies,\" wrote Sokolsky, giving the impression that such things could never be .

Even the propa- gandist's other employer, the Herald Tribune, used the name in the second part of the heading, but the Times left Sokolsky out of the head and used a minimum of the news, even less than the Herald Tribune did. It was shown that Hill & Knowlton, steel corporation press agents, paid Sokolsky $28,599 from June, 1936, to February, 1938, chiefly for service to the American Iron and Steel Institute . The propagandists also contracted with the N . A . M . for $i,ooo a month for the Sokolsky services and paid him the entire sum .

Its significance will undoubtedly grow . Journalistically, it marked the most important repudiation of the press by the public . How important that repudiation was only time can tell, but it was certainly the first time in our history that a large number of people became aware of the newspaper as a political force-a fact which even the humble European peasant has known for at least a century . Nineteen thirty-six also showed up the place of that new power in American journalism, the columnist . The Washington correspondents, those several hundred men who write the politics of the nation, were overwhelm- ingly on the side of Roosevelt and Reform, although over- whelmingly their papers were opposed . Most of the colum- nists, however, had no compromise to face, no conscience to trouble them : they as well as big business, the millionaire oil man of Kansas, Hearst, the manufacturers' association, the Liberty League, were all on the same side . The Washington correspondents voted nineteen to one for Roosevelt . In the Chicago Tribune, New York Herald Tribune, and other towers of Landonism, the vote among the working reporters was about the same ratio .

A ., from the fact that 1935 circulation figures were used by the liberal journals in estimating the readership of 1936 . I do not think it necessary to quibble . The fact is that if the press was not nine to one against Roosevelt, it was seven to three, or six to four against him, and that in 1938 this percentage increased still more, and the reason, as Captain Patterson of the New York Daily News so bluntly said, had more to do with pocketbooks than principles . The fair, impartial Christian Century, without using statistics, said that thousands, probably millions of the ballots cast in the 1936 elections were not merely for Roose- velt but votes against the newspapers in general . \"Election Day, 1936, was judgment day for America's daily press .\" Unfair, partial apologists for the publishers have listed the papers in the solid South, with their millions of readers, without explaining that no opposition press existed there, and no contest . On the other hand, the anti-press case could be made much worse by testing the specific gravity of the papers officially listed as pro-Roosevelt . In New York City, for instance, the Post, the World-Tele- gram, the Times and the News, with more than two and a half million circulation, are listed as supporting Roosevelt,"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"1936 AND THE COLUMNISTS \t 333 against two and a quarter million for Landon in the Hearst press, the Herald Tribune and the Sun . A rather fair set-up . But one must not rest on figures, one must attempt to measure emotions . The passion which Hearst put into his pro-Landon cam- paign was a combination of all the yellowness which has made him notorious for half a century and earned him the boycott of most decent and intelligent people in America at long last . As Doctor Beard recently pointed out, there was no cesspool which Mr . Hearst has not searched, no art of char- acter assassination which he has not practiced . And so stories were invented, headlines were colored, news was puffed up or suppressed, and everything possible done to smear and destroy the reformer in the White House . The Sun refrained from yellowness : it ran no gargantuan headlines, invented no pure fakes, kept out of cesspools, but it showed that in a nice, gentlemanly, well-bred upper class and aristocratic manner it was able to join hands with Hearst in coloring and distorting and smearing . if the Hearst journalism reeked of the sewer, the Sun's smelled of a royal charnel house . The Herald Tribune gave its usual biased Republican news . All in all, the pro-Landon press was strong in its support and extremely active in propagandizing the electorate . The 2,296,050 circulation of the four papers was thoroughly exploited by partisan news and editorials, with little attempt made at objectivity except in the Herald Tribune .

The Times published one editorial announcing itself for the President and then continued its policy of presenting the news impartially as between Roosevelt and Landon .

The Republi- cans made great use of this page in the Democratic News . The Post was ioo percent for Roosevelt . If, therefore, an attempt is made to gauge the quality as well as the quantity of circulation, it will be found that the Landon support was actually much more intense than the cold figures indicate, and that a considerable proportion of the Roosevelt figures cannot be rightly placed in his column . In other words, the seventy-one percent pro-Landon circula- tion in what the New Republic called the fifteen competitive areas, where both candidates had a chance of winning, is actually opposed by less than the twenty-nine percent pro- Roosevelt circulation of the statistics . Curiously enough in four large cities where the President had not one newspaper on his side he won by about two to one . In Chicago, where the circulation was almost ten to one for Landon and that \"favorite\" son, Knox, the voting was just under two to one for the \"outside agitator .\" Apologists for the press are still interpreting the 1936 figures in an attempt to restore prestige out of debris .

I know that a number of the news- paper correspondents who write so-called `unfriendly' articles are not personally opposed to the things they write about .

All these things provide grounds for those who question whether he has any title to be called `liberal .' \" The liberal criticism is well represented by the Nation's editor, Margaret Marshall, who writes that Lippmann (a man \"born fifty years too late in the wrong country\") \"has moved steadily to the right ; his prestige and prosperity have increased concomitantly. There is a temptation to dismiss him, in an old phrase, as a man who began with a wealth of thought and ended with the thought of wealth . But the Lippmann processes suggest a multiple and more subtle diagnosis . It is a truism that the effective apologist, like the cruder type of demagogue, must be himself at least half- deceived .\" Lippmann, she adds, \"removes himself from the battlefield and yet maintains his claim to liberalism . In the writing itself there is a lack of tension, and a pompous, measured elegance that match the profound irrelevance of his much-advertised point of view .

The words of Jack Reed will be meat and drink for the hearts and minds of free men in generations to come when the name of Walter Lippmann is not even a whisper in the wind .\" (Unless \"Liberty and the News\" is remembered .)

Dorothy Thompson Mr . Lamont deplore's the fact that men \"turn tail and seek consolation on the bosom of Mother Capitalism .\" Miss Thompson, like Mr . Lippmann who turned tail, was also once a radical . At that time, as she herself explains, she was making a small salary as a hard-working newspaper re- porter . Her friends in Berlin and Vienna were all of the left, she knew no reactionaries except professionally, and her sym- pathies were probably more left than any reporter's except those occasional journalists free-lancing amidst poverty for the radical press . Some of the most brilliant arguments for or against the Marxian state, especially as attempted in Soviet Russia, were heard in the little salon which Miss Thompson conducted in the two capitals, to which she was for years assigned by the Philadelphia Ledger and New York Evening Post . Many of the most famous cultured notables of Vienna and Berlin visited her house, and she was on friendly terms with many more . Freud was one of them . Culture and politics were rivals for her time . Miss Thompson did not then seek consolation on the bosom of Mother Capitalism, nor did she arrive there by drifting, as did her colleague Mr . Lippmann : she was thrust upon it . In 1927 she began to share the tragedy of Sinclair Lewis . Ever since he came a writer Red Lewis has considered him- self at least liberal, pro-labor, leftist .

More than a decade ago, in Paris one night, Red had with him a copy of Upton Sinclair's \"Money Writes .\" \"I love Upton,\" he said, almost weeping . \"Why, I was janitor for him once-at Helicon Hall .

Dorothy's income from column conducting plus lectures and other writings is esti- mated at more than $ i oo,ooo a year . It is considerably more than the forty or fifty dollars a week she got when she was a radical in Vienna and Berlin . Miss Thompson has not abandoned every idea of that radical past . What has happened-apparent from the alterna- tion of liberal and anti-liberal columns-is an attempt to rationalize the old life and the new . The result at times is utter confusion . Forever Miss Thompson writes under her slogan : \"Let there be Light ; let Reason prevail,\" apparently unaware that neither light nor reason (with Einsteinian exceptions which do not enter here) can travel in anything but a straight and narrow line .

Miss Thompson denounced the murderous Fascist aviators who destroyed Guernica and who killed ten thousand civil- ians in Barcelona and other Loyalist cities . She paid no attention to the Catholic hierarchy's answers on Guernica, as other columnists did, and she was right because the slaughter at Barcelona, which even bishops and cardinals find hard to defend, was an even worse atrocity . Braver yet is criticism of the Catholic hierarchy at home .

On this error the Times condemned the fourteen volumes of documentary evidence and 2492 unchallenged cases . A much better way would have been to investigate before editorializing . I have made a fairly thorough investigation of the entire file of Better Times and The New Times . I find to its credit that it had a notable scoop on Henry Luce's offer to buy the paper and Mr . Sulzberger's rejection . As for the price, Better Times reported $15,ooo,ooo and the fact is that $40 ; ooo,ooo was offered . On the other hand the story that the Times has invited F . D . Roosevelt to its editorship after 1940 is generally denied . It is true there is such talk in the air, but no action has been taken . To the credit of Better Times must go the exposure of the war correspondence from Spain, both the publication of false news from Carney and the continual badgering of Matthews . Better Times may hold the publisher responsible for the situation, but it so happens that the present writer, having been in Spain when the telegrams of censure were sent Matthews and having placed the evidence before Mr . Sulzberger himself, is convinced that the publisher is in no way guilty . But a serious and reprehensible act has been com- mitted and its exposure is in my opinion the most praise- worthy thing Better Times has done . The facts in the case should be of general interest . It is now well known that reactionary Catholics (as distinguished from liberal Catholics who are either for the Loyalist gov- ernment or neutral) have used their tremendous pressure, plus threats of boycott, and the withdrawal of advertising money, to change the opinion of American newspapers re- garding the war in Spain . At the end of this chapter I will tell the story of the Times Madrid correspondent, William P . Carney, as I learned it in Spain . It is an excellent illustration of many things journalistic . But at the moment the subject is the action Better Times has taken in the Carney case ."},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"360 \t SERVANTS OF THE LORDS At the time of the capture of Teruel by the Loyalists Carney reported a week later the recapture by Franco . It is possible that this was an error due to false information, but whereas others merely cabled the falsehood, Carney gave a description of marches within the recaptured city, rejoicings, and celebration . This story cannot be condoned ; it is a false- hood . And in addition Carney, with the Fascists, continually reports events within the Loyalist lines about which he can know nothing, and almost every day injects propaganda into his dispatches . On July i i th, he put into the mouths of American prisoners a statement that the American Friends of Spanish Democracy were a propaganda outfit \"connected somehow with United States Communists .\" Both the Rev . Dr . Reissig and Bishop Paddock protested this falsehood which has been disproven in the Times itself months ago, but the Times permitted Carney to repeat it and without investigation wrote an editorial upholding Carney . The ex- posure of such practices by Better Times and The New Times therefore deserves a medal for journalistic service . Not since the famous New Republic exposure of the falsity of the Russian news from 1917 to 192o has there been such a valid criticism of the Times . As for Matthews, he was decorated by Mussolini for his war correspondence in Ethiopia . He then said and still be- lieves that the Italian troops were excellent there and the invasion probably for the best . He was friendly to Italy when he came to Spain . He has of course realized the right- ness and nobility of the Loyalist side . But from the very beginning he has been held in check by the Times editors whereas Carney has had a free hand .

Better Times states (January, 1938, page 3, column 1), that \"the Fascist phalanx in the bull pen\" is pro-Franco, anti- Matthews, pro-Carney . One of this group is responsible for the change between the first and city editions of the head- line on Father Duffee's address, PRIEST DEFENDS FASCIST NATIONS to PRIEST SEES SOVIET REAL FOE OF U . s . This is a typical case of slanting Times headlines until they become Hearstian in their Red-baiting . Night Managing Editor Ray- mond McCaw is accused by Better Times of being respon- sible for the order to substitute \"insurgent troops\" wherever Matthews wrote \"Italian troops .\" This also parallels Hearst's order to change the Associated Press and United Press cables, using \"Reds\" for \"Loyalists,\" proof of which I have in letters from these agencies . \"In vain,\" continues Better Times, \"the copy reader pro- tested the whole point of the story was Matthews' proofs of military intervention by Mussolini . So, he carried out his orders with malicious glee when he came to a line declaring 'these troops were Italians and nothing but Italians .'\" Does the reader perhaps remember his confusion over the Mat- thews story which concluded, \"These troops were insurgents and nothing but insurgents\"? Better Times further charges the assistant editors with sending a pro-Fascist to head the copy desk for a while, describes his discomfiture and transfer and also sees a plot in the orders which prevented Matthews' vacation coinciding with Sulzberger's trip to Europe . But its full bitterness was apparent in its February issue when Better Times, reporting the publisher's speech at Chapel Hill, added : \"Mr . Sulzberger is quoted as saying of the Spanish War, 'I confess to a vast sense of relief that I do not have to take"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"362 \t SERVANTS OF THE LORDS sides either with Loyalist or Rebel .' He is glad he is not compelled to choose between right and wrong .\" Such an editorial opinion is hard to understand . If the Communist unit knows what is really happening at the Times, and it gives factual evidence it knows a lot, it should also understand that Arthur Hays Sulzberger is a convinced neutral-liberal, that his intentions are honest, and that he is woefully ignorant of the Carney situation and of many things that happen in his office . It is true that if the sabotage, intimidation, distortion, coloration and suppression that happens on the Times was directed to advance any progres- sive or leftist cause, instead of a reactionary, pro-Franco or generally rightist cause, the editors, sub-editors, reporters and others engaged in it would immediately find themselves out of a job . But being reactionaries they are not only in, but going up . I think this is the most important factor about the Times at present . Mr . Sulzberger says he is a liberal . There is no reason to doubt that he himself believes his liberalism a fact . And Mr . Sulzberger's idea of liberalism is to permit men of all opinions to occupy his editorial jobs, even when a majority of them are not only non-liberals but anti-liberals, and ultimately enemies of liberalism . He seems incapable of spotting reactionary sabotage, but smells \"radical disloyalty\" far away . In the March-April issue The New Times (as it was now called) under the headline, \"Civil Liberties Probe Sabotaged as News,\" said that \"The Times sabotaged news of the La Follette Civil Liberties Committee's investigation of the National Association of Manufacturers in the first part of March so completely that it ought to get paid with more advertising for publishing only what the manufacturers think is fit to print .\" I was shocked by this statement because I thought it false . I took the statement to one of the chiefs of the La Follette committee, one of my best friends . His reply was general : Practically the entire American press sabotaged or suppressed the hearings of the manufacturers' association ."},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"\"TREASON \" ON THE \"TIMES \" \t 363 So long as the La Follette committee dealt with strikes, and strike breakers, its hearings were reported, but when the House of Lords of Big Business was investigated, the press, including the Times, purposely threw the story down . On several occasions the labor-hating Sun gave more N . A . M . investigation news than the supposedly impartial Times . In the May-June issue the Times is accused of changing to an anti-New Deal policy and proofs are advanced . A large part of the issue is taken up with an editorial, \"Lenin and Jefferson .\" There is the usual mixture of fact with bitter- ness and propaganda . But this issue, as all the rest, is in- tensely interesting . On publication day the Times office loses its Olympian dignity . Laughter, shouts and a deep curse from the \"Fascist phalanx\" mark the appearance of The New Times . Every- one marvels at the disclosures . Managing editor James sends a boy into the street to get two copies . He frequently accuses a reporter of being one of the \"disloyal\" who produce the sheet . To one who proved his innocence he remarked \"Why, those -- -- Reds are even in Sulzberger's office .\" (Better Times, January .) The secret sheet accuses the Times of send- ing detectives to its printing shop, intimidating its \"news- boys,\" and trying to put it out of business . So far as I can tell there is nothing illegal and nothing libelous in The New Times . There are propaganda edi- torials which do not interest me . There are a few mistakes . There is also evidence of intense enmity against Sulzberger and the Times itself, and while this is interesting as a social phenomenon in a world where employers still wave the old falsehood about the interests of capital and labor being identical, it is not the one significant fact . The significant fact, which is implicit, although The New Times might give monthly emphasis to it, is that the news- paper, admittedly the most important in America and popu- larly believed the best among metropolitan publications, is far from being a free newspaper . Its claims to liberalism can-"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"364 \t SERVANTS OF THE LORDS not be mentioned in real liberal circles . Its motto \"All the News That's Fit to Print\" has been challenged too often . The evidence is provided in every issue of The New Times that the great Canons of Journalism-Independence, Truth- fulness, Impartiality, Fair Play-do not always thunder on the American Thunderer ; in fact some of them barely whisper and at times all are silent . The little Times tries to make a personal devil out of the publisher . I do not think this is quite fair . But I do think that Mr . Sulzberger must realize that no matter how much he prefers to remain in the neutral background, his paper continues to push into the front line of active social- political forces . The Times itself is news . It might therefore be better policy for Mr . Sulzberger to make a living force out of his announced liberalism than to let that credo become a football for some elevated police reporters who have become editorial powers and who speak of Sulzberger liberalism as \"the bunk .\" Mr . Sulzberger should not forget that his paper is so power- ful that hundreds of others take their tips from it . The Times not only influences its million readers but many more millions through newspapers which follow its policies . The New York Times today is approaching the London Times as a national institution . The truer this statement becomes the more pessimistic must be our judgment of American journalism, because The New Times proves every month that in the greatest of our papers there is also a slanting of news, an exaggeration of headlines, bias in politics, worse than bias in labor reporting, burial alive of \"bad news,\" subservience to big business if not to individual advertisers, and the usual bowing down in the House of Rimmon where the ancient golden calf has become the sacred cow of American journalism .

Journalistically the voice of The New Times is but a whisper, but figuratively it is a national hook-up roaring out an indictment of the whole press of America . And the unanswerable point of the indictment is that our whole press, the greatest power in shaping public opinion, is not playing a fair game with the American people . V The Case of \"General\" Carney The case of William P . Carney, of the New York Times, deserves special attention because it illustrates the power a reporter can have if his views are backed by a pressure group such as the Legion, any church, the N . A . M ., or other seekers of special privilege . When General Franco marched on Madrid in November, 1936, his associate, the drunken buffoon, General Queipo de Llano, speaking over the Seville radio, betrayed one of the many Fascist conspiracies . He announced that Franco was marching with four columns and was relying on \"the Fifth Column,\" the secret Fascist conspirators living in Madrid and pretending to be loyal, to stab the Republic in the back . This announcement resulted in the government taking appropriate action . The prisons of Madrid and Valencia are full of traitors-at least all the known ones except the thou- sands who were able to buy their way into South American pro-Fascist embassies and the headquarters of European ministers favorable to the reactionaries and the mines and money they controlled . But no announcement has been made from General Franco in Burgos on the support his treasonable cause has had from"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"366 \t SERVANTS OF THE LORDS his sixth column : the column commanded by \"General\" Carney in the New York Times . This support of Fascism did not begin in July, 1936, when Franco, after conspiring with Italian Fascist and German Nazi authorities and arranging for the guns and airplanes now in use, openly began the land owners' and mine owners' rebellion . This support from William P . Carney, the New York Times correspondent in Madrid, began in the early days of the Spanish Republic . It was intensified in 1936 . It became fanatical when the Fascist columns were stopped . Carney was the friend of Robles and Lerroux who formed the Clerico-Fascist government of 1933 and which in 1934 imported Moors and the Tercio to massacre the Asturian miners . Carney throughout this period wrote in support of this pre-Fascist movement . The Times refused to listen to protests from all liberals, including a lengthy one from Madariaga . When Franco rebelled and the government put on a cen- sorship, Carney, according to government officials, attempted on all occasions to write into his cables to America items to aid and comfort Fascism and to betray government positions and army plans to Franco . The censors in Madrid make the statement that from almost every cable which Carney sent to the Times they had to delete military information which he injected despite daily warnings . In public cafes and in gatherings of journalists and others, Carney throughout the months of July to December, 1936, continued to express his allegiance to the Fascist cause ; he openly supported Franco ; he cursed the liberal-republican government and he called them \"Reds .\" On leaving Spain in December, 1936, Carney wrote a very long cable in which he pretended to tell the uncensored truth . The Paris office of the Times informs me that the entire staff would have nothing to do with this cable, be- cause although it did not know what was the truth, it realized that Carney's was not, because his lies and prejudices were"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"\"TREASON\" ON THE \"TIMES\" \t 367 too apparent . Also, and this is most important, one American of the Times Paris staff did realize that Carney's cable con- tained a list of the artillery batteries of Madrid and their disposition . However, the Times bureau informs me, it was not able to cancel the cablegram of another Times man ; it merely washed its hands of the matter, and Carney therefore filed the ten thousand words himself . In the government press bureaus in Madrid and Valencia the truth of a large part of the Carney cable is denied . From my own experience in Spain I can say that parts of it are evidently ridiculous and all of it prejudiced . One of the most vicious of all of \"General\" Carney's state- ments is also contained in this dispatch . \"Madrid cannot be cpnsidered an open city,\" says \"General\" Carney . \"Madrid is an open city,\" states General Franco . When, where and how did Franco come to make this statement? You will find it in the New York Times of March 16, 1937- In a dispatch signed by Carney . In other words Franco is more honest than Carney . Carney, apologizing for Fascism, attempted to defend the murder of innocent people in Madrid by telling the Times readers that he did not consider Madrid an open city, whereas the man who ordered the murdering calmly admits that Madrid is an open city . Carney, professional Red-baiter, then repeats the biggest myth of the Spanish war . He cabled: \"There were foreign volunteers-the International Column as they were termed- comprising the tenth, eleventh and twelfth battalions . They were mostly Russians . . . .\" This statement is a lie . (Why call it a misstatement, or a falsehood, when the word lie is the right one?) All the correspondents in Spain then and now know that there never were and are not now any Russians in the Inter- national Brigade . They know there are no Russian troops in Spain . They know that there are or were once some Russians in the Spanish aviation and tanks corps, Russian engineers and experts . Some estimate the number at five hundred,"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"368 \t SERVANTS OF THE LORDS others at seven hundred . But no Russian troops have ever been sent to Spain and to call the tenth, eleventh and twelfth battalions of the International Brigade \"mostly Russians\" is to utter a lie . But the most vicious part of the cable is the description of the defenses of Madrid . Carney tells of machine guns and anti-aircraft guns \"mounted on the tops of all the ministries and tall buildings in the center of the city such as the Fine Arts structure, Calle Alcala, Madrid's main street, and the Palace of the Press in the Gran Via or Broadway . Batteries of six-inch guns have been placed in the Callao Square, directly in front of the park ; near the Prado museum, the observatory and the Ministry of Public Works . The Atocha or Andalusian railway station where more batteries were placed . . . . Observation posts for the government's artillery are stationed in the towers of the taller buildings in the center of the city . . . .\" As a war correspondent I know that if I had sent such a dispatch from the American Expeditionary Force, I would have been taken out and shot . Moreover, there was in Spain at the time a United States government officer-I cannot identify him further because pressure might be brought against him by the pro-Fascists in America-who said to me : \"The man who sent that list of gun emplacements should be shot . If he were on Franco's side and sent such a cable, he should be shot . I make this statement without any emotion and without any prejudices . In any war, and no matter what side you are on, a war correspondent sending out a list of gun emplacements is committing an act of espionage, and shooting is too good for him . Professional spies do such things and take the risk of being shot . But the correspondent of a big and powerful newspaper is not only committing an act of espionage, he is hiding behind the power of his newspaper .\" Carney also defended the slaughter of the women and children of Madrid . \"It cannot be helped that women and"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"\"TREASON\" ON THE \"TIMES\" \t 369 children and aged persons have taken refuge in the base- ments of these structures, say the insurgents,\" he cabled, not only trying to excuse the murders but actually reporting from Madrid what the Fascists on the other side were saying, an unheard-of feat in journalism but an old trick of propa- ganda . \"Despatches submitted for censorship had to be accom- panied by Spanish translations,\" continues Mr . Carney . \"This is an absolute lie,\" says Ilse Kulczar, the censor to whom Mr . Carney submitted his dispatches . After Carney's vacation in Paris in December, 1936, he was sent to the Fascist side, and this seems to me one of the most reprehensible actions in modern journalism . To the dismay of the entire Anglo-American press corps in Valencia and Madrid, including the numerous New York Times representatives, a new series of Carney dispatches, dated Gibraltar, began appearing in the Times . Carney had joined Franco's side . On February 25th he began quoting the exaggerations and murderous boasts of Queipo de Llano . From Franco's side he was also able to tell what the govern- ment side was doing . He reported from Motril that \"retreat- ing government troops are reported to have burned the few remaining churches and to have executed 200 persons, in- cluding four priests who were burned alive after a gasoline bath . . . .\" The authenticated reports from this front, con- firmed by other reporters with Franco ' is that the govern- ment did not even harm the Fascists in the prisons . The Carney report is another of the thousands of hearsay atroc- ities . I can state on the authority of six New York Times corre- spondents in Europe that each one is disgusted with the sort of journalism which Carney has produced . Without excep- tion these reputable journalists declare Carney should have remained with Hearst ."},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8 Freedom for Newspapermen THE elite in newspaperdom is made up of publishers, editors, foreign correspondents, Washington correspondents, columnists, etc ., but the rank and file consists of reporters . Quite recently the term \"working\" newspapermen was in- vented to distinguish them from all sorts of near and pseudo- newspapermen, \"trained seals,\" certain columnists, and others who compose the fringes of journalism . The reporter throughout our history has been the lowliest of animals . Believing himself too good to join in any organ- ization or movement, he has found himself exploited by everyone, and he has been so blinded by his egotism that he has refused to look out for his own material interests . Being a rugged individualist he was usually also the hired stooge of the owners . Lacking any sort of security, he was always in fear of being fired, and this fear quickly drained all the high ideals and great courage with which he usually came into journalism as a cub reporter . The old phrase \"journalistic prostitute\" was popular for generations . It had its justification . But it ceased being ap- propriate the day Garland Ashcraft, of the Cleveland Press, began the formation of a union of editorial workers . Today there is one big union, one small one, several company unions, some independent unions, but generally speaking it must be admitted that the American Newspaper Guild, of which Heywood Broun is president, has led the American newspaper workers out of the red-light district of journalism and into the green pastures of human dignity . 370"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"FREEDOM FOR NEWSPAPERMEN \t 371 The Guild, and the other unimportant organizations which have arisen as a result of Guild activity, have again made journalism a profession, and one no longer akin to the oldest-and worst paid . Unfortunately there is still a percentage of newspaper workers about as dumb as a corre- sponding percentage in other businesses, which does not realize there is a world war going on at present between progress and reaction ; unfortunately there are still journal- istic street walkers, some in the higher brackets, some in little bordellos known as company unions, and some indi- viduals who parade their subserviency, if not prostitution, in lonely grandeur . There are still some who think the brass check a medal of honor . But it may be said that the Guild under • the leadership of Broun, Jonathan Eddy, Carl Ran- dau, Morris Watson, Victor Pasche, Milton Kaufman and Clyde Beals, who edits its weekly journal, means to eliminate all suspicion of harlotry from the profession, and give America the example of a union which is allied with all the powerful, enlightened and progressive forces . In the Autumn of 1938 the Guild listed 15,000 members of whom 12,000 were working newspapermen . The total journalistic population of the nation is less that 40,000, of whom io,ooo or more are one-or-two-man shows which do not enter the Guild field .

In some cities the Guild operates in every newspaper office, in others it has no foothold whatever, but whether it is in control or merely attempting to enter, it furnishes the absolute proof-that the majority of publishers and the most important percentage of their employees are enemies . This enmity was created by the publishers . After generations of merely frowning upon the idea of organization-during which time they paid organized typographical employees higher wages than writers-many publishers began threaten- ing them after laws made unionization possible, and many"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"372 \t SERVANTS OF THE LORDS violated the laws by firing men for joining the Guild . Espionage, intimidation, coercion, and other methods usu- ally associated with big business of the steel corporation and auto industry type have been found by the La Follette Civil Liberties investigators existing in newspaper offices . And as a result hatred of writers for the big lords of the press has spread throughout America . It is a new phenomenon . Falsehood and trickery have also been used by many publishers in attacking the Guild . The Guild has been called a closed shop, which is untrue ; it has been accused of attempt- ing to dictate the coloration of the news-a right heretofore exercised only by the owners-and it has frequently been reported schismatic and decadent . And of course that old lie about Communism was also dragged out despite the fact that Editor & Publisher, mouthpiece of the A . N . P . A ., declared unqualifiedly that \"charges that the American Newspaper Guild is unduly friendly with the Communist Party have come to us recently, part, no doubt, of the current anti-Red hysteria . Brief investigation discloses no basis for them . . . .\" There is of course a unit on the Communist Daily Worker- just as there is on the Fascist Il Progresso . In the famous June, 1937, special convention of the pub- lishers the notable attendants were Arthur Hays Sulzberger, of the New York Times ; Norman Chandler, of the Los Angeles Times ; Harry Bitner, of the Hearst press ; John Cowles, of the Des Moines Register & Tribune ; Frank Gan- nett, chain lord, and Colonel McCormick, of the Chicago Tribune . A . N . P . A . president Stahlman said : \"A closed editorial shop means a closed editorial mind .\" That was the keynote . Sulzberger was the chief backer of a resolution which after intense debate over the use of the word \"de- termination\" or \"refusal,\" finally was passed as a \"determina- tion not to enter into any agreement\" with the Guild on a \"closed Guild shop or any other form of closed shop\" basis . Editor & Publisher headlines are typical :"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"FREEDOM FOR NEWSPAPERMEN \t 373 FIRM STAND AGAINST GUILD CLOSED SHOP VOTED BY ELEVEN NEWSPAPER GROUPS Editorial Union Demand Viewed as Menace to Press Freedom The facts of course are these : The Guild contract, which most publishers reject, permits the publisher to hire anyone in the world he likes ; it provides, however, for recognition of the Guild and the adhesion to this organization of the new employee within thirty days . Therefore the use of the words \"closed shop\" is a case of smearing, just as the Herald Tribune invention of \"youth control\" for freedom from child labor was, and when Hearst changed \"tax the rich\" to \"soak the rich .\" President Broun of the Guild replied that the A . N . P . A . was \"holding to the philosophy of Tom Girdler\" in union matters . The publishers then and now insist that the unionization of press employees will mean a labor bias in the news . Thus Wilbur Forrest, assistant executive editor of the New York Herald- Tribune, told the Williamstown Institute of Public Relations that \"for the Guild to inject the closed shop means that perhaps unknowingly you will inject into newspaper writing unconsciously and between the lines, a pro-labor view .\" (This would result in the most heinous crime against free- dom of the press, of course, because it would replace the present anti-labor slant of some ninety percent of the news- papers .) Walter Lippmann, America's best known ex-liberal, re- fused to continue to pay his dues \"as long as the American Newspaper Guild stands committed to the political opinion adopted at the St . Louis convention or any other political opinions .\" New York executive secretary Milton Kaufman replied that \"individual members of the Guild are no more"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"374 \t SERVANTS OF THE LORDS committed to resolutions . . . than are editorial employees of the Herald Tribune committed to the editorial policy of the Herald Tribune,\" a thrust which probably hurt the con- servative catechumen . All anti-labor forces have attacked the Guild on the same basis . Thus Merwin K . Hart, of the New York State Eco- nomic Council, an organization which would go Hitler one better by disfranchising men out of jobs, accused the Guild of attempting to gain control of the nation's press by strikes and intimidation . To all these attacks the Guild has replied that there is not a single instance of proof . It is not the Guild intention to seize the newspapers or change their editorial policy or in any way to interfere with the editors and publishers . An investigation by the New Republic led to the con- clusion that \"there is not the slightest evidence that the Newspaper Guild has tried or ever will try to dictate the editorial policies of the newspapers where its members are employed .\" Another investigation by the American Press, a publisher's organ, which asked every paper which had a Guild contract to report on it, led to the conclusion that \"all editors who responded agree that so far there has been no attempt to color stories or dictate news treatment and without exception the men were willing to work as long as necessity demanded . . . . All admitted there had been slight payroll increases .\" Lewis B . Seltzer, editor of the Cleveland Press, replied : \"By and large our morale, the general attitude of everyone on the paper, the enthusiasm and happiness-individually and as a group-is higher than in fifteen years .\" What really happens when a newspaper office is made into a Guild preferential shop is that the reporters, assured for the first time in their lives of economic security so long as they are efficient, begin telling the real facts, the truth behind the news, and stop slanting the news-consciously or uncon- sciously-to please the First National or the Peoples Light, or"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"FREEDOM FOR NEWSPAPERMEN 375 the other pecuniary forces with which the owner is allied in some way . Of course the publishers, who openly admit their enmity for the Guild, have replied by charging it with being dicta- torial, and with being pro-labor and altogether too liberal . The Guild claims there is not a case on record where Guild reporters failed to cover a labor dispute honestly or where Guildsmen influenced either the handling of the news or the editorials on any labor dispute . Says the Guild Reporter : \"The hypocrisy of all the pious bleating about `the danger of pro-labor bias' becomes apparent in a mo- ment's reflection on the present handling of labor news . Editorially and in their news columns most publishers con- duct a ceaseless campaign against labor unions . The New York Times, like most of the others, plays up such organiza- tions as the Flint Alliance (strike breakers) and `back to work movements' (later found to be paid for), trumped up for strike-breaking purposes ; it plays up statements laying responsibility on unions, plays up anything suggesting the defeat of a strike, and buries in stories any details showing the gains won in the innumerable victorious strikes . . . .\" Of course everyone in the profession (outside the usual number of knownothingists) understands what is really go- ing on behind the parade of words . Everyone knows that the Guild is not a union in the old A . F . of L . sense, and is even miles ahead of the C . I . O . The Guild has realized that labor unions whose whole objective is better working conditions and better money for its membership, are only a small step forward in American progress .

And it is just because the newspaper publishers of Amer- ica are either unaware of the social issues, or, worse yet, in- sistent that the public be kept in ignorance of the social issues, that they have united all their forces and venom to fight the intelligent leadership of the socially conscious News- paper Guild ."},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"376 \t SERVANTS OF THE LORDS From the very beginning all the smug and the wealthy and the supercilious critics have had their fun about the Guild \"going out of its way\" to endorse a pardon for Tom Mooney for example, or to uphold the civil liberties of a man or a movement where some atrocious denial of justice has taken place . The Guild has been told to stick to its trade and con- centrate on bettet wages and hours . But it has consistently branched out into all social and economic problems which affect its membership and the whole people, and when the test came of this policy it was upheld by its membership . It is most interesting to note that whereas some ninety percent of the publishers have gone on record for or against certain public measures, the employees of these publishers have usually gone on record by the same percentage, but on the opposite side . The Guild has supported the C . I . 0 ., it has denounced the Chicago policemen for the murders of Memorial Day, it has supported the Roosevelt Supreme Court Plan, it has approved WPA appropriations, and generally denounced the American brand of Fascism which masquerades as patriotism . It has always passed resolutions in the belief they were for the general welfare of the Amer- ican people, not the special welfare of a small group . Its most important action has been its declaration in favor of a press free for the reader instead of freedom of the press for the publisher at the expense of all the rest of the world . Being therefore always on the side of the general welfare as against the special interests it has naturally been opposed to the publishers' program in almost all cases . At various times during strikes and other conflicts with the publishers the Guild has obtained proof that the employers are no better or worse than members of the National Associa- tion of Manufacturers or the U . S . Chamber of Commerce . In other words, it has been an open fight between capital and labor, with the publishers using the police, the injunction, and many other weapons-except bullets and infrequently tear gas-to defeat the newspapermen . Moreover, having al-"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"FREEDOM FOR NEWSPAPERMEN \t 377 most complete control of the channels of communications, the publishers have distorted the facts and in some instances lied about the issues . Guildsmen at various times have pub- lished little sheets giving their side of the case and making the foregoing charges against the newspaper owners . The publishers, reported the president of the Guild at the Atlan- tic City meeting in 1937, \"used their own news columns without restraint for a campaign of distortion and misrepre- sentation of the Guild and its acts, seeking to injure its position with the public .\" The Guild has found out that there is no free press . The Guild knows that the press is not fair to labor . The Guild knows that the publishers are anti-labor ; in fact, that they are anti-social . I cannot for the life of me see how Arthur Robb,* editor of Editor & Publisher, can write editorially that ninety-five percent of the press is honest, fair and accu- rate and only five percent guilty of sins of omission and com- mission, when there are more than ten thousand organized and enlightened writers for this press who testify that the figures are just about the other way around . The Guild has the complete proof that about five percent of the press is honest, accurate and fair, and that ninety-five percent is not honest, accurate or fair . In other words we have no free press in America . We have a few free newspapers . Too darn few . V The Guild today represents American journalism .

Practical suggestions, if possible . It is of course quite easy to make idealistic sugges- tions, such as \"change the world\" or \"introduce a new sys- tem,\" but even the smallest tinge of idealism is looked upon with suspicion, and a strong attempt at reform arouses al- most violent opposition, as any public official can easily find out for himself . In this section of five small chapters I would like to make five practical-or near-practical-suggestions for producing a better press than the press lords have given us . First of all I think the time has come to recognize the fact that the newspaper business is a business, a big investment, \"no longer a mere million-dollar affair ; it calls for tens of millions,\" as Lewis Gannett has said . Well, big business has generally recognized the unionization of its employees . The publishers and the Typographical Union have gotten along splendidly . They should recognize the Guild or any other newspaper union as a union . Once this were done, I suggest that the next step should be to invite the newspapermen to run the newspapers . After all, doctors run hospitals and lawyers run the courts, and it would not be strange if newspapermen, who know all there is to know, were actually in complete charge of their busi- ness . There is no other in the world where' the employees can take over so easily without the help of bosses and owners . Several years ago I wrote that \"what the Guild really wants 381"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"382 \t BATTLES OF THE LORDS is a say in newspaper making in America . It is entitled to that . The day of the irresponsible employers is over . . .\" but apparently I made a terrible blunder there . The Guild attacked me angrily . Its executive secretary, Jonathan Eddy, wrote : \"I hope Mr . Seldes is right when he pictures the Guild as the cleanest and most progressive force in American jour- nalism today, yet he is very wrong (perhaps out of a personal 'wish-fulfillment') when he seems to imply that the Guild aims to exert editorial control over newspapers . But since he does believe that our organization is a great and healthy force in American life, it is difficult to understand how he can take seriously the pretensions of bitter and unscrupulous enemies of the Guild .\" It was not unscrupulous enemies of the Guild that gave me the idea, nor was it wish-fulfillment . It was pure logic . And I am sorry to know that the Guild is not interested in edi- torial control of newspapers, or in editing and publishing them . So long as the papers remain private property there is of course no chance for workingmen to make such demands from the owners, but it seems to me obvious that the Guild, which includes all the men' cap able of running the industry, and which has proven that it means freedom of the press and not freedom of the lords, and which has a program which puts it in the forefront of liberal and progressive organ- izations in America, should at least have a say in the business . They ought to ask for it . It ought to be given them without asking . Newspapermen can challenge the publishers . They can say : Prove you mean freedom of the press by letting the editorial staff run the newspaper . Here we have men of many different political, economic and perhaps religious viewpoints, but all of them know just what a free newspaper should be . If you put them on the editorial board-as some great newspapers have done in the past-you will produce a free newspaper against which no honest man can raise a word of protest ."},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"LET NEWSPAPERMEN RUN THE NEWSPAPERS 383 At present most newspapers run under a sort of dictator- ship . Not Fascist, but still dictatorial . When Hearst sends an order to run Marion Davies' picture every day for a month, it hurts no one, but when he sends an order to smear a certain liberal Congressman, that is journalistic dictatorship . Nor is Hearst unique . I regret that I have to retract my statement that the Guild wants a say in newspaper making . I know that the Guild has never tried to run the press, and says it will never try to dictate editorial policies on any paper . And I repeat : news- papermen should demand a voice in newspaper making .

The American government is willing to take an enormous loss provided education, enlightenment and culture flourish . It is supposed that printed matter provides all of them . Westbrook Pegler is the only journalist who has ever questioned the size of the subsidy, but he has not forgotten that it exists . He claims that the loss through free newspapers carried in the county of publication is only $8,ooo,ooo a year, and that the postmaster general should not compute first-class rates on it, since newspapers do not get first-class treatment . The New York Daily News is the only paper in Americaa which, although its beneficiary, has consistently criticized the subsidy.

Farley claims, and that the chief beneficiaries, the newspapers, have kept the fact hidden in their closets . Certainly every time they attack some other subsidy and keep their own silent they are giving that old skeleton another push into the darkness . Now, no one in America, not even Colonel McCormick of the free press committee of the publishers' association, is a greater advocate of a free press than the present writer, and I would not for a moment suggest any check or barrier, blinder or halter, shackle or manacle on our free press .

The failure of a free press in most countries is usually blamed on the readers . Every nation gets the government- and the press-it deserves . This is too facile a remark . The people deserve better in most governments and press .

Intelligent readers frequently ask for means of testing the press . The easiest way is to buy copies of newspapers for a week or so, study them carefully, and compare news and headlines .

Of the (say) ninety percent of the press which howled down the President in 1937 and 1938 a goodly portion called itself independent, or that hypocritical paradox, \"independent Republican\" and \"independent Democratic .\" There are less than a dozen independent newspapers in the whole country, and even that small number is dependent on advertisers and other things, and all these other things which revolve around money and profii make real independence impossible . No newspaper which is supporting one class of society is inde- pendent .

Class-conscious newspapers cannot be free newspapers . If we accept the statement that this feeling is still \"un- conscious,\" then we can proceed with tests of the freedom of these papers .

Give some space to minority parties, at least space relative to their strength . (These two tests will put the majority of our press, which .styles itself independent, on the spot .) 3 .

This co-operative, non- profit-seeking organization tests all consumers' goods ; its scientific reports are frequently at variance with the adver- tisements, and no one can challenge their truthfulness . The newspapers show their prostitution to advertisers every time they refuse a Consumers Union advertisement . The adver- tisements merely solicit membership in the organization . They do not distinguish between good and bad products . But the monthly report of the Union does list good and bad products thereby serving its members well, but offending the manufacturers of bad products who are also large adver- tisers . If I were to be asked for one specific proof that the old- fashioned venality still persists in the press, and that the advertiser still dominates the newspaper business, I would offer the experiences of the foregoing organization in dealing with the business managers of newspapers and magazines . The element of hypocrisy also enters the situation : do numerous cases the Union has requested the publications to place their refusal to carry its advertisements in writing . But the publications have refused to give the organization docu- mentary proof of their dirty work . The excuses given by some of the great newspapers are strange and varied . One says it does not accept the \"type\" of advertisement, and another declares the ad is \"contro- versial .\" The Union advertisement is not an advertisement offering anything for sale : it is simply a notice that a non- profit making public service society seeks members, and these members are promised a scientifically truthful service about consumers' goods . Among the advertising managers who said by telephone they would not take the Union's announcements and who refused to send written confirmation, the Union informs me, are the New York News and the Philadelphia Record . On the other hand the Union has a frank (although oral) admission from a salesman from the magazine Esquire that"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"390 \t BATTLES OF THE LORDS that magazine \"had received complaints from some of the big liquor firms because Esquire had run a C . U . ad describ- ing our liquor report . They threatened to withdraw their advertising if Esquire ran any more C .

U . for a page advertisement, which it did . The Union offered to pay the usual price of $goo for a page . But the ad did not appear because the salesman who rejoiced one day that he had landed the order, found out the next day that it would offend all the other advertisers . The Union ran full page advertisements in the New York Times in 1936 and the result was a tremendous growth in membership . But in February, 1937, -the Times man- agement held up an advertisement and questioned the competency of the Union's laboratories . At .a conference the non-profit making organization submitted its evidence, whereupon the Times representatives, although seemingly satisfied, suggested that an investigation be made by the Better Business Bureau . This bureau is an organization which is run by big business and advertisers and some of its officials make drugs, foods and commodities which have been criticized by Consumers Union . The proposition was ridicu- lous . It would be equivalent to have the ethical doctors of America investigated by the patent medicine makers . Finally the Times suggested it might run the advertising if promi- nent men would endorse the work . Senators, Representatives, college professors, writers, and others did so . But the Times still continues to play the game of straddling and evading . Among the sixty publications which through sheer fear of losing money from other advertisers have refused the Union advertising (in addition to those mentioned) are the New York Herald Tribune, the New York Post, the Chris- tian Science Monitor, and dozens of magazines . The Post has been \"considering\" an ad for two years ; on"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"TEN TESTS FOR A FREE PRESS \t 391 May 3, 1937, it wrote it was \"not in a position to determine the accuracy of the Consumers' Union reports\" and would communicate when it had done so, and there the matter rests . The Christian Science Monitor, which has a great record for throwing fake advertising for the very drugs, foods and commodities, which the Union also exposes, out of its columns, could not, however, bring its integrity to the point of accepting the advertising f or .a n organization which has a social and progressive policy and a social conscience . \"It is, not possible for us to give the reason for this decision,\" it wrote . A letter mailed in a Scripps-Howard envelope informed the Union that John Sorrells, executive editor, had sent instructions to all Scripps-Howard editors to kill C . U . press material . The Union complained to Roy Howard . It re- ceived a reply from Mr . Sorrells saying : \"We have not instructed Scripps-Howard editors `not to use C . U . press material' . . . but we have from time to time cautioned our editors with regards to the use of handouts material from any of the various consumer bureaus . . . .\" In other words the Scripps-Howard press uses thousands of columns of handouts from the automobile and other industries which advertise, but cautions its editors not to use press material which would benefit the consumers-perhaps at the expense of the advertisers . Time after time Consumers Union has protested this boy- cott by the press in its own monthly reports . Frequently many among its 65,000 members have written to publishers and received no satisfaction . The New York Times, however, has adopted a form letter to deal with such protests . It reads : The New York Times accepted the advertising of the firm you mention for many months .

This is the nearest to a confession that it is advertising agency pressure which is directing the policy of the news- papers . A better confession of this sinister business can be found in Editor & Publisher (August 6, 1938) where Edward Davenport, a merchandising expert, writes a tremendous attack on all consumers' organizations . Since he cannot possibly say anything just or rational against them, he calls them names and \"enemies of the American industrial system and social order .\" In a way this is true . Consumers' organizations favor their members, the public, and expose such things as excessive utility rates, fake advertising, shoddy goods, false bargains, poisonous patent medicines, and many useless and fraud- ulent companies and products which help put big publishers in the upper income tax brackets, and therefore maintain their social order .

My ideal newspaper would publish nothing but the facts as far as it is humanly possible to get them . But it would have a staff of men who would be out every day looking for the facts and who would never be content with the surface, news . With such a newspaper it would not be necessary o 399"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"400 \t BATTLES OF THE LORDS have an editorial page, because the facts would write their own editorial . But until such time as such an ideal newspaper is founded, it is necessary that we have a press which will publish the considerable body of news which the commercial press sup- presses or buries, or distorts ; and a press which will have an editorial policy counteracting the poisons which flow from the editorial pages of the great majority of party and corpo- ration newspapers . Outside of the commercial press I have mentioned the Christian Science Monitor and the Jewish Forward, two powerful daily newspapers, which are not motivated by profits and which have a great influence . But, as I have also pointed out, they are parochial in their views . The Communist Party supports the New York Daily Worker and its Chicago and San Francisco colleagues . These newspapers are marked Communist . There is no pretense about them, no dishonesty about ownerships as with the dailies which proclaim themselves the public defender but really represent the utilities, banks and other interests . The La Follette movement has a few liberal supporters which state their ownership and interests honestly . But the great mass-majority of the American people, or- ganized and unorganized labor, has no daily press of its own, and has not yet awakened to the fact-as French and British and other workingmen have done-that the commercial press only pretends that the interests of labor are its first interest also . There is not one labor newspaper in America to equal the London Herald . (That paper, alas, has been turned over to a commercial printer by the British Labor Party and has lost a great deal of its power .) There are 570 labor publications in the United States, with 8,778,000 circulation, and there are several independent weeklies which are decidedly friendly to labor . The Peoples Press, founded a few years ago, has attained"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"LABOR MUST FIGHT THE PRESS LORDS \t 401 a circulation of a quarter million copies . It is a weekly . It is supported by unions and devoted to their cause, but it is actually a general newspaper . It publishes special editions for various sections of the country and for special events, such as big strikes . One of its greatest achievements was the scoop on the death of 476 workers in a West Virginia tunnel enterprise : the cause of death was silicosis . At that time the New York Times wrote an editorial exonerating the corpo- ration and joking at the whole idea of silicosis, but a Con- gressional investigation substantiated the Peoples Press . This weekly also does its readers many services, one of which' is a consumers' department exposing fraudulent food and drugs . A few hundred thousand dollars subscribed for this weekly would make it an important force in the country . Another weekly, Labor, founded two decades ago, now has a circulation of 500,000 . Its editor, Edward Keating, tried to induce Samuel Gompers, late president of the American Federation of Labor, to back a chain of labor newspapers throughout the country, but Gompers, although impressed, found he had no time for the idea . Recently there were rumors that John L. Lewis would found at least one, and possibly three big newspapers which would help the C . I . O . movement, but nothing has come of them . For its own interests, if not for the 'interests of a better press, labor should have its own newspapers . It can publish either a string of journals devoted to general information, or it can publish purely journals which editorially would counteract the news propaganda of its enemies . To get millions of readers the labor press will have to supply the comic strips, the stories dealing with sex, money and crime, which have made many tabloids successful, the baseball scores, all the stuff the general public wants and now gets in the non-labor or anti-labor press . If the labor newspaper existed it would act as a purge for the general press . No editor and publisher would continue to"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"402 BATTLES OF THE LORDS distort and discolor -the news if he was certain that his rival, a labor newspaper, would detect him in this work and expose him every day . The existence of labor newspapers would raise the standards of all newspapers . A labor newspaper would be for journalism what the TVA yardstick is for electricity . IF Labor must challenge the press lords . It takes a million to start a newspaper nowadays, and organized labor can raise that million . Newspapermen should ask for a share in newspaper mak- ing . The reader should challenge the bona fides of his home town newspapers under the code of ethics and the canons of journalism which the editors and publishers proclaim . Congress should go ahead with the proposed investigation of our lords of the press . More so today than in the time of the World War and in generations and centuries ago, the press of the world has become the most important weapon of dictators and com- mercial powers . In no dictator country do the .people have anything to say to their rulers, political or journalistic . Only in democratic countries is there the beginning of a suspicion that the old axioms about the press being the bulwark of liberty is something that affects the daily life of the people- that it is a living warning rather than an ancient wisecrack . A people that wants to be free must arm itself with a free press ."},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"17, 19, 34, 23 8, 3o8 , 372 , 397 American Press, 374 American Press Society, 377, 397 American Society of Newspaper Edi- tors, 6, 227, 302 Anderson, Benjamin, 317 Anderson, Paul Y ., 51, 204, 266, 267 Annenberg, Moses L ., Chapter 18 Ashcraft, Garland, 370 Associated Press, 9, 1o, 16, 29, 53, 137, 235, 238, 285, 297 Aylesworth, Merlin H ., 99 Index Bovard, Oliver K ., 268-271, 899 Brandeis, justice, 320 Bridge, Don, 193 Bridgeport Times-Star, 132 Bridges, Harry, 230, 245 Briffault, Robert, 1gg Bromley, Dorothy Dunbar, 97, 137 Brpoklyn Eagle, 86, 173 Brooklyn Tablet, 346, 899 Brophy, John, go, 91 Broun, Heywood, 7, 95 , 97, 423 , 324, 327, 337, 338, 345, 37 0 Browder, Earl, 324 Buffalo News, 181 Byoir, Carl, 812 Baltimore Sun papers, 41, Chapter 9, . 181, 285, 296 Barnes, Dr .
