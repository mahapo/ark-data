During his lifeti me he was unable to allow his name to appear as its submission for Eccleiastial Censorship might have l ed to complications. The foreword and appendices an d a number of notes to the present edition were the wor k of Father Fahey. The authoress, Mrs. L. Fry, was married to one of t he aristocrats of Czarist Russia and she suffered h arrowing experiences in the days of the Bolshevist Revolutio n. This first hand knowledge of Communism in action has given authority to her writings. For many years she was associated with the work of the late French pr iest Monseigneur Jouin, helping hime in his researches i nto the atheistic and Judeo-Bolshevist plot against Christianity. 1st Edition 1931 2nd Edition Revised 1933 3rd Edition Revised 1934 4th Edition Revised 1953 5th Edition Enlarged 1965 6th Edition 1988 "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"CONTENTS .

The Publishers are pleased to be able to present a new edition of Waters Flowing Eastward, considere d by many to be the best and most complete work on the f amous Protocols of the Sages of Zion. To stress the fact that the realization of the Protocols means the eli mination of the rule of Christ the King, it has bee n thought well to Sub-title the book The War Against the King ship of Christ. We are omitting some of the illustrations include d in the earlier editions, but we are adding three important Appendices. Appendix I is the reproduction of a lar ge portion of an article which appeared in The Aust ralian Social Crediter, March and April, 1946. It shows th e steady advance of the plans outlined in the Proto cols and emphasizes the importance of the financial factor. Appendix II treats of the Berne Trials, in particul ar of the false statements circulated about the decision give n in the Second Trial. This Appendix is the transla tion of an extract from a work by the late H. de Vries de Heek elingen, one of the ablest writers on this question . The Third Appendix contains some information abou t the Jews who hold leading positions in Russia and the Satellite Countries, as well as in U.N.O. and U.S.A ., and about the persecution of Catholics in these countries and in Palestine. The information is taken from Fre e Britain (August 20, September 10, September 24, 1 950), The Tablet (Brooklyn) and Social Credit (Canada). Several arguments against the authenticity of the P rotocols are examined in the book. It may be well t o mention here a completely new argument for their authentici ty. In 1937, a Russian ex-officer of the Czarist In telligence Service asked to see a friend of ours. The Russian ex-officer was accompanied, on the occasion of the meeting, by a man well and favourably known to our friend. T he ex-officer informed our friend and his wife that , in 1897, he had been called from Washington, where he was working for the Czari st government, and sent to Basle, Switzerland, wher e the first Zionist Congress was being held that year. He was given a small detachment of picked secret serv ice men. While the Jews were in secret conclave, his men sta ged a sham fire and dashed into the room shouting F ire! Fire! In the ensuing confusion he made his way quic kly to the President's or Lecturer's table and took possession of all the papers that were on it. These papers contained the originals of the Protocols. This Russian officer escaped out of Russia in 191 7 and lived mostly in Paris. He was an old man in 1 937. Needless to say our friend's veracity and reliabili ty are unquestioned. To the information taken from Free Britain must b e added the following from Know Your Enemy, by Robe rt H. Williams: \" Mr. Ashberg, who was known throughou t the banking world as a Jewish financier at the Ni a Banken in Sweden before the Bolshevik Revolution, a nd was reported by Edgar Sisson as having arrived i n Russia two months after the successful \" October Re volution,\" is still in Russia and is the banker for the U.S.S.R. The London Star, September 6, 1948, report ed a visit by Ashberg to Switzerland ' for secret m eetings with Swiss government officials and banking executi ves. Diplomatic circles describe Mr. Ashberg as the Soviet Banker who advanced large sums to Lenin and Trotski in 1917. At the time of the revolution, Mr. Ashber g gave Trotski money to form and equip the first unit of t he Red Army. A spokesman of the Soviet Legation in Berne said ' Mr. Ashberg's visit will be private. He has property in Switzerland'. . . Note that Banker-Comm unist Ashberg was even permitted to own property, and in a capitalist nation. Gentile bankers-competitors of Jewish finance-were liquidated as capitalists soon after t he revolution.\" (i) In The A.D.L. Bulletin of January, 1953, published by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, ther e appeared an article entitled \" The Protocols and th e Prague Trial.\" The article began by asserting tha t the Protocols had been proved to have been \" fabricated \" under the Russian Czars. That statement is now seen to be doubly false fro m the testimony above adduced. The main purpose of the A.D.L. article was to attem pt to show that the Protocols, in an astounding num ber of ways \"-were \" the source book for the Prague purge trials.\" That is very interesting in view of the fa ct that the Minister of Justice in charge of the Prague \" Anti- Semitic \" trials was a Jew, Stefan Rais. He, of cou rse, was acquainted with the Protocols from the Jewish side, and he was only one of the multitude of Jews who a re in"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"control behind the Iron Curtain. One of them was F. Herczog, who replaced as Minister of State-plannin g in Hungary the \" purged \" Jew, Zolton Vas.

PREFACE It has been frequently observed that our civiliza tion follows the course of the sun westward: from G reece to Rome, from Scandinavia and Germany to England, Fran ce and Spain, from Europe to America. It looks towards the west for fresh lands where it may build nobler cities and create more perfect forms of lif e, unhampered by the trammels of the past. It may be s aid that the west stands for independence of though t, free expression, and representative government: these pr inciples are involved in the western conception of progress. Beneath this great westward flow of our civilizat ion, there are undercurrents moving eastward. These are impelled by a spirit which looks back to the east, to the days of tyrant and slave, of luxury and mise ry, and incidentally the suppression of western culture. Th is spirit is retrogressive, though often calling it self \" Progress,\" and its ways are devious. But the curren ts for which it is responsible are broad, deep and violent in their effect. The following pages are designed to cast light on these eastern undercurrents which have undermined western states. Political problems which most governments p refer to ignore have been commented upon in detail. Special attention has been given to a struggle goin g on underground, and which is perhaps of greater significance than the so-called perils to western c ivilization, such as the Yellow Peril or the Black Peril, where every move is watched and understood not only by th er rulers in each nation, but also by the governed themselves as a whole. In brief, an attempt has been made to place in br oad relief the inner structure of a system which ha s produced and still foments not only racial enmity, but also has even undermined certain civilizations and overt hrown established national governments."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"PART ONE ZIONISM I. THE BALFOUR DECLARATION The world war had entered its fourth year in the latter part of 1917, with no indication of a rapid settlement in sight. The complexity and variety of events, increa sing with the years, had emphasized its universal c haracter. Every country engaged-whether America, Germany, Rus sia, Greece, France, Italy, or England found its en tire interests, political, economic, and ethnic, involve d in the issue. All these nations seemed gripped in a deadlock, and at the same time felt the pressing need of deli verance. Before 1917, it had been thought that if the alli es continued to hold the western front, the Russian \" steam roller \" would crash the central powers by sheer fo rce of numbers. But the \"steam roller\" had itself e xploded: there had been a revolution, and, by the end of Jul y, Russian troops had withdrawn from Bessarabia and Moldavia, and between the Dniester and the Pruth, l eaving the eastern front undefended. If this loss w as somewhat offset by the fact that America, in spite of the President's reluctance, had finally joined t he allies, it was still doubtful whether her forces would arrive in time and in sufficient numbers to be of real mil itary value. The scale on which the war was waged made all usu al methods of reaching a settlement out of the ques tion: no outside Power could be invoked as mediator; the Pop e had issued a peace proposal on August 1, but the allies regarded it as inspired by Germany and turned a dea f ear. Allied statesmen had cast about for some principl e on which an honourable peace could be proposed, i f a crushing defeat could not be inflicted on the enemy . The principle of nationalities, viz., the right o f small nations to form their own government, had been adva nced, and had met with general acceptance. Thus America's object in entering the war, accordin g to President Wilson, was to deliver the peoples o f the world from autocracy,\" \" to make the world safe for democracy,\" and the like. But the application of t his principle presented difficulties. That Germany and Austria should be broken up into Poland, Czecho-Slo vakia, Hungary, Jugo-Slavia, etc., in the way that afterwa rd occurred, was one matter; but the example of Rus sia, and the possibility of the principle being applied to E ngland, then troubled by Irish agitators, and the o ther allies, led many to dread a completely dismembered Europe. Nevertheless, the idea had acquired a large measu re of popularity in cities where reaction against o ver- organization had created an intense desire for free dom. In rough, this was the situation when the British government issued a note favouring a national home for the Jews: it took the form of a letter addressed to Lor d Rothschild and signed by the Secretary of State f or Foreign Affairs, Sir Arthur (later Lord) Balfour, and read: Foreign Office, November 2, 1917. \" DEAR LORD ROTHSCHILD, I have much pleasure in conveying to you on behal f of His Majesty's Government the following declara tion of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations, which has been submitted to and approved by the Cabinet: His Majesty's Government view with favour the estab lishment in Palestine of a national home for the Je wish people, and will use their best endeavours to facil itate the achievement of this object, it being clea rly understood that nothing shall be done which, may pr ejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine or the rights and politica l status enjoyed by Jews in any other country. I should be grateful if you would bring this declar ation to the knowledge of the Zionist Federation. Yours sincerely, ARTHUR JAMES BALFOUR.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Thus it was that the Jews, the \" Chosen People,\" after centuries of ispersion, were to be establishe d in a home land. Here was poetic justice; it seemed as though nineteen centuries of wrongs were to be righted. Six weeks later, the newspapers were full of the triumphal entry of General Allenby into Jerusalem, and the conquest of the Holy Land by the British army which included Jewish units: to the religious-minded, it was as though Providence had set the seal of approval on t he Balfour declaration. Sceptics, on the other hand , remarked callously that Allenby's army had been loi tering about Palestine inactive for the last four m onths; that Jerusalem offered no resistance and one week ought to have sufficed for staging his entry. His forces undoubtedly counted some Jews in the commissary dep artment, as there are in all armies; but the credit for the conquest was almost wholly due to the assistance of the Arabs, over a hundred thousand strong, to whom the promise of autonomy had been made by England in 191 5. The Balfour declaration was a direct violation o f this promise. But for every miracle there are unbeliever s! More than a decade has passed, and, looking back, one is inclined to ask a few questions: Why was it that the British cabinet with a war on its hands resolved to set aside a national home for the Jews ? Had the c abinet proposed a home in the Near East to the Armenians f irst, and on the latter's refusal turned to the Jew s ? Was it to be an asylum for cripples and orphans; or a reli gious centre; or a sort of Liberia, like African Li beria founded in 1822 for freed negroes? Or were all the Jews in the world supposed to migrate back to Palestine ? T his last idea, though excellent in theory, would hardly be f easible. Reading the declaration carefully, it becomes cle ar that certain Jews (the Zionist group), and not a ll the Jews, wanted a \" national home \": they may even have inti mated their desire to some member of the cabinet. S ir Arthur was dining one evening at Lord Rothschild's country place and admiring his beautiful home, when , at the mention of that word, Lord Rothschild, turning away to hide a tear, said sadly that some of his fr iends \" had no home [that is, no national home] where they coul d lay their heads.\" Sir Arthur was touched and said he would mention it to His Majesty and to his colleagu es, and knew that they would express their sympathy for Lord Rothschild's friends in distress. Accordingly, the declaration of sympathy followed a few days la ter. For those who are satisfied with the above explan ation there is no need to read further; those, howe ver, w î desire a fuller account of things may be willing to discard popular fallacies and study things afresh. As a background, a general idea of the history and chara cter of the Jews and their institutions is essentia l. The longest path may be the shortest in the end. II. THE JEWISH COMMUNITY: ITS SPIRIT AND ORGANISATI ON In studying the Jewish people, special attention must be given to the Jewish community. This pecul iar social order has for twenty centuries impressed its indeli ble mark on every one of its members in every quart er of the globe; uncrushed by pressure from without, it has a dministered its affairs according to its own arbitr ary laws, often in defiance and to the detriment of the gover nment of the land. The authority of the Jewish lead ers, originally derived from the ten commandments delive red to Moses,l had already in the time of Augustus been widely extended2 by a learned but unscrupulous prie sthood 3 over an ignorant, superstitious people. In that age, while a struggle was going on between two rival sec ts, Pharisees4 and Sadducees,5 certain political cl ubs 6 were formed which concealed under a religious mask the grasping aims of a clique.7 These clubs were not slow to take advantage of th eir country's misfortunes. A few years later, durin g the siege of Jerusalem by Vespasian, they won, by the betraya l of the Jewish cause, the favour of the Roman conq ueror,8 and were subsequently entrusted by the imperial gov ernment with the administration of Palestine.' More over, with the sack of Jerusalem, the destruction of the temple, and the death of the patriotic leaders, the common people found themselves utterly dependent, in spiri tual as well as civil matters, upon these same self -styled societies of the learned, who alone possessed the s ecrets of the priesthood and copies of the sacred t exts. By interpreting, altering, and augmenting the rules an d ritual these texts contained, and by a system of espionage and assassination,10 the new rulers established a s trict control over the daily life of their co-relig ionists. Thus having taken hold of the Jewish people through the medium of the Roman authority, this clique easily p laced its laws above the ten commandments, and formed a gover nment whose control over its subjects was absolute. 11 This government became henceforth known as the Kaha l.12"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The dispersion of the Jews which followed in 135 A. D., instead of destroying the Kahal, served on the contrary to set it on a new and firmer basis, on which it ha s continued ever since. Wherever Jewish emigrants s ettled,13 they founded communities apart under the direction of the fraternities, and held to the precepts of th e Talmud.(tm) Each community had its representative, its rabbi, its synagogue: it was a miniature Kahal. The different aims of these communities always found th emselves intimately related with those of the centr al body upon which their existence depended. For if the ruling clique or caste had begun by gr inding down its own race,\" it now saw that, by draf ting them into its organization, it could exploit the gentile s on a far grander scale.\" The number of fraterniti es was increased by the addition of trade unions, every tr ade in which the Jews engaged being represented. To strengthen its control and to advance the interests of the Jews as a whole, it developed and perfected that system of espionage which it still maintains. It sent agents17 to watch over Jewish affairs at police stations, and, when opportunity offered, dis tribute gifts to the employees. Other agents were posted at the d oors of shops, hotels, business houses, lawcourts, and even in the private households of government officials. These trained agents had each a special field to co ver: police, export, import, exchange, government supplies, laws uits, etc. The duty of an agents assigned to lawcourts was t o keep constantly in touch with the proceedings, or with the official, meet the petitioners and, when practicabl e,18 fix the sum they must pay for a favourable jud gment. This concluded, the agent took all necessary steps, and often succeeded in obtaining a decision contra ry to justice. But in every case, the first duty of the a gent was to note all errors and irregularities comm itted by the court, and all scandals brought out in the course o f trial: these, reported and carefully recorded in the files of the Kahal, could be used as weapons against any person involved, who might later wish to act contrary to J ewish interests. Thus the order derived strength from thr ee sources: advance information on trade conditions , bribery, and blackmail. It is quite easy to understand the reasons of the concentration of trade in the hands of the Jews, w herever they have settled in sufficient numbers. For if on the o ne hand the individual Jew is the slave of the Kaha l, his submission on the other hand is rewarded by its sup port in his struggle with non-Jewish competitors. H e can count on the immediate help of his fraternity, and where necessary of the whole organization, and thus is assured of the victory over any single gentile. The teaching in the synagogue incited its followi ng to a thorough exploitation of their gentile neig hbours, care only being taken not to excite hostility to the ext ent of endangering the whole community. This doctri ne, popular from the start, was eventually embodied in its most concrete form in a book of the Talmud, cal led the Shulchan Aruk. A few quotations will suffice to sho w its character:19 \"When a Jew has a gentile in his clutches, anothe r Jew may go to the same gentile, lend him money an d in his turn deceive him, so that the gentile shall be ruin ed. For the property of a gentile (according to our law) belongs to no one, and the first Jew that passes has the fu ll right to seize it.\"20 \"When a Jew makes a deal with a gentile, and anothe r Jew comes up and deceives the gentile no matter i n what manner, whether he give him false measure or overch arge him, then both Jews must share between them th e profits thus sent by Jehovah.\"21 \"Although it is not a direct obligation for a Jew to kill a gentile with whom he lives in peace, yet , in no case, is he allowed to save a gentile's life.\"22 \"It is always a meritorious deed to get hold of a g entile's possessions.\"23 \"Marriages taking place among gentiles have no bind ing strength, i.e. their cohabitation is just as th e coupling of horses, therefore their children do not stand as humanly related to their parents.\"24 Of the spirit which taught that all non-Jews were animals 25 to be stripped of their property for th e benefit of Jewry, and which united the community in a common a im and a common hatred; of the Shulchan Aruk which"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"transmitted this aim and this hatred from generatio n to generation, Jewish leaders of the last fifty y ears have written :26 \" The Shulchan Aruk is not the book that we have chosen for our guide, but the book that has been ma de our guide, whether we would or not, by force of histori cal development: because this book, just as it is i n its present form, with all its most uncouth sections, was the b ook that best suited the spirit of our people, thei r condition and their needs, in those generations in which they accepted it as binding on themselves and their des cendants. If we proclaim that this is not our law, we shall b e proclaiming a falsehood; this is our law, couched in the only form which was possible in the middle ages, just as the Talmud is our law in the form which it took in the last days of the ancient world, just as the Bible is our law in the form which it took while the Jews still lived as a nation on their own land. The three books are but t hree milestones on the road of a single development , that of the spirit of the Jewish nation.\" A Jewish community, in the midst of a gentile pop ulation on which it preyed, depended for its succes s on two things: the absolute subordination of its members a nd the secrecy of its proceedings. The Kahal concea led its activities from the outside world under the guise o f religion. \" The Jews were loyal subjects like the ir neighbours, but to them faith was life, and they we re constantly preoccupied with the observance of th eir ritual \", it told the world. But this was not a sufficient screen. As in all secret organizations there are t raitors and renegades whatever the penalty. The Kahal was oblig ed to shroud itself in mystery and mysticism,27 eve n from its members. The multiplicity of the ritual laws, t he voluminous civil code, the secret instructions o f the fraternities, the continuance of obsolete forms, al l served to create such a confusion that no non-Jew confronted with the documents could distinguish what was funda mental from what was prolix ritual or irrelevant.28 The general scheme of the Kahal, which has been in oper ation since the second century A. D., remains in fo rce to this day. Its essential characteristics may be outl ined as follows: a) The council of elders or geronsia,\"(r) preside d over by à patriarch or exilarch. Its functions w ere purely formal; it represented the Jews in official relati ons with foreign governments, acted as their spokes man when they wished to arouse public sentiment in their fav our, but had no direct responsibility in the secret government whose exist ence it served to conceal. Composed of leading mem bers of the fraternities, it could discuss at secret meetin gs questions of general interest, leaving their pra ctical solution to the fraternities. b) The tribunal or beth-din.30 c) The fraternities. The beth-din decided all lawsuits and differences arising between individual Jews, and between membe rs and the Kahal itself. It existed in all localities wher e there were Jews, catered to their commercial need s, and had final jurisdiction in both civil and religious matt ers. It alone was competent to interpret the spirit ual laws of the Talmud. To illustrate the character of this court, the following paragraphs from the Talmudic code31 m ay be given: \" No Jew may appeal for justice to any court or jud iciary other than the Jewish tribunal. This holds e ven when the laws of the country bearing on the question at issue agree with the Jewish laws, and when the two parties are willing to submit their differences to the form er. Whoever breaks this injunction shall be outlawe d;32 his offence is equivalent to contempt and violation of the law of Moses. \" The beth-din judges cases involving loans, debt s, marriages, legacies, gifts, damages, interest, e tc. \" Although the beth-din has no right to fine a th ief or looter, it may inflict the indoui on him unt il he makes full restitution. It may inflict fines for the infr action of rules as prescribed in the Talmud."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" \" When the beth-din notices that the nation is gi ven to disorders,33 it may, without confirmation by the Jewish authorities, impose fines, death-sentences, and oth er penalties; and in this connection it may waive t he production of testimony to prove the guilt of the a ccused. Where the latter is a person of influence i n the country, the beth-din may use the legal machinery o f the country to punish him. His property may be de clared outside the protection of the law (guefker), and he himself may be done away with as circumstances req uire.\" It would be erroneous to suppose that all suits b etween Jews are tried by the beth-din. In many circ umstances, and especially in thorny cases where the Jewish law is contrary to common sense, because the form and the terms do not agree with justice and conscience, the case is tried not by the judges of the beth-din, c alled dayans, but by a special court composed of persons chosen f or their knowledge of business practice or other sp ecial reasons. The explanation of the mass of lawsuits between Jew s before non-Jewish courts is as follows. For the m ost part, these have to do with drafts presented for payment and drawn on Jews who have incurred penalties at th e hands of the beth-din. The laws of the country are thus u sed to execute the decisions of the Jewish tribunal . The beth- din makes a practice of binding the two parties in a suit submitted for its decision, by having them s ign blanks before the trial. If, afterward, the party who has lost the case refuses to abide by the decision, the blank bearing his signature is converted into a draft and put int o circulation. Turning to the fraternities which are the sinews of the organization, one finds their outward form s trictly innocuous. The rules are nearly all on the same mod el, and fix the annual dues, the place and date for the regular meetings, the duties and obligations of mem bers, and the penalties if disregarded; the latter range from small fines to expulsion from the fraternity. A mem ber expelled from a fraternity found himself cut of f from the community and generally died an outcast. Each frate rnity has a religious or charitable purpose, connec ted with such worthy objects as the following: a) Reading from the sacred texts,34 b) Burial of the dead, c) Ransoming of prisoners, d) Free loans, help for poor girls, aid for the s ick, clothing for the poor, etc. It should be noted that these objects were not en tirely disinterested: the fraternity charged with r eading the texts, distorted them; those who buried the dead re ceived fees, not only for that care, but also for p lots in the Jewish cemetery, for the purification bath prescrib ed for Jewish women, for seats in the synagogue.35 The fraternity for ransoming prisoners was composed of the most influential members of the community; as i ts chief concern was the freeing of delinquent Jews from gen tile courts, it had to bring pressure to bear on po lice and government officials.36 An excellent illustration of a Jewish community i n the twentieth century is found in the account of the organizing of the KehillaW in New York City in 1909 and of its subsequent operation, - published in th e Jewish Communal Register.38 The purpose of the Kehillah is to \" weld Jewish int erests and develop community conscientiousness \"; t he immediate cause of its creation was \" the statement of the police commissioner, General Bingham, that the Jews contributed fifty per cent, of the criminals of New York City.\"39 The first step taken by the constitutive conventi on was the election of an executive committee and a n advisory council of seventy members; the latter is the counc il of elders or gerousia, and its duty is to \" make its voice heard and its opinions felt (sic) in all questions affecting the Jews the world over.\" The next thing of importance is the creation of a b eth-din or court of arbitration, by the board of au thoritative rabbis (vaad harabbonim) already charged with the r egulations of marriage, divorce, circumcision, and ritual bath.40 The beth-din will undertake to settle all d isputes between labour and capital.41"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" Further on, the purpose of the Kehillah is made c learer: it is for the \" coordination of the existin g communal agencies42 to save the synagogue from impending rui n,\" to which end all the material and moral resourc es of the entire community are to be drafted.43 In other words, the hierarchy of fraternities for which Juda ism serves as a cloak and the synagogues as a lodge-room, is e ndeavoring to strengthen its hold on its members, a mong whom there is a tendency towards emancipation. Finally, mention is made of some of the fraternit ies, under the title of benevolent societies: the b urial clubs and the visitors of the sick. It is particularly intere sting to note that these orders assess their benefi ciaries: that is, they operate as life insurance companies.44 So well is the question of ritual meat (kosher) reg ulated by the Kehillah, that \" all the meat slaught ered in New York city and vicinity, whether for Jewish consumpt ion or not, is slaughtered by schochetim under the supervision of authoritative rabbis.'45 Of New York's sixty per ce nt gentile population, none can buy meat not prepar ed according to Jewish ritual. But this paternal inter est of the Kehillah for its members and for the who le gentile population is not entirely unmotivated; for the Reg ister goes on to explain that meat so killed brings \" prices far in excess of those paid for ordinary meat.\" It pays the slaughter-houses to employ schochetim and cont ribute to the welfare of the authoritative rabbis. Thus the Jewish fraternities through the ages hav e kept their typical character of a secret governme nt, disguised under the form of synagogues and schools. The life of the people, too, has changed little fro m generation to generation, and from one country to another: they are always and everywhere the tools of the rul ing clique; to it they pay heavy, indirect taxes, a nd in return receive help in exploiting the land which harbours them. They have a heavy heritage, a Jewish conscientiousness, a hatred of non-Jews, a love of deceiving; all this they cannot easily shake off, and with it the yoke of th e Kahal. 1. Exodus xx. 2.

NEW LINKS BETWEEN COMMUNITIES The Jews, disseminated in all lands and claiming the same rights as other nationals, jealously guard ed the secret of their hierarchy. Prior to the eighteenth century various nations had from time to time grant ed equality of rights to the Jews within their borders,1 but in every case had retracted them. About 1770, Moses Mendelssohn2 and others began pre aching emancipation for all Jews everywhere, as the ultimate goal of the race. This suited the Kahal: i f its members enjoyed the privileges of other natio nals, they would eventually occupy important posts in gentile governments and thus extend its own power and influ ence. The aim was to a large extent realized a few years later. With the French revolution in 1789, the stat us of the Jews in that country was completely changed.3 Not o nly did they obtain the franchise, but, profiting b y the sale of confiscated property, they soon acquired great w ealth. Napoleon remarked in 1806: \" By what miracle did whole provinces of France become heavily mortgaged to the Jews, when there are only sixty thousand of them in the country? \".4 Jews in Austria and Germany as in France and Englan d, obtained about the same time political freedom a nd soon rose to high social and administrative rank in the land of their adoption: the names of Rothschil d,5 Cremieux,6 and Disraeli,7 at once suggest themselve s. But, freed from the restricting influence of the ghetto, the Jews tended to become assimilated not o nly in appearance, but in reality. The yoke of the Kahal s eemed more irksome to those who had acquired wealth which they wished to enjoy undisturbed. As it could add nothing to their success in life, they longed to be rid of its ritual, indirect taxes, demands of personal ser vices, and its threats."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" Jewish leaders, observing this tendency, felt the need of new links between communities, the more so , as the new facilities of communication of the nineteenth c entury- telegraph, railways, steamships-rendered in tercourse between distant bodies much easier. A group of so-c alled \" universal brotherhoods \" was accordingly or ganized in only five years, 1864-1869; they were: a) Brotherhood for the awakening of the slumberin g Jews,8 at St. Petersburg; b) Alliance Israelite Universelle9 at Paris; c) Jewish Emigration Society,10 at London; d) Brotherhood for the enlightenment of the Jews, 11 at St. Petersburg; e) Brotherhood for the repopulation of Palestine. 12 The first of these societies was founded in 1864 : in 1866, it already numbered twelve hundred members among th e wealthiest and most influential Jews, at whose he ad stood: England England Sir Moses Montefiore D. L. Loewe France Russia Pr ussia Prussia Rabbi Albert Cohn M. Strahun M. S. Magnus L. Silber man In 1864 was also founded the Brotherhood for the en lightenment of the Jews (fourth in the above list) with its centre at St. Petersburg; within a year it numbered 227 wealthy Jews, including Dr. Bernstein, the ban kers Ginzberg, Dr. Kalisher, Dr. Schwabacher,13 and men prominent in science. It is therefore not surprisin g that their efforts should have met with sympathy among C hristians. On closer examination, the enlightenment these soci eties sought appears not to be of the kind to raise the people above the racial prejudices fostered in the ghetto. On the contrary, the literature which the society for the awakening of the slumbering Jews published, with th e exception of a book of travels, was strictly a co urse of studies in Talmudic laws,14 and calculated to reviv e the sentiment of a common aim and common hatred f ound in the Shulchan Aruk. The book of travels, Even Saphir, is more stimulati ng: it points out in subtle language the power of t he Kahal and Jewish solidarity. A passage may be quoted as i llustration:15 \" Here in Cairo, Jewish business is exchange, ban king, and usury... The Jews derive great benefit fr om these three operations, thanks to the different foreign c urrencies and the fact that there are two rates of exchange, one fixed by the government, the other by merchants. \" These two rates constantly vary, rising and fal ling, and people who do not deal in money matters a re easily misled. These operations are for the most part in t he hands of the Jews, wise and clever people who, a mong capitalists, rank as high as the wealthiest in Euro pe. They occupy important positions in the pasha's palaces and government offices. In fact the Jews at the present moment enjoy full freedom in every way: their word counts for much, and in trials and lawsuits with non-Jews their side always wins.\" The Kahal resorted to another device to keep its flock within the fold. Whenever opportunity offered , it made a cause celebre of some Jew brought to trial in a g entile court, and then, when the case had become th e common talk of the day, it had him released. In what bette r way could it show its power? The murder of a French missionary by three or four Jews in Damascus in 1840 furnished one such occasio n, and the Dreyfus case in 1896 another."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" It found, too, little difficulty in organizing po groms in Poland and in Russia. The peasants in thes e countries, though of a trusting, friendly nature, could be pro voked by fraud and extortion at length to retaliate . A few Jews were killed, and millions of their race rallied aro und the synagogue. The privileges granted the Jews by the Tsar Alexander II necessitated the pogroms of 1882; and these were followed by a cry of \" anti-semitism,\" w hich, as Herzl used to say, always gathered the sheep into t he fold \"-the time at the conference at Kattowitz i n 1884. Here eastern Jews16 met their more assimilated br ethren from the West, but little was accomplished. The latter, whose views had been modified by long conta ct with Frenchmen, Englishmen, and Germans, failed to understand the violent nationalism of the eastern g hettoes, where the aim was a return to Palestine, t he creation of a Jewish state, and eventual world domination. The eastern group was known as \"The Friends of Zion \"17 and was led by Leo Pinsker and Moses Lilienblum . Pinsker had already set forth his programme in a bo ok, Auto-emancipation (1882), in which he had been inspired by the Rome and Jerusalem (1862) of Moses Hess. Fear of the Russian authorities preventing a full exposition of his aim, he had limited himself to cl aiming Palestine for the Jews as a refuge against p ersecution. One of his colleagues, Asher Ginzberg, was destin ed to carry his work much further. The latter, a fa natic, fanned Jewish national aspirations in the East, and from the date of the founding of the \" Sons of Mos es \" in Odessa in 1889, the movement spread rapidly. Meanti me in Germany and Austria, another active nationali st, Nathan Birnbaum18 of Vienna, organized the Jewish s tudents into a body called the kadimah. Its aim was to establish a Jewish centre in Palestine which should rule the world in the three spheres of politics, e conomics, and religion, through the medium of Jews at the con trol of affairs in every nation. If the western group, on the other hand, did not re spond readily to a nationalist appeal, they yet wer e intrigued by the idea of world domination. International and clannish at heart, in spite of their outward assimi lation, they were to prove by the sequel that they could be won to the eastern point of view: if they rejected it a t first, it was largely because they thought they could obtain all they wanted without the help of their retrograde br ethren. They were, moreover, divided into two camps: the Ro thschilds and the German Jews in Germany and Americ a. The second camp had invested a large part of their capital in German industry, which proved very produ ctive in the years 1884 to 1896; they also shared, or preten ded to share, in the plans of pan-German ambition. But when, in 1896, Germany obtained from the Sultan the concession for the Bagdad railway and reached out over Palestine towards India, some leading western Jews were alarmed and felt the need of uniting Jewr y. The only basis of union was the eastern programme, for the eastern group, being fanatics, would accept no other. To win over the western group to the new aim, an assimilated Jewish writer, Theodore Herzl, was call ed on to paraphrase Leo Pinsker's Auto-emancipation.19 This paraphrase, published in 1896, bore the title, The Jewish State. There was little that was original about the book, but the character and influence of the autho r carried much weight. Theodore Herzl was a typical assimilated Jew.20 B orn in Hungary in 1860, after finishing school in B udapest and studying law at the university of Vienna, he de voted himself to journalism and literature. As repo rter for the Viennese paper, Die neuefreie Presse, he worked in Spain and later in France. While in Paris, he repor ted the Dreyfus case, under the influence of another Jew, t he famous Dr. Blowitz, correspondent of the London Times. It is said that the Dreyfus case \" made a Jew of Herzl.\" He did not know Hebrew, and had never been taught the fanatical books of the Talmud, such as the Shuk han Aruk and the Abodah Zarah. He was opposed to vi olent methods, and in one of his novels, Altneuland, has left a picture of a civilized Jewish state, pattern ed on those of Western Europe. In any case, after the publication of The Jewish State, the Friends of Zion in Odessa, and the body of students (Kadimah) under Nathan Birnbaum, adopted Herzl. The first Zionist congress was called at Basle the fol lowing year (1897). Herzl was elected president, a positio n which he held till his death (1904). At the congress, as the eastern group was the more numerous, the name \" Zionism\", coined by Nathan Birnbaum in 1886, was adopted, and its aim declared essentially democratic. But the western group was not"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"wholly won. Some of them, mostly from England and F rance, responded coldly to Herzl's appeal, fearing to compromise the rights and positions already acquire d in those countries. The desired union could not y et be effected, and the two groups rallied around their r espective leaders, Herzl and Ginzberg. Herzl nevertheless remained faithful to the task he had undertaken.21 He entered into negotiations w ith the rulers of several nations to obtain some suitable h ome for the Jews. He failed to get Palestine from t he Sultan, and later, the El Arish peninsula from the Khedive of Egypt; but he received, and virtually accepted, the offer of Uganda from Great Britain. In 1903, he laid this pr oposal before the sixth Zionist congress: it was th rown out by the Zionists who would have no land but Palestin e. Herzl died the following year, and with him the leadership of the moderate party was soon to pass i nto the hands of the violent nationalists.22 * * * An article in the Judisk Tidskrift (No. 6, Aug.-S ept., 1929), written by Dr. Ehrenpreis, Chief Rabbi of Sweden, contained, according to the Swedish paper Nationen, the following passage:- \" I participated with Herzl in the first Zionist Congress which was held in Basle in 1897. Herzl was the most prominent figure at that first Jewish World Congres s. He worked to achieve an object which had been fi xed beforehand. Just as Isaiah foresaw, decades before the event occurred, the victorious power of Cyrus b efore anyone else, so did Herzl foresee twenty years, bef ore we experienced them, the revolutions brought ab out by the Great War, and he prepared us for that which wa s going to happen. He foresaw the splitting up of T urkey, and he foresaw that England would obtain control ov er Palestine. \" We may expect important development s in the world.\" These were the words spoken by Herzl tw enty years before the Great War. He added that the events would offer the Jewish people fresh opportunities.\" 1.

GINZBERG THE INTERPRETER OF JEWISH AIMS If Herzl strove to modify and conciliate Jewish a mbition with its gentile surroundings, it was the t ask of Ginzberg to give it a new form and the strength of mass fanaticism. Asher Ginzberg1 was born at Skvira, in the provin ce of Kiev, in 1856, of well-to-do parents belongin g to the Jewish sect of Hassidim. He received a strictly rab binical education and, at seventeen, married the gr and- daughter of a prominent rabbi, Menachem Mendel. Fiv e years later (1878), he moved to Odessa, where he continued his studies, with special attention to th e works of Spinoza, Moses Mendelssohn, and Nietzsch e. Not long after,2 he visited Berlin, Breslau, and Vienna where he met Charles Netter, a French Jew and one of the founders of the Alliance Israelite Universelle, who introduced him into that body. It was thus that, in 1884, on his return to Odessa, Ginzberg joined the Friends of Zion3 under Leo Pin sker and Moses Lilienblum, and attended the conference at Ka tto-witz. His shrewd, restless mind and command of Hebrew soon raised him to prominence: a letter in H ebrew to the scientist S. Finn on his seventieth bi rthday, attracted the notice of Alexander Zederbaum. Zederb aum was the editor of the Hebrew paper Ha-melitz, a nd immediately invited Ginzberg to contribute. Although he had constantly criticized the methods o f the Friends of Zidh privately, he hesitated to do so in print; but finally overcoming his scruples, he sent in a radical article, entitled Not the Way,4 which appeared the same year (1889). In it, Ginzberg attacked Pins ker's plan of sending Russian Jews to Palestine for the material advantages they might derive.5 All attempt s to improve the condition of Russian ghettoes were futile, he insisted; the Jews must first become consciously , aggressively national. The article with its direc t appeal to fanaticism was read by Jews all over Europe; other articles by the same pen followed. He now broke with the Friends of Zion, and with h im went a group of young men who had come to share his advanced views. These men he formed (1889) into a s ecret organization called the Sons of Moses.6 It me t in his house in Yamskaya Street, Odessa, and numbered amon g its first members, Ben Avigdor, Zalman Epstein, Louis Epstein, and Jacob Eisenstaat. It was to this small group that Ginzberg read what is to-day know n as \" the protocols \",7 in which the national aim is set fort h in such direct, forceful language, -in strange co ntrast to the confused, pedantic style of the Talmud."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" The opening words give the tone of the whole. \" Let us put aside phraseology and discuss the inne r meaning of every thought: by comparison and deduc tion let us illuminate the situation. In this way I will des cribe our system, both from our own point of view a nd that of the goyim.s \" It must be remembered that people with base insti ncts,\" he continues, \" are more numerous than those with noble ones; therefore, the best results in governin g are achieved through violence and intimidation, a nd not through academic discussion. Every man seeks power; every one would like to become a dictator if he po ssibly could; and rare indeed are those who would not sacr ifice the common good in order to attain personal advantage.\" The argument is then developed with conciseness a nd lucidity: all objections are anticipated and met in a few terse phrases. No rhetorical effect is sought; expr ession is natural and vivid: e.g. of the mob at the time of a revolution,9 the author says: \" These beasts fall asleep when they have drunk e nough blood; it is then easy to shackle them.\" The Protocols are sometimes criticized as contain ing nothing that had not been said previously by philosophers or statesmen; but even if that were tr ue, it would detract little from their interest. Fo r their importance does not lie in the aim, world dominatio n, nor in the theory by which it is attained, explo itation of man's baser instincts, but in the extraordinary ast uteness with which the practical application of the plan has been suited to existing conditions. The very fact that the language is forceful and i ncisive, that all the allusions are striking, and t he thesis so to speak irrefutable, is to some an obstacle to belief : nor is this surprising. If, at Waterloo, Napoleon had had a battalion of tanks and a few batteries of modern eight-inch guns , the forces of England and Prussia would have been drive n from the field: with the improved methods of warf are of the last century at his command, he could have defi ed the armies of the world in 1814. For the past century the Jews have been making rapi d progress in the theory and practice of politics, while the rest of the world thought them merely emerging from the ghetto; and, as it cannot understand the intri cate new machinery of government they have devised and set u p, it says, \" Such a thing is impossible.\" Yet, lik e a great engine of war, the organization of the Kahal advanc es on the course determined, crashing all resistanc e. That course is succinctly stated in the twenty-fo ur protocols of Ginzberg: they are an epitome of Je wish thought from Rabbi Akiba10 and Maimonides11 down to Marx12 and Engels. At the same time the reader is reminded constantly of some familiar event of recen t years which bears out the thesis. For example the passage:13 \" To show that all the gentile governmen ts of Europe are enslaved by us, we will manifest o ur power by subjecting one of them to a reign of terro r, violence and crime.\" Can anyone, recalling the Russian revolution of 1 918, read this, knowing it was written before 1897, 14 and not be impressed by the correspondence between the prophecy and its fulfilment two decades later? But Ginzberg was no visionary: he knew of what he wrote, and the course of the revolutionary movemen t already on foot in Russia had been too carefully ca lculated to leave any doubt as to its eventual succ ess. The Second International was formed in 1889, and the theories of Marx and Engels adopted. The labour movement was no longer represented by a small group of workingmen led by theorists, but by powerful national organizations of workers. Therefore the ai m of the Second International to secure the transfe r of power to the proletariat was to be pursued under conditio ns more favourable than those which had prevailed a t the time of the First International. The dominant indus trial and financial interests served to further the objectives of the socialists through a callous disregard for labo ur.15"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" In 1900, on Lenin's return from exile, appeared t he first number of the revolutionary paper Iskra (\" The Spark \") edited in London by Trotski (Braunstein) a Jew, and supported by another Jew, Blumenfeld.16 Organiz ations directed by Iskra spread throughout Russia: it was the source from which the ideas of local leaders we re derived. In March 1903, there emerged at its first meeting in Minsk, a completely formed Russian commu nist party; it represented six organizations and was hea ded by nine men, of whom at least five were of Jewi sh descent.17 It was known as the \" Russian social dem ocratic party \" (until 1918), and its methods as we ll as its motto \" Proletarians of all countries, unite \", wer e those of Marx and Engels. A second congress of th e party met at Brussels and then at London, in July and Aug ust, of the same year. Here the doctrine that \" the necessary condition of the social revolution is the dictators hip of the proletariat \", was expressed for the fir st time.18 Then came the split between bolsheviks and menshevi ks, and the movement faced its first real test in 1 905. Weakened by defeat in the war with Japan, the Tsari st government could not forestall strikes and disor ders. The shooting down of workmen who had assembled before t he winter palace encouraged the bolsheviks to attem pt an armed uprising. A congress of the party met in L ondon on April 25, 1905, and formulated the program me which was to be put in practice twelve years later. 19 The outbreak in Russia was immediately hailed by a Zionist paper as the work of Jews. \" The revolution in Russia is a Jewish revolution , a crisis in Jewish history. It is a Jewish revolu tion because Russia is the home of about half the Jews of the wo rld, and an overturning of its despotic government must have a very important influence on the destinies of the millions living there and on the many thousand s who have recently emigrated to other countries. But the revolution in Russia is a Jewish revolution also b ecause Jews are the most active revolutionists in the Tsar 's empire \".20 Unsupported by the peasants and the army, the revol ts of 1905 failed. A period of reaction set in, bri nging with it the arrest and exile of many of the revolutionar y leaders. From that time, in fact, plans for a rev olution in Russia had to be entirely directed from abroad. How the old leaders usually managed to escape their pr ison sentences;21 how they secured funds to travel about and participate in congresses in Stockholm, Paris, Prague, Berne and other cities; and how they managed to kee p alive a central organization is not explained in published documents; but the connection between these subvers ive activities and Zionism will become clearer furt her on.22 Meantime the protocols, secretly circulated in Hebr ew among the Sons of Moses, had helped the expansio n of that order throughout Russia and Poland and contrib uted to its victory at the Basle congress in 1897,2 3 when Zionism became an official movement. But when Ginzberg saw that Herzl's conception of Zionism was \" an economic one first and foremost \", 24 excluding as it seemed the spirit of Jewish nationa lism, he gathered his old adherents into a new secr et order, the Sons of Zipn (B'nai Zion) to propagate the true faith. While affecting himself to keep outside of the official movement, he edited a Hebrew paper, Hashiloah (\" Th e Way \"), thanks to financial aid from a Moscow tea merchant, a Jew, Kalonymous Wissotzkii, and became head of a great Hebrew publishing firm called Ahias af. With these powerful organs, he could attack Herzl w ith impunity. One of the latter's friends complains :25 \" Ahad-ha-am (Ginzberg) reproaches Herzl with wan ting to imitate Europe. He (Ginzberg) cannot admit that we should borrow from Europe its academies, operas, white gloves. The only thing he would transfer fro m Europe into Altneuland (i.e. Palestine) would be th e principles of the inquisition, the way of acting of the anti- semites, the restrictions of the Rumanian laws... H e understands freedom as practised in the ghetto, o nly in his conception the parts are reversed: persecutions are to continue, but this time, of the gentiles by the Jews... He is one of the worst enemies of Zionism, and it is our duty to protest against its name being used by him. His conception is the exact opposite of Zionism, and he would mislead us by speaking (slightingly) of ' po litical' Zionism, in contrast to ' this secret Zionism>26 wh ich is his very own.\" Fourteen years of labour at last began to show fr uit. In 1911, Ginzberg's representatives, Chaim Wei zmann and others, scored a victory at the tenth Zionist C ongress. Two years later (1913), \" when he visited the congress for the second time,\" writes a disciple,27 \" he was happy. He could see how some of his ideas , some of the truths that he had fought so bitterly to adv ance, were already working within. He was happy, as a"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"practical philosopher should feel when he realizes that his life has not been in vain, that he has bee n one link in the long chain that pulls Israel to a glorious futu re, that he has served Israel, and, through Israel, mankind \". From this point, Zionism, as Ginzberg understood it, became a reality which his disciples28 have sin ce carried from victory to victory under the eye of the master . He himself remained aloof, at least from public v iew, until his death in 1927 in a Judaized Palestine. 1.

ZIONISTS AND ANTI-ZIONISTS DURING WORLD WAR I It has frequently been observed that Europe, whet her considered as a whole or as so many separate co untries, lost rather than benefited by the world war: the vi ctorious allies, with a huge burden of debt, came o ff hardly better than the vanquished. But to Zionism, the war brought untold wealth and the complete realization of an immediate aim. \" The present war \", wrote Sokolov at the time,1 \" has not affected the unity of the Zionist organiz ation. As the latter was established on the federal principle, it was found possible to continue the essential work of the movement by utilizing the separate organizations of the different countries. The work of propaganda an d the collection of funds... actually made great progress .\" It may therefore be interesting to trace its activi ties in four capitals, Berlin, Petrograd, London an d New York, during this period. At the outbreak of the war, Zionism had its headq uarters in Berlin.2 There also were the headquarter s of the moderate party, represented by the society, Hilfsve rein der deutschen Juden. This society had built in the Holy Land a number of schools, seminaries, and other ins titutions, superior to those of the Alliance Israel ite Universelle and the Zionists. On this account, Germ any had promised the society control over Palestine , as soon as she had completed the Berlin-Bagdad railway . But as such an eventuality would not have suited Zionist plans, they looked to a different solution.3 \"The i nner actions committee,\" we learn,1 \"which met regu larly in Berlin and transacted all international business be tween congresses, was composed of members dispersed in various countries. Dr. Schmaryar Levin had come to America to attend the Zionist Convention in June (1 914). His presence in America during the war was valuable both for American Zionism and the international ca use. Warburg and Hantke, two Gentfan members, were in Be rlin where they remained practically throughout the war; Jacobson, another German member, was then in C onstantinople.\" The strength of this Zionist international chain of communication did not escape the notice of the G erman government, which sought its support in addition to that of the Hilfsverein. In June 1915, an appeal w as sent out from Berlin to all Zionists \"asking for sympathy wi th Germany\".* The Zionists, however, were too shrew d to commit themselves while the issue of the war was st ill doubtful; at the same time, they wished to keep Germany's confidence, which they subsequently explo ited in connection with Russia. They therefore refu sed the request with the ironical explanation that \"the Zionist movement could not be involved in world po litics\". The following year, they secretly transferred the ir support from the central powers to the allies, a nd their headquarters from Berlin to London.6 From then on, their influence was felt more and more in political circles in Europe and America. In particular the Zionist Tr ansfer Department, as it was called, was in a posit ion to transmit funds and information to subversive elemen ts in enemy countries. In this connection, Jacobson , seeing that \"Constantinople could no longer be the centre of Zionist politics, left for Copenhagen, where, in a neutral"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"country, he could be of practical use to the Zionis ts by transmitting information and funds. There he established a Zionist bureau. Chlenov, one of the Russian membe rs, went back and forth between Russia and Denmark, and eventually went to England. Another Russian member, Nahum Sokolov, moved about freely in the allied countries \".7 Rudolf Steiner, occult adviser to the Kaiser, passed freely between Germany and England during the whole period of hostilities, in spite of police regulations. \" By its dependable financial methods , it established what was practically a Zionist credit t hroughout the world. This had no small share in bri nging about that attitude on the part of the allied gover nments which later resulted in their recognition of the Zionist organization as the official representative of the Jewish people.\"8 The chief task which engaged the Zionists at this time (1916) was the revolutionary movement in Russ ia. The body of professional revolutionaries which had prep ared and directed the outbreak of 1905, had continu ed its subversive work through congresses held in the diff erent capitals of Europe with undiminished zeal.9 L enin had become the acknowledged leader of the bolsheviks: w ith him on the central committee (elected in 1912) and later prominent among those who took over the contr ol of Russia were: Zinoviev (Jew), Ordzhonikidze (Georgian), Schwarzmann (Jew), Spandarian (Armenian ), and later Stalin (Georgian), and Belostolskii (J ew).io Outside of it, Trotski (Jew) was active both in New York and London. Since 1914, these and other professional agitator s had been carrying on, principally in Switzerland, a campaign against the war, which they hoped to turn into a class struggle.11 Under wartime conditions, however, a well organized revolutionary movement wa s difficult to effect. In 1905 the party in Russia had counted three million adherents, in 1906 one millio n, in 1907 three-quarters of a million, in 1908 onl y 174,000, and in 1910 just 46,000. In April 1917, a congress of the party claimed to represent 76,000 organized workers. It would be idle to fancy that this minute body was in any sense representative of the 'proletariat', or that it could become a welcome ruler, seven months later, o ver millions of people.12 But the Zionist task was facilitated by a clever exploitation of the German general staff in the beginning of 1917. The latter, in order to render Russia impotent and thus free troops for use on the western front, staked more on the use of su bversives and thus played the Zionist game. \" Some man in Ger many \", writes General von Hoffmann, then chief of the German staff on the Russian front, 13 \" who had con nections with the Russian revolutionaries exiled in Switzerland, came upon the idea of employing some o f them in order to hasten the undermining and poiso ning of the morale of the Russian army. He applied to th e deputy Erzberger and the deputy of the foreign of fice. And thus it came about that Lenin was conveyed through Germany to Petersburg in the manner that afterward transpired \". On May 10, 1917, shortly after his ar rival in Russia from the sealed German railway car, Lenin spoke at the Petrograd conference of his party agai nst the provisional government.14 He wanted to dest roy at the roots every reminder of Russia's Slavic past. H e feared that a \" bourgeois government would make t he Soviets unnecessary \",15 How, in the course of the ten months following, t he bolsheviks replaced the provisional government, and, by preventing the constituent assembly from meeting, r emained the absolute masters of Russia; how, faithf ul to their Zionist patrons, they manifested the strength of Zionism by subjecting the Tsar's empire to a \" reign of terror, violence, and crime \",16 is common knowledg e and cannot be treated here. Suffice it to say tha t they justified the judgment of the Austrian foreign mini ster, Count Czernin, who wrote (Nov. 17, 1917):\" \" This Russian bolshevism is a peril to Europe, and if we had the power, beside securing a tolerable p eace for ourselves, to force other countries into a state of law and order, then it would be better to have not hing to do with such people as these, but to march on Petersbu rg and arrange matters there. Their leaders are alm ost all of them Jews, with altogether fantastic ideas, and I d o not envy the country that is governed by them. Th e way they begin is this: everything in the least reminis cent of work, wealth, and culture, must be destroye d, and the bourgeoisie exterminated. Freedom and equality seem no longer to have any place on their programme: on ly a bestial suppression of all but the proletariat itse lf.\"1\" Zionism gained immeasurably by this success in bo th money and influence. Crown jewels and possession s, millions of paper rubles put into circulation, art treasures in museums, churches, and private houses, all have been turned to its account. Besides, the dramatic t riumph of the ruthless methods advocated by Ginzber g did much to overawe the opposition to Zionism among the Jews. As a leading Zionist said:19"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" \" The downfall of the tsardom of Russia was undou btedly one of the greatest events in the world's hi story. Russia entered into a period of revolution which se emed to bring with it all the blessings of right an d liberty. The restrictions affecting nationalities and creeds were removed. But far from destroying Zionism, the new liberty gave it an immense stimulus.\" (The blessing s mentioned, it appears, are reserved exclusively f or Zionists.) While these events were taking place in Petrograd , Zionists in London were not idle. \" London from t he beginning was the financial centre of the Zionist o rganization \";20 for, while the rival banking firm of Bleichroeder Mendelssohn in Berlin continued their support of the moderates, Rothschild had been won t o the new movement. Nahum Sokolov had, during his frequen t visits as member of the inner actions committee, been impressed with the opportunities offered for establ ishing a centre there:21 since 1914, he and Chaim W eizmann had been actively working to bring its political pr oblems to the fore in England. To this end, Weizman n had entered into intimate \" relations with the house of Rothschild and done much to make this family more closely acquainted with Zionism.\"22 Among the non-Jews, an invaluable friend was foun d in Sir Mark Sykes. How he was won to the cause is not clear:23 before the war he disliked it as \" bad cos mopolitanism and finance,\" but, in the middle of th e war, came to the decision which he announced in Hull, th at \" It would mean that every Jew throughout the wo rld would be made more valuable to the state which he h ad chosen for himself.\"24 However that may be, from the beginning of 1917, Sykes devoted himself heart and soul to the movement, and his house at No. 9 Buckin gham Gate, \" equipped with all such materials as corresp ondence files and telegraphic communications, becam e a Zionist centre.\"25 Collaborating with Sykes was ano ther gentile, Georges Picot. The first official meeting of what was known as t he \" Political Committee \" took place on February 7 , 1917, at the house of Dr. Moses Gaster. There were present ( besides Gaster) Lord Rothschild, James de Rothschil d, Sir Mark Sykes, Sir Herbert Samuel, Herbert Bentwich, H arry Sacker, Joseph Cowen, Chaim Weizmann, and Nahum Sokolov.26 The Zionist programme to serve as a basis for off icial negotiations, covering the future mandates of Palestine, Armenia, Mesopotamia, and a kingdom of the Hedjaz, was discussed in detail.27 On the following day (Fe b. 8) there was a second, smaller conference, with George s Picot, at Sykes' house: the result was a plan kno wn as the Sykes-Picot agreement, which was then put into exec ution. Sokolov left for Paris to negotiate with the French government. On March 22, 1917, he was received at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he \" outlined th e principles of the Zionist programme. He received the assurance that the French government regarded the p rogramme very favorably and was authorized to infor m the Zionist organizations of Russia and America of this result by telegraph.\"28 Sykes left for Rome, and t hence for Port Said and Cairo; then to Jeddah to negotiate wi th King Hussein, returning on June 14 to London, wh ere he was occupied until November 1917, arranging the pre liminaries for the Balfour declaration.29 One must not suppose that this was all done on th e sole initiative of the London group; on the contr ary,\" every idea born in London was tested by the Zionist organ ization in America, and every suggestion from Ameri ca received the most careful attention in London.\"çî The details of the diplomatic conversations in Lo ndon which led to the declaration have not yet been made public; but, of the British cabinet besides Sir Her bert Samuel, Lloyd George, if not already a Zionist , was easily won to the cause;31 while Sir Arthur Balfour and ot her members who had the good of the nation at heart , were yet inclined to view it favourably from the followi ng considerations: a) The financial support of the Rothschilds, at a time when the country had to float loan after loan , would be lost, if the Zionist request were refused. b) If granted, it would ensure Jewish co-o peration throughout the empire and in other countri es, both during the war and in the future."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" c) The Palestine mandate, coupled with that of Me sopo tamia, was the gateway to India: by calling it \" a national home for the Jews\", England would lull Fr ench and Italian jealousy. As against these, the mandate constituted a breac h of England's promise made to the Arabs in 1915 in return for their support in fighting Turkey. To offset thi s objection, the Zionists generously proposed to gi ve the Arabs what they already owned, but with the new title of \" Kingdom of the Hedjaz \". Moreover the cabinet could count on a number of Zio nist votes in the House, notably Sir Alfred Mond (t he late Lord Melchett)32 and Sir Philip Sassoon among the C onservatives, and more among Lloyd George's followi ng. The shrewder members of the cabinet realized that t hey would eventually have to reckon with the Britis h taxpayer, and the commercial advantages33 of Palest ine lost nothing in Zionist exposition. But the gre at plea was that the English and the Jews, the two great tr ading races of the world, should unite forces and t ake over the trade routes between Europe and Asia.34 Although the Zionists had made all preliminary ar rangements with the allied governments and the cabi net as a whole was desirous of complying with every point, y et some over-scrupulous member,35 with (the Zionist s thought) undue regard for the actual inhabitants of Palestine, altered the text Weizmann's committee h ad prepared.36 Instead of the words, \" The reconstitut ion of Palestine as the national home of the Jewish people \", at the last minute were substituted the words, \" Th e establishment of a national home in Palestine \". \" It can scarcely be necessary to explain at length ,\" wrote Asher Ginzberg indignantly three years lat er,37 \" the difference between the two versions. Had the Britis h government accepted the version suggested to it, its promise might have been interpreted as meaning that Palestine, inhabited as it now is, was restored to the Jewish people on the ground of its historic right; that the Jewish people was to rebuild its waste pla ces and was destined to rule over it and manage all its affairs in its own way, without regard to the consent or n on-consent of its present inhabitants. For this rebuilding (it mi ght have been understood) is only a renewal of the ancient right of the Jews, which overrides the right of the prese nt inhabitants who have wrongly established their n ational home on a land not their own.\" It does not seem, however, that Ginzberg advocate d the Jews withdrawing from the rich lands of Europ e and America, on the ground that they have there \" wrong ly established their national home on a land not th eir own.\" The Balfour declaration was issued on November 2, 1917, and transmitted to Lord Rothschild on behalf of the Zionist federation.38 Its endorsement by the other allies was a small matter between Nahum Sokolov and the two representatives, Pichon for France, Imperial! f or Italy. From the debates in the French senate, Ap ril 5, 6, 1921, following the interpellation of Senator Domin ique Delahaye, it subsequently appeared that neithe r the Chamber of Deputies nor the Senate had ever had the question of ratification put to them. To those active in Zionist circles, the declarati on was no surprise: among the leaders it had been e xpected for many months. It was, however, made the occasion for public rejoicing in the Jewish and Jew-controlled gentile press,39 and mass meetings were held in London and addressed by Sir Mark Sykes,40 Sir Herbert Samuel,4 1 and others prominent in politics. But the Jewish mo derates, headed by Claude G. Montefiore and David L . Alexander, raised a dissentient voice: they feared, as at the Basle congress,42 that the new nationali sm would injure their social rights as Englishmen. Even more they disliked being eclipsed by Ginzberg's satelli tes from the ghetto. They made, therefore, common cause with the anti-Zionists in America; and when anti-Zionis m died out there, it disappeared in England. Meantime, in New York, changes were taking place of much importance to Jewry. When the Kehillah was organized in 1909,43 the control rested with a grou p of German Jews, including Jacob Schiff, president of Kuhn, Loeb & Co, a branch of the Bleichroeder Mende lssohn bank,44 Isidor Strauss, Julius Sachs, David Philipson, who, through their affiliations in Germa ny, were anti-Zionists and favoured the internation al Jewish policy. They maintained a ministry for foreign affa irs, at first composed of appointees of the union o f American-Hebrew congregations. The latter, through its delegates, established an ambassadorship at Washington to act for the Jewish people on immigrat ion and other political matters. Subsequently the u nion was given the support of the B'nai B'rith,45 whose leading member had been appointed ambassador. \" For thirty years \", wrote an American Zionist,46 \" our ambassa dor at Washington was the Hon. Simon Wolf. He infor med"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"the United States government what the Jews of this country wanted and what they were opposed to. In Si mon Wolf's opinion, the Jews were not a nationality but a religious sect; they insisted upon being regarde d solely as Americans. Mr. Wolf spoke in the name of assimilati on on behalf of the Jews in America.\" Later another more powerful group of Jews organiz ed under the name of the American Jewish committee and took over the ministry of foreign affairs.47 During the Wilson administration certain Jews appointed t o the highest posts exerted so much influence on the chie f executive and members of congress as almost to co ntrol the national policy: in particular the Zionist Loui s Brandeis of the supreme court, Bernard Baruch, ch airman of the war industries board,48 Felix and Paul Warburg of the federal reserve, Julius Klein of the departm ent of commerce, and Eugene F. Meyer.49 Under Zionist influence, the Yiddish newspapers, edited by radicals, started a campaign against the American Jewish committee on the grounds that it was autocra tic, and demanded an American Jewish congress, elec ted by and responsible to the people. \" As Zionism move d forward,\" continues the article quoted above, \" t he opposition had to recede. When the congress is not in session, the affairs of the Jewish nation are re gulated [1917] by the inner actions committee50 and the gre ater actions committee, two executive bodies the me mbers of which are elected by the Zionist congress.\" Thus Zionism, by clever propaganda, gained the ma sses. But it did not neglect to win over certain le aders of American Jewry, by what means may be guessed. Jacob Schiff had long been interested in the revolutiona ry movement in Russia and had transferred large sums t o support it through his bank, as far back as 1905. The success therefore of the revolution in 1917, engine ered by the Zionists, could not fail to change his views. \" I believe, \" he wrote Rabbi Philipson in 1918,51 \" I have heretofore explained to you the reasons which, soon after the outbreak of the Russian revolution, have induced me to change my former attitude towards the Zionist movement, and I have since become more and more con vinced that it was in the best interests of our peo ple that I did this.\" Schiff had evidently shared the \" blessings \"52 of the Russian revolution and quite properly gave cred it where it was due. The letter continues. \" There can be no do ubt that the success of these [Zionist] endeavours will have the most healthy and refreshing effect upon entire Isra el, wherever in the world its members may be locate d, and the proposition you bring forward, to oppose these efforts, is, in my opinion, nothing less than prepo sterous.\" When the opposition to Zionism came to a head in America, it found all the leading Jews on whose sup port it had counted either only nominally anti-Zionist, or frankly favourable. Rabbi David Philipson and Max S enior, who with others were attempting to call a conferenc e to combat it in the autumn of 1918, met with litt le encouragement in New York. Oscar S. Strauss wrote:5 3 \" I regard the holding of a conference to counter act the activities of Zionists as distinctly unwise and har mful. I do hope that your committee will recall its proposed action. I make this suggestion, yea request, not as a Zionist, as I am not affiliated with that organi zation, but as an American and as a lover of our people.\" An exchange of letters between Max Senior and Lou is Marshall54 is more instructive. \" The reasons,\" wrote the latter, \" which I then urged [in declining Rabb i Philip-son's invitation] have been emphasized by the rapid march of events. The allied armies have now swept t he Turks and the Germans out of Palestine. It is si gnificant that Jewish units constitute a part of the victorio us army. \" President Wilson expressed his personal views i n support of the principles laid down in the Balfou r declaration. France, Italy, and Greece have formall y adopted it: there is therefore an unanimity of se ntiment on the part of the allied powers. \" The American Jewish committee, although its me mbers are in the main non-Zionists, recognised the political importance of the declaration as a factor in the effort to defeat the central powers. Major Lionel de Rothschild, president of the league for British Jew s, informs me that that organization is in agreemen t with the American Jewish committee.\"55"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" But, if Marshall pretended that the Jews should a ccept Zionism in order to comply with the \" unanimo us sentiment of the allied powers \" who had determined to build a home for the Jews in Palestine, he was not blind to the real reason for Zionism. His letter continue s: \" The Balfour declaration with its acceptance by the powers, is an act of the highest diplomacy. It means both more and less than appears on the surface. Zionism is but an incident of a far-reaching plan: it is me rely a convenient peg on which to hang a powerful weapon.\" 56 The letter ends with a threat to non-Zionists: \" All the protests they may make would be futile. It would su bject them individually to hateful and concrete exa mples of a most impressive nature. Even if I were disposed t o combat Zionism, I would shrink from the possibili ties which might result \". Senior's reply is direct and fearless:57 \" I repudiate any connection on national, religio us, racial, or cultural grounds, with a ' national home-land for the Jews in Palestine'. We have seen how demoralizi ng a divided allegiance was to the Germans in this country. I do not pretend to know the inside political histo ry and intricacies of policy of which you hint... I am not to be intimidated into silence by either of the threats y ou mention... I regard the real danger to the Jew t o lie in silent acquiescence to the Zionist claims. You recognize t hat the non-Zionists did not precipitate the ruptur e. The break was bound to come, but the recent Tammany-lik e circular to congressmen was certainly the breakin g point... I refuse to accept the Zionist coup d'etat as an accomplished and sacred fact... Finally, you and I and the Zionists know that Palestine offers no solution for the Jewish question in Russia, Galicia, and Rumani a. Six million Jews in these lands cannot be removed to Pa lestine. I certainly have no objection to Jews movi ng to Palestine, or Persia, or Patagonia, if they can sec ure freedom in those lands. But emigration is only a palliative. The Jewish question must ultimately be worked out i n Russia, Galicia, and Rumania.\" Senior's fear that the \" real danger to the Jews (in America) lay in silent acquiescence to Zionist claims\" has proved justified. The tasks since set by the Zionis ts for American Jewry have been heavier by far than those set by the Egyptians.58 But the Zionists cleverly lulle d any lurking suspicions in the minds of all but a very few (including Senior) by a fanatical appeal to nationa lism and a romantic picture of the \" land overflowi ng with milk and honey \". Anti-Zionism disappeared. Then came the peace conference; the formation of the League of Nations at Geneva;59 and the British mandate for the holy land, over which the Jews exer cised complete control in practice, leaving to the English taxpayer the expense of civil administration.60 Thus Zionism gained its ends: in Berlin and Petro grad by subversive activities, in London and New Yo rk mainly by diplomacy. Without the influence of Zioni sm in America during the Wilson administration, and American money, the Balfour declaration, obtained b y the efforts of Weizmann and Sokolov, would have remained a dead letter. 1.

TEN YEARS OF ZIONISM Sionism is a convenient peg on which to hang a po werful weapon,\" wrote Louis Marshall,1 meaning that the project of a national home in Palestine would serve as an excuse for building up a powerful, internati onal organization to supplant eventually the present nat ional governments. From whatever angle one considers it, the project is an experiment on a vast scale. Decades have pas sed since the experiment was begun, and it is time to ask: a) Is the experiment a success or a failure ? b) Have the promoters of the experiment proved th at they have throughout always acted in good faith, or not? To answer these questions properly would require a careful study of onditions, not only in Palestine , but in the world at large: such a study is beyond the present scope. It is, however, possible to examine certain points which bear directly on the above, namely: 1. Did the promoters of the national home for the Jews use undue political influence on the Europea n powers, England in particular, in obtaining control of Pale stine? 2. Did the promoters (the Zionist organization) b enefit by the realization of the project? 3. Was their administration of funds scrupulous a nd competent ? 4. Have the inhabitants of Palestine benefited by the mandate; has Great Britain benefited by it; an d have the Jews as a whole benefited by it ? In connection with the first point, the origin of the Sykes-Picot agreement and of the Balfour decla ration has already been traced.2 Both of these were in direct violation of the agreement made by the British gove rnment in"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"1915 through Sir Henry MacMahon with the Sherif of Mecca, Hussein. Then the Sherif had agreed to aid t he British cause against the Turks, in return for a pr omise that Great Britain would recognize and suppor t the independence of the Arabs, south of the prospective Turkish boundary. The British government has withh eld from publication part of the official correspondenc e containing this agreement, in spite of requests m ade in the House of Lords and the House of Commons.3 It is aff irmed by a writer to whom Hussein showed Sir Henry' s letters that, when the Arab leader flatly refused t o accept territorial reservations proposed by the B ritish authorities, the latter finally conceded the point and in January 1917 definitely undertook to support Arab claims in the whole territory south of the Turkish boundary, except in the protectorate of Aden and in the region of Basra in southern Iraq. In March 1916, Sir Henry wrote again to the Sherif confirming the agreement .4 But, as Chaim Weizmann once said,5 in this connec tion: \" Negotiating with a government is easy: one must demand things from a government; a government does not do things by itself; you must know what to dema nd, how to demand, and when to demand. If you know that , you know all the secret: that is essential for Zi onists to understand.\" The Balfour declaration was endorsed in February, 1918, by the French government; in May, by the Ita lian government through its ambassador in London; in Aug ust, 1918, by a published letter from President Wil son; and, later, by a joint resolution of the United Sta tes Congress in its 1922 session.6 To allay Arab fears, just before the armistice (Nov . 7, 1918), the British and French governments issu ed a joint declaration which was posted throughout Syria and P alestine and ran :7 \" The end aimed at by France an d England in the East is the complete and final enfra nchisement of the peoples so long oppressed by the Turks, and the establishment of national governments and a dministrations, drawing their authority from the in itiative and free choice of the native populations. \"To fulfil these purposes, France and Great Brita in have agreed to encourage and help the establishm ent of native governments and administrations in Syria and Mesopotamia, which have been freed by the allies, and in the territories whose liberation they are now pursu ing, and to recognize these as soon as they are eff ectively established. Far from wishing to impose upon the po pulations of these regions any particular instituti ons, the allies have no other desire than to assure, by thei r support and by an effective assistance, the norma l functioning of the governments and administrations which the po pulations have freely given themselves. To assure a n impartial and equal justice for all, to facilitate the economic development of the country by helping and encouraging local initiative, to favour the spread of education, to bring to an end Turkish political divisions, too long exploited, such is the role which the two alli ed governments assume in the liberated territories. \" Early in 1919 there also gained currency in Pales tine the twelfth of Wilson's fourteen points, to th e effect that nationalities under Turkish rule \" should be assure d an undoubted security of life and an unmolested opportunity of autonomous development\".8 In May of the same year a purely American commission went to the Near East to ascertain the wishes of the commun ities as to a mandatory; the commission reported th at Great Britain received second choice in 57.49 per cent, o f the petitions; that there was a general agreement in favour of retaining the unity of Syria and Palestine, as w ell as a strong sentiment against France as a manda tory for Syria; less than one per cent, of the petitions sup ported the establishment of a Jewish national home in Palestine, while 72.3 per cent, expressed oppositio n to it.9 Yet, without reference to these findings, the all ied supreme council, at its meeting in San Remo on April 24, 1920, awarded the mandate for Syria and the Lebanon to France, and the mandates for Palestine and Iraq to Great Britain. This in itself was an act of bad fai th on the part of the council; but the terms of the Palestine mandate were still less in keeping \" with the wishe s of the native populations \". The mandate provided for carrying out the Jewish national home policy on the one hand, and for guaranteeing the rights of the e xisting population on the other. Throughout the confusion o f the two aims, and the duplicity of both the Briti sh government and the Zionists behind it, are striking . In article 2 the mandatory made itself responsibl e for placing the country under such political, administr ative, and economic conditions as would secure the establishment of the Jewish national home; for the development of self-governing institutions, and for safeguarding the civil and religious rights of the inhabitants of Palestine, irrespective of race and religion. In article 4 the Palestine administration was to recei ve special advice from a so-called Jewish agency; u nder article 6 the British government undertook to facilitate Je wish immigration and encourage close settlement by Jews on"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"the land, including state lands and waste lands: ot her sections provided that local autonomy should be encouraged, that there should be free access to the holy places, etc. At the time when the mandate was awarded,10 Pales tine bad a population of 757,182, of whom 590,890 w ere Moslems, 73,024 Christians, and 83,794 Jews; the re maining 9,474 were principally Druzes.11 The Jewish fraction, eleven per cent, of the population, was r oughly divided into four groups: Descendants of Jews who had never left Palestine (negligible in number); 1. Descendants of Jews who had returned to Palest ine in the middle ages (few in number); 2. Those who had come in during the nineteenth an d twentieth centuries, under non-Zionist auspices; 3. Those who had come in under Zionist auspices. The mandate, however, recognized the Zionist orga nization as the Jewish agency with special public f unctions in Palestine, because Zionists were thoroughly orga nized both there and abroad and were the promoters of the whole experiment; and the Zionist, Sir Herbert Samu el, was appointed first British High Commissioner, taking office on July 1, 1920, superseding the military ad ministration.12 The next point, whether the Zionist organization has gained by the venture, is easily elucidated by noting the enormous expansion of that body in the last decade and the millions of dollars that have passed throug h its hands. The world Zionist organization today includes for ty-seven territorial Zionist federations, a few sma ller Zionist societies, and certain special unions.13 all repres ented at the world Zionist congresses. There are se ven members of the Zionist executive committee in Pales tine (four general Zionists, two labourites and one Mizrachi Zionist). Their duty is to watch over the work of the Zionist organization in Palestine, and to keep in touch with their colleagues abroad. Of the latter, there are three in England, one in Germany, and one in the United States.14 To make its activities more effective, the world Zionist organization has delegated a considerable p art of its practical work to certain corporations and companie s, of which the more important are:15 1. The Jewish Colonial Trust, Ltd., with a balance sheet for the year 1928 of more than ?10,000,000. 2. The Anglo-Palestine Co. Ltd., subsidiary of the above, also showing a balance sheet of more than ?10,000,000. 3. The Jewish National Fund, which by 1929 had acqu ired about 71,500 acres of rural, and 450 acres of urban land. The annual receipts between 1924 and 1928 averaged $1,384,000, making over $5,500,000 for the four years. 4. The Palestine Land Development Co, Ltd., which acquired about 38,400 acres, of which it sold to J ewish settlers about 14,300 acres. Its trial balance shee t in Dec. 1928 showed a balance of over $2,100,000. 5. The Palestine Foundation Fund, Ltd. (Keren Hayes od), which received for Zionist projects during the eight years 1921-1929 a total of approximately $18,000,00 0. It maintains a complete educational system, inclu ding the Hebrew university at Jerusalem, a technica l institute at Haifa, four technical and one music school, four normal schools, six secondary schools, and ninety- seven elementary schools."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Under Zionist auspices there has been organized als o: 1. The Women's International Zionist Organization ; 2. The Sick Benefit Fund17 with a membership of 1 5,000. Of the fifteen million Jews in the world today, 1 ,200,000 are enrolled as members of the Zionist org anization. To secure the co-operation of all Jews and thus bro aden its base of support, the organization entered into long negotiations with non-Zionists in America.18 In the se, Samuel Untermeyer, Zionist, law partner of Loui s Marshall (ostensibly anti-Zionist) in New York, too k a leading part. The Zionist body altered its name to \" World Zionist Organization \"; then in 1923, as mone y was not coming in fast enough, Chaim Weizmann at the Carlsbad congress suggested that the latter should be transformed into the \" Jewish Agency under the M andate \", and should admit all non-Zionist Jews. Alfred Mo nd, the late Lord Melchett President of the English Zionist federation, was requested to go to America to promo te the new Jewish agency and welcome Louis Marshall and his non-Zionist following into it. While in America , Mond said:19 \" The Jewish Agency under the mandate is the broa dest possible basis for all those who wish to help. It will be an immense aid to Palestine and a great strength to the Zionist organization, and I am glad to think t he negotiations which had been carried on in London, f avoring a committee to include the Zionist executiv e and representatives of the most important Jewish bodies have been brought to a successful result. I told C haim Weizmann that it will be one of the greatect honour s that can be conferred on me to serve on a board o f that kind.\"20 After long negotiations, a basis of agreement was finally reached in August 1929. Zionists and non-Z ionists are now merged in a new body known as the Jewish Ag ency: its council includes an equal number of Zioni sts and non-Zionists : the executive committee of the c ouncil, consisting of twenty Zionists and twenty no n- Zionists, is henceforth to occupy the privileged po sition described under article 4 of the mandate. Such, in brief, are the visible organs establishe d by Zionists for realizing their aim. What the sum s collected by these and other organs would total is not easy t o estimate. The Zionist organization is said to hav e spent seven million pounds ($34,000,000),2i and Baron Edm ond de Rothschild an additional $50,000,000 in Palestine. 22 The first sum, however, represents bu t a fraction of the sums collected. The Keren hayes od alone brought in $18,000,000; and, in the single month of September 1929, the Jews of the United States rais ed more than ?1,500,000.23 A conservative estimate of the f unds that have passed through Zionist hands since t he Balfour declaration would be $100,000,000, irrespec tive of the large sums spent annually by the Britis h government. Had such a large capital been placed in competent hands, there would be no need for furthe r appeals or loans. Yet in May 1931, Alfred Mond made personal efforts to float a projected Zionist Inte rnational loan and endeavoured to get the Italian government to join with the governments of Great Britain, Fran ce and Germany in guaranteeing it.24 But the Zionist administration of funds has been not only incompetent but irregular. A single instan ce may suffice. It concerns the opposition made by American Zioni sts to the administration of Louis Lipsky, Presiden t of the American Zionist organization, and the resignation from that body of Rabbi Stephen Wise, Samuel Rosens ohn and Lawrence Berenson. At the Atlantic City (U. S. A.) Zionist conventio n the previous year, the disclosure had been made o f the mismanagement of funds, and Berenson and Rosensohn were appointed to enquire into the affairs of the organization and restore the confidence of the Zion ists in the country. Berenson said later:25 \" One of the first things we did was to create a thing heretofore unknown to the organization: namel y a balanced budget—whereby the organization could neve r spend or invent a necessity for sums in excess of the budget. We found a deficit of $175,000, exclusive o f guarantees, which had been created under the lead ership"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"of Mr. Louis Lipsky in the year or two prior to the Atlantic City convention. In the creation of a bal anced budget, it became necessary to eliminate a lot of e xpenditures such as subsidies and compensation to f avoured individuals.26 \" A note on the Mercantile Bank (New York) was en dorsed by the organization for the American Zion Commonwealth for $285,000. A petition of bankruptcy has been filed against the American Zion Commonwealth in Palestine. An attempt is now being made to save the Commonwealth and to raise $200,000 . That is futile. The liabilities are $1,068,000. The assets consist of approximately $400,000 of accoun ts receivable, money owed by American purchasers of th e lands in Palestine, and which will not be paid un til the deeds are produced; but those deeds can not be prod uced. The remaining asset is land in Palestine, pur chased in the land boom a few years ago. In part, the moneys received, instead of being applied to acquire the d eeds, were used to purchase additional lands. The American Zio n Commonwealth attempted to build an hotel, but the project had to be abandoned. The Commonwealth has o ther contingent liabilities, and the Arabs threaten to foreclose. \" One of the obligations of the Zionist Organizat ion of America was the endorsement of this note on the Central Mercantile Bank of New York for $285,000. P resident Weinstein and Rosenblatt had a hand in tha t work, and were the two prime movers in the land spe culation. When the speculation was rife and it look ed as though the America Zion Commonwealth would make mon ey, Mr. Lipsky, a man without any business experience, endorsed the American Zion Commonwealth as an American Zionist institution, ran editorials in the New Palestine and other Zionist publications, a nd was largely responsible for inducing the America n purchasers to make deposits for the acquisition of lands through the American Zion Commonwealth. Thus the United Palestine Appeal felt compelled to advance i n cash to the American Zion Commonwealth a sum of $320,000; and about $125,000 more of the United Pal estine Appeal money had to be used to pull the Amer ican Zion Commonwealth out of its difficulties. \" The endorsement was placed upon that note by Mr . Lipsky without the knowledge, consent or approval of anybody in the Zionist organization. \" The United Palestine Appeal found it necessary to advance these sums of money, because the indigna tion of the land purchasers was injuring the United Palesti ne Appeal campaign, and even affecting the confiden ce in the Zionist organization.\" There remains to consider whether the native popu lation of Palestine has benefited by the mandate. I t is recalled that 79 per cent, of the population at the time of the St. Remo award was Moslem and it is th erefore fitting to weigh the complaints of the Palestine Ar abs. These may be grouped as follows: 1. Prior to the British occupation, Jews and Arab s lived together in tranquillity; since, there hav e been four serious breaks, of which three occurred in 1920 and 1921 and totalled 104 killed and 400 wounded; the last was still more serious. In view of the fact th at each break has inspired a fruitful campaign of Z ionist appeals, there would seem to be a deeper connection between the former and the latter. 2. The purpose of article 22 of the League covena nt was to promote \" the well-being and development of the people\" of the mandated territories. Alien Jews, living outside Palestine, did not come within the s cope of this aim. The Balfour declaration prevented Pales tine from creating those self-governing institutions des cribed in article 2 of the mandate. Article 20 of t he League covenant provided that all states members of the Le ague must take immediate steps to procure their rel ease from any undertakings inconsistent with the terms o f the covenant: the Balfour declaration fell unde r this category."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 3. Because of the Balfour declaration, t he British authorities set up in Palestine a Jewi sh agency whose function was to advance Jewish interests above all others; Jews should be represented in a Palestinia n legislature only in proportion to their numbers. 4. The Jewish national home policy cannot be acce pted by the Arabs. If it constituted a reason for l etting the Jews outside Palestine enter the country \" as of right and not on sufferance,\" it was the more reaso n that the Arabs themselves should be confirmed in their natio nal home as against all intruders, and immigration placed in their control. The Jews already in Palestine were there by right and should enjoy the same status as the Arabs. But to argue (as the British did) that the right of the present Jewish community in Palestine should b e extended to all the Jews of the world, was to adopt a line o f reasoning \" which no people, let alone the Arabs, would accept if applied to itself.\"27 5. The Arab-speakin g inhabitants, to whom Palestine is Falastin (Phili stia) resent its being referred to in all official documents as Eretz-Israel (land of Israel). They do not see why a country which they are accustomed to think of as their own should suddenly become Eretz Israel without their c onsent, simply because it has pleased other nations to set up in it a Jewish national home. They point out tha t their own possession of the country since the seventh century gives them rights to-day which the Jews scattered abroad do not possess. The next question is, have the Jews as a whole benefited by the national home policy ? Th e native Jewish population of Palestine is in much the same position as the Arab population: it has suffered f rom a large influx of immigrants causing acute unemployment. Nor have the immigrants benefited greatly. Althoug h their future depended largely on agricultural develop ment, the majority of Jewish immigrants, as shown by official figures and estimates, settled in the town s: in 1922 there were found to be 68,000 Jews in ur ban areas and only 15,000 in rural areas; in 1925, 85,000 i n urban against 23,000 in rural.28 In 1926 and 1927 unemployment grew so acute that the Zionist organiz ation had to resort to doles in the chief centres o f Jewish population.29 For the seven years 1922-1928 the total number of Jewish immigrants was 79,894, nearl y as many as the Jews in the country at the time of the British occupation; the total number of Jewish emig rants (mostly disappointed immigrants) for that same peri od was 23,761. The huge sums raised on the pretext of a national home, and the new taxes devised and levied by the Zionist organization have been a heavy drain on Jewry as a whole, without any palpable compensation.30 What of Great Britain? She has long desired to control the Palestine-Transjordan-Iraq route; by the Balfour de claration she was led to the belief that a friendly Jewish po pulation in Palestine would be the best possible gu arantee of continued British control of this route which flank s the Suez canal and guards the approach to India. Apparently it is her intention to continue to seek some means of reconciling conflicting interests in Palestine. But her prestige has already suffered: Arab discontent in P alestine has spread to Iraq and India; the Jews hav e been the first to go back on her and make her responsible fo r all their difficulties. Moreover Palestine is a h eavy drain on her treasury: to it she has had to advance several loans, of which the first in 1927 was for ?4,475,00 0. The Palestine administration has a public debt, guarant eed by the British treasury; it also has a yearly d eficit, which in 1928 amounted to approximately ?800,000. In conclusion, it is seen that the Zionists, thro ugh undue political influence, engaged England in c arrying out a Jewish national home policy. This policy, contrary to England's prior engagements and against her own best interests, has resulted in a costly and futile expe riment. It has created a new politico-racial problem in the near east, and has been disastrous to the native p opulation of Palestine, and even to Jewry taken as a whole. But to its Zionist promoters, it has brought vast influ ence through the expansion of their own powerful, intern ational organization, and millions and millions in revenue. World Zionist organization, or Jewish agency, or Alliance Israelite Universelle—whatever name it tak es, it is at bottom always the Kahal with its eighteen centur ies of accumulated experience. Its aims and princip les, whether shrouded in the mysticism of the Talmud or bluntly stated in the Protocols, are the same to-da y as under the Roman empire. But in recent years the tec hnical improvements in its methods of operating3! a nd the debility of national governments32 have advanced it s cause with singular rapidity. Just fifty years ag o, a German wrote:33 \" Russia is the last defence agains t the Jews, and its surrender is only a matter of t ime.

HOW THE PROTOCOLS CAME TO RUSSIA The word \" protocol \"i was used to signify a fly -leaf pasted at the top of an official document, be aring either the opening formula or a summary of the contents fo r convenient reference. The original draft of a tre aty was usually pasted on in this way, that the signatories might check the correctness of the engrossed copy before signing. The draft itself being based on the discus sion at the conference, the word came to mean also the minutes of the proceedings. In this instance \" the protocols \" mean the \" dra ft of the plan of action \" of the Jewish leaders. T here have been many such drafts at different periods in Jewish his tory since the dispersion, but few of them have com e into general circulation. In all, the principles and mor ality are as old as the tribe. By way of illustrati on we give an instance which occurred in the fifteenth century. In 1492, Chemor, chief Rabbi of Spain, wrote to t he Grand Sanhedrin, which had its seat in Constanti nople, for advice, when a Spanish law threatened expulsion .2 This was the reply: \" Beloved brethren in Moses, we have received you r letter in which you tell us of the anxieties and misfortunes which you are enduring. We are pierced by as great pain to hear it as yourselves. The advice of the Grand Satraps and Rabbis is the following: 1. As for what you say that the King of Spain 3 o bliges you to become Christians: do it, since you c annot do otherwise. 2. As for what you say about the command to despo il you of your property: make your sons merchants t hat they may despoil, little by little, the Christians of theirs. 3. As for what you say about making attempts on y our lives: make your sons doctors and apothecaries, that they may take away Christians' lives. 4. As for what you say of their destroying your s yna gogues: make your sons canons and clerics in o rder that they may destroy their churches. 5. As for the many other vexations you complain o f: arrange that your sons become advocates and lawy ers, and see that they always mix in affairs of State, t hat by putting Christians under your yoke you may d ominate the world and be avenged on them. 6. Do not swerve from this order that we give you , because you will find by experience that, humilia ted as you are, you will reach the actuality of power. (Signed) PRINCE OF THE JEWS OF CONSTANTINOPLE.\" The protocols given to the world by Nilus are onl y the latest known edition of the Jewish leaders pr ogramme. The story of how the latter came into general circu lation is an interesting one. In 1884 the daughter of a Russian general, Mile. Justine Glinka, was endeavouring to serve her count ry in Paris by obtaining political information, which she communicated to General Orgevskii4 in St. Petersbu rg. For this purpose she employed a Jew, Joseph Schorst,5 m ember of the Miz-raim Lodge in Paris. One day Schor st offered to obtain for her a document of great impor tance to Russia, on payment of 2,500 francs. This s um being received from St. Petersburg was paid over and the document handed to Mile. Glinka.6 She forwarded the French original, accompanied by a Russian translation, to Orgevskii, who in turn h anded it to his chief, General Cherevin, for transmission to the Tsar. But Cherevin, under obligation to wealth y Jews, refused to transmit it, merely riling it in the arc hives.7"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" Meantime there appeared in Paris certain books on Russian court life8 which displeased the Tsar, who ordered his secret police to discover their authorship. Thi s was falsely attributed, perhaps with malicious in tent,9 to Mile. Glinka, and on her return to Russia she was b anished to her estate in Orel. To the marechal de n oblesse of this district, Alexis Sukhotin, Mile. Glinka gave a copy of the Protocols. Sukhotin showed the documen t to two friends, Stepanov and Nilus; the former had it prin ted and circulated privately in 1897; the second, P rofessor Sergius A. Nilus, published it for the first time i n Tsarskoe-Tselo (Russia) in 1901, in a book entitl ed The Great Within the Small. Then, about the same time, a frie nd of Nilus, G. Butmi, also brought it out and a co py was deposited in the British Museum on August 10, 1906. Meantime, through Jewish members10 of the Russian police, minutes of the proceedings of the Basle congress11 in 1897 had been obtained and these were found to correspond with the Protocols.12 In January 1917, Nilus had prepared a second edit ion, revised and documented, for publication. But b efore it could be put on the market, the revolution of March 1917 had taken place, and Kerenskii, who had succe eded to power, ordered the whole edition of Nilus's book to be destroyed. In 1924, Prof. Nilus was arrested by the Cheka in Kiev, imprisoned, and tortured; he was tol d by the Jewish president of the court, that this t reatment was meted out to him for \" having done them incalcu lable harm in publishing the Protocols \". Released for a few months, he was again led before the G. P. U. (C heka), this time in Moscow and confined. Set at lib erty in February 1926, he died in exile in the district of Vladimir on January 13, 1929. A few copies of Nilus's second edition were saved and sent to other countries where they were publis hed: in Germany, by Gottfreid zum Beek (1919); in England, by The Britons (1920); in France, by Mgr. Jouin in La Revue Internationale des SocUtes Secretes, and by U rbain Gohier in La Vieille France; in the United St ates, by Small, Maynard & Co. (Boston 1920), and by The Beck with Co (New York 1921). Later, editions appeared i n Italian, Russian, Arabic, and even in Japanese. Such is the simple story of how these Protocols r eached Russia and thence came into general circulat ion. Mr. Stepanov's deposition'3 relative to it is her e given as corroboration. \" In 1895, my neighbour in the district of Toula, Major (retired) Alexis Sukhotin, gave me a manuscr ipt copy of the Protocols of the Wise Men ofZion. He told me that a lady of his acquaintance, whose name he did not mention, residing in Paris, had found it at the hou se of a friend, a Jew. Before leaving Paris, she ha d secretly translated it and had brought this one copy to Russ ia and given it to Sukhotin. \"At first I mimeographed this translation, but fi nding it difficult to read, I resolved to have it p rinted, making no mention of the date, town, or printer's name. In this I was helped by Arcadii Ippolitovich Kelepovs kii, who at that time was chief of the household of Grand Du ke Sergius. He gave the document to be printed by the distric t printing press. This took place in 1897. Sergius Nilus inserted these Protocols in his work and added his own commentary.

Recognizing the fact beneath this expression, one is little surprised at the zeal with which cert ain parties seek to disprove documentary evidence. If the evidence were false, then it would be ignored by th ose concerned and pass quickly into the realm of fo rgotten things. But if the evidence is genuine and open to verification from many angles, then the truth will hurt, and thus not be ignored. If this reasoning is correct, the violent methods used by the Jews, particularly those affiliated wi th the Zionist movement, to discredit and suppress the document en titled The Protocols of the Elders ofZion, would al one constitute a proof of its authenticity. Nilus and Butmi had published the document withou t comment. Its success was therefore entirely due t o: 1. The self-evident character of the document. 2. The logical reasoning expressed in clear, simp le terms; 3. The explanation it gives of international poli tics; 4. The fact that the events predicted in it have actually occurred since. But if its publishers gave no guarantee of its ge nuineness, those who have attacked it have failed e ven more conspicuously to discredit and refute it. To quote Nesta Webster, in her World Revolution:1 \"The truth is, then, that the Protocols have neve r been refuted, and the futility of the so-called r efutations published, as also the fact of their temporary supp ression, have done more to convince the public of t heir authenticity than all the anti-Semite writings on t he subject put together\"."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" There is plenty of indisputable, documentary evid ence which explains the Jewish plan of action, with out recourse to the Protocols. Their importance lies in the fact that, published at a definite date, they foretold historical events which have upset the world, that they explained these events by the principles set f orth in the work itself: this fact makes it superfluous to enqu ire whether the author of the Protocols is the Zion ist Congress in corpore, a member of the congress, or some Jewis h (or even Christian) thinker. Their source is of s mall moment: the facts, the relation of cause and effect , are there; the existence of the work prior to the events foretold in it can never be brought into question, and that is enough. The first attempt at refutation appeared in 1920, entitled, The Jewish Bogey and the Forged Protocol s of the Learned Elders ofZion, by a Jew, Lucien Wolf; it wa s followed by articles in the Metropolitan (New Yor k) signed \" William Hard \". The effect of these articl es, contrary to the intention of their authors, was to draw wider public attention to the existence of the Prot ocols. At the same time in America the Jewish Anti- Defamation League2 filled the papers with denunciat ions of the libel from all parts of the country, th us proving how powerful is Jewish organization. One of its mem bers was Louis Marshall, and, as an illustration of its activity, the story of the suppression of the editi on of the Protocols which an American publishing ho use tried to bring out, is instructive. It shows not only the pressure the Jews can bring to bear on anyone who dares to lift his finger against them, but their own mental attit ude of absolute intolerance towards others, while d emanding of the world complete acquiescence in their schemes . George Haven Putnam, head of the firm Putnam & So n, New York, after his annual visit to London, brou ght out in 1920 an American edition of The Cause of Wor ld Unrest? About the same time, he decided to issue The Protoc ols of the Elders of Zion in book form. Advance not ices were released and the book set up and ready to go o n the stands about October 15. On the eve of its ap pearance, Putnam received the following letter from Louis Mar shall.4 MY DEAR SIR: As one who believes in those qualities that const itute the true American spirit, I have been greatly disturbed by the accounts given by the newspapers of the outrage to which you were subjected at the meeting held at Erasmus High School in Brooklyn the other evening. Knowing your patriotism, I can only regard the alle ged cause, namely, that you had condemned the Declarati on of Independence and were of the opinion that we owed an apology to England for severing our relations wi th her, as a slander, born of prejudice and ignoran ce. I had scarcely finished reading this episode whic h had thus aroused my indignation, when I found upo n my table a book, bearing the imprint of your firm, ent itled The Cause of World Unrest, bound in a flaming red and purporting to be a republication of articles that h ave recently appeared in the London Morning Post wi th which I had become familiar. To say that I was shocked th at your honoured name should be made the vehicle of disseminating among the American people these outpo urings of malice, intolerance and hatred, this witc hes' broth of virulent poison, is merely to confess the poverty of my vocabulary. On opening the book I tur ned to the publishers' note, which was apologetic and disclaim ed responsibility for the publication. It was follo wed by an introduction which made it absolutely clear that th e purpose of the book was to charge the Jews with a n age- long conspiracy to destroy civilization in order th at they might absorb the wealth and power of the wo rld. Thus proclaimed, at length came the stupid drivel intend ed to support this thesis and calculated to make th e Jew repulsive in the eyes of his fellow-men and to exte rminate him, not figuratively, but literally, appea ling, as it does, to the lowest passions and proceeding upon th e same processes that were employed in the Middle A ges for the same object. Then it was the blood accusati on, the charge of poisoning wells, of spreading pla gues and pestilence, of the desecration of the Host. Now it is pretended conspiracy to overturn the economic sy stem of the world by inciting warfare and revolution. The slightest knowledge of history, the most elem entary capacity for analysis, or even a minute inkl ing as to what the Jew is and has been, would suffice to stam p this book and the forged Protocols on which it is based, as the most stupendous libel in history. These writing s are the work of a band of conspirators who are se eking to continue to make the Jew, as he has been in all the centuries, the scapegoat of autocracy. The Protoco ls bear the hall-mark of the secret agents of the dethroned Rus sian bureaucracy, and the book which you have publi shed is a mere babbling reiteration of what the murderers o f the Ukraine, of Poland, and of Hungary are urging as"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"justification for the holocausts of the Jews in whi ch they have been engaged. It has been intimated, a nd there is much to sustain the theory, that the real purpose o f these publications in the United States and in En gland is to arouse sufficient hostility against the Jews to sub ject them to mob violence and thus to give justific ation to those who have incited pogroms in Eastern Europe. I have also observed that, upon the cover of the book to which I am now referring, you are advertisi ng the publication of The Protocols, which I unhesitatingl y denounce as on their face palpable forgeries. If you were called upon to circulate counterfeit money or forge d bonds, you would shrink in horror at the suggesti on. What you have done and what you propose to do is, howeve r, in morals, incalculably worse. You are assisting in spreading falsehoods, in uttering libels, the effec t of which will be felt for decades to come. You ar e giving them respectability, whilst the name of the author is shrouded in secrecy. Even Mr. Gwynne does not av ow paternity for the book which he has heralded. Much as you may desire to shake off responsibility, ther efore, the real responsibility for hurling this bomb, for such it is, prepared though it has been by others, rest s upon you. Whoever may read this book and is of such a low typ e of intelligence as to be influenced by it, will n ot be apt to draw the fine ethical distinctions with which you a re seeking to salve your conscience. As a patriotic American, do you believe that you are contributing to the cre ation of that spirit of justice and fair-play, of u nity and harmony, which is the very foundation of that Ameri canism for which every good citizen has yearned, wh en you stimulate hatred and passion by the publication of these dreadful falsehoods? If there should occu r in this country, in consequence of those publications and t hose of Henry Ford, what is earnestly desired by th e anti- Semites with whom you have arrayed yourself, do you suppose that, when the Almighty calls you to a reckoning and asks you whether you have ever borne false witness against your neighbour, you will be g uiltless in His eyes because of your publishers' note disavo wing responsibility ? I know that you must have been pained, as I was w hen I read of the treatment to which you were subje cted, because of lying accusations directed against you. Are you able to appreciate the pain, the grief, the agony, that you are causing three millions of your fellow-count rymen and to millions of men, women and children in other parts of the world by your participation in the dis graceful and inhuman persecution which is now being insidiously carried on by means of publications in the distribution of which you are now actively enga ged ? I look upon this as a tragedy. Louis MARSHALL. Major Putnam, still feeling and sincerely believi ng that he was an independent American, though not a very brave one, for throughout he uses the name of Mr. G wynne as a screen, answered: New York, October 15th, 1920. DEA R MR. MARSHALL: Your letter of the 13th inst., which has to do wi th the publication of the volume entitled World Unr est and the announcement of the companion volume The Protocols, has been read before the members of our publishing board and has received the respectful consideration to which any communication from a citizen of your standing and reputation is assuredly entitled. I am asked by my associates to make report as follows a s to our own understanding of the matters in question: 1. We are not prepared to accept your view of the responsibility that attaches to a publishing impri nt, or to the association of such imprint with one volume or anot her. We believe that our own policy in this matter is in accord with that of the leading publishing houses o n both sides of the Atlantic. It would be impossibl e to carry on the business of publishing books of opinion, whe ther the opinions have to do with the issues of to- day or with matters of the past, if the publisher was assu med to be in accord with the con clusions arrived a t by one author or another. It is the intention to bring i nto print only such volumes as may present on such issues information that is understood to make an addition to the knowledge of the subject, o r con clusions which appear to be entitled to consi deration, to analysis, or possibly to refutation."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 2. We have on our own catalogue, for instance, vo lumes expressing almost every phase of theological or religious belief. The list includes some books ac cepted by the Christian Scientists as fairly repres entative of their doctrines. In publishing such books we have, of course, no intention of announcing ourselves as upholding the theories of t he Christian Scientists any more than in the public ation of a volume by a Presbyterian divine we have expressed o ur acceptance of the Westminster catechism, or in p rinting a book by an Episcopal friend, we have been prepare d to approve the reasonableness of the thirty-nine articles. 3. The volume, World Unrest, was, as you will ha ve noted, brought into publication in London at the instance of Mr. Gwynne, the scholarly editor of the Morning Post. You doubtless have knowledge of the journals of England and will realize that the Post does not bel ong to the sensation-monger journals like Bottomley 's John Bull or Hearst's American. It is a conservative pap er which has the reputation of avoiding sensational material. Mr. Gwynne had convinced himself that the papers brought into print in the Post, and later published under his direction in book form, were deserving of considera tion. As we have stated in the publisher's note, we are not prepared to express any opinion whatsoever in regar d to the so-called information presented, or as to the weight of the conclusions arrived at by the writer and end orsed by Mr. Gwynne. The recommendation came to us that, as the Gwynne volume used as a large part of its te xt the document entitled The Protocols, the readers of World Unrest would be interested in having an opportunity of examining the full text of The Protocols. You h ave already knowledge of this curious document. It has, it seems, been in print since 1905, and possibly e arlier. An edition was published some months back by Eyre & Sp ottiswoode, conservative law publishers of London. The text that was brought to us is a translation freshl y made from the Russian and is accompanied by a rec ord of what is known of the original document.5 It is evident that the document has, as you point out, no voucher for authenticity and it is quite p ossible that it will be found to possess no historic importance. At tention has again been directed to it during the pa st year simply on the ground, according at least to the und erstanding of Mr. Gwynne's author and of himself, t hat certain of the instructions given and policies reco mmended in The Protocols appear to have been carrie d out by the bolshevik government in Russia. Certain suggest ions in The Protocols have also been connected with the policies of the Zionists, policies which, according to Mr. Gwynne and some other writers, are causing serious unrest in Palestine, Syria and Arabia. In presenting The Protocols to American readers i n a carefully printed edition, we have not the leas t intention of expressing the view that the documents are authe ntic, or that they will in the end be considered as possessing historic authority. Mr Gwynne takes the ground that neither World Unr est nor The Protocols -themselves present charges a gainst the Jews as a whole. They emphasize certain things that have been done, or are alleged to have been do ne, by certain groups of Jews. It would be as fair to say that a record of lynching in Texas or Arkansas, or a record of the attempt of the Bryan group to secure the paymen t of debts fifty cents on the dollar, was to be con sidered as a charge against the whole American people. Mr. Gwynne's associates take the ground that the leading Jews on both sides of the Atlantic, men wh ose patriotism is unquestioned, ought not to put these documents to one side as of trifling importance. Th e time may very properly have come at which the charges made a s said, only against certain groups of Jews should be analyzed by the Jews whose judgments would be accep ted as authoritative by English and American reader s. If the charge is unfounded that bolshevism as carried on in Russia has been conducted largely under Jewis h direction, the statement ought to be refuted. I received only yesterday a copy of a monthly ent itled The Brooklyn Anti-Bolshevist. The magazine undertakes to make \" defense of American institutio ns against the Jewish bolshevist doctrines of Morri s Hillquit and Leon Trotzki.\" It seems to me that American cit izens of the Jewish race (and the group comprises s ome of the best citizens that we have) might properly inte rest themselves in making clear to the public that there is no foundation for any charge against the World Patriot ism of the Jewish race.6"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" I wish very much that you might yourself be inter ested in preparing a volume that should give consid eration to the whole subject matter and particularly, of cours e, to these publications which have come into print as a result of the world's indignation against the Moscow gover nment. G. P. Putnam's Sons would be well pleased to asso ciate the imprint of their New York and London Hous es with such a volume from the pen of a distinguished jurist like yourself. One further thought occurs to me: You and I are b elievers in freedom of speech. We recognize that in war times certain reservations are in order for the sak e of the nation, but we hold that, with the necessa ry reservations as to the rights of an individual, or as to a possible libel upon an individual, it is in order, and, from the point of view of the community, wise, to allow full freedom for platform utterances. If, however, this be true for the spoken word it should logically be app licable also to the word, that comes into print. In case you may be interested in considering the suggestion of a monograph from your pen to be prepa red by yourself, or by some competent authority whom you m ight be able to interest, I should be ready to keep an appointment for a personal word at such time and pl ace as you might find convenient. Submitting the suggestion for your consideration, I am, with cordial regards, Yours faithfully, GEORGE HAVEN PUTNAM. The suggestion of a ' monograph' from Louis Marsh all's pen was somewhat ironical. There is no doubt that on October, 15, 1920, Major Putnam still felt himself an independent American. And the binding of The Protocols went on as usual. But on October 29th came one more letter from the president of the American Jewish committee: New York City, October 29th, 1920. MY DEAR SIR: Absence from the city and professional engagement s have prevented me from replying earlier to yours of the 15th inst., in which you define your policy regardi ng the publication of The Cause of the World Unrest and your announcement of your intended publication of T he Protocols. I cannot accept the theories on which you seek to justify acts which, in all moderation, I sought to characterize in my letter of the 13th inst. You disregard entire ly the proposition on which my criticism is based. Nobody can go farther than I do in upholding the freedom of th e press and freedom of speech. - It has been my pri vilege to aid in the creation of important precedents in furt herance of these fundamentals of liberty. Libel and slander, however, have always been looked upon in American l aw as abuses of a free press and of free speech and as attacks upon the integrity of the constitutional gu arantees that you invoke. Nor do I question the rig ht of any publisher to issue \" books of opinion \" to whatever subject the opinions may relate. They may be polemical or they may attack the soundn ess of scientific, political or theological theorie s or doctrines. No fair-minded man would for a moment ve nture to find fault because of strictures directed against his cherished doxy. The Protocols and The Cause of World Unrest are n ot, however, books of opinion. They assume to deal with facts. The Protocols purport to be the pronouncemen ts of so-called \" Wise Men of Zion\". The Cause of W orld Unrest undertakes to charge that the Jews and the F reemasons are together engaged in a conspiracy for the overthrow of civilization and the arrogation by the m of world domination. It is these alleged facts th at I denounce as falsehoods and as libels criminal in in tent and criminal in their operation. The Protocols , which are made the basis of the Cause of World Unrest and whi ch you properly describe as companion volumes, are so intrinsically false that even Mr. Gwynne concedes t hat he himself has a serious doubt as to their genu ineness. That The Protocols are a fabrication similar to tho se that have appeared in every period of history, a ppears from every line of that document. I am credibly informed that the manuscript was offered for publication to seven different publishing houses in this country, who re fused to have their names connected with it, before Small,"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Maynard & Co, undertook to issue it to the American public. The author of the Cause of World Unrest hi des behind anonymity. You yourself speak of the author as being \" Mr. Gwynne's author.\" Apparently even yo u do not know the pedigree of this incendiary book. Yet you have, I repeat, given it your endorsement by pu blishing it, even though you disavow responsibility. Your po sition is that of one who endorses a note to give i t currency and at the same time makes a mental reservation aga inst meeting his obligation. No, Major Putnam, the principle which you seek to establish will not work. Whoever touches pitch is defiled. Whoever retails falsehoods and spreads them, whethe r it be orally or through the medium of the press, is responsible for those falsehoods. It will not do to say that you have many friends among the Jews whom you respect and that these books are not intended to re flect upon all Jews. The world is not so discrimina ting. People whose passions are aroused do not differentiate. The forger of The Protocols a nd the mysterious author of The Cause of World Unre st make no distinctions. Neither did their prototypes of th e middle ages, nor the black hundreds of modern Rus sia, indulge in such refinements. Troy and Tyre were ali ke to them. Do not for a moment misunderstand me. I contend that there are no Jews who are now engaged or who h ave ever been engaged in a conspiracy such as that char ged by you as existing in these books which emerge smoking from your presses. The cry of Bolshevism wi ll not suffice. Your reference to the Brooklyn Anti - Bolshevist shows what a sad pass you have reached. To shelter yourself behind the bulwarks of an infam ous pasquinade of the guttersnipe variety and to insinu ate that because that sheet pretends to defend Amer ican institutions \" against the Jewish bolshevist doctri nes of Morris Hillquit and Leon Trotzki \" you may t herefore descend to the same depths, is a revelation to me. I had not believed that any real, true American wou ld thus lend himself to the creation of ill-will and malevo lence. The fact that out of the mass of Russian Jew s there is an infinitesimal percentage who are Bolshevists, af fords no justification for laying the sins of Bolsh evism at the door of the Jewish people. To say that Bolshevism i s a Jewish movement is as ridiculous as to say that the Jews are responsible for capitalism, or because there ar e Jewish musicians, actors and poets, that music, t he drama and poetry are Jewish movements. I am not a Zionist, and yet I regard the slurs th at these books are attempting to make against Zioni sm to be unworthy. The very Zionists whom these books are at tacking have been persecuted by the Bolsheviks and have been denounced as counter-revolutionists, just as t he mass of the Jews of Russia have been pursued as members of the bourgeoisie. I am not a member of the Masoni c or of any other secret order, but the attempt in these books to charge Freemasonry with participation in s uch a conspiracy as is proclaimed almost argues the existence of a pathological condition on the part o f the author that betokens mental aberration. When one remembers that fifteen of the presidents of the Uni ted States, including George Washington, have been Freemasons, it is unnecessary to go further in cond emnation of these volumes which you are pleased to denominate \" books of opinion \". I had not believed that a Jew in this country wou ld ever be called upon to occupy the humiliating po sition of defending his people against the charges such as th ose which are being spread broadcast through your a gency. If ever the time comes when it shall be desirable t o answer such books, I am quite sure that it will b e unnecessary for me to avail myself of your invitati on to make use of the services of your firms as pub lishers. Very truly yours, Louis MARSHALL. Two days later, Putnam bowed before the will of J ewry in the following terms:  November 1st, 1920. DEAR MR MARSHALL: Mr Gwynne, at whose instance we brought into prin t the American edition of his volume on World Unres t, had taken the ground that the publication of the do cument known as The Protocols might throw light on the organization of the Bolshevists. Their operations h ave caused grave concern throughout the world and t hey are, therefore, a matter of legitimate public discussion ."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" It was his opinion that if it had not been for th e apprehension aroused by bolshevism, the document would probably have been permitted to rest in obscurity. An edition of The Protocols was, therefore, publi shed in London by Eyre & Spottiswoode, law publishe rs of high standing. It had seemed to us that the readers of \" The Wor ld Unrest \" were entitled to have the opportunity o f examining the complete document (to which frequent references are made in Mr Gwynne's volume) and we had, therefore, undertaken the publication of a car efully prepared translation by us, which is now nea rly in readiness, and has involved a considerable outlay. We now find, however, that an edition printed in Boston is being distributed as a regular publicatio n. There is no necessity for bringing into print another volume containing substantially the same material. We hav e decided, therefore, in deference to the objections raised by yourself, and by my valued friend, Oscar Strauss, not to proceed1 with the publication. I am, Yours v ery truly. GEORGE HAVEN PUTNAM. What had taken place between October 29 and Novembe r 1 ? Putnam wrote to one of the parties interested that so much pressure was brought to bear on him that he had to give up publishing The Protocols, and would be obliged to withdraw unsold copies of World Unrest. It is safe to conclude that Putnam's firm was threa tened with bankruptcy if it persisted. We understand that Small, Maynard & Co. of Boston and The Beckwith Co . of New York and in fact practically every firm which h as published The Protocols had difficulties within a year or two. Of course it is said that that is purely accid ental: but it was just such an \" accident \" that Pu tnam wished to avoid! 1. 1st edition, p. 305. 2.

MORE ATTEMPTS AT REFUTATION THE LONDON TIMES LENDS A HAND While the Jews have succeeded in having the Protoco ls suppressed, entirely in Russia, Poland, Rumania, and other countries in Eastern Europe, and partiall y in England and America, they have failed in their many ingenious efforts to have them refuted by non-Jews. Indeed the so-called refutations with which thei r henchmen flooded the press in 1920-21 reveal more o f the real nature, workings, and associations of th e Jews and their agents than they rebut the evidence of th e Protocols. It is noteworthy that not one of these numerous a nd contradictory refutations bears an honest, non-J ewish signature. There is the article of the notorious Pr incess Radzivill1 published in the Jewish Tribune ( New York) for March 11, 1921, and followed by a statement by her friend, Mrs. Hurlbut. The former2 makes no ment ion of Mile. Glinka and describes the forgery of the proto cols by Golovinskii and a renegade Jew, Manassevich Manuilov, in Paris in 1904 \". Further on, oblivious of chronology, she states that General Cherevin wi lled her his memoirs, including the protocols, at the time o f his death in 1896.

Another person who wrote against the protocols, A . du Chayla, can hardly be taken more seriously. An article of his appeared on May 14, 1921, in the Tribune Jui ve of Paris; and later, another article on June 13 in the New York Call, a violent Communist sheet, besides artic les in Soviet publications. Prof. Nilus mentions in one of his books4 meeting this Frenchman, who then paraded as a devotee of the Russian Orthodox Church. The chara cter of this adventurer is well drawn in the reply his a rticles drew from a Russian lady, Madame Fermor, wh ich is given in full. \" Lately there appeared in the Russian paper Posl ednii Novosti, Nos. 331-332 a series of articles by Count Alexander de Chayla, in which he casts doubt on the authenticity of a certain document (The Protocols of the Elders of Ziori), because obtained by a man who did not inspire confidence. \"If the value of a document be based on the credi t of the person by whom it is produced, one must al so analyze the character of him who discredits it. \"That is why I am prompted to narrate how I becam e acquainted with Count du Chayla. \"I usually spent the summer on my estate in White Russia, in a village near Moguileff, where there i s a famous convent. There, one day, about ten years ago, I was visited by the Superior, the Archimandrite Arsene, who introduced a young man, Count du Chayla. Du Chayla had been sent to the convent to study the Russian language and the Orthodox religion of which he pret ended to be a devotee. \"Mr. Sabler5 had invited him to come to Russia an d sent him to the celebrated monastery of Optina Po ustine, whence he was sent to our monastery to serve as an example of anti-Catholic propaganda. \"It must be admitted that he lived up to his char acter and showed himself more of a Russian Orthodox than the Patriarch himself. Thanks to his zeal, beautifully sculptured angels in the Renaissance style were rem oved from the chapel of our monastery: du Chayla found them t oo Catholic. He told me the great joy he felt when he smashed these angels with a hammer. When I reproach ed him with an act of vandalism, his intolerance betrayed itself in the hatred which he then manifes ted against the Jews. Many a time I heard him say: \" One must have a good pogrom in Russia.\" One can underst and my astonishment when I read in his articles a f alse accusation of propaganda for pogroms against the Wh ite Army, which he now blames, he, who so loudly proclaimed that pogroms were a necessity! It is fro m him that I heard of the existence of Drumont's bo oks, which he praised eloquently; he used to advise me t o read them that I might understand to what extent the Jews had conquered France. He used to predict that the s ame fate would overtake Russia, if ever the Jews we re granted full civil rights. \"Great was my surprise when I read du Chayla's at tack on Drumont, whose books he now calls lies. He, who had so much admired Drumont. \"As I followed du Chayla's life in Russia, I was amazed to see the extraordinary rapidity of his pol itical and ecclesiastical career. He became an intimate friend of the Bishops known for their Orthodoxy, and he p reached the sacred and absolute power of the Russian Monarc h and implacable hatred towards all foreigners. We saw du Chayla as an intimate friend of the Bishops Anthony of Volinia and Evlogii of Holm, frequent the famou s salon of Countess Ignatieff. As he rose in Russian societ y, his activities shifted from the religious field: he took up politics, and, as a follower of Count Bobrinsky, le ader of the Pan-Slavic Party, he was sent to Austri a on a secret mission among the Galicians. He was subseque ntly arrested for espionage. \"After his return to Russia, he directed a violen t campaign against the smaller racial groups of the empire, especially against the Poles and Finns. As du Chayl a was always in need of money, I recommended him to the president of the commission for the affairs of Finl and, Mr. Korevo, who used him for anti-Finnish prop aganda in the foreign press. At the time of the declaratio n of war, du Chayla was a student in the theologica l academy of Petrograd; he was appointed chief of a field hos pital organized by Bishop Pitirim and provided with funds from Rasputin. Then I lost sight of him until after the revolution, when I heard of him as an agent pr ovocateur,"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"inciting the Cossacks against the White Army. In 19 19 du Chayla was tried by court martial and convict ed of seditious activities in the pay of the Soviets. The sentence was published in the newspapers of the Cr imea. \"I was astonished to find his name appended to an a rticle in a Russian newspaper notorious for its equ ivocal position concerning the reconstruction of Russia. ( Signed) TATIANA FERMOR.\" June 9th, 1921—Paris. Not satisfied—and rightly so—with these efforts t o discredit the Protocols, and yet unable to attach the signature of a noted gentile writer to their denial s, the Jews sought another expedient: the seal of a pproval of one of the best known newspapers would impress the general public. Heretofore the articles had borne t he name of private persons: now an official exposure of the protocols was to be published over the signature o f the \" Correspondent of The London Times in Constantinople \". The identity of the \" correspondent \" was not revealed,^ although the most elementary sense of ju stice would insist on giving full credit to the gen tleman who had made such a momentous discovery. Nor is there a ny evidence of his having been in Constantinople. Anyone who writes to the editor of a newspaper is a correspondent, and the number of lies which gain circulation in this fashion is notorious. The \" sen sational discovery \" which. The Times1 thus gave to its readers was that the protocols were a \" clumsy plagiarism \" of a French book it called \" The Dialogues of Gene va\", published in Brussels in 1865. The \" correspondent\" tells in a easy, off-hand mann er and with perfect self-assurance, about meeting i n Constantinople a Mr. W, who said: \" Read this book through and you will find irrefutable proof that th e Protocols of the Learned Elders ofZion is a plagiar ism \". So it wasn't the correspondent who deserved the c redit for the \" sensational discovery \" after all; but a \" Mr. X, a Russian landowner with English connexions \". Agai n, it is a pity that the gentleman should not have given his name and received the large reward which would sure ly have been his, from those who have been so activ e in suppressing and refuting the Protocols. Then follows the story of Mr. X, with his views o n religion, politics, secret societies, and the res t: this Mr. X is an old-fashioned gentleman and the reader is ready to believe every word, as reported by \" our corresp ondent\". Mr. X. explains how he obtained the copy of the Gen eva Dialogues from an old Okhrana officer; this establishes the fact that the Russian police had ma de use of the book to forge the Protocols. In fact the \" correspondent \" goes on to identify this very copy of the Geneva Dialogues as belonging to A. Sukhotin —there is an \" A. S. \" scratched in the back which is conc lusive—and from which the protocols were plagiarize d and given to Nilus. Parallel passages from the Dialogue s and the protocols are set opposite each other; an d the English reader, never at home in Continental politi cs, is led into speculations on Napoleon Ill's rela tions with the Carbonari, his employment of Corsicans in the p olice, the employment of Corsicans by the Russian p olice, the knowledge Corsicans had of the existence of the Geneva Dialogues, Joly's purpose in writing them, the influence of Philippe, a Lyons mystic, on the Tsar, and so on, until the reader is completely overwhel med. When he has reached this state, he is told: \" At an y rate, the fact of the plagiarism has now been con clusively established, and the legend [of the Protocols] may be allowed to pass into oblivion.\" The publication of this news from Constantinople was hailed by all the Jews, whose instant enthusias m is no less revealing than the following letter from a lea ding Zionist, which appeared in The Times on the sa me day as the \"discovery\". To the Editor—The Times, \"Sir, Your Constantinople correspondent, who has done a world service in tracking to their source the Prot ocols (for they have been carefully published throughout the world), says: \"There is no evidence to show how the Geneva Dialogues reached Russia.\" In your leading a rticle, however, you suggest that the protocols wer e forged under the auspices of Rachkovskii, head of the Russ ian secret police in Paris. This appears to be the truth. M. A. du Chayla, a French student of theology at St. P etersburg in 1910, who was in 1918 on the staff of the army"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"of the Cossacks of the Don, has testified through t he Tribune Juive (Paris, May 14, 1921) that Nilus t old him that the protocols were sent him from Paris by his friend, Mme. K—, who had received them from General Rachkovskii. M. du Chayla confirms a suggestion of yours, that the courier who brought the ms. from Pa ris was Alexander Sukhotin. He has seen this very ms., whic h, being in poor French and varying penmanship, sug gests a complex authorship in the Russian police bureau. The fact that the Geneva Dialogues have now been bo ught from an exmember of it, completes the chain. That the object of the publication of 1905 was to drown the Russian revolution in Jewish blood, I, l ike you, have asserted. But it appears that there was a prev ious edition in 1902 in the shape of an appendix to a reprint of a pietistic work by Nilus, and the motive behind th is earlier publication throws another curious sidel ight upon the old Russian court. For that publication was app arently a move in the game to discredit in favour o f Nilus a Lyons mystic. Philippe, of whose power over the Tsa r the Grand Duchess Elizabeth disapproved. Knowing that Nilus was designed as Philippe's supplanter, Rachko vskii, it is thought, wished to secure his good gra ces by providing him with a valuable weapon against Russia n liberalism. I am sorry that your correspondent should conclud e with the suggestion that those parts of the proto cols not in the Geneva Dialogues may possibly have been supplie d by Jews who spied on their co-religionists; for t his far- fetched hypothesis gives a gleam of hope to the con siderable number of organs throughout Europe that l ive only in the Protocols. Now is your correspondent ac curate in thinking that only moral harm has been do ne by this historic forgery? M. du Chayla offers evidence that it has helped to goad on those countless pogr oms in the Ukraine, of whose horrors Western Europe is almost ignorant. As for Nilus, he appears to be a fanatica l mystagogue, honest enough except for that theologic al twist which betrayed itself when, confronted by the suspicion that the Protocols were forged, he replie d: \" Even if they were, God who could speak through Balaam's ass, could also put the truth in a liar's mouth.\" Yours gratefully,  ISRAEL ZANGWILL \". Far End, East Preston, Sussex, August 18, 1921. Since then, to some extent, the Protocols have be en forgotten. But, Audiatur et altera pars, in the words of Max Nordau.8 The Times \" correspondent \" would conv ince us that there are similar or identical passage s to be found in the Protocols and in the Dialogues; and th is we readily admit. We go farther: identical passa ges will be found in earlier Protocols9 which go back to the da ys before the dispersion. By way of illustration, let it be assumed that th e Book of Common Prayer used in the Anglican Church were unknown to the Jews. Suppose, then, that a copy of it were secretly obtained by a certain Jew and publ ished, and that the Jews were shocked by the Anglican doct rine of which they learned in this way for the firs t time. It would then be easy for another Jew to show that the Book of Common Prayer was a plagiarism: it contain s passages copied, word for word, from the Gospels; t he Psalms are a transcript from King James' Bible; and so on. And not only that, but there are many parallels to be found in the secular literature. \" At any ra te \", one can imagine the second Jew saying at the end, \" the fac t of plagiarism has been conclusively established, and we may therefore affirm that no such Book of Common Pr ayer is used in the worship of the Church of Englan d.\" The second Jew would be right in pointing out the parallels in the earlier literature—though his con clusion would be ridiculous—for there is a very real connec tion: and so it is with the Protocols. One might have thought that The Times, in its des ire to publish the truth about the Protocols, would at least have given the correct title of the Geneva Dialogue s, it is, Dialogues aux Enfers entre Machiavelli et Montesquieu, published anonymously in Brussels in 1 865. Moreover a minute's search in a library catalo gue shows that another book, bearing a similar title, w as published some years earlier: namely, Machiavell i, Montesquieu & Rousseau, by Jacob Venedey, published by Franz Dunnicker in Berlin in 1850. The Times, with its interest in plagiarisms, might have been t empted to glance at this latter volume as also at T he Prince by Machiavelli and L'Esprit des Lois by Montesquieu. H ad it done so, its curiosity would have been amply rewarded: passages quoted from the Protocols as pla giarised from the Dialogues of 1865, are similar to several10 in Venedey's book of 1850, and both Jacob Venedey and Maurice Joly should be branded as plagiarists."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" But the resemblance between the Protocols and Ven edey's book does not stop with a few parallel passa ges: the spirit of both is the same; it is revolutionary, wh ereas the Dialogues of 1865 are socialistic and pol emical. The anonymous author merely borrowed certain descriptiv e passages in Venedey to give colour to his argumen t.11 Now hadn't The Times better discover a copy of Ve nedey belonging to a former Okhrana officer, so as to explain how the Russian secret police were able to plagiarize the spirit, as well as a few platitudes and descriptive bits, when forging the Protocols ? Its correspondent in Peiping might make that discovery some day? No, the Peiping correspondent (or any other) w ill be-very careful not to make that discovery, for the simple reason that Venedey was a Jew, whereas The Times' point is that the Jews had nothing to do with the drafting of the Protocols. Its argument i s that the author of the Dialogues was a Corsican; that the Co rsicans in the Paris Police preserved the Dialogues and gave a copy to the Corsican members of the Russian polic e, who used it to forge the Protocols: these insidi ous Corsicans!12 But what of Venedey ? Jacob Venedey, born in Cologne in May, 1805, was early engaged in revolutionary activities which cau sed his expulsion from Germany. He settled in Paris where, in 1835, he edited a paper of subversive character, called Le Proscrit. Driven from Paris by the police, he mo ved to Havre, until, thanks to the representations of Arago and Mignet, friends of Cr6mieux, he was allowed to return to the capital. Meanwhile his book, Romanism e, Christianisme et Germanisme, won the praise of the French Academy, Venedey was a close friend and associate of Karl Marx. After spending the years 18 43-44 in England, the headquarters of continental revolutionaries, he worked in Brussels for the foun ding, with Marx in 1847, of a secret organization, \" The Communist League of Workers \" (later the \" Societe internationale de la Democratic \"). After the February revolution in 1848, Venedey jo ined Marx in Germany, where he became one of the ch iefs of the revolutionary committee of Fifty (March, 184 8), and was sent as commissar into the Oberland to stand against Hecker. Later elected as a member of the Le ft from Hesse-Homburg, he continued to serve on the Committee of Fifty. It was at this time that he bro ught out in Berlin his Machia-yelli, Montesquieu & Rousseau, stressing the views attributed to Machiavelli and R ousseau in favour of despotism and oppression.13 When order was restored in Germany, Venedey was e xpelled from Berlin and Breslau. He was an active member of the Free Masons and affiliated with the C arbonari;14 he was also closely associated not only with the revolution 12. It is noteworthy that no Corsic an has yet raised a voice ofprotest against the cha rges made in The Times. Yet it is the Corsicanswho are the real victims of a libel, not the Jews tionaries of his d ay, but (as might be expected) with the leading Jews, the found ers of the Alliance Israelite Univer-selle.15 The l atter included men of as different political parties as t he reactionary-imperialist Fould, the liberal-conse rvative Disraeli, and the communist-revolutionary Marx, and whether living under an empire, a constitutional monarchy or a republic, all laboured towards a comm on aim, the establishment of an international Jewis h world power.16 Prominent among them and in close touch wi th Venedey, was Adolphe Isaac Cr6mieux (1798-1880). A Nimes lawyer with an ardent admiration for Napole on, he became legal adviser to the Bonaparte family and an intimate of Louis Napoleon with whom he joined i n overthrowing the government of Louis Philippe in 1849. A member of the Mizraim Lodge, the Scottish Rite (o f which he became Supreme Master on the death of Viennet), he was familiar with all new movements; a nd his influence enabled him to render at least one important service to Jewry by having the Jewish mur derers of Father Thomas in Damascus (1841) set at l iberty. One of the leaders in the revolution of February ] 848, he was appointed minister of justice under the provisional government, and used all his political influence in the election of Louis Napoleon to the presidency of the republic. Cremieux hoped in this way to be n amed Prime Minister and to control French policy fo r a period, as Disraeli did in England somewhat later. Like Disraeli, he had the financial support of the Rothschilds; but when the President chose for his b anker another Jew, Fould, and named General Cavaign ac premier, Cremieux saw he had lost. Bitterly disappo inted, he became so hostile to his former friend th at, at the time of the coup d'e\"tat in 1851, he was imprisoned at Vincennes. On his release, he identified himsel f with the enemies of the emperor; these included the communis t associates of Marx, Mazzini, Jacob Venedey (alrea dy mentioned), Louis Blanc, Ledru Rollin, Pierre Lerou x, and a group of socialists, among whom was Mauric e Joly.17"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" Joly, some thirty years younger than Cr6mieux, wi th an inherited hatred of the Bonapartes, seems to have fallen very largely under his influence. Through Cr 6mieux, Joly became acquainted with communists and their writings. Though, until 1871 when his ambition for a government post turned him into a violent communi st, he had not in 1864 gone beyond socialism, he was so im pressed with the way they presented their arguments that he could not, if the chance were offered, refrain f rom imitating it. And this chance came in 1864-1865 , when his hatred of Napoleon, whetted by Crdmieux, led hi m to publish anonymously in Brussels the Dialogues aux Enfers entre Machiavelli et Montesquieu. In this wo rk he tells us,18 \" Machiavelli represents the poli cy of Might, while Montesquieu stands for that of Right: Machiavelli will be Napoleon, who will himself desc ribe his abominable policy \". It was natural that he should choose the Italian Machiavelli to stand for Bonapar te, and the Frenchman Montesquieu, for the ideal statesman: it was equally natural that he should put in the mouth of Machiavelli some of the same expressions which Vene dey had put in it, and which Joly had admired. His own view was: \" Socialism seems to me one of the forms of a new life for the people emancipated from the traditions of the old world. I accept a great many of the solutions offered by socialism; but I reject communism, either as a social factor, or as a political instit ution. Communism is but a school of socialism. In p olitics, I understand extreme means to gain one's ends—in that at least, I am a Jacobin.\"19 The French authorities, however, penetrated the thi nlydisguised satire: Joly was arrested and sentence d to two years imprisonment (April, 1865). But the Dialogues had pleased Cremieux as much as they had displease d the emperor, and, when his term expired, his Jewish pat ron rallied to his support: Joly was able to found a legal review, Le Palais, with Jules Favre, Desmaret, Lebl ond, Arago, Berryer, and Adolphe Cremieux as its pr incipal stockholders. With the fall of Napoleon III, Adolphe Cremieux o nce more took an open part in politics. Pushing to the front his former secretary, Gambetta, he directed through him the negotiations with Bismarck. Bismarck himse lf was guided by the Jew Bamberger (1832-1899), a former r evolutionary of '48, but who had for years managed the Paris branch of the Jewish bank Bischofsheim & Gold -schmidt; he was also a friend of Cremieux. A third Jew in the negotiations was the son of James Rothschild .20 In this way, care was taken that the treaty sho uld be satisfactory, if not entirely to the signatories, y et at least so to the Alliance Israelite Universell e. From then (1871) until his death in 1880, as Pres ident of the Alliance Israelite Universelle and Sup reme Master of the Scottish Rite, Cremieux was one of th e promoters of the anti-clerical movement following the Franco-Prussian war. His favourite theme was that t here should be one cult: speaking at a general asse mbly of the Alliance he said: \" The Alliance is not limited to our cult; it voices its appeal to all cults and wants to penetrate in all religions, as it has penetrated in to all countries. Let us endeavour boldly to bring about the union of all cults under one flag of \" Union and Progress \": such is the motto of humanity.\"21 One cult, one flag. Are the Protocols of Nilus, o r the words of Machiavelli in Joly's book or in Ven edey's book, anything but an elaborate exposition of the i deas thus briefly expressed by Cremieux? His activi ties are one of the best examples of Jewish internationalism . Thus the principal attempt to discredit the Proto cols leads directly into historical studies which substantiate and illustrate their doctrine in a remarkable and unexpected manner. 1. Princess Catherine Radzivill was convicted of fo rgery in London on April 30,1902, the amount involv ed being ?3,000, and was sentenced to two years in pri son (London Times, April 16, 29, and May 1, 1902). On October 13, 1921, suit was filed against her by the Hotel Embassy, New York, for failure to pay her bi ll of $1,239, and on October 30 she was arrested on the instance of the Hotel Shelbourn e, New York, on a charge of defrauding the hotel of $352.

In his novel Coningsby (London, 1844), Disraeli draws a picture from life of the Jews ruling the w orld from behind thrones as graphic as anything in the Protoc ols of Nilus. (It is expected that The Times will s hortly be in a position to establish conclusively that Coningsby is a plagiarism of a Byzantine novel of the XVIIth century). The passage in which Rothschild (Sidonid) describes this runs as follows: \" If I followed my own impulse, I would remain he re,\" said Sidonia. \" Can anything be more absurd th an that a nation should apply to an individual to maintain its credit, and with its credit, its existence as a n empire and its comfort as a people; and that individual one to whom its laws deny the proudest rights of citizens hip, the privilege of sitting in its senate and of holding l and; for though I have been rash enough to buy seve ral estates, my own opinion is that by the existing law of Engla nd, an Englishman of Hebrew faith cannot possess th e soil.\" \" But surely it would be easy to repeal a law so il liberal.\" \" Oh! as for illiberality, I have no obje ction to it if it be an element of power. Eschew political sentimenta lity. What I contend is that if you permit men to a ccumulate property, and they use that permission to a great e xtent, power is inseparable from that property, and it is in the last degree impolitic to make it in the interes t of any powerful class to oppose the institutions under which they live. The Jews, for example, independent of th e capital qualities for citizenship which they poss ess in their industry, temperance, and energy and vivacity of mi nd, are a race essentially monarchical, deeply reli gious, and shrinking themselves from converts as from a ca lamity, are ever anxious to see the religious syste ms of the countries in which they live, flourish; yet since y our society has become agitated in England and powe rful combinations menace your institutions, you find the once loyal Hebrew invariably arrayed in the same r anks as the leveller and the latitudinarian, and prepared t o support rather than tamely continue under a syste m which seeks to degrade him. The Tories lose an important election at a critical moment; 'tis the Jews come f orward to vote against them. The Church is alarmed at the sch eme of a latitudinarian university, and learns with relief that funds are not forthcoming for its establishmen t; a Jew immediately advances and endows it. Yet th e Jews, Coningsby, are essentially Tories. Toryism indeed i s but copied from the mighty"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"prototype which has fashioned Europe. And every gen eration they must become more powerful and more dangerous to the society which is hostile to them. Do you think that the quiet humdrum persecution of a decorous representative of an English university ca n crush those who have successively baffled the Pha raohs, Nebuchadnezzar, Rome, and the feudal ages? The fact is you cannot destroy a pure race of the Caucasian organisation. It is a physiological fact; a simple law of nature, which has baffled Egyptian and Assyr ian kings, Roman emperors, and Christian inquisitors. No penal laws, no physical tortures, can effect that a supe rior race should be absorbed in an inferior, or be destroyed by it. The mixed persecuting races disappear, the p ure persecuted race remains. And at this moment, in spi te of centuries, or tens of centuries, of degradati on, the Jewish mind exercises a vast influence on the affai rs of Europe. I speak not of their laws, which you still obey; of their literature, with which your minds are satu rated; but of the living Hebrew intellect. \" You never observe a great intellectual movemen t in Europe in which the Jews do not greatly partic ipate. The first Jesuits were Jews: that mysterious Russia n diplomacy which so alarms Western Europe is organ ised and principally carried on by Jews; that mighty rev olution (of 1848) which will be in fact a second an d greater Reformation, and of which so little is as yet known in England, is entirely developing under the auspi ces of Jews, who almost monopolise the professorial chairs of Germany. Neander, the founder of Spiritual Christianity, and who is Regius Professor of Divini ty in the University of Berlin, is a Jew. Benary, e qually famous, and in the same university, is a Jew. Wehl, the Arabic Professor of Heidelberg, is a Jew. Year s ago, when I was in Palestine, I met a German student who was accumulating materials for the history of Chri stianity and studying the genius of the place; a modest and learned man. It was Wehl; then unknown, since becom e the first Arabic scholar of the day, and the author of the life of Mahomet. But for the German professors of this race, their name is legion. I think there are more than ten at Berlin alone. \" I told you just now that I was going up to town to-morrow, because I always made it a rule to inte rpose when affairs of state were on the carpet. Otherwise, I n ever interfere. I hear of peace and war in newspape rs, but I am never alarmed, except when I am informed that th e sovereigns want treasure; then I know that monarc hs are serious. \" A few years back we were applied to by Russia. Now there has been no friendship between the Court of St Petersburg and my family. It has Dutch connections which have generally supplied it; and our represent ations in favour of the Polish Hebrews, a numerous race, b ut the most suffering and degraded of all the tribe s, have not been very agreeable to the Czar. However circum stances drew to an approximation between the Romano ffs and the Sidonias. I resolved to go myself to St. Pe tersburg. I had on my arrival an interview with the Russian Minister of Finance, Count Cancrin; I beheld the so n of a Lithuanian Jew. The loan was connected with the affairs of Spain; I resolved on repairing to Spain from Russia. I travelled without intermission. I ha d an audience immediately on my arrival with the Spanish minister, Senor Mendizabel; I beheld one like myse lf, the son of a Nuevo Christiano, a Jew of Aragon. In cons equence of what transpired at Madrid, I went straig ht to Paris to consult the President of the French Counci l; I beheld the son of a French Jew, a hero, an imp erial marshal and very properly so, for who should be mil itary heroes if not those who worship the Lord of H osts? \" \" And is Soult a Hebrew? \" \" Yes, and others of the French marshals, and the most famous, Massena, for example; his real name w as Mannaseh: but to my anecdote. The consequence of ou r consultations was that some northern power should be applied to in a friendly and mediative capacity. We fixed on Prussia, and the President of the Council made an application to the Prussian minister, who attended a few days after our conference. Count Arnim entere d the cabinet, and I beheld a Prussian Jew. So you see, m y dear Coningsby, that the world is governed by ver y different personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes (pp. 249-252). 17.

TEXT AND COMMENTARY OF THE PROTOCOLS The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion may be briefly described as a blueprint for the dominat ion of the world by a secret brotherhood. Whatever may be the truth about their authorship—and, as will be shown, this has been the subject of bitter dispute—there can be no doubt that the world society to which they look forward is nothing more or less than a world police state. The book in which the Protocols were first embodi ed was published by Professor Sergyei A. Nilus in R ussia in 1905, a copy being received in the British Museu m on August 10th, 1906. Professor Nilus's concern w as to expose what he believed to be a ruthless, cold-bloo ded conspiracy for the destruction of Christian civ ilisation. Earlier, in August and September, 1903, the Russian newspaper Snamia had published the Protocols, and they are also believed to have been published in the win ter of 1902/1903 in the newspaper Moskowskija Wiedomosti. They remained unknown outside Russia, h owever, until after the Bolshevik Revolution, when Russian emigrants brought Nilus's book to North Ame rica and Germany. The similarity between what was forecast in the P rotocols and the fate which had befallen Russia und er the Bolsheviks was so marked that, after these long yea rs of neglect, they rapidly became one_of the most famous (or notorious) documents in the world. In Bolshevik Russia, the penalty for their mere p ossession was death. It remains so to this day, bot h in the Soviet Union and in the Satellite countries. Outsid e the Iron Curtain, in South Africa possession of t he Protocols is also forbidden by law, although the pe nalty is less drastic. As a result of their rapidly growing fame, numerous attempts were made to discredit the Protocols as a forgery. But it was not until 1933 that the Jews resorted to legal action. On 26th June, 1933, the Federation o f Jewish Communities of Switzerland and the Berne Jewish Com munity brought an action against five members of th e Swiss National Front, seeking a judgment that the P rotocols were a forgery and a prohibition of their publication.1 The procedure of the Court was astoun ding, the provisions of the Swiss Civil Code being deliberately set aside. Sixteen witnesses called by the plaintiffs were heard, but only one of the for ty witnesses called by the defendants was allowed a hearing. The judge allowed the plaintiffs to appoint two privat e stenographers to keep the register of proceedings d uring the hearing of their witnesses, instead of en trusting the task to a Court official. In view of these and similar irregularities, it w as not surprising that, after the case had lasted j ust on two years, the Court pronounced the Protocols to be a forgery and demoralising literature. The decision was given on 14th May, 1935, but it was announced in the Jewish Press before it was delivered by the Court I"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" On 1st November, 1937, the Swiss Court of Crimina l Appeal quashed this judgment in its entirety. Jew ish propagandists, however, still declare that the Prot ocols have been \"proved\" to be a forgery. It was natural that the Jews should try to discre dit the Protocols, for their growing fame was focus sing more public attention on other revealing utterances. In Disraeli's The Life of Lord George Bentinck, w ritten in 1852, there occurs this quotation:— \"The influence of the Jews may be traced in the l ast outbreak of the destructive principle in Europe . An insurrection takes place against tradition and aris tocracy, against religion and property. Destruction of the Semitic principle, extirpation of the Jewish religi on, whether in the Mosaic or the Christian form, th e natural equality of men and the abrogation of property are proclaimed by the Secret Societies which form Provi sional Governments and men of Jewish Race are found at the head of every one of them. The people of God co- operate with atheists; the most skilful accumulator s of property ally themselves with Communists; the peculiar and chosen Race touch the hand of all the scum and low castes of Europe; and all this because they wis h to destroy that ungrateful Christendom which owes to t hem even its name, and whose tyranny they can no lo nger endure.\" Max Nordau, a Jew, speaking at the Zionist Congre ss at Basle in August 1903, made this astonishing \"prophesy\":— \"Let me tell you the following words as if I were showing you the rungs of a ladder leading upward a nd upward: Herzl, the Zionist Congress, the English Ug anda proposition, the future world war, the peace conference, where with the help of England a free a nd Jewish Palestine will be created.\" Walter Rathenau, the Jewish banker behind the Kai ser, writing in the German Weiner Frei Presse, Dece mber 24th 1912, said:— \"Three hundred men, each of whom knows all the ot hers, govern the fate of the European continent, an d they elect their successors from their entourage.\" Confirmation of Rathenau's statement came twenty years later in 1931 when Jean Izoulet, a prominent member of the Jewish Alliance Israelite Universelle , wrote in his Paris la Capitale des Religions:— \"The meaning of the history of the last century i s that today 300 Jewish financiers, all Masters of Lodges, rule the world.\" The London Jewish Chronicle, on April 4th, 1919, declared :— \"There is much in the fact of Bolshevism itself, in the fact that so many Jews are Bolshevists, in t he fact that the ideals of Bolshevism at many points are consona nt with the finest ideals of Judaism.\" and on March 15th, 1923, the Jewish World asserted:— \"Fundamentally Judaism is Anti-Christian.\" These and many similar assertions from Jewish sou rces were damaging enough from the Jewish point of view. Taken in conjunction with the Protocols, with which more and more people were becoming familiar, they were damning. The attitude of many people whose concern over th e growing attack on Christian civilisation was rapi dly increasing was summed up by the late Henry Ford sen ior, the founder of the world-famous motor manufacturing company. In an interview published in the New York World on February 17th, 1921, Mr. For d declared: \"The only statement I care to make about the Prot ocols is that they fit in with what is going on. Th ey are sixteen years old, and have fitted the world situat ion up to this time. THEY FIT IT NOW.\""},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" Those who, like Henry Ford, could see that \"they fit it now\" only sixteen years after Nilus's first publication of the Protocols, naturally tended to concentrate thei r attention on the relatively recent phenomenon of Bolshevism. Few of them then understood the equally dangerous, if more insidious, danger of internatio nalism. Now, however, more than half a century after Nilu s's publication of the Protocols, the reality of th at danger must be crystal clear to anybody who views the worl d situation objectively. The Protocols are full of references to a \"super- Government\". Protocol VI, for example, states:— \"In every possible way we must develop the signif icance of our super-Government by representing it a s the Protector and Benefactor of all those who voluntari ly submit to us.\" That is exactly the way in which the United Natio ns organisation, set up at the end of the second Wo rld War, is represented to those who voluntarily submit to i t. It is exactly the way the various United Nations special agencies—U.N.E.S.C.O. (U.N. Educational, Sc ientific and Cultural Organisation); I.L.O. (International L abour Organisation); W.H.O. (World Health Organisat ion); F.A.O. (Food and Agriculture Organisation); Commiss ion on Human Rights; Genocide Convention, etc.—are represented. For some years there has been in existence an int ernational organisation calling itself the World As sociation of Parliamentarians for World Government, which pursue s the same objective as that of another long-establ ished international organisation, Federal Union. This bod y does not disguise the fact that the United Nation s, by means of a few relatively minor changes in its Char ter, could be transformed virtually overnight into a World Government. There has long been agitation for the creation of a World Police Force. This would enable the United Nations super-Government to function as the master of an al l-powerful World Police State, and the closing year s of the 1950'.? have seen the agitators for a World Police Force come close to achieving their objective. The U.N. Emergency Force, established after the Suez crisis of 1956, has been openly regarded as a \"pilot schem e\". Should the few changes in the Charter necessary t o transform the U.N. into a super-Government be mad e, it will have in the special agencies ready made Minist ries of Education (or Propaganda), Labour, Health, Food and Agriculture, \"Justice\" etc. Can it be an accident that these things are so ac curately fore-shadowed in the Protocols? The full-scale World super-Government is not the only, nor perhaps the most immediate, danger. It is obvious to everyone that the nations of the East are being herded into subjection under the dominance of the S oviet Union. But what of the nations of the West? Are the y really the \"free nations\" which they are popularl y supposed to be? Far from it! They are being herded into the same sort of pen as are the nations of the East under Communism—and often on the pretext that this is the only way in which they can save themselves from Communism. Late in 1957, the process had gone far e nough to be given an official name. That name was t he \"policy of inter-dependence\". The nations of the West are being brought under i nternational control at political, military and eco nomic levels. They are rapidly in process of becoming con trolled also on the social level. All alike are bei ng told that their only hope lies in the surrender of national s overeignty. National Parliaments must give way to such bodies as the Council of Europe or the Atlantic Council. National Forces must be submerged in such bodies as the Nort h Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.), the Bagh dad Pact or the South-East Asia Treaty Organisation (S. E.A.T.O.), so that no nation has control over its o wn means of defence. National economies must be submerged in such bodies as the Organisation for European Econo mic"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Co-operation (O.E.E.C.), the European Payments Unio n (E.P.U.) or the World Bank, so that no nation may control its own economic destiny. Even on the social level, individual national dis tinctions must disappear. For example, under the \"C ommon Market\" Treaty which unites six European nations on the economic plane, provision is made for the \"equalisation of social policies\". And strenuous ef forts have been made to herd other European nations , Great Britain among them, into this same pen in the assoc iated European Free Trade Area. In 1934, when the leader of the British Labour Pa rty (Mr. Clement Attlee) told the party's annual conference:— \"We are deliberately putting loyalty to a world o rder above loyalty to our own country\", he was wide ly execrated. Twenty-three years of propaganda, however, leave their mark, and when, in 1957, a Conservative Prime Minister of Britain told the British people that th ey must surrender some of their national sovereigni ty to an unknown international cabal, scarcely a voice was r aised in protest. At the close of 1957 there was an official declaration of the British Government's support for the plan which was foreshadowed in the Protocols o ver sixty years ago. The Earl of Gosford, Joint Parliam entary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs , said in the House of Lords on 7th November, 1957:— \"Her Majesty's Government are fully in agreement with World Government. We agree that this must be t he goal, and that every step that is humanly possible must be taken to reach that goal.\" All over the world, \"federation\", \"integration\", \"regionali-sation\" and \"inter-dependence\" are the o rder of the day. All this is foreshadowed in the Protocols, pub lished more than half-a-century ago by Sergyei Nilu s, which, we are told, are a forgery. Can all this be coincidence? Could any forger be so prescient? Or are the Protocols what Nilus and many others b elieved them to be—the blueprint of a conspiracy to destroy Christian civilisation and place the whole world un der the domination of a small, select cabal ? NOTES I — \"AGENTUR\" and \"The Political\" There are two words in this translation which are unusual, the words \"Agentur\" and \"political\" used as substantives. \"Agentur\" appears to be adopted from the original text and it means the whole body of ag ents and agencies directed by the Elders, whether members of the tribe or their Gentile tools. By \"the Political\" Mr. Marsden means, not exactly the \"body politic\" but the entire machinery of pol itics. II—The Symbolic Snake of Judaism Protocol III opens with a reference to the Symbol ic Snake of Judaism. In his Epilogue to the 1905 Ed ition of the Protocols Nilus gives the following interesting account of this symbol:— According to the records of secret Jewish Zionism , Solomon and other Jewish learned men had already, in 929 B.C., thought out a theoretical scheme for the peac eful conquest of the whole universe by Zion. As the course of history unfolded, this scheme wa s elaborated in detail and completed by later gener ations of men who had been initiated into their secrets. Thes e learned men decided by peaceful means to conquer the world for Zion with the slyness of the Symbolic Sna ke, whose head was to represent those who have been initiated into the plans of the Jewish administrati on, and the body of the Snake to represent the Jewi sh people— the administration was always kept secret, even fro m the Jewish nation itself. As this Snake penetrate d into the"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"hearts of the nations which it encountered it under mined and devoured all the non-Jewish power of thes e States. It is foretold that the Snake has still to finish i ts work, strictly adhering to the designed plan, un til the course which it has to run is closed by the return of its head to Zion and until, by this means, the Snake ha s completed its round of Europe and has encircled it—and until, by dint of enchaining Europe, it has encompassed t he whole world. This it is to accomplish by using every ende avour to subdue the other countries by economic con quest. The return of the head of the snake to Zion can o nly be accomplished after the power of all the Sove reigns of Europe has been laid low, that is to say, when by m eans of economic crises and wholesale destruction e ffected everywhere, there shall have been brought about spi ritual demoralisation and moral corruption, chiefly with the assistance of Jewish women masquerading as French, Italians, etc. Their example is the surest method o f encouraging licentiousness among the leaders of the nations. A map of the course of the Symbolic Snake is show n as follows:—Its first stage in Europe was in 429 B.C. in Greece, where, about the time of Pericles, the Snak e first started eating into the power of that count ry. The second stage was in Rome in the time of Augustus, a bout 69 B.C. The third in Madrid in the time of Cha rles V, in A.D. 1552. The fourth in Paris about 1790, in th e time of Louis XVI. The fifth in London from 1841 onwards (after the downfall of Napoleon). The sixth in Berl in in 1871 after the Franco-Prussian war. The seven th in St. Petersburg, over which is drawn the head of the Sna ke under the date of 1881. All these states which the Snake traversed have h ad the foundations of their constitutions shaken, G ermany, with its apparent power, forming no exception to th e rule. In economic conditions England and Germany are spared, but only till the conquest of Russia is acc omplished by the Snake, on which at present (i.e., 1905) all its efforts are concentrated. The further course of the Snake is not shown on this map, but arrows indicat e its next movement towards Moscow, Kieff and Odessa. It is now well known to us to what extent the lat ter cities form the centres of the militant Jewish race. Constantinople is shown as the last stage of the Sn ake's course before it reaches Jerusalem. (This map was drawn years before the occurrence of the \"Young Tur k\"—i.e., Jewish— Revolution in Turkey). III—The term GOYIM The term \"Goyim\", meaning Gentiles or non-Jews, i s used throughout the Protocols and is retained by Mr. Marsden. PROTOCOL 1 THE BASIC DOCTRINE Right lies in Might—Politics versus Morals—The En d justifies the Means —\"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\"—The New Aristocracy. Putting aside fine phrases we shall speak of the significance of each thought: by comparison and ded uction we shall throw light upon surrounding facts. What I am about to set forth, then, is our system from the two points of view, that of ourselves and that of the goyim (i.e., non-Jews). It must be noted that men with bad instincts outn umber good men, and therefore the best results in g overning them are attained by violence and terrorisation, an d not by academic discussions. Every man aims at po wer, everyone would like to become a dictator if only he could, and rare indeed are the men who would not b e willing to sacrifice the welfare of all for the sak e of securing their own welfare. What has restrained the beasts of prey who are ca lled men? What has served for their guidance hither to? At the dawn of society they were subjected to bru tal and blind force; afterwards—to Law which is the same force, only disguised. I draw the conclusion that b y the law of nature right lies in force."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" Political freedom is an idea but not a fact, and one must know how to use it as a bait whenever it a ppears necessary to attract the masses of the people to on e's party for the purpose of crushing another who i s in authority. This task is rendered easier if the oppo nent has himself been infected with the idea of fre edom, so- called liberalism, and for the sake of an idea, is willing to yield some of his power. It is precisely here that the triumph of our theory appears; the slackened reins of government are immediately, by the law of life, caught up and gathered together by a new hand, because the bl ind might of the nation cannot for one single day e xist without guidance, and the new authority merely fits into the place of the old already weakened by libe ralism. In our day the power which has replaced that of t he rulers who were liberal is the power of Gold. Ti me was when Faith ruled. Freedom is an impossible ideal to achieve because no one knows how to use it with moderation. It is enough to hand over a people to s elf-government for a certain length of time for tha t people to be turned into a disorganised mob. Thereafter there arises internecine strife, which soon devolves int o class warfare, in the midst of which States burn down and their importance is reduced to that of a heap of a shes. Whether a State exhausts itself in its own convul sions, whether its internal discord brings it under the power of external foes—in any case it can be accounted irret rievably lost: it is in our power. The despotism of Capital, which is entirely in our hands, reaches out to it a straw that the State, willy-nilly, must take hold of: if not—it goes to the bottom. Should anyone of a liberal mind say that such ref lections as the above are immoral I would put the f ollowing questions :—If every State has two foes and if in r egard to the external foe it is allowed and not con sidered immoral to use every manner and art of conflict, as for example to keep the enemy in ignorance of plan s of attack and defence, to attack him by night or in su perior numbers, then in what way can the same means in regard to a worse foe, the destroyer of the structu re of society and the commonweal, be called immoral and not permissible? Is it possible for any sound logical mind to hope with any success to guide crowds by the aid of rea sonable counsels and arguments, when any objection or contr adiction, senseless though it may be, can be made, and when such objection may find more favour with the p eople, whose powers of reasoning are superficial? M en in masses and the men of the masses, being guided sole ly by petty passions, paltry beliefs, customs, trad itions and sentimental theorism, fall a prey to party dissensi on, which hinders any kind of agreement even on the basis of a perfectly reasonable argument. Every resolution o f a crowd depends upon a chance or packed majority, which, in its ignorance of political secrets, puts forth some ridiculous resolution that lays in the administration a seed of anarchy. The political has nothing in common with the mora l. The ruler who is governed by the moral is not a skilled politician, and is therefore unstable on his throne . He who wishes to rule must have recourse both to cunning and to make-believe. Great national qualities, like frankness and honesty, are vices in politics, for they bring down rulers from their thrones more effectively and more certainly than the most powerful enemy. Such qualities must be the attributes of the kingdoms of the goyim, but we must in no wise be guided by the m. Our right lies in force. The word \"right\" is an a bstract thought and proved by nothing. The word mea ns no more than:—Give me what I want in order that thereb y I may have proof that I am stronger than you. Where does right begin? Where does it end? In any State where central authority is weak, and where laws and rulers have lost their personality amid the flood of rights ever multiplying out of liberalism, I find a new right—to attack by the right of the s trong, and to scatter to the winds all existing forces of order a nd regulation, to reconstruct all institutions and to become the sovereign lord of those who have left to us the rig hts of their power by laying them down voluntarily in their liberalism. Our power in the present tottering condition of a ll forms of power will be more invincible than any other, because it will remain invisible until the moment w hen it has gained such strength that no cunning can any longer undermine it."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" Out of the temporary evil we are now compelled to commit will emerge the good of an unshakeable rule , which will restore the regular course of the machin ery of the national life, brought to nought by libe ralism. The result justifies the means. Let us, however, in our plans, direct our attention not so much to what is good and moral as to what is necessary and useful. Before us is a strategic plan from which we canno t deviate without running the risk of seeing the la bour of many centuries brought to naught. In order to elaborate satisfactory forms of actio n it is necessary to have regard to the rascality, the slackness, the instability of the mob, its lack of capacity to understand and respect the conditions of its own l ife, or its own welfare. It must be understood that the might of a mob is blind, senseless and unreasoning force, ever at the mercy of a suggestion from any side. The blind cann ot lead the blind without bringing them into the ab yss; consequently members of the mob, upstarts from the people even though they may have a genius for wisdo m, yet having no understanding of the political, canno t come forward as leaders of the mob without bringi ng the whole nation to ruin. Only one trained from childhood for independent r ule can understand the meaning of the words that ca n be constructed from the political alphabet. A people left to itself, that is, to upstarts fro m its midst, brings itself to ruin by party dissens ions excited by the pursuit of power and honours and disorders arising therefrom. Is it possible for the masses of the peo ple calmly and without petty jealousies to form judgements, to deal with the affairs of the country, which cannot be mixed up with personal interests? Can they defend themsel ves from an external foe? It is unthinkable, for a plan broken up into as many parts as there are heads in the mob loses all homogeneity, and thereby becomes unintelligible and impossible to execute. It is only with a despotic ruler that plans can b e elaborated extensively and clearly in such a way as to distribute the whole properly among the several par ts of the machinery of the State: from this the con clusion is inevitable that a satisfactory form of government f or any country is one that is concentrated in the h ands of one responsible person. Without an absolute despotism t here can be no existence for civilisation which is carried on not by the masses but by their guide, whosoever tha t person may be. The mob is a savage and displays i ts savagery at every opportunity. The moment the mob s eizes freedom in its hands it quickly turns to anar chy, which in itself is the highest degree of savagery. Behold the alcoholised animals, bemused with drin k, which freedom permits them to consume to excess. It is not for us and ours to walk that road. The peoples of the goyim are bemused with alcoholic liquors; th eir youth has grown stupid on classicism and from early immor ality, into which it has been inducted by our speci al agents—by tutors, lackeys, governesses in the house s of the wealthy, by clerks and others, by our wome n in the places of dissipation frequented by the goyim. Amon g the latter I also include the so-called \"society ladies,\" voluntary followers of the others in corruption and luxury. Our countersign is—Force and Make-believe. Only f orce conquers in political affairs, especially if i t be concealed in the talents essential to statesmen. Vi olence must be the principle, and cunning and make- believe the rule for governments which do not want to lay d own their crowns at the feet of agents of some new power. This evil is the one and only means to attain the e nd, the good. Therefore we must not stop at bribery , deceit and treachery when they should serve towards the at tainment of our end. In politics one must know how to seize the property of others without hesitation if by it we secure submission and sovereignty. Our State, marching along the path of peaceful co nquest, has the right to replace the horrors of war by less noticeable and more satisfactory sentences of death , necessary to maintain the terror which tends to p roduce blind submission. Just but merciless severity is th e greatest factor of strength in the State: not onl y for the sake of gain but also in the name of duty, for the sake of victory, we must keep to the programme of violen ce and make-believe. The doctrine of squaring accounts is precisely as strong as the means of which it makes use. Therefore it is not so much by the means themselves as by the doctrine of severity that we shall trium ph and bring all governments into subjection to our super- government. It is enough for them to know that we a re merciless for all disobedience to cease."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" Far back in ancient times we were the first to cr y among the masses of the people the words \"Liberty , Equality, Fraternity,\" words many times repeated si nce those days by stupid poll-parrots who from all sides round flew down upon these baits and with them carr ied away the well-being of the world, true freedom of the individual, formerly so well guarded against the pr essure of the mob. The would-be wise men of the goy im, the intellectuals, could not fathom these abstract word s; did not note the contradiction of their meaning and interrelation; did not see that in nature there is no equality, cannot be freedom: that Nature herself has established inequality of minds, of characters, and capacities, just as immutably as she has establish ed subordination to her laws: never stopped to think t hat the mob is a blind thing, that upstarts elected from among it to bear rule are, in regard to the political, th e same blind men as the mob itself, that the adept, though he be a fool, can yet rule, whereas the non-adept, even if he were a genius, understands nothing in the politi cal—to all these things the goyim paid no regard; yet all the time dynastic rule rested upon these tenets: for th e father passed on to the son a knowledge of the course of p olitical affairs in such wise that none should know it but members of the dynasty and none could betray it to the governed. As time went on the meaning of the dy nastic transference of the true position of affairs in the political was lost, and this aided the success of our cause. In all corners of the earth the words \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\" brought to our ranks, thanks to our blind agents, whole legions who bore our banners with ent husiasm. And all the time these words were canker-w orms at work boring into the well-being of the goyim, pu tting an end everywhere to peace, quiet, solidarity and destroying all the foundations of the goya States. As you will see later, this helped us to our triump h: it enabled us to grasp, among other things, the master card—th e destruction of the privileges, or in other words of the very existence of the aristocracy of the goyim, that cla ss which was the only defence peoples and countries had against us. On the ruins of the natural and genealo gical aristocracy of the goyim we have set up the a ristocracy of our educated class headed by the aristocracy of money. The qualifications for this aristocracy we h ave established in wealth, which is dependent upon us, and in knowledge, for which our learned elders prov ide the motive force. Our triumph has been rendered easier by the fact that in our relations with the men whom we wanted w e have always worked upon the most sensitive chords of the human mind, upon the cash account, upon the cupidi ty, upon the insatiability for material needs of man; a nd each one of these human weaknesses, taken alone, is sufficient to paralyse initiative, for it hands ove r the will of men to the disposition of him who has bought their activities. The abstraction of freedom has enabled us to pers uade the mob in all countries that their government is nothing but the steward of the people who are the o wners of the country, and that the steward may be r eplaced like a worn-out glove. It is this possibility of replacing the represent atives of the people which has placed them at our d isposal, and, as it were, given us the power of appointment. PROTOCOL 2 ECONOMIC WARS Routine scientific government—Darwinism, Marxism , Nietzcheism—Press-inculcated mentality. It is indispensable for our purposes that wars, a s far as assible, should not result in territorial gains: war will urns be brought on to the economic ground, where th e nations will not fail to perceive in the assistan ce we give the strength of our predominance, and this state of things will put both sides at the mercy of our int ernational agentur, which possesses millions of eyes ever on t he watch and unhampered by any limitations whatsoev er. Our international rights will then wipe out nationa l rights, in the proper sense of right, and will ru le the nations precisely as the civil law of States rules the rela tions of their subjects among themselves. The admin istrators, whom we shall choose from among the public with str ict regard to their capacities for servile obedienc e, will not be persons trained in the arts of government an d will therefore easily become pawns in our game in the hands of men of learning and genius, who will be th eir advisers, specialists bred and reared from earl y childhood to rule the affairs of the whole world. A s is well known to you, these specialists of ours h ave been drawing the information they need to fit them for r ule from our political plans, from the lessons of h istory, from"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"observations made of the events of every moment as it passes. The goyim are not guided by practical us e of unprejudiced historical observation, but by theoret ical routine without any critical regard for conseq uent results. We need not, therefore, take any account of them—le t them amuse themselves until the hour strikes, or live on hopes of new forms of enterprising pastime, or on t he memories of all they have enjoyed. For them, let that play the principal part which we have persuaded them to accept as the dictates of science (theory). It is w ith this object in view that we are constantly, by means of our press, arousing a blind confidence in these the ories. The intellectuals of the goyim will puff themselves up with their knowledge and without any logical verifi cation will put into effect all the information available from science, which our agentur specialists have cu nningly pieced together for the purpose of educating their minds in the direction we want. Do not suppose for a moment that these statements are empty words: think carefully of the successes we arranged for Darwinism, Marxism, Nietzcheism. To us Jews, at any rate, it should be plain to see what a disintegrating effect these directives have had upo n the minds of the goyim. It is indispensable for us to take account of the thoughts, characters, tendencies of the nations in order to avoid making slips in the political and in the direction of administrative affairs. The triumph of our syste m, and of the machinery of which it is composed, which may vary a ccording to the temperament of the peoples we encou nter, will not be assured unless its practical applicatio n is based upon a resume of the lessons of the past in the light of the present. In the hands of the States of to-day there is a g reat force that creates the movement of thought in the people, and that is the Press. The part played by the Press is to keep pointing out requirements supposed to b e indispensable, to give voice to the complaints of t he people, to express and to create discontent. It is in the Press that the triumph of freedom of speech finds its inc arnation. But the goyim States have not known how t o make use of this force; and it has fallen into our hands . Through the Press we have gained the power to inf luence while remaining ourselves in the shade; thanks to t he Press we have got the gold in our hands, notwith standing that we have had to gather it out of oceans of bloo d and tears. But it has paid us, though we have sac rificed many of our people. Each victim on our side is wort h in the sight of God a thousand goyim. PROTOCOL 3 METHODS OF CONQUEST The Symbolic Snake—\"People's Rights\"—Liquidation of the Goyim—\"Sovereign Lord of the World\"— Universal economic crisis—\"Ours they will not touch ...\"—Secret Masonic agents. Today I may tell you that our goal is now only a few steps off. There remains but a small space to c ross of the long path we have trodden before the cycle of the S ymbolic Snake, by which we symbolise our people, wi ll be completed. When this ring closes, all the States of Europe will be locked in its coil as in a powerful vice. The constitutional scales of these days will shor tly break down, for we have established them with a certain lack of accurate balance in order that they may osc illate incessantly until they wear through the pivo t on which they turn. The goyim are under the impression that they have welded them sufficiently strong and they have all along kept on expecting that the scales would come into equilibrium. But the pivots—the kings onJtheir thrones—are hemmed in by their representatives, who play the fool, distraught with their own uncontrol led and irresponsible power. This power they owe to the ter ror which has been breathed into the palaces. As th ey have lost contact with their people, the kings on their thrones are no longer able to come to terms with th em and so strengthen themselves against seekers after power. We have made a gulf between the far-seeing Sovereig n Power and the blind force of the people so that bot h have lost all meaning, for like the blind man and his stick, both are powerless apart. In order to incite seekers after power to abuse i t we have set all forces in opposition one to anoth er, breaking up their liberal tendencies towards independence. T o this end we have stirred up every form of enterpr ise, we have armed all parties, we have set up authority as a target for every ambition.

Republican rights for a poor man are no more than a bitter piece of irony, for since he is obliged to toil alm ost all day, on the one hand, he is unable to use t hem, and on the other, they rob him of all guarantee of regular and certain earnings by making him dependent on st rikes by his comrades or lockouts by his masters. The people under our guidance have annihilated the aristocracy, who were their one and only defence an d foster-mother for the sake of their own advantage w hich is inseparably bound up with the well-being of the people. Nowadays, with the destruction of the arist ocracy, the people have fallen into the grips of me rciless money-grinding scoundrels who have laid a pitiless and cruel yoke upon the necks of the workers. We appear on the scene as the alleged saviours of the worker from this oppression and we suggest tha t he should enter the ranks of our fighting forces—Socia lists, Anarchists, Communists—to whom we always giv e support in accordance with an alleged brotherly rul e (of the solidarity of all humanity) of our social masonry. The aristocracy, which enjoyed by law the labour of the workers, was interested in seeing that the wor kers were well fed, healthy and strong. We are interested in just the opposite—in the diminution, the killing ou t of the goyim. Our power is in the chronic shortness of foo d and physical weakness of the worker because by al l that this implies he is made the slave of our will, and he will not find in his own authorities either stre ngth or energy to set against our will. Hunger gives capital the r ight to rule the worker more surely than it was giv en to the aristocracy by the legal authority of kings. By want and the envy and hatred which it engender s we shall move the mobs and with their hands we sh all wipe out all those who hinder us on our way. When the hour strikes for our Sovereign Lord of a ll the World to be crowned it is these same hands w hich will sweep away everything that might be a hindrance the reto. The goyim have lost the habit of thinking unless prompted by the suggestions of our specialists. The refore they do not see the urgent necessity of what we, wh en our kingdom comes, shall adopt at once, namely t his, that it is essential to reach in national schools one si mple, true piece of knowledge, the basis of all kno wledge—the knowledge of the structure of human life, of social existence, which requires division of labour, and, consequently, the division of men into classes and conditions. It is essential for all to know that ow ing to difference in the objects of human activity there c annot be any equality, that he who by any act of hi s own compromises a whole class cannot be equally respons ible before the law with him who affects no one but only his own honour. The true knowledge of the structure of society, into the secrets of which we do not ad mit the goyim, would demonstrate to all men that position a nd work must be kept within a certain circle, that they may not become a source of human suffering, arising fro m an education which does not correspond with the w ork which individuals are called upon to do. After a th orough study of this knowledge the people will volu ntarily submit to authority and accept such position as is appointed them in the State. In the present state o f knowledge and the direction we have given to its development the people, blindly believing things in print, cher ishes— thanks to promptings intended to mislead and to its own ignorance—a blind hatred towards all condition s which it considers above itself, for it has no understand ing of the meaning of class and condition."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" This hatred will be still further magnified by th e effects of an economic crisis, which will stop de alings on the exchanges and bring industry to a standstill. We sh all create by all the secret subterranean methods o pen to us and with the aid of gold, which is all hi our hands , a universal economic crisis whereby we shall simu ltaneously throw upon the streets whole mobs of workers in all the countries of Europe. These mobs will rush deli ghtedly to shed the blood of those whom, in the simplicity of their ignorance, they have envied from their cra dles, and whose property they will then be able to loot. Ours they will not touch, because the moment of a ttack will be known to us and we shall take measure s to protect our own. We have demonstrated that progress will bring all the goyim to the sovereignty of reason. Our despot ism will be precisely that; for it will know how to pacify a ll unrest by wise severities, to cauterise liberali sm out of all institutions. When the populace has seen that all sorts of con cessions and indulgences are yielded it in the name of freedom, imagining itself to be sovereign lord it h as stormed its way to power, but, naturally, like e very other blind man, it has come upon a host of stumbling blo cks, it has rushed to find a guide, it has never ha d the sense to return to the former state and it has laid down its plenipotentiary powers at our feet. Remember th e French Revolution, to which it was we who gave the name of \"Great\": the secrets of its preparations are well known to us for it was wholly the work of our hands. Ever since that time we have been leading the peo ples from one disenchantment to another, so that in the end they should turn also from us in favour of that Kin g-Despot of the blood of Zion, whom we are preparin g for the world. At the present day we are, as an international fo rce, invincible, because if attacked by some we are supported by other States. It is the bottomless rascality of the goyim peoples, who crawl on their bellies to fo rce, but are merciless towards weakness, unsparing to faults and indulgent to crimes, unwilling to bear the contrad ictions of a free social system but patient unto martyrdom und er the violence of a bold despotism—it is those qua lities which are aiding us to independence. From the premi er-dictators of the present day the goyim peoples s uffer patiently and bear abuses for the least of which th ey would have beheaded twenty kings. What is the explanation of this phenomenon, this curious inconsequence of the masses of the peoples in their attitude towards what would appear to be events of the same order? It is explained by the fact that these dictators whisper to the peoples through their agents that th rough these abuses they are inflicting injury on the States wit h the highest purpose—to secure the welfare of the peoples, the international brotherhood of them all, their so lidarity and equality of rights. Naturally they do not tell the peoples that this unification must be ccomplished o nly under our sovereign rule. And thus the people condemn the upright and acqui t the guilty, persuaded ever more and more that it can do whatsoever it wishes. Thanks to this state of thing s the people are destroying every kind of stability and creating disorders at every step. The word \"freedom\" brings out the communities of men to fight against every kind of force, against e very kind of authority, even against God and the laws of nature. For this reason we, when we come into our kingdom, shall have to erase this word from the lex icon of life as implying a principle of brute force which turns mobs into bloodthirsty beasts. These beasts, it is true, fall asleep again every t ime when they have drunk their fill of blood, and a t such times can easily be riveted into their chains. But if the y be not given blood they will not sleep but contin ue to struggle. PROTOCOL 4 MATERIALISM REPLACES RELIGION"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" Stages of a Republic—Gentile masonry a screen—Int ernational speculation in industry—Cult of Gold. Every republic passes through several stages. The first of these is comprised in the early days of m ad raging by the blind mob, tossed hither and thither, right and left: the second is demagogy from which is born anarchy, and that leads inevitably to despotism—not any long er legal and overt, and therefore responsible, desp otism, but unseen and secretly hidden, yet nevertheless se nsibly felt despotism in the hands of some secret organisation or other, whose acts are the more unsc rupulous in as much as it works behind a screen, be hind the backs of all sorts of agents, to change whom not on ly does not injuriously affect but actually aids th e secret force by saving it, thanks to continual changes, fr om the necessity of expending its resources on rewa rding long services. Who and what is in a position to overthrow an inv isible force? And this is precisely what our force is. Gentile masonry blindly serves as a screen for us and our o bjects, but the plan of action of our force, even i ts very abiding-place, remains for the whole people an unkn own mystery. But even freedom might be harmless and have its p lace in the State economy without injury to the wel l-being of the peoples if it rested upon the foundation of faith in God, upon the brotherhood of humanity, unc onnected with the conception of equality, which is negatived by the very laws of creation, for they have establ ished subordination. With such a faith as this a people m ight be governed by a wardship of parishes, and wou ld walk contentedly and humbly under the guiding hand of its spiritual pastor submitting to the dispositions of God upon earth. This is the reason why it is indispensable for us to undermine all faith, to tear out of the minds of the goyim the very prin ciple of Godhead and the spirit, and to put in its place ari thmetical calculations and material needs. In order to give the goyim no time to think and t ake note, their minds must be diverted towards indu stry and trade. Thus, all the nations will be swallowed up i n pursuit of gain and in the race for it will not t ake note of their common foe. But again, in order that freedom may once for all disintegrate and ruin the communit ies of the goyim, we must put industry on a speculative ba sis: as a result, what is withdrawn from the land b y industry will slip through their hands and pass into specula tion, that is, to our classes. The intensified struggle for superiority and shoc ks delivered to economic life will create, nay, hav e already created, disenchanted, cold and heartless communiti es. Such communities will foster a strong aversion towards the higher political and towards religion. Their on ly guide is gain, that is Gold, which they will ere ct into a veritable cult, for the sake of those material deli ghts which it can give. Then will the hour strike w hen, not for the sake of attaining the good, not even to win wea lth, but solely out of hatred towards the privilege d, the lower classes of the goyim will follow our lead against o ur rivals for power, the intellectuals of the goyim . PROTOCOL 5 DESPOTISM & MODERN PROGRESS Centralised Government—Gulfs separating States —Sham eloquence to overcome public opinion—Super- Government Administration. What form of administrative rule can be given to communities in which corruption has penetrated ever ywhere, communities where riches are attained only by the c lever surprise tactics of semi-swindling tricks; wh ere looseness reigns; where morality is maintained by p enal measures and harsh laws but not by voluntarily accepted principles; where the feelings towards fai th and country are obliterated by cosmopolitan conv ictions? What form of rule is to be given to these communiti es if not that despotism which I shall describe to you later? We shall create an intensified centralisation of go vernment in order to grip in our hands all the forc es of the community. We shall regulate mechanically all the a ctions of the political life of our subjects by new laws. These laws will withdraw one by one all the indulge nces and liberties which have been permitted by the goyim, and our kingdom will be distinguished by a despotis m of such magnificent proportions as to be at any m oment and in every place in a position to wipe out any go yim who oppose us by deed or word."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" We shall be told that such a despotism as I speak of is not consistent with the progress of these da ys, but I will prove to you that it is. In the times when the peoples looked upon kings o n their thrones as on a pure manifestation of the w ill of God, they submitted without a murmur to the despoti c power of kings: but from the day when we insinuat ed into their minds the conception of their own rights they began to regard the occupants of thrones as m ere ordinary mortals. The holy unction of the Lord's An nointed has fallen from the heads of kings in the e ye of the people, and when we also robbed them of their faith in God the might of power was flung upon the stree ts into the place of public proprietorship and was seized b y us. Moreover, the art of directing masses and individ uals by means of cleverly manipulated theory and ve rbiage, by regulations of life in common and all sorts of o ther tricks, in all of which the goyim understand n othing, belongs likewise to the specialists of our administ rative brain. Reared on analysis, observation, on d elicacies of fine calculation, in this species of skill we have no rivals, any more than we have in the drawing up of plans of political action and solidarity. In this respect th e Jesuits alone might have compared with us, but we have contrived to discredit them in the eyes of the unth inking mob as an overt organisation, while we ourse lves all the while have kept our secret organisation in the shade. However, it is probably all the same to the world who is its sovereign lord, whether the head of Catholic ism or our despot of the blood of Zion! But to us, the Chosen People, it is very far from being a matter of indif ference. For a time perhaps we might be successfully dealt with by a coalition of the goyim of all the world: but from this danger we are secured by the discord existing among them whose roots are so deeply seated that th ey can never now be plucked up. We have set one against an other the personal and national reckonings of the g oyim, religious and race hatreds, which we have fostered into a huge growth in the course of the past twenty centuries. This is the reason why there is not one State which would anywhere receive support if it were to raise its arm, for every one of them must bear in mind that any ag reement against us would be unprofitable to itself. We are too strong—there is no evading our power. The natio ns cannot come to even an inconsiderable private agreement without our secretly having a hand in it. Per Me reges regnant. \"It is through me that King s reign.\" And it was said by the prophets that we w ere chosen by God Himself to rule over the whole earth. God has endowed us with genius that we may be equa l to our task. Were genius in the opposite camp it would still struggle against us, but even so a newcomer is no match for the old-established settler: the struggle would be merciless between us, such a fight as the world has never yet seen. Aye, and the genius on their side w ould have arrived too late. The wheels of the machi nery of all States are moved by the force of the engine, wh ich is in our hands, and that engine of the machine ry of States is—Gold. The science of political economy in vented by our learned elders has for long past been giving royal prestige to capital. Capital, if it is to co-operate untrammelled, mus t be free to establish a monopoly of industry and t rade: this is already being put in execution by an unseen hand in all quarters of the world. This freedom will give political force to those engaged in industry, and that will h elp to oppress the people. Nowadays it is more impo rtant to disarm the peoples than to lead them into war; more important to use for our advantage the passions wh ich have burst into flames than to quench their fire; more i mportant to catch up and interpret the ideas of oth ers to suit ourselves than to eradicate them. The principal obj ect of our directorate consists in this: to debase the public mind by criticism; to lead it away from serious ref lection calculated to arouse resistance; to distrac t the forces of the mind towards a sham fight of empty eloquence . In all ages the peoples of the world, equally wit h individuals, have accepted words for deeds, for t hey are content with a show and rarely pause to note, in th e public arena, whether promises are followed by performances. Therefore we shall establish show ins titutions which will give eloquent proof of their b enefit to progress. We shall assume the liberal physiognomy of all pa rties, of all directions, and we shall give that ph ysiognomy a voice in orators who will speak so much that they w ill exhaust the patience of their hearers and produ ce an abhorrence of oratory."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" In order to put public opinion into our hands we must bring it into a state of bewilderment by givin g expression from all sides to so many contradictory opinions and for such length of time as will suffic e to make the goyim lose their heads in the labyrinth and com e to see that the best thing is to have no opinion of any kind in matters political, which it is not given to the public to understand, because they are understood o nly by him who guides the public. This is the first secret. The second secret requisite for the success of ou r government is comprised in the following: To mult iply to such an extent national failings, habits, passions, and conditions of civil life, that it will be impo ssible for anyone to know where he is in the resulting chaos, so that the people in consequence will fail to unde rstand one another. This measure will also serve us in another way, namely, to sow discord in all parties, to dis locate all collective forces which are still unwilling to subm it to us, and to discourage any kind of personal in itiative which might in any degree hinder our affair. There is nothing more dangerous to us than personal initi ative: if it has genius behind it, such initiative can do more t han can be done by millions of people among whom we have sown discord. We must so direct the education of th e goyim communities that whenever they come upon a matter requiring initiative they drop their hands i n despairing impotence. The strain which results fr om freedom of action saps the forces when it meets with the fr eedom of another. From this collision arise grave m oral shocks, disenchantments, failures. By all these mea ns we shall so wear down the goyim that they will b e compelled to offer us international power of a natu re that will enable us without any violence gradual ly to absorb all the State forces of the world and to for m a Super-Government. In place of the rulers of to- day we shall set up a bogey which will be called the Super -Government Administration. Its hands will reach ou t in all directions like nippers and its organisation will b e of such colossal dimensions that it cannot fail t o subdue all the nations of the world. PROTOCOL 6 TAKE-OVER TECHNIQUE Reservoirs of riches—Destruction ofgoy aristocrac y—Vicious circle of rising prices. We shall soon begin to establish huge monopolies, reservoirs of colossal riches, upon which even lar ge fortunes of the goyim will depend to such an extent that they will go to the bottom together with the credit of the States on the day after the political smash ... . You gentlemen here present who are economists, ju st imagine the significance of this combination! .. .. In every possible way we must develop the signifi cance of our Super-Government by representing it as the Protector and Benefactor of all those who voluntari ly submit to us. The aristocracy of the goyim as a political force , is dead —we need not take it into account; but as landed proprietors they can still be harmful to us since a s such they are self-sufficient. It is essential th erefore for us at whatever cost to deprive them of their land. This o bject will be best attained by increasing the burde ns upon landed property— in loading lands with debts. These measures will check land-holding and keep it in a state of humble and unconditional submission. The aristocrats of the goyim, being hereditarily incapable of contenting themselves with little, wil l rapidly burn up and fizzle out. At the same time we must intensively patronise tr ade and industry, but, first and foremost, speculat ion, whose part is to provide a counterpoise to industry: the absence of speculative industry will multiply capit al in private hands and will serve to restore agriculture by free ing the land from indebtedness to the land banks. W e want industry to drain off from the land both labour and capital and by means of speculation transfer into our hands all the money of the world, and thereby throw all t he goyim into the ranks of the proletariat. Then th e goyim will bow down before us, if for no other reason but to get the right to exist. To completely ruin the industry of the goyim we shall bring to the assistance of speculation the lu xury which we have developed among the goyim, that greedy dema nd for luxury which is swallowing up everything. We"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"shall raise the rate of wages which, however, will not bring any advantage to the workers, for, at the same time, we shall produce a rise in prices of the first nece ssaries of life alleging that it arises from the de cline of agriculture and cattle-breeding; we shall further u ndermine sources of production, artfully and deeply by accustoming the workers to anarchy and to drunkenne ss, and side by side therewith taking all measures to extirpate from the face of the earth all the educat ed forces of the goyim. In order that the true meaning of things may not strike the goyim before the proper time we shall ma sk it under an alleged ardent desire to serve the working class es and the great principles of political economy ab out which our economic theories are carrying on an energetic propaganda. PROTOCOL 7 WORLD-WIDE WARS Encouraging an arms race—Universal war to check g oy opposition—The guns of America, China and Japan. The intensification of armaments, the increase of police forces—are all essential for the completion of the aforementioned plans. We desire that there should b e in all the States of the world, besides ourselves , only the masses of the proletariat, a few millionaires devot ed to our interests, police and soldiers. Throughout all Europe, and by means of relations with Europe, in other continents also, we must crea te ferments, discords, and hostility. Therein we gain a double advantage. In the first place we keep in c heck all countries, for they well know that we have the powe r whenever we like to create disorders or to restor e order. All these countries are accustomed to see in us an indispensable force of coercion. In the second plac e, by our intrigues we shall tangle up all the threads which we have woven into the cabinets of all States by me ans of the political, by economic treaties, or loan obligation s. In order to succeed in this we must use great cu nning and penetration during negotiations and agreements, but , as regards what is called the \"official language, \" we shall keep to opposite tactics and assume the mask of hon esty and compliancy. In this way the peoples and governments of the goyim, whom we have taught to lo ok only at the outside of whatever we present to th eir notice, will still continue to accept us as the ben efactors and saviours of the human race. We must be in a position to respond to every act of opposition by war with the neighbours of that co untry which dares to oppose us: but if these neighbours s hould also venture to stand collectively together a gainst us, then we must offer resistance by a universal war. The principal factor of success in the political is the secrecy of its undertakings: the word should not agree with the deeds of the diplomat. We must compel the government of the goyim to tak e action in the direction favoured by our widely- conceived plan, already approaching the desired con summation, by what we shall represent as public opi nion, secretly prompted by us through the means of that s o-called \"Great Power\"— the Press, which with a few exceptions that may be disregarded, is already enti rely in our hands. In a word, to sum up our system of keeping the go vernments of the goyim in Europe in check, we shall show our strength to one of them by terrorist attempts a nd to all, if we allow the possibility of a general rising against us, we shall respond with the guns of America or Ch ina or Japan. PROTOCOL 8 PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT Legal justification for audacity—Super-educationa l training— Control of bankers, industrialists and capitalists. We must arm ourselves with all the weapons which our opponents might employ against us. We must sear ch out the very finest shades of expression and knotty points in the Lexicon of legal justification for t hose cases"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"where we shall have to pronounce judgments that mig ht appear abnormally audacious and unjust, for it i s important that these resolutions should be set fort h in expressions that shall seem to be the most exa lted moral principles cast into legal form.

It will surround itself with publicists, practical jurists, administrators , diplomats and finally, with persons prepared by a special super-e ducational training in our special schools. These p ersons will have cognizance of all the secrets of the social st ructure, they will know all the languages that can be made up by political alphabets and words; they will be made acquainted with the whole underside of human natur e, with all its sensitive chords on which they will have to play. These chords are the cast of mind of the goy im, their tendencies, shortcomings, vices and qualities, the particularities of classes and conditions. Needless to say that the talented assistants of authority, of whom I spe ak, will not be taken from among the goyim, who are accustomed to perform their administrative work wit hout giving themselves the trouble to think what it s aim is, and never consider what it is needed for. The admin istrators of the goyim sign papers without reading them, and they serve either for mercenary reasons or for ambi tion. We shall surround our government with a whole wor ld of economists. That is the reason why economic sciences form the principal subject of the teaching given to the Jews. Around us again will be a whole constellation of bankers, industrialists, capitalis ts and—the main thing—millionaires, because in subs tance everything will be settled by the question of figur es. For a time, until there will no longer be any ris k in entrusting responsible posts in our States to our brother- Jews, we shall put them in the hands of persons who se past and reputation are such that between them a nd the people lies an abyss, persons who, if they disobey our instructions, must face criminal charges or dis appear— this in order to make them defend our interests to their last gasp. PROTOCOL 9 RE-EDUCATION Meaning of anti-semitism—Source of the all-engulf ing terror, Boosting of false theories. In applying our principles let attention be paid to the character of the people in whose country you live and act: a general, identical application of them, unti l such time as the people shall have been re-educat ed to our pattern, cannot succeed. But by approaching their a pplication cautiously you will see that not a decad e will pass before the most stubborn character will change and we shall add a new people to the ranks of those alr eady subdued by us. The words of the liberal, which are in effect the words of our masonic watchword, namely, \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,\" will, when we come into our kingdom, b e changed by us into words no longer a watchword, b ut only an expression of idealism, namely, into: \"The right of liberty, the duty of equality, the ideal o f brotherhood.\" That is how we shall put it—and so we shall catch the bull by the horns . . . . De facto we have already wiped out every kind of rule except our own , although de jure there still remain a good many o f them. Nowadays, if any States raise a protest against us it is only pro forma at our discretion, and by our direction, for their anti-Semitism is indispensable to us for the management of our lesser brethren. I will not enter into further explanations, for this matter has formed the subjec t of repeated discussion amongst us. For us there are no checks to limit the range of our activity. Our Super-Government subsists in extr a-legal conditions which are described in the accepted term inology by the energetic and forcible word—Dictator ship. I am in a position to tell you with a clear conscienc e that at the proper time we, the law-givers, shall execute judgment and sentence, we shall slay and we shall s pare; we, as head of all our troops, are mounted on the steed of the leader. We rule by force of will, because in our hands are the fragments of a once powerful par ty, now vanquished by us. And the weapons in our hands are limitless ambition, burning greediness, merciless vengeance, hatred and malice. It is from us that the all-engulfing terror proce eds. We have in our service persons of all opinions , of all doctrines, restoring monarchists, demagogues, socia lists, communists, and Utopian dreamers of every ki nd. We have harnessed them all to the task: each one of th em on his own account is boring away at the last re mnants of"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"authority, is striving to overthrow all established forms of order. By these acts all states are in to rture; they exhort to tranquillity, they are ready to sacrifice everything for peace: but we will not give them pe ace until they openly acknowledge our international Super-Gov ernment, and with submissiveness. The people have raised a howl about the necessity of settling the question of Socialism by way of an international agreement. Division into fractional p arties has given them into our hands, for, in order to carry on a contested struggle, one must have money, and the money is all in our hands. We might have reason to apprehend a union between the \"clear-sighted\" force of the goy kings on thei r thrones and the \"blind\" force of the goy mobs, but we have taken all needful measure against any such possibility: between the one and the other force we have erected a bulwark in the shape of a mutual te rror between them. In this way the blind force of the pe ople remains our support and we, and we only, shall provide them with a leader and, of course, direct them alon g the road that leads to our goal. In order that the hand of the blind mob may not f ree itself from our guiding hand, we must every now and then enter into close communion with it, if not actually in person, at any rate through some of the most tr usty of our brethren. When we are acknowledged as the only auth ority we shall discourse with the people personally on the market places, and we shall instruct them on questi ons of the political in such wise as may turn them in the direction that suits us. Who is going to. verify what is taught in the vil lage schools ? But what an envoy of the government or a king on his throne himself may say cannot but become imm ediately known to the whole State, for it will be s pread abroad by the voice of the people. In order not to annihilate the institutions of th e goyim before it is time we have touched them with craft and delicacy, and have taken hold of the ends of the sp rings which move their mechanism. These springs lay in a strict but just sense of order; we have replaced th em by the chaotic licence of liberalism. We have go t our hands into the administration of the law, into the conduc t of elections, into the press, into the liberty of the person, but principally into education and training as being th e corner-stones of a free existence. We have fooled, bemused and corrupted the youth o f the goyim by rearing them in principles and theor ies which are known to us to be false although it is by us that they have been inculcated. Above the existing laws, without substantially al tering them, and by merely twisting them into contr adictory interpretations, we have erected something grandios e in the way of results. These results found expres sion first in the fact that the interpretations masked the law s: afterwards they entirely hid them from the eyes of the governments since it had become impossible to under stand the tangled web of legislation. This is the origin of the theory of arbitration. You may say that the goyim will rise upon us, arm s in hand, if they guess what is going on before th e time comes; but in the West we have prepared against thi s a manoeuvre of such appalling terror that the ver y stoutest hearts quail— the undergrounds, those subterranean corridors, before the time comes, will be driven un der all capitals, from whence those capitals will be blown into the air with all their organisations and archi ves. PROTOCOL 10 PREPARING FOR POWER Camouflaged political freedom—Universal suffrage— The rise of republics—Transition to masonic despotism—Proclamation of the \"Lord of all the Worl d\"—Innoculation of diseases. Today I begin with a repetition of what I said be fore, and I beg you to bear in mind that government and peoples are content in the political with outside a ppearances. And how, indeed, are the goyim to perce ive the underlying meaning of things when their representat ives give the best of their energies to enjoying th emselves? For our policy it is of the greatest importance to notice this detail; it will be of assistance to us when we come to"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"consider the division of authority, freedom of spee ch, of the press, of religion (faith), of the law o f association, of equality before the law, of the inviolability of property, of the dwelling, of taxation (the idea o f concealed taxes), of the reflex force of the laws. All these questions are such as ought not to be touched upon directly and openly before the people. In cases where it is indi spensable to touch upon them they must not be categ orically named, it must merely be declared without detailed exposition that the principles of contemporary law are acknowledged by us. The reason for keeping silence in this respect is that by not naming a principle w e leave ourselves freedom of action, to drop this or that o ut of it without attracting notice; if they were al l categorically named they would all appear to have been already gi ven. The mob cherishes a special affection and respect for the geniuses of political power and accepts al l their deeds of violence with the admiring response: \"rasc ally, well, yes, it is rascally, but it's clever! . . . a trick, if you like, but how craftily played, how magnificently do ne, what impudent audacity!\" .... We count upon attracting all nations to the task of erecting the new fundamental structure, the proj ect for which has been drawn up by us. This is why, first a nd foremost, it is indispensable for us to arm ours elves and to store up in ourselves that absolutely reckless a udacity and irresistible might of the spirit which in the person of our active workers will break down all hindrance s in our way. When we have accomplished our coup d'etat we shal l say then to the various peoples: \"Everything has gone terribly badly, all have been worn out with sufferi ngs. We are destroying the causes of your torment— nationalities, frontiers, differences of coinages. You are at liberty, of course, to pronounce sentenc e upon us, but can it possibly be a just one if it is confirmed by you before you make any trial of what we are offer ing you.\" .... Then will the mob exalt us and bear us up in their hands in a unanimous triumph of hopes and expectati ons. Voting, which we have made the instrument which wil l set us on the throne of the world by teaching eve n the very smallest units of members of the human race to vote by means of meetings and agreements by groups , will then have served its purposes and will play its par t then for the last time by a unanimity of desire t o make close acquaintance with us before condemning us. To secure this we must have everybody vote withou t distinction of classes and qualifications, in ord er to establish an absolute majority, which cannot be got from the educated propertied classes. In this way, by inculcating in all a sense of self-importance, we s hall destroy among the goyim the importance of the family and its educational value and remove the possibilit y of individual minds splitting off, for the mob, h andled by us, will not let them come to the front nor even gi ve them a hearing; it is accustomed to listen to us only who pay it for obedience and attention. In this way we shall create a blind, mighty force which will never be in a position to move in any direction without the guida nce of our agents set at its head by us as leaders of the mob. The people will submit to this regime because it wi ll know that upon these leaders will depend its ear nings, gratifications and the receipt of all kinds of bene fits. A scheme of government should come ready made fro m one brain because it will never be clinched firml y if it is allowed to be split into fractional parts in the minds of many. It is permissible, therefore, for u s to know of the scheme of action but not to discuss it lest we disturb its artfulness, the interdependence of its component parts, the practical force of the secret meaning of each clause. To discuss and make alterations in a labour of this kind by means of numerous votes is to impress upon it the stamp of all the reasoning and misunder standing which has failed to penetrate the depth and extent of its plottings. We want our schemes to be forcibl e and suitably concocted. Therefore we ought not to fling the work of genius of our guide to the fangs of th e mob or even to a selected company. These schemes will not turn existing institutions upside down just yet. They will only effect change s in their economy and consequently in the whole combined move ment of their progress, which will thus be directed along the paths laid down in our schemes. Under various names there exists in all countries approximately one and the same thing. Representati on, Ministry, Senate, State Council, Legislative and Ex ecutive Corps. I need not explain to you the mechan ism of the relation of these institutions to one another, because you are aware of all that; only take note o f the fact that each of the above-named institutions corresponds to some important function of the State, and I would beg to remark that the word \"important\" I apply not to the institution but to the function, consequently it i s not the"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"institutions which are important but their function s. These institutions have divided up among themsel ves all the functions of government—administrative, legisla tive, executive, wherefore they have come to operat e as do the organs in the human body. If we injure one part in the machinery of State, the State falls sick, l ike a human body, and . . . will die. When we introduced into the State organism the po ison of Liberalism its whole political complexion underwent a change. States have been seized with a mortal illness— blood-poisoning. All that remains i s to await the end of their death agony. Liberalism produced Constitutional States, which took the place of what was the only safeguard of th e goyim, namely. Despotism; and a constitution, as you well know, is nothing else but a school of discord, misunderstanding, quarrels, disagreements, fruitles s party agitations, party whims—in a word, a school of everything that serves to destroy the personality o f State activity. The tribune of the \"talkeries\" ha s, no less effectively than the Press, condemned the rulers to inactivity and impotence, and thereby rendered the m useless and superfluous, for which reason indeed they have been in many countries deposed. Then it was that th e era of republics became a possibility that could be realiz ed; and then it was that we replaced the ruler by a caricature of a government—by a president, taken from the mob, from the midst of our puppet creatures, our slaves . This was the foundation of the mine which we have laid u nder the goy people, I should rather say, under the goy peoples. In the near future we shall establish the respons ibility of presidents. By that time we shall be in a position to disregard forms in carrying through matters for which our im personal puppet will be responsible. What do we care if the ranks of those striving for power should be thinned , if there should arise a deadlock from the scarcity of findin g presidents, a deadlock which will finally disorga nise the country? .... In order that our scheme may produce this result we shall arrange elections in favour of such presid ents as have in their past some dark, undiscovered stain, s ome \"Panama\" or other—then they will become trustwo rthy agents for the accomplishment of our plans, being a fraid, on the one hand, of revelations, and eager, on the other, for what everyone who has attained power des ires, namely, the retention of the privileges, adva ntages and honour connected with the office of president. The chamber of deputies will protect and elect pres idents, but we shall take from it the right to propose new, or make changes in, existing laws, for this right will be given by us to the responsible president, a puppet in our hands. Naturally, the authority of the president w ill then become a target for every possible form of attack, but we shall provide him with a means of self-defen ce in the right of an appeal to the people, for the decision of the people over the heads of their representativ es that is to say, an appeal to that same blind slave of ours— th e majority of the mob. Independently of this we sha ll invest the president with the right to declare a state of war. We shall justify this last right on the ground that the president as chief of the whole army of the country must be able to command it, should it be needed to defend the new republican constitution, since the right to defend it will belong to him as the responsible re presentative of this constitution. It is easy to understand that in these conditions the key of the shrine will lie in our hands, and n o one outside ourselves will any longer direct the force of legis lation. Besides this we shall, with the introduction of t he new republican constitution, take from the Chamb er the right of interpellation on government measures, on the pretext of preserving political secrecy, and, f urther, we shall by the new constitution reduce the number of representatives to a minimum, thereby proportionate ly reducing political passions and the passion for pol itics. If, however, they should, which is hardly to be expected, burst into flame, even in this minimum we shall nul lify them by a stirring appeal and a reference to t he majority of the whole people .... Upon the president will de pend the appointment of presidents and vice-preside nts of the Chamber and the Senate. Instead of constant session s of Parliaments we shall reduce their sittings to a few months. Moreover, the president, as chief of the ex ecutive power, will have the right to summon and di ssolve Parliament, and, in the latter case, to prolong the time for the appointment of a new parliamentary as sembly. But in order that the consequences of all these act s which in substance are illegal, should not, prema turely for our plans, fall upon the responsibility established by us of the president, we shall instigate ministe rs and other"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"officials of the higher administration about the pr esident to evade his dispositions by taking measure s of their own, for doing which they will be made the scapegoa ts in his place .... This part we especially recomm end to be given to be played by the Senate, the Council of St ate, or the Council of Ministers, but not to an ind ividual official. The president will, at our discretion, interpret the sense of such of the existing laws as admit of various interpretations; he will further annul them when we indicate to him the necessity to do so. Besides th is, he will have the right to propose temporary laws, and even new departures in the government constitutional wor king, the pretext both for the one and the other being th e requirements for the supreme welfare of the State . By such measures we shall obtain the power of des troying little by little, step by step, all that at the outset when we enter on our rights, we are compelled to in troduce into the constitutions of States to prepare for the transition to the imperceptible abolition of every kind of constitution, and then the time is come to turn every form of government into our despotism. The recognition of our despot may also come befor e the destruction of the constitution; the moment f or this recognition will come when the peoples, utterly wea ried by the irregularities and incompetence—a matte r which we shall arrange for—of their rulers, will cl amour: \"Away with them and give us one king over al l the earth who will unite us and annihilate the causes o f discords—frontiers, nationalities, religions, Sta te debts— who will give us peace and quiet which we cannot fi nd under our rulers and representatives.\" But you yourselves perfectly well know that to pr oduce the possibility of the expression of such wis hes by all the nations it is indispensable to stir up the peop le's relations with their governments in all countr ies so as utterly to exhaust humanity with dissension, hatred , struggle, envy and even to use torture, starvatio n, the inoculation of disease and want, so that the goyini see no other course open to them than to take refu ge in our complete sovereignty in money and in all else. But if we give the nations of the world a breathi ng space the moment we long for is hardly likely ev er to arrive. PROTOCOL 11 THE TOTALITARIAN STATE The new constitution—Abolition of the rights of man— \"Show\" army of masonic lodges. The State Council has been, as it were, the empha tic expression of the authority of the ruler; it wi ll be, as the \"show\" part of the Legislative Corps, what may be c alled the editorial committee of the laws and decre es of the ruler. This then, is the programme of the new constituti on. We shall make Law, Right and Justice (1) in the guise of proposals to the Legislative Corps, (2) by decrees of the president under the guise of general regulat ions, of orders of the Senate and of resolutions of the Stat e Council in the guise of ministerial orders, (3) a nd in case a suitable occasion should arise—in the form of a rev olution in the State. Having established approximately the modus agendi we will occupy ourselves with details of those combinations by which we have still to complete the revolution in the course of the machinery of State in the direction already indicated. By these combinations I mean the freedom of the Press, the right of assoc iation, freedom of conscience, the voting principle, and ma ny another that must disappear for ever from the me mory of man, or undergo a radical alteration the day after the promulgation of the new constitution. It is onl y at that moment that we shall be able at once to announce al l our orders, for, afterwards, every noticeable alt eration will be dangerous, for the following reasons: if this al teration be brought in with harsh severity and in a sense of severity and limitations, it may lead to a feeling of despair caused by fear of new alterations in the same direction: if, on the other hand, it be brought in in a sense of further indulgences it will be said t hat we have recognised our own wrongdoing and this will destroy the prestige of the infallibility of our authority , or else it will be said that we have become alarmed and are co mpelled to show lenience for which we shall get no thanks"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"because it will be supposed to be compulsory .... B oth the one and the other are injurious to the pres tige of the new constitution. We desire that from the first mom ent of its promulgation, while the peoples of the w orld are still stunned by the accomplished fact of the revol ution, still in a condition of terror and uncertain ty, they should recognize once for all that we are so strong, so in expugnable, so superabundantly rilled with power, t hat in no case shall we take any account of them, and so far from paying any attention to their opinions or wish es, we are ready and able to crush with irresistible power all expression or manifestation thereof at every momen t and in every place, that we have seized at once everything we wanted and shall in no case divide our power wi th them .... Then in fear and trembling they will close the ir eyes to everything, and be content to await what will be the end of it all. The goyim are a flock of sheep, and we are their wolves. And you know what happens when the wolves g et hold of the flock? .... There is another reason also why they will close their eyes: for we shall keep promising them to giv e back all the liberties we have taken away as soon as we have quelled the enemies of peace and tamed all parties .... It is not worth while discussing how long they wi ll be kept waiting for the return of their libertie s .... For what purpose then have we invented this whole policy and insinuated it into the minds of the goy without giving them any chance to examine its underlying me aning? For what, indeed, if not in order to obtain in a roundabout way what is for our scattered tribe unat tainable by the direct road ? It is this which has served as the basis of our organisation of secret Masonry which i s not known to, and whose aims are not even so much as suspected by, these goy cattle attracted by us into the \"show\" army of Masonic Lodges in order to thro w dust in the eyes of their fellows. God has granted to us, His Chosen People, the gif t of the dispersion, and in this which appears in a ll eyes to be our weakness, has come forth all our strength, whic h has now brought us to the threshold of sovereignt y over all the world. There now remains not much more for us to constru ct upon the foundation we have laid. PROTOCOL 12 CONTROL OF THE PRESS Masonic \"freedom\"—Control of printing and publish ing— Vishnu, idol of the Press. The word \"freedom\" which can be interpreted in va rious ways, is defined by us as follows:— Freedom i s the right to do that which the law allows. This interpr etation of the word will at the proper time be of s ervice to us, because all freedom will thus be in our hands, sinc e the laws will abolish or create only that which i s desirable for us according to the aforesaid programme. We shall deal with the press in the following way : what is the part played by the press of to-day? I t serves to excite and inflame those passions which are needed for our purpose or else it serves selfish ends of p arties. It is often vapid, unjust, mendacious, and the majority o f the public have not the slightest idea what ends the press really seves. We shall saddle and bridle it with a tight rein: we shall do the same also with all prod uctions of the printing press, for where would be the sense in sil encing the attacks of the press if we remain target s for pamphlets and books? The produce of publicity, whic h nowadays is a source of heavy expense owing to th e necessity of censorship, will be turned by us into a very lucrative source of income to our State: we shall lay on it a special stamp tax and require deposits of caut ion-money before permitting the establishment of an y organ of the press or of printing offices: these will then h ave to guarantee our government against any kind of attack on the part of the press. For any attempt to attack us , if such still be possible, we shall inflict fines without mercy. Such measures as stamp tax, deposit of caution-mone y and fines secured by these deposits, will bring i n a huge income to the government. It is true that party org ans might not spare money for the sake of publicity , but these we shall shut up at the second attack upon us. No o ne shall with impunity lay a finger on the aureole of the infallibility of our government. The pretext for st opping any publication will be the alleged plea tha t it is"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"agitating the public mind without occasion or justi fication. I beg you to note that among those making attacks upon us will also be organs established by us, but they will attack exclusively points that we have pr e- determined to alter. Not a single announcement will reach the public w ithout our control. Even now this is already being attained by us inasmuch as all news items are received by a few agencies, in whose offices they are focused fro m all parts of the world. These agencies will then be alr eady entirely ours and will give publicity only to- what we dictate to them. If we have already contrived to possess ourselve s of the minds of the goy communities to such an ex tent that they all come near looking upon the events of the w orld through the coloured glasses of those spectacl es we are setting astride their noses; if already there is no t a single State where there exist for us any barri ers to admittance into what goy stupidity calls State secr ets: what will our position be then, when we shall be acknowledged supreme lords of the world in the pers on of our king of all the world .... Let us turn again to the future of the printing p ress. Every one desirous of being a publisher, libr arian, or printer, will be obliged to provide himself with th e diploma instituted therefore, which, in case of a ny fault, will be immediately impounded. With such measures the in strument of thought will become an educative means in the hands of our government, which will no longer a llow the mass of the nation to be led astray in by- ways and fantasies about the blessings of progress. Is there any one of us who does not know that these phantom blessings are the direct roads to foolish imagining s which give birth to anarchical relations of men a mong themselves and towards authority, because progress, or rather the idea of progress, has introduced the conception of every kind of emancipation, but has f ailed to establish its limits .... All the so-calle d liberals are anarchists, if not in fact, at any rate in thought. Every one of them is hunting after phantoms of fre edom, and falling exclusively into licence, that is, into the anarchy of protest for the sake of protest .... We turn to the periodical press. We shall impose on it, as on all printed matter, stamp taxes per sh eet and deposits of caution-money, and books of less than 3 0 sheets will pay double. We shall reckon them as pamphlets in order, on the one hand, to reduce the number of magazines, which are the worst form of pr inted poison, and, on the other, in order that this measu re may force writers into such lengthy productions that they will be little read, especially as they will be cos tly. At the same time what we shall publish ourselv es to influence mental development in the direction laid down for our profit will be cheap and will be read voraciously. The tax will bring vapid literary ambi tions within bounds and the liability to penalties will make literary men dependent upon us. And if there should be any found who are desirous of writing against u s, they will not find any person eager to print their produ ctions. Before accepting any production for publica tion in print the publisher or printer will have to apply t o the authorities for permission to do so. Thus we shall know before hand of all the tricks being prepared agains t us and shall nullify them by outstripping them wi th explanations on the subject treated of. Literature and journalism are two of the most imp ortant educative forces, and therefore our governme nt will become proprietor of the majority of the journals. This will neutralise the injurious influence of the privately- owned press and will put us in possession of a trem endous influence upon the public mind .... If we gi ve permits for ten journals, we shall ourselves found thirty, and so on in the same proportion. This, how ever, must in nowise be suspected by the public. For this reas on all journals published by us will be in appearan ce, of the most opposite tendencies and opinions, thereby crea ting confidence in us, and bringing over to us our quite unsuspicious opponents, who will thus fall into our trap and be rendered harmless. In the front rank will stand organs of an officia l character. They will always stand guard over our interests, and therefore their influence will be comparatively ins ignificant. In the second rank will be the semi-official orga ns, whose part it will be to attract the tepid and indifferent. In the third rank we shall set up our own opposit ion, which, to all appearance, in at least one of i ts organs, will present what looks like the very antipothesis to us . Our real opponents at heart will accept this simu lated opposition as their own and will show us their card s."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" All our newspapers will be of all possible comple xions— aristocratic, republican, revolutionary, eve n anarchical— for so long, of course, as the constitu tion exists .... Like the Indian idol Vishnu, they will have a hundred hands, and every one of them will have a fi nger on any one sector of public opinion as require d. When a pulse quickens these hands will lead opinion in t he direction of our aims, for an excited patient lo ses all power of judgment and easily yields to suggestion. Those fools who will think they are repeating the opinion of a newspaper of their own camp will be repeating our o pinion or any opinion that seems desirable for us. In the vain belief that they are following the organ of th eir party they will in fact follow the flag which w e hang out for them. In order to direct our newspaper militia in this sense we must take especial and minute care in orga nising this matter. Under the title of central department of th e press we shall institute literary gatherings at w hich our agents will without attracting attention issue the orders and watchwords of the day. By discussing and controverting, but always superficially, without to uching the essence of the matter, our organs will c arry on a sham fight fusillade with the official newspapers s olely for the purpose of giving occasion for us to express ourselves more fully than could well be done from t he outset in official announcements, whenever, of c ourse, that is to our advantage. These attacks upon us will also serve another pur pose, namely, that our subjects will be convinced o f the existence of full freedom of speech and so give our agents an occasion to affirm that all organs which oppose us are empty babblers, since they are incapable of fin ding any substantial objections to our orders. Methods of organisation like these, imperceptible to the public eye but absolutely sure, are the bes t calculated to succeed in bringing the attention and the confid ence of the public to the side of our government. T hanks to such methods we shall be in a position as from time to time may be required, to excite or tranquillize the public mind on political questions, to persuade or confuse , printing now truth, now lies, facts or their cont radictions, according as they may be well or ill received, alwa ys very cautiously feeling our ground before steppi ng upon it ... We shall have a sure triumph over our opponents since they will not have at their disposition orga ns of the press in which they can give full and final express ion of their views, owing to the aforesaid methods of dealing with the press. We shall not even need to refute th em except very superficially. Trial shots like these, fired by us in the third rank of our press, in case of need, will be energet ically refuted by us in our semi-official organs. Even nowadays, take only the French press, there are forms which reveal masonic solidarity in acting on the watchword: all organs of the press are bound togeth er by professional secrecy; like the augurs of old, not one of their number will give away the secret of his sourc es of information unless it is resolved to announce them. Not one journalist will venture to betray this secret f or not one of them is ever admitted to practice lit erature unless his whole past has some disgraceful sore or other . ... These sores would be immediately revealed. So l ong as they remain the secret of a few the prestige of the journalist attracts the majority of the country—th e mob follow after him with enthusiasm. Our calculations are especially extended to the p rovinces. It is indispensable for us to inflame the re those hopes and impulses with which we could at any momen t fall upon the capital, and we shall represent to the capitals that these expressions are the independent hopes and impulses of the provinces. Naturally, th e source of them will be always one and the same—ours. We requi re that, until such time as we are in the plenitude of power, the capitals should find themselves stifled by the provincial opinion of the nation, i.e., of a majority arranged by our agentur. It is essential for our pu rpose that at the psychological moment the capitals should not be in a position to discuss an accomplished fact fo r the simple reason, if for no other, that it has b een accepted by the public opinion of a majority in the province s. When we are in the period of the new regime prior to the transition to that of the assumption of our full sovereignty we must not admit any revelations by th e press of any form of public dishonesty; it is nec essary that the new regime should be thought to have so pe rfectly contented everybody that even criminality h as disappeared . . .

No o ne will dare to demand the abrogation of a matter once sett led, all the more so as it will be represented as a n improvement ....

Into the discussions of these new questions w ill throw themselves those of the brainless dispensers of fortunes who are not able even now to understand that they have not the remotest conception about the mat ters which they undertake to discuss. Questions of the political are beyond the comprehension of any save those who have guided it already for many ages, the creators. From all this you will see that in securing the o pinion of the mob we are only facilitating the work ing of our machinery, and you may remark that it is not for ac tions but for words issued by us on this or that qu estion that we seem to seek approval. We are constantly making public declaration that we are guided in all our undertakings by the hope, joined to the conviction, that we are serving the common weal. In order to distract people who may be too troubl esome from discussing questions of the political we are now putting forward what we allege to be new questions of the political, namely, questions of industry.

In order that the masses themselves may not guess what they are about, we further distract them with amusements, games, pa stimes, passions, people's palaces .... Soon we sha ll begin through the press to propose competitions in art, i n sport of all kinds: these interests will finally distract their minds from questions in which we should find oursel ves compelled to oppose them. Growing more and more unaccustomed to reflect and form any opinions of th eir own, people will begin to talk in the same tones as we, because we alone shal l be offering them new directions for thought... of course through such persons as will not be suspected of so lidarity with us.

If this gives birth to the atheists whom we see to-day it will not, being only a transition al stage, interfere with our views, but will serve as a warni ng for those generations which will hearken to our preaching of the religion of Moses, that, by its stable and t horoughly elaborated system, has brought all the pe oples of the world into subjection to us.

When we at last definitely come into our kingdom by the aids of coups d'etat prepared everywhere for one and the same day, after the worthlessness of all existi ng forms of government has been definitely acknowle dged (and not a little time will pass before that comes about, perhaps even a whole century) we shall make it our task to see that against us such things as plots shall n o longer exist. With this purpose we shall slay wit hout mercy all who take arms (in hand) to oppose our coming in to our kingdom. Every kind of new institution of an ything like a secret society will also be punished with de ath; those of them which are now-in existence, are known to us, serve us and have served us, we shall disband a nd send into exile to continents far removed from E urope. In this way we shall proceed with those goy masons who know too much; such of these as we may for some"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"reason spare will be kept in constant fear of exile . We shall promulgate a law making all former membe rs of secret societies liable to exile from Europe as the centre of our rule. Resolutions of our government will be final, with out appeal. In the goy societies, in which we have planted an d deeply rooted discord and protestantism, the only possible way of restoring order is to employ merciless measu res that prove the direct force of authority: no re gard must be paid to the victims who fall, they suffer for th e well-being of the future. The attainment of that well-being, even at the expense of sacrifices, is the duty of a ny kind of government that acknowledges as the just ification for its existence not only its privileges but its o bligations. The principal guarantee of stability of rule is to confirm the aureole of power, and this aureole is a ttained only by such a majestic inflexibility of mi ght as shall carry on its face the emblems of inviolability from mystical causes—from the choice of God. Such was u ntil recent times, the Russian autocracy, the one and on ly serious foe we had in the world, without countin g the Papacy. Bear in mind the example when Italy, drench ed with blood, never touched a hair of the head of Sulla who had poured forth that blood. Sulla enjoyed an a potheosis for his might in the eyes of the people, though they had been torn in pieces by him, but his intrep id return to Italy ringed him round with inviolabil ity. The people do not lay a finger on him who hypnotises th em by his daring and strength of mind. Meantime, however, until we come into our kingdom , we shall act in the contrary way: we shall create and multiply free masonic lodges in all the countries o f the world, absorb into them all who may become or who are prominent in public activity, for in these lodges w e shall find our principal intelligence office and means of influence. All these lodges we shall bring under on e central administration, known to us alone and to all others absolutely unknown, which will be composed of our l earned elders. The lodges will have their represent atives who will serve to screen the above-mentioned admini stration of masonry and from whom will issue the watchword and programme. In these lodges we shall t ie together the knot which binds together all revol utionary and liberal elements. They will be composed of all strata of society. The most secret political plots will be known to us and will fall under our guiding hands o n the very day of their conception. Among the members of these lodges will be almost all the agents of inter national and national police, since their service is for us irreplaceable in the respect that the police are in a position not only to use their own particular measures with the insubordinate, but also to screen our activities an d provide pretexts for discontents, et cetera. The class of people who most willingly enter int o secret societies are those who live by their wits , careerists, and in general people, mostly light-minded, with wh om we shall have no difficulty in dealing and in us ing to wind up the mechanism of the machine devised by us. If this world grows agitated the meaning of that w ill be that we have had to stir it up in order to break up its too great solidarity. But if there should aris e in its midst a plot, then at the head of that plot will be no othe r than one of our most trusted servants. It is natu ral that we and no other should lead masonic activities, for we kno w whither we are leading, we know the final goal of every form of activity whereas the goyim have knowledge o f nothing, not even of the immediate effect of acti on; they put before themselves, usually, the momentary recko ning of the satisfaction of their self-opinion in t he accomplishment of their thought without even remark ing that the very conception never belonged to thei r initiative but to our instigation of their thought. ... The goyim enter the lodges out of curiosity or in the hope of getting a nibble from the public pie, and some of them in order to obtain a hearing before the public for their impracticable and groundless fantasies: they thirst for the emotion of success and applause, of which w e are remarkably generous. And the reason why we gi ve them this success is to make use of the high concei t of themselves to which it gives birth, for that i nsensibly disposes them to assimilate our suggestions without being on their guard against them in the fullness of their confidence that it is their own infallibility which is giving utterance to their own thoughts and that it is impossible for them to borrow those of others .... You cannot imagine to what extent the wisest of the goyim can be brought to a state of unconscious naivete th rough this high conceit of themselves, and at the s ame time how easy it is to take the heart out of them by the slightest ill-success, though it be nothing more t han silencing the applause they enjoyed, and reducing them to sla vish submission for the sake of winning a renewal o f success .... By so much as ours disregard success i f only they can carry through their plans, by so mu ch the goyim are willing to sacrifice any plans only to ha ve success. This psychology of theirs materially fa cilitates for"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"us the task of setting them in the required directi on. These tigers in appearance have the souls of sh eep and the wind blows freely through their heads. We have set them on the hobbyhorse of an idea about the absorpt ion of individuality by the symbolic unit of collectivism .... They have never yet and they never will have t he sense to reflect that this hobbyhorse is a manifest violatio n of the most important law of nature, which has es tablished from the very creation of the world one unit unlike another and precisely for the purpose of instituti ng individuality .... If we have been able to bring them to such a pitc h of stupid blindness is it not proof and amazingly clear proof of the degree to which the mind of the goyim is und eveloped in comparison with our mind? This it is, m ainly, which guarantees our success. And how far-seeing were our learned elders in an cient times when they said that to attain a serious end it behoves us not to stop at any means or to count the victims sacrificed for the sake of that end .... W e have not counted the victims of the seed of the goy cattle, though we have sacrificed many of our own, but for that we have now already given them such a position on the earth as they could not even have dreamed of. The comparatively small numbers of the victims from the number of ours have preserved our nationality from destruction. Death is the inevitable end for all. It is bette r to bring that end nearer to those who hinder our affairs than to ourselves, to the founders of this affair. We execu te masons in such wise that none save the brotherho od can ever have a suspicion of it, not even the victims t hemselves of our death sentence, they all die when required as if from a normal kind of illness .... Knowing this, even the brotherhood in its turn dare not protest. By such methods we have plucked out of the midst of masonry the very root of protest against our disposition. While preaching liberalism to the goyim we at the same ti me keep our own people and our agents in a state of unquestioning submission. Under our influence the execution of the laws of the goyim has been reduced to a minimum. The presti ge of the law has been exploded by the liberal interpreta tions introduced into this sphere. In the most impo rtant and fundamental affairs and questions judges decide as we dictate to them, see matters in the light wherew ith we enfold them for the administration of the goyim, of course, through persons who are our tools though w e do not appear to have anything in common with them—by news paper opinion or by other means .... Even senators and the higher administration accept our counsels. The purely brute mind of the goyim is incapable of anal ysis and observation, and still more of foreseeing whither a certain manner of setting a question may tend. In this difference in capacity for thought betwee n the goyim and ourselves may be clearly discerned the seal of our position as the Chosen People and of our higher quality of humanness, in contradistinction to the brute mind of the goyim. Their eyes are open, but see not hing before them and do not invent (unless, perhaps , material things). From this it is plain that nature herself has destined us to guide and rule the worl d. When comes the time of our overt rule, the time t o manifest its blessings, we shall remake all legis latures, all our laws will be brief, plain, stable, without any kind of interpretations, so that anyone will be in a position to know them perfectly. The main feature which they wi ll hold in common is submission to orders, and this principle will be carried to a grandiose height. Ev ery abuse will then disappear since all, down to th e lowest unit, will be held responsible before the higher au thority of the representative of power. Abuses of p ower subordinate to this last instance will be so mercil essly punished that none will be found anxious to t ry experiments with their own powers. We shall pursue jealously every action of the administration on whi ch depends the smooth running of the machinery of the State, for slackness in this produces slackness eve rywhere; not a single case of illegality or abuse of power w ill be left without exemplary punishment. Concealment of guilt, connivance between those in the service of the administration—all this kind of evil will disappear after the very first examples of severe p unishment. The aureole of our power demands suitabl e, that is, cruel punishment for the slightest infringement , for the sake of gain, of its supreme prestige. Th e sufferer, though his punishment may exceed his fault, will co unt as a soldier falling on the administrative fiel d of battle in the interest of authority, principle and law, wh ich do not permit that any of those who hold the re ins of the public coach should turn aside from the public high way to their own private paths. For example: our ju dges will know that whenever they feel disposed to plume them selves on foolish clemency they are violating the l aw of"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"justice which is instituted for the exemplary edifi cation of men by penalties for lapse and not for di splay of the spiritual qualities of the judge .... Such qualitie s it is proper to show in private life, but not in a public square which is the educational basis of human life. Our legal staff will not serve beyond the age of 55, firstly because old men hold more obstinately t o prejudiced opinions and are less capable of submitting to new directions, and secondly because after this measure we will enjoy greater elasticity in changing the staff, whi ch will thus the more easily bend under our pressur e: he who wishes to keep his place will have to give blind ob edience to deserve it. In general, our judges will be elected by us only from among those who thoroughly understa nd that the part they have to play is to punish and apply laws and not dream about the manifestations of libe ralism at the expense of the educational scheme of the State, as the goyim in these days imagine it to be. This m ethod of shuffling the staff will serve also to exp lode any collective solidarity of those in the same service and will bind all to the interests of the governmen t upon which their fate will depend. The young generation of jud ges will be trained in certain views regarding the inadmissibility of any abuses that might disturb th e established order of our subjects among themselve s. In these days the judges of the goyim create indulg ences to every kind of crimes, not having a just understanding of their office, because the rulers o f the present age in appointing judges to office ta ke no care to inculcate in them a sense of duty and consciousness of the matter which is demanded of them. As a brut e beast lets out its young in search of prey, so do the goy im give their subjects places of profit without thi nking to make clear to them for what purpose such place was creat ed. This is the reason why their governments are be ing ruined by their own forces through acts of their ow n administration. Let us borrow from the example of the results of these actions yet another lesson for our government . We shall root out liberalism from all the importa nt strategic posts of our government on which depen ds the training of subordinates for our State structure. S uch posts will fall exclusively to those who have b een trained by us for administrative rule. To the possible obje ction that the retirement of old servants will cost the Treasury heavily, I reply, firstly, they will be provided wi th some private service in place of what they lose, and, secondly, I have to remark that all the money in th e world will be concentrated in our hands, conseque ntly it is not our government that has to fear expense. Our absolutism will in all things be logically co nsecutive and therefore our supreme will in each on e of its decrees will be respected and unquestionably fulfil led: it will ignore all murmurs, all discontents of every kind and will destroy to the root every kind of manifest ation of them in act by punishment of an exemplary character. We shall abolish the right of cassation, which wi ll be transferred exclusively to our disposal—to th e cognizance of our ruler, for we must not allow the conception among the people of a thought that there could be such a thing as a decision that is. not right by ju dges set up by us. If, however, anything like this should occur, we shall ourselves cassate the decision, but inflic t therewith such exemplary punishment on the judge for lack of understanding of his duty and the purposes of hi s appointment as will prevent a repetition of such cases .... I repeat that it must be borne in mind that we shall know every step of our administration which only ne eds to be closely watched for the people to be content with u s, for it has the right to demand from a good gover nment a good official. Our government will have the appearance of a patr iarchal paternal guardianship on the part of our ru ler. Our own nation and our subjects will discern in his per son a father caring for their every need, their eve ry act, their every interrelation as subjects one with another, a s well as their relations to the ruler. They will t hen be so thoroughly imbued with the thought that it is impos sible for them to dispense with this wardship and g uidance, if they wish to live in peace and quiet, that they will acknowledge the autocracy of our ruler with a devotion bordering on Apotheosis, especially when they are c onvinced that those whom we set up do not put their own in place of his authority but only blindly execute his dictates. They will be rejoiced that we have regul ated everything in their lives as is done by wise parent s who desire to retain their children in the cause of duty and submission. For the peoples of the world in regard to the secrets of our state are ever through the ag es only children under age, precisely as are also their gov ernments."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" As you see, I found our despotism on right and du ty: the right to compel the execution of duty is th e direct obligation of a government which watches over its s ubjects like a father. It has the right of the stro ng that it may use it for the benefit of directing humanity toward s that order which is defined by nature, namely, su bmission. Everything in the world is in a state of submission , if not to man, then to circumstances or to its ow n inner character, in all cases to what is stronger. And so shall we be this something stronger for the sake o f good. We are obliged without hesitation to sacrifice in dividuals, who commit a breach of established order , for in exemplary punishment of evil lies a great education al problem. When the King of Israel sets upon his sacred head the crown offered him by Europe he will become pat riarch of the world. The indispensable victims offered by him in consequence of their suitability will never reach the number of victims offered in the course of centurie s by the mania of magnificence, the emulation betwe en the goy governments. Our King will be in constant communion with the p eoples, making to them from the tribune speeches wh ich fame will in that same hour distribute over all the world. PROTOCOL 16 BRAINWASHING Emasculation of the Universities—Abolition of fre edom of instruction. In order to effect the destruction of all collect ive forces except ours we shall emasculate the fir st stage of collectivism—the universities, by re-educating them in a new direction. Their officials and professors will be prepared for their business by detailed secret prog rammes of action from which they will not with immu nity diverge, not by one iota. They will be appointed with special precaution, and will be so placed as to be wholly dependent upon the Government. We shall exclude from the course of instruction S tate Law as also all that concerns the political qu estion. These subjects will be taught to a few dozens of pe rsons chosen for their pre-eminent capacities from among the number of the initiated. The universities must no longer send out from their halls milksops concoc ting plans for a constitution, like a comedy or a tragedy, bus ying themselves with questions of policy in which e ven their own fathers never had any power of thought. The ill-guided acquaintance of a large number of persons with questions of state creates Utopian dre amers and bad subjects, as you can see for yourselves from th e example of the universal education in this direct ion of the goyim. We must introduce into their education all t hose principles which have so brilliantly broken up their order. But when we are in power we shall remove eve ry kind of disturbing subject from the course of ed ucation and shall make out of the youth obedient children o f authority, loving him who rules as the support an d hope of peace and quiet. Classicism, as also any form of study of ancient history, in which there are more bad than good exam ples, we shall replace with the study of the programme of th e future. We shall erase from the memory of men all facts of previous centuries which are undesirable to us, and leave only those which depict all the errors of th e government of the goyim. The study of practical lif e, of the obligations of order, of the relations of the people one to another, of avoiding bad and selfish example s, which spread the infection of evil, and similar questions of an educational nature, will stand in the forefro nt of the teaching programme, which will be drawn u p on a separate plan for each calling or state of life, in no wise generalising the teaching. This treatment of the question is specially important. Each state of life must be trained within strict limits corresponding to its destination and work in life. The occasional genius has always managed and always wil l manage to slip through into other states of life, but it is the most perfect folly for the sake of this rare oc casional genius to let through into ranks foreign t o them the untalented who thus rob of their places those who b elong to those ranks by birth or employment. You kn ow yourselves in what all this has ended for the goyim who allowed this crying absurdity."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" In order that he who rules may be seated firmly i n the hearts and minds of his subjects it is necess ary for the time of his activity to instruct the whole nation i n the schools and on the market places about his me aning and his acts and all his beneficent initiatives. We shall abolish every kind of freedom of instruc tion. Learners of all ages will have the right to a ssemble together with their parents in the educational esta blishments as it were in a club: during these assem blies, on holidays, teachers will read what will pass as free lectures on questions of human relations, of the l aws of examples, of the limitations which are born of unco nscious relations, and, finally, of the philosophy of new theories not yet declared to the world. These theor ies will be raised by us to the stage of a dogma of faith as a transitional stage towards our faith. On the comple tion of this exposition of our programme of action in the present and the future I will read you the principl es of these theories. In a word, knowing by the experience of many cent uries that people live and are guided by ideas, tha t these ideas are imbibed by people only by the aid of educ ation provided with equal success for all ages of g rowth, but of course by varying methods, we shall swallow up a nd confiscate to our own use the last scintilla of independence of thought, which we have for long pas t been directing towards subjects and ideas useful for us. The system of bridling thought is already at work i n the so-called system of teaching by object lesson s, the purpose of which is to turn the goyim into unthinki ng submissive brutes waiting for things to be prese nted before their eyes in order to form an idea of them .... In France, one of our best agents, Bourgeois, has already made public a new programme of teaching by object l essons. PROTOCOL 17 ABUSE OF AUTHORITY The demoralisation of Justice—Wrecking of the Chr istian religion—Jewish Patriarch Pope of the universe—Secret police employing public informers. The practice of advocacy produces men cold, cruel , persistent, unprincipled, who in all cases take u p an impersonal, purely legal standpoint. Their invetera te habit is to refer everything to the defensive va lue of its properties and not to the public welfare of its res ults. They do not usually decline to undertake any defence whatever, they strive for an acquittal at all costs , cavilling over every petty crux of jurisprudence and thereby they demoralise justice. For this reason we shall s et this profession into narrow frames which will ke ep it inside this sphere of executive public service. Advocates, equally with judges, will be deprived of the right to communicate with litigants; they will receive busin ess only from the court and will study it by notes of report and documents, defending their clients after they h ave been interrogated in court on facts that have a ppeared. They will receive an honorarium without regard to t he quality of the defence. This will render them me re reporters on law-business in the interests of justi ce and as a counterpoise to the proctor who will be the reporter in the interests of prosecution; this will shorten business before the courts. In this way will be est ablished a practice of honest unprejudiced defence conducted n ot from personal interest but by conviction. This w ill also, by the way, remove the present practice of corrupt bargaining between advocates to agree only to let t hat side win which pays most We have long past taken care to discredit the pri esthood of the goyim, and thereby to ruin their mis sion on earth, which in these days might still be a great h indrance to us. Day by day its influence on the peo ples of the world is falling lower. Freedom of conscience has b een declared everywhere, so that now only years div ide us from the moment of the complete wrecking of that Ch ristian religion. As to other religions, we shall h ave still less difficulty in dealing with them, but it would be premature to speak of this now. We shall set cle ricalism and clericals into such narrow frames as to make their influence move in retrogressive proportion to its f ormer progress. When the time conies finally to destroy the papal court the finger of an invisible hand will point t he nations towards this court. When, however, the nations flin g themselves upon it, we shall come forward in the guise of its defenders as if to save excessive bloodshed. By this diversion we shall penetrate to its very bowe ls and be sure we shall never come out again until we have gn awed through the entire strength of this place."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" The King of the Jews will be the real Pope of the Universe, the patriarch of an international Church . But, in the meantime, while we are re-educating y outh in new traditional religions and afterwards in ours, we shall not overtly lay a finger on existing churches , but we shall fight against them by criticism calc ulated to produce schism .... In general, then, our contemporary press will con tinue to criticise State affairs, religions, incapa cities of the goyim, always using the most unprincipled expressio ns in order by every means to lower their prestige in the manner which can only be practised by the genius of our gifted tribe Our kingdom will be an apologia of the divinity V ishnu, in whom is found its personification—in our hundred hands will be, one in each, the springs of the mach inery of social life. We shall see everything witho ut the aid of official police which, in that scope of their ri ghts which we elaborated for the use of the goyim, hinders governments from seeing. In our programme one-third of our subjects will keep the rest under observati on from a sense of duty, on the principle of volunteer serv ice to the State. It will then be no disgrace to be a spy and informer, but a merit: unfounded denunciations, how ever, will be cruelly punished that there may be no development of abuses of this right. Our agents will be taken from the higher as well as the lower ranks of society, from among the admin istrative class who spend their time in amusements, editors, printers and publishers, booksellers, clerks, and s alesmen, workmen coachmen, lackeys, et cetera. This body, ha ving no rights and not being empowered to take any action on their own account, and consequently a pol ice without any power, will only witness and report . Verification of their reports and arrests will depe nd upon a responsible group who will control police affairs, while the actual act of arrest will be performed by the gendarmerie and the municipal police. Any pers ons not denouncing anything seen or heard concerning questi ons of state will also be charged with and made responsible for concealment, if it be proved that h e is guilty of this crime. Just as nowadays our brethren are obliged at thei r own risk to denounce to the kabal apostates of th eir own family or members who have been noticed doing anyth ing in opposition to the kabal, so in our kingdom o ver all the world it will be obligatory for all our subject s to observe the duty of service to the State in th is direction. Such an organisation will extirpate abuses of aut hority, of force, of bribery, everything in fact wh ich we by our counsels, by our theories of the superhuman rig hts of man, have introduced into the customs of the goyim .... But how else were we to procure that increase of causes predisposing to disorders in the midst of their administration? .... Among the numbers of those met hods one of the most important is —agents for the restoration of order, so placed as to have the oppo rtunity in their disintegrating activity of develop ing and displaying their evil inclinations—obstinate self-c onceit, irresponsible exercise of authority, and, f irst and foremost, venality. PROTOCOL 18 ARREST OF OPPONENTS Measures of secret defence—Undermining authority. When it becomes necessary for us to strengthen th e strict measures of secret defence (the most fatal poison for the prestige of authority) we shall arrange a simul ation of disorders or some manifestation of discont ents finding expression through the co-operation of good speakers. Round these speakers will assemble all w ho are sympathetic to his utterances. This will give us th e pretext for domiciliary perquisitions and surveil lance on the part of our servants from among the number of the g oyim police .... As the majority of conspirators act out of love for the game, for the sake of talking, so, until they commit some overt act we shall not lay a finger on them but onl y introduce into their midst observation elements . ... It must be remembered that the prestige of authority is les sened if it frequently discovers conspiracies again st itself: this implies a presumption of consciousness of weakness, or, what is still worse, injustice. You are aware that we have broken the prestige of the goy kings by freque nt attempts upon their lives through our agents, bl ind sheep"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"of our flock, who are easily moved by a few liberal phrases to crimes provided only they be painted in political colours. We have compelled the rulers to acknowledg e their weakness in advertising overt measures of s ecret defence and thereby we shall bring authority to des truction. Our ruler will be secretly protected only by the most insignificant guard, because we shall not admi t so much as a thought that there could exist again st him any sedition with which he is not strong enough to cont end or from which he is compelled to hide. If we should admit this thought, as the goyim hav e done and are doing, we should ipso facto be signi ng a death sentence, if not for our ruler, at any rate f or his dynasty, at no distant date. According to strictly enforced outward appearance s our ruler will employ his power only for the adva ntage of the nation and in no wise for his own or dynastic p rofits. Therefore, with the observance of this deco rum, his authority will be respected and guarded by the subj ects themselves, it will receive an apotheosis in t he admission that with it is bound up the well-being o f every citizen of the State, for upon it will depe nd all order in the common life of the pack .... Overt defence of this kind argues weakness in the organisation of his strength. Our ruler will always be surrounded among the peo ple by a mob of apparently curious men and women, w ho will occupy the front ranks about him, to all appea rance by chance, and will restrain the ranks of the rest out of respect as it will appear for good order. This will sow an example of restraint also in others. If a p etitioner appears among the people forcing his way through th e ranks and trying to hand in a petition, the first ranks must receive the petition and before the eyes of th e petitioner pass it to the ruler, so that all may know that what is handed in reaches its destination, and that, con sequently, the ruler himself is subject to control. To exist, the aureole of power requires that the people may be ab le to say \"If the king knew of this,\" or \"the king will hear of it.\" With the establishment of official secret defence the mystical prestige of authority disappears: giv en a certain audacity, and everyone counts himself master of it, the sedition-monger is conscious of his strength, and when occasion serves watches for the moment to make an a ttempt upon authority .... For the goyim we have be en preaching something else, but by that very fact we are enabled to see what measures of overt defence h ave brought them to. Criminals with us will be arrested at the first mor e or less well-grounded suspicion; it cannot be all owed that out of fear of a possible mistake an opportunity of escape should be given to persons suspected of a p olitical lapse or crime, for in these matters we shall be li terally merciless. If it is still possible, by stre tching a point, to admit a reconsideration of the motive causes in sim ple crimes, there is no possibility of excuse for p ersons occupying themselves with questions in which nobody except the government can understand anything . An d it is not all governments that understand true policy. PROTOCOL 19 RULERS AND PEOPLE Making use of public petitions—Debasing heroism—M artyrdom of sedition-mongers. If we do not permit any independent dabbling in t he political we shall on the other hand encourage e very kind of report or petition with proposals for the govern ment to examine all kinds of projects for the ameli oration of the condition of the people; this will reveal to us the defects or else the fantasies of our subjects, to which we shall respond either by accomplishing them or by wi sely rebutting them to prove the short-sightedness of one who judges wrongly. Sedition-mongering is nothing more than the yappi ng of a lap-dog at an elephant. For a well organise d government, not from the point of view of the polic e but of the public, the lap-dog yaps at an elephan t entirely unconscious of its strength and importance. It need s no more than to take a good example to show the r elative importance of both and the lap-dogs will cease to y ap and will wag their tails the moment they set eye s on an elephant."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" In order to destroy the prestige of heroism for p olitical crime we shall send it for trial in the ca tegory of thieving, murder, and every kind of abominable and filthy crime. Public opinion will then confuse in i ts conception this category of crime with the disgrace attaching to every other and will brand it with th e same contempt. We have done our best, and I hope we have succeed ed, in preventing the goyim from adopting this mean s of contending with sedition. It was for this reason th at through the Press and in speeches indirectly—in cleverly compiled school-books on history, we have advertise d the martyrdom alleged to have been accepted by sedition-mongers for the idea of the commonweal. Th is advertisement has increased the contingent of li berals and has brought thousands of goyim into the ranks o f our livestock cattle. PROTOCOL 20 FINANCIAL PROGRAMME Progressive taxation—Stagnant capital—The ruinous Gold Standard. Today we shall touch upon the financial programme , which I put off to the end of my report as being the most difficult, the crowning and the decisive point of o ur plans. Before entering upon it I will remind you that I have already spoken before by way of a hint when I said that the sum total of our actions is settled by the question of figures. When we come into our kingdom our autocratic gove rnment will avoid, from a principle of self-preserv ation, stupidly burdening the masses of the people with ta xes, remembering that it plays the part of father a nd protector. But as State organisation is costly it i s necessary nevertheless to obtain the funds requir ed for it. It will, therefore, elaborate with particular precauti on the question of equilibrium in this matter. Our rule, in which the king will enjoy the legal fiction that everything in his State belongs to him (which may easily be translated into fact), will have power to resort to the lawful confiscation of all sums of e very kind for the regulation of their circulation in the State. F rom this it follows that taxation will best be cove red by a progressive tax on property. In this manner the due s will be paid without straining or ruining anybody in the form of a percentage of the amount of property. The rich must be aware that it is their duty to place a part of their superfluities at the disposal of the State si nce the State guarantees them security of possessio n of the rest of their property and the right to honest gains. I say honest, for the control over property will do a way with robbery on a legal basis. This social reform must come from above, for the time is ripe for it—it is indispensable as a pledge of peace. The tax upon the poor man is a seed of revolution and works to the detriment of the State which in h unting after the trifling is missing the big. Quite apart from this, a tax on capitalists diminishes the grow th of wealth in private hands where we have in these days concentra ted it as a counterpoise to the government strength of the goyim—their State finances. A tax increasing in a percentage ratio to capital will give a much larger revenue than the present i ndividual or property tax, which is useful to us now for the sol e reason that it excites trouble and discontent amo ng the goyim. The force upon which our king will rest consists in equilibrium and the guarantee of peace, for the sake of which things it is indispensable that the capitalis ts should yield up a portion of their incomes in or der to ensure the working of the machinery of the State. State ne eds must be paid by those who will not feel the bur den and have enough to take from. Such a measure will destroy the hatred of the poo r man for the rich, in whom he will see a necessary financial support for the State, and the organiser of peace a nd well-being since he will see that it is the rich man who is paying the necessary means to attain these things."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" In order that payers of the educated classes shou ld not too much distress themselves over the new pa yments they will have full accounts given them of the dest ination of those payments, with the exception of su ch sums as will be appropriated for the needs of the throne and the administrative institutions. He who reigns will not have any properties of his o wn once all in the State represents his patrimony, or else the one would be in contradiction to the other; the fac t of holding private means would destroy the right of property in the common possession of all. Relatives of him who reigns, his heirs excepted, who will be maintained by the resources of the Stat e, must enter the ranks of servants of the State or must wo rk to obtain the right to property; the privilege o f royal blood must not serve for spoiling the treasury. Purchase, receipt of money or inheritance will be subject to the payment of a stamp progressive tax. Any transfer of property, whether money or other, witho ut evidence of payment of this tax, which will be s trictly registered by names, will render the former holder liable to pay interest on the tax from the moment o f the transfer of these sums up to the discovery of his e vasion of declaration of the transfer. Transfer doc uments must be presented weekly at the local treasury office wi th notifications of the name, surname and permanent place of residence of the former and the new holder of the p roperty. This transfer with the register of names m ust begin from a definite sum which exceeds the ordinary expe nses of buying and selling of necessaries, and thes e will be subject to payment only by a stamp impost of a defi nite percentage of the unit. Just estimate how many times such taxes as these will cover the revenue of the goyim States. The State exchequer will have to maintain a defin ite complement of reserve sums, and all that is col lected above that complement must be returned into circula tion. From these sums will be organised public work s. The initiative in works of this kind, proceeding from S tate sources, will bind the working class firmly to the interests of the State and to those who reign. From these sam e sums also a part will be set aside as rewards of inventiveness and productiveness. On no account should so much as a single unit abo ve the definite and freely estimated sums be retain ed in the State treasuries, for money exists to be circulated and any kind of stagnation of money acts ruinously on the running of the State machinery, for which it is the lubricant; stagnation of the lubricant may stop th e regular working of the mechanism. The substitution of interest-bearing paper for a part of the token of exchange has produced exactly this stagnation. The consequence of this circumstance ar e already sufficiently noticeable. A court of account will also be instituted by us, and in it the ruler will find at any moment a full account of State income and expenditure, with the exception of the current monthly account, not yet made up, and that of the preceding month, which will not yet have been d elivered. The one and only person who will have no interest in robbing the State is its owner, the ruler. This is why his personal control will remove the possibility of lea kages or extravagances. The representative function of the ruler at recep tions for the sake of etiquette, which absorbs so m uch invaluable time, will be abolished in order that th e ruler may have time for control and consideration s. His power will not then be split up into fractional par ts among time-serving favourites who surround the t hrone for its pomp and splendour, and are interested only in their own and not in the common interests of the St ate. Economic crises have been produced by us for the goyim by no other means than the withdrawal of mone y from circulation. Huge capitals have stagnated, wit hdrawing money from States which were constantly ob liged to apply to those same stagnant capitals for loans. These loans burdened the finances of the State wit h the payment of interest and made them the bond slaves o f these capitals .... The concentration of industry in the hands of capitalists out of the hands of small mast ers has drained away all the juices of the peoples and with them also of the States ...."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" The present issue of money in general does not co rrespond with the requirements per head, and cannot therefore satisfy all the needs of the workers. The issue of money ought to correspond with the growth of population and thereby children also must absolutel y be reckoned as consumers of currency from the day of their birth. The revision of issue is a material qu estion for the whole world. You are aware that the gold standard has been the ruin of the States which adopted it, for it has no t been able to satisfy the demands for money, the more so that we have removed gold from circulation as far as pos sible. With us the standard that must be introduced is t he cost of working-man power, whether it be reckone d in paper or in wood. We shall make the issue of money in accordance with the normal requirements of each subject, adding to the quantity with every birth an d subtracting with every death. The accounts will be managed by each department ( the French administrative division), each circle. In order that there may be no delays in the payin g out of money for State needs the sums and terms o f such payments will be fixed by decree of the ruler; this will abolish the protection by a ministry of one i nstitution to the detriment of others. The budgets of income and expenditure will be car ried out side by side that they may not be obscured by distance one to another. The reforms projected by us in the financial inst itutions and principles of the goyim will be clothe d by us in such forms as will alarm nobody. We shall point out the necessity of reforms in consequence of the dis orderly darkness into which the goyim by their irregulariti es have plunged the finances. The first irregularit y, as we shall point out, consists in their beginning with d rawing up a single budget which increases year afte r year owing to the following cause: this budget is dragge d out to half the year, then they demand a budget t o put things right, and this they expend in three months, after which they ask for a supplementary budget, a nd all this ends with a liquidation budget. But, as the budget of the following year is drawn up in accordance wit h the sum of the total addition, the annual departure from th e normal reaches as much as 50 per cent, in a year, and so the annual budget is trebled in ten years. Thanks to su ch methods, allowed-by the carelessness of the goy States, their treasuries are empty. The period of loans sup ervenes, and that has swallowed up remainders and b rought all the goy States to bankruptcy. You understand perfectly that economic arrangemen ts of this kind, which have been suggested to the g oyim by us, cannot be carried on by us. Every kind of loan proves infirmity in the State an d a want of understanding of the rights of the Stat e. Loans hang like a sword of Damocles over the heads of rul ers, who, instead of taking from their subjects by a temporary tax, come begging with outstretched palm to our bankers. Foreign loans are leeches which the re is no possibility of removing from the body of the State until they fall off by themselves or the State flin gs them off. But the goy States do not tear them off; they persi st in putting more on to themselves so that they mu st inevitably perish, drained by voluntary blood letti ng. What also indeed is, in substance, a loan, especi ally a foreign loan? A loan is—an issue of governme nt bills of exchange containing a percentage obligation commens urate to the sum of the loan capital. If the loan b ears a charge of 5 per cent., then in twenty years the Sta te vainly pays away in interest a sum equal to the loan borrowed, in forty years it is paying a double sum, in sixty treble—and all the while the debt remains an unpaid debt. From this calculation it is obvious that with any form of taxation per head the State is baling out the last coppers of the poor taxpayers in order to settle ac counts with wealthy foreigners, from whom it has bo rrowed money instead of collecting these coppers for its o wn needs without the additional interest. So long as loans were internal the goyim only shu ffled their money from the pockets of the poor to t hose of the rich, but when we bought up the necessary perso n in order to transfer loans into the external sphe re all the wealth of States flowed into our cash-boxes and all the goyim began to pay us the tribute of subjects."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" If the superficiality of goy kings on their thron es in regard to State affairs and the venality of m inisters or the want of understanding of financial matters on the p art of other ruling persons have made their countri es debtors to our treasuries to amounts quite impossible to pa y, it has not been accomplished without on our part heavy expenditure of trouble and money. Stagnation of money will not be allowed by us and therefore there will be no State interest-bearing paper, except a one-per-cent. series, so that there will b e no payment of interest to leeches that suck all t he strength out of the State. The right to issue interest-bearing p aper will be given exclusively to industrial compan ies who will find no difficulty in paying out of profits, wherea s the State does not make interest on borrowed mone y like these companies, for the State borrows to spend and not to use in operations. Industrial papers will be bought also by the gove rnment which from being as now a payer of tribute b y loan operations will be transformed into a lender of mon ey at a profit. This measure will stop the stagnati on of money, parasitic profits, and idleness all of which were useful for us among the goyim so long as they were independent but are not desirable under our rule. How clear is the undeveloped power of thought of the purely brute brains of the goyim, as expressed in the fact that they have been borrowing from us with pay ment of interest without ever thinking that all the same these very moneys, plus an addition for payment of interest, must be got by them from their own State pockets in order to settle up with us. What could have been simpler than to take the money they wanted from th eir own people? But it is a proof of the genius of our chosen min d that we have contrived to present the matter of l oans to them in such a light that they have even seen in them an advantage for themselves. Our accounts, which we shall present when the tim e comes in the light of centuries of experience gai ned by experiments made by us on the goy States, will be d istinguished by clearness and definiteness and will show at a glance to all men the advantage of our innovation s. They will put an end to those abuses to which we owe our mastery over the goyim, but which cannot be allowed in our Kingdom. We shall so hedge about our system of accounting that neither the ruler nor the most insignificant p ublic servant will be in a position to divert even the sm allest sum from its destination without detection o r to direct it in another direction except that which will be once fixed in a definite plan of action. And without a definite plan it is impossible to r ule. Marching along an undetermined road and with undetermined resources brings heroes and demi-gods to ruin. The goy rulers, whom we once upon a time advised sh ould be distracted from State occupations by representative receptions, observances of etiquette , and entertainments, were only screens for our rul e. The accounts of favourite courtiers who replaced them i n the sphere of affairs were drawn up for them by o ur agents, and every time gave satisfaction to short-s ighted minds by promises that in the future economi es and improvements were foreseen .... Economies from what ? From new taxes?—were questions that might have been but were not asked by those who read our accou nts and projects. You know to what they have been brought by this c arelessness, at what a pitch of financial disorder they have arrived, notwithstanding the astonishing industry o f their peoples. PROTOCOL 21 LOANS AND CREDIT Bankruptcy—Abolition of money markets. To what I reported to you at the last meeting I s hall now add a detailed explanation of internal loa ns. Of foreign loans I shall say nothing more, because the y have fed us with the national moneys of the goyim , but for our State there will be no foreigners, that is, not hing external."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" We have taken advantage of the venality of admini strators and the slackness of rulers to get our mon eys twice, thrice and more times over by lending to the goy go vernments moneys which were not all needed by the S tates. Could anyone do the like in regard to us? .... Ther efore, I shall only deal with details of internal l oans. States announce that such a loan is to be conclud ed and open subscriptions for their own bills of ex change, that is, for their interest-bearing paper. That the y may be within the reach of all the price is deter mined at from a hundred to a thousand; and a discount is made for the earliest subscribers. Next day, by artificial means, the price of them goes up, alleged reason being that ev eryone is rushing to buy them. In a few days the tr easury safes are, as they say, overflowing, and there's mo re money than they can do with (why then take it?) The subscription, it is alleged, covers many times over the issue total of the loan; in this lies the whol e stage effect—look you, they say, what confidence is shown in the government's bills of exchange. But when the comedy is played out there emerges t he fact that a debit, and an exceedingly burdensome debit, has been created. For the payment of interest it be comes necessary to have recourse to new loans, whic h do not swallow up but only add to the capital debt. And, w hen this credit is exhausted it becomes necessary b y new taxes to cover, not the loan, but only the interest on it. These taxes are a debit employed to cover a debit. Later comes the time for conversions, but they di minish the payment of interest without covering the debt, and besides they cannot be made without the consent of the lenders; on announcing a conversion a proposal is made to return the money to those who are not willing to convert their paper. If everybody expressed his unwillingness and demanded his money back, the gove rnment would be hoisted on their own petard and wou ld be found insolvent and unable to pay the proposed s ums. By good luck the subjects of the goy governmen ts, knowing nothing about financial affairs, have alway s preferred losses on exchange and diminution of in terest to the risk of new investments of their moneys, and ha ve thereby many a time enabled these governments to throw off their shoulders a debit of several millions. Nowadays, with external loans, these tricks canno t be played by the goyim for they know that we shal l demand all our moneys back. In this way an acknowledged bankruptcy will best prove to the various countries the absence of any m eans between the interests of the peoples and those who rule them. I beg you to concentrate your particular attentio n upon this point and upon the following: nowadays all internal loans are consolidated by so-called flying loans, that is, such as have terms of payment more or less near. These debts consist of moneys paid into the s avings banks and reserve funds. If left for long at the disposition of a government these funds evaporate i n the payment of interest on foreign loans, and are replaced by the deposit of equivalent amount of rents. And these last it is, which patch up all the leak s in the State treasuries of the goyim. When we ascend the throne of the world all these financial and similar shifts, as being not in accor d with our interests, will be swept away so as not to leave a trace, as also will be destroyed all money markets, since we shall not allow the prestige of our power to be sha ken by fluctuations of prices set upon our values, which we shall announce by law at the price which represents their full worth without any possibility of loweri ng or raising. (Raising gives the pretext for lowering, w hich indeed was where we made a beginning in relati on to the values of the goyim.) We shall replace the money markets by grandiose g overnment credit institutions, the object of which will be to fix the price of industrial values in accordance wi th government views. These institutions will be in a position to fling upon the market five hundred millions of i ndustrial paper in one day, or to buy up for the sa me amount. In this way all industrial undertakings will come i nto dependence upon us. You may imagine for yoursel ves what immense power we shall thereby secure for ours elves ....

On this subject there remains still a little for me to add. In our hands is the greatest power of our day—gol d: in two days we can procure from our storehouses any quantity we may please. Surely there is no need to seek further proof tha t our rule is predestined by God?

We shall make plain therewith that freedom does not c onsist in dissipation and in the right of unbridled licence a ny more than the dignity and force of a man do not consist in the right for everyone to promulgate destructive pr inciples in the nature of freedom of conscience, eq uality and the like. The freedom of the person in no wise cons ists in the right to agitate oneself and others by abominable speeches before disorderly mobs, for true freedom c onsists in the inviolability of the person who hono urably and strictly observes all the laws of life in commo n, and human dignity is wrapped up in consciousness of the rights and also of the absence of rights of each, a nd not wholly and solely in fantastic imaginings ab out the subject of one's ego.

That the peoples may become accustomed to obedien ce it is necessary to instil lessons of humility an d therefore to reduce the production of articles of l uxury. By this we shall improve morals which have b een debased by emulation in the sphere of luxury. We sh all re-establish small master production which will mean laying a mine under the private capital of manufact urers. This is indispensable also for the reason th at manufacturers on the grand scale often move, though not always consciously, the thoughts of the masses in directions against the government. A people of smal l masters knows nothing of unemployment and this bi nds them closely with existing order, and consequently with the firmness of authority. Unemployment is a m ost perilous thing for a government. For us its part wi ll have been played out the moment authority is tra nsferred into our hands. Drunkenness will also be prohibited by law and punishable as a crime against the human ness of man who is turned into a brute under the influence of alcohol. Subjects, I repeat once more, give blin d obedience only to the strong hand which is absolute ly independent of them, for in it they feel the swo rd of defence and support against social scourges .... Wh at do they want with an angelic spirit in a king? W hat they must see in him is the personification of force and power. The supreme lord who will replace all existing ru lers, dragging on their existence among societies d emoralised by us, societies that have denied even the authorit y of God, from whose midst breaks out on all sides the fire of anarchy, must first of all proceed to quench this a ll-devouring flame.

PROTOCOL 24 QUALITIES OF THE RULER Selecting and training the seed of David. I pass now to the method of confirming the dynast ic roots of King David to the last strata of the ea rth. This confirmation will first and foremost be included in that in which to this day has rested the force of conservatism by our learned elders of the conduct of all the aff airs of the world, in the directing of the educatio n of thought of all humanity. Certain members of the seed of David will prepare the kings and their heirs, sejecting not by right of heritage but by eminent capacities, inducting them into the most secret mysteries of the political, into scheme s of government, but providing always that none may come to know the secrets. The object of this mode of ac tion is that all may know that government cannot be entrust ed to those who have not been inducted into the sec ret places of its art .... To these persons only will be taught the practical application of the aforenamed plans by comparison o f the experiences of many centuries, all the observations on the politico-economic moves and social sciences —in a word, all the spirit of laws which have been unshak ably established by nature herself for the regulati on of the relations of humanity. Direct heirs will often be set aside from ascendi ng the throne if in their time of training they exh ibit frivolity, softness and other qualities that are the ruin of a uthority, which render them incapable of governing and in themselves dangerous for kingly office. Only those who are unconditionally capable of fir m, even cruel, direct rule will receive the reins o f power from our learned elders. In case of falling sick with weakness of will or other form of incapacity, kings must by law hand ov er the reins of rule to new and capable hands .... The king's plans of action for the current moment , and all the more so for the future, will be unkno wn, even to those who are called his closest counsellors. Only the king and the three who stood sponsor for him will know what is coming. In the person of the king who with unbending will is master of himself and of humanity all will disc ern as it were fate with its mysterious ways. None will know what the king wishes to attain by his dispositions, and therefore none will dare to stand across an unknown path."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" It is understood that the brain reservoir of the king must correspond in capacity to the plan of gov ernment it has to contain.

This ensures the necessary clinching of the two forces which are now divided one from anot her by us by the terror. This terror was indispensable for us till the tim e comes for both these forces separately to fall un der our influence. The king of the Jews must not be at the mercy of his passions, and especially of sensuality: on no s ide of his character must he give brute instincts power over h is mind. Sensuality worse than all else disorganise s the capacities of the mind and clearness of views; dist racting the thoughts to the worst and most brutal s ide of human activity.

CONCLUDING PASSAGE FROM THE EPILOGUE OF NILUS (Edition of 1905) According to the testament of Montefiore, Zion is not sparing, either of money or of any other means , to achieve its ends. In our day, all the governments o f the entire world are consciously or unconsciously submissive to the commands of this great Supergover nment of Zion, because all the bonds and securities are in its hands; for all countries are indebted to the Je ws for sums which they will never be able to pay. A ll affairs— industry, commerce, and diplomacy —are in the hands of Zion. It is by means of its capital loans that it has enslaved all nations. By keeping education on purel y materialistic lines, the Jews have loaded the Gen tiles with heavy chains with which they have harnessed them to their \" Supergovernment\". The end of national liberty is near, therefore pe rsonal freedom is approaching its close; for true l iberty cannot exist where Zion uses the lever of its gold to rule the masses and dominate the most respectable and e nlightened class of society. \" He that hath ears to hear, let him hear \". It is nearly four years since the Protocols of th e Elders of Zion came into my possession. Only God knows what efforts I have made to bring them to general n otice—in vain—and even to warn those in power, by disclosing the causes of the storm about to break o n apathetic Russia who seems, in her misfortune, to have lost all notion of what is going on around her. And it is only now when I fear it may be too late , that I have succeeded in publishing my work, hopi ng to put on their guard those who still have ears to hear an d eyes to see.

A FEW ILLUSTRATIVE FACTS Jacob Brafmann and his Work About the middle of the last century, Jacob Brafm ann, a Jewish rabbi in Russia, became a convert to Christianity and spent the rest of his life endeavo uring to throw light on the Jewish questions in gen eral, and on the situation in Russia in particular, both in the interest of gentiles and of the Jews themselves. Hi s two works, The Book of the Kahal,1 and The Jewish Brotherhoods ,* were first published at government expense some sixty years ago and are still the best source of in formation on many points. Brafmann's story, given i n his own words in the preface to the Book of the Kahal, is r eprinted here :* \"During his majesty's (Alexander II) stay at Mins k in 1858, I submitted to him a report on the socia l status and organization of the Jews in Russia. Some time after , by order of the holy synod (April 29, 1859), I wa s called to St. Petersburg in connection with the report, and w as subsequently (May 13, 1860) appointed professor of Hebrew at the Minsk seminary. I was also charged wi th finding a means for overcoming the obstacles to conversion to Christianity set up by the Jews ... T horoughly familiar with the Jewish question (as I h ad professed Judaism till the age of thirty-four), I k new where to draw the materials necessary for the w ork, and the archbishop of Minsk furnished me with the means . My task was facilitated by the co-operation of se veral enlightened Jews4. I thus obtained valuable materia l which served not only for the work in hand, but a lso to throw light on the Jewish question in general, as w ell as their social and religious organization in R ussia. This material included over a thousand acts of th e Jewish Kahal (civil administration), and of the b eth-dins (Talmudic law courts), showing the power and extent of their secret government. The Kahal goes so far as to decree what individuals may be invited to, and what dishes served at, a Jewish family feast. On the important question, whether the law of the land is binding on the Jews, the comments in the T almud are evasive, but the documents here listed (under N os. 5, 16, 166) show that the Jews must abide by th e instructions of the Kahal and the beth-din, in cont radistinction to the law of the land and their own conscience. Similarly, on the question of the real estate and a ppurtenances belonging to non-Jews, the Talmud is o bscure; but the thirty-seven acts cited in our fifth articl e prove conclusively that the Kahal may sell to Jew s the right (Hasaka and Meropie) to the real estate and appurte nances of any gentile. The documents also prove tha t the Kahal and the beth-din are not bound to judge accor ding to Jewish law, but may hand down personal deci sions as they please-Thus, by secret acts, the Jews circu mvent their Christian competitors and acquire a con trolling share of the capital and real estate of the country . I submitted these documents together with my reco mmendations to Gov. Gen. von Kaufmann, who appointe d a commission to examine them, with the result that the official Jewish Kahal was suppressed by the cir cular of Aug. 34, 1867."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" The authenticity of all the documents is thorough ly established; the 290 documents published herewit h cover the period from 1794 to 1803. To facilitate their s tudy, they have been arranged in seventeen categori es, each preceded by a short explanation on the laws and cus toms referred to, and indicating their real aim and influence on the Jews and on the gentiles.\" As the subject of Brafmann's other work, The Jewi sh Brotherhoods, has been treated rather fully in c hapter II, it is hardly necessary to give an analysis of the b ook here. 1.

In ancient sacred Hebrew, based on the ancient sa cred language of the Egyptian temples, each letter, apart from its vernacular value as sound and number, has, moreover, secret meanings known only to adepts. Fa bre d'Olivet thus characterizes the accumulation of the different meanings contained in the ancient Hebrew alphabet:— \" Moses, in his teaching, followed the method of the Egyptian priests who made use of three methods to express their thoughts: the first was the common us e; the second was symbolical or figurative; the thi rd was sacred or hieroglyphic. Such was the character of t hat language. According to their will, the same wor d had the ordinary, figurative or the allegorical meaning. He raclitus has expressed this difference in three ter ms: namely, the spoken word, the symbol, and the hidden meaning .\"4 Moreover, each letter stood for one of the names of God, and for one of the mysterious keys of the Tarot, the sacred book wherein, under different images, is con centrated all the ancient practice of magical scien ce.5 The name of God, corresponding to the letter lame d, is Shadai, composed of three letters, represente d by A (the Greek capital letter D) and it governs the sph ere of Saturn. The number of Saturn is also 3. This explains once again why the letter lamed is thrice repeated. 6 On the other hand, following cabbalistic teaching , the letter lamed stands for the heart, the king o f the body, wherein dwells the soul—Ruach. Cabbalists affirm th at man is formed of three main invisible parts: nam ely, Nesham, the mind, Ruach, the soul, and Nefesh, the lower soul or subconscience which governs directly the material body. Nesham has its seat in the brain; Ne fesh, in the liver, and Ruach, in the centre, betwe en liver and brain, namely, in the heart. According to the ancie nts, the heart is king of the body (Melek = king), and, we repeat again, was situated in the body between brai n and liver, that is, in the centre.7 This is clear ly shown by the cabbalistic analysis of the word Melek = king."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" Three words are fused in one: \" brain \", represen ted by the first letter of the word mem; \" heart \" by the first letter of the word lamed; and \" liver \", by the fir st letter of the word kaph, which is the same lette r as ;J, but in the form used at the end of a word. It is clear, th erefore, that the letter L (lamed), symbolising the \" heart \", which is found in the centre between \" liver \" and \" brain \", is placed in the word Melek between lett ers representing these two organs.8 Therefore, according to the ancients, the heart ( lamed) is the king (Melek) of the organism and the seat of life. The destruction of the heart causes the death of th e organism and, in symbolical language, it also mea ns that the destruction of the king brings about the downfall o f the kingdom. Furthermore, in studying the hidden meaning of th e roots, one discovers that the root LL (double lam ed), still found in Arabic, means the agony of a man being tor n to pieces.9 The addition of a third only strengthens this mea ning and indicates the agony bf a desperate situati on. Interpreting the inscription on the wall with the help of the Tarot,10 one finds that the letter L c orresponds to the twelfth card of the Great Arcana,l1 and also to the letter Luzain, of the sacred language of the E gyptian Magi. This arcanum represents a man hanging by one foot from a pole whose two ends rest on two trees f rom each of which six branches have been cut. The man's arms are tied behind his back and folded so as to form the base of a triangle pointing downwards; the apex is formed by the head of the man. It is the sign of vi olent death, but it can also mean sacrifice.12 Therefore, reading the cabbalistic meaning of the three letters, one gets:— HERE THE KING WAS STRUCK TO THE HEART IN PUNISHMENT OF HIS CRIMES, or, HERE THE KING WAS SACRIFICED TO BRING ABOUT THE DESTRUCTION OF HIS KINGDOM. Finally, the line drawn beneath these three lette rs (in Magical Science the horizontal line is the s ymbol of the passive principle) indicates that those who killed the king did not do so of their own will, but in ob edience to superior command. Whoever wrote this inscription was a man well ver sed in the secrets of the ancient Jewish cabbalism, as contained in the Cabbala and the Talmud. In accompl ishing the deed in obedience to superior order, thi s man performed a rite of Black Magic. It is for this rea son that he commemorated his act by a cabbalistic i nscription in cipher, which belonged to the rite. The inscription therefore proves:— 1. That the Tsar was killed. 2. That the murder of the Tsar was committed by m en under the command of occult forces; and by an or ganiza tion which, in its struggle against existing power resorted to the ancient cabbalism in which it was w ell versed.

FABIANISM The preceding chapters have been devoted to a stu dy of the Jewish world organization, its historical background, its branches, its aims and the methods whereby they are obtained. If the reader has follow ed the thread thus far patiently and objectively, his mind has doubtless grasped, not only the historical fac ts and specific Jewish plans for the immediate future, but also something of Jewish character and psychology in general. A full knowledge of the latter—which can b e gained only through personal experience—is the gr eatest safeguard against Jewish snares and pitfalls of eve ryday life. In the following pages will be found the names of men and women prominent in political, economic and social circles who, lured by the tempting bait, have becom e enmeshed in Jewish intrigue. To all the world the y appear to play an independent role; but in reality they ar e merely puppets whose every move is worked by stri ngs from behind the scene.l The close observer will discover, slavishly servi ng the Jewish cause under the mask of benevolence, democracy or liberalism, bishops, archbishops, prim e ministers and national presidents, government off icials of every rank and leading representatives of all other professions (lawyers, economists, scientists and t he rest). He will recognize them at once as traitors who have so ld themselves and their country for their own perso nal advantage. \" Every man aims at power, everyone would like to become a dictator if only he could, and rare indee d are the men who would not be willing to sacrifice the welfa re of all for the sake of securing their own welfar e.\"2 But these traitors, when the great day comes, like thei r counterparts in the French and in the recent Russ ian revolutions, will pay the price of treason with the ir heads.3 Not less useful to the Jewish cause than those ho lding official positions, are the rich scions of so cially prominent families: their wealth and their prestige are the \" force and make-believe \" of the Jewish countersign.* A rich young Bostonian, Garland, gave millions of dollars to the foundation which bears his name, and appointed as one of its trustees the noto rious \" red \", William Zebulon Foster. \" Foster told them that the Garland Foundation co uld be depended upon whenever anyone got into troub le because of radical political opinions.

For that insensibly disposes them to assimilate our su ggestions without being on their guard against them, in the f ullness of their confidence that it is their own in fallibility which is giving utterance to their own thoughts, an d that it is impossible for them to borrow those of others... You cannot imagine to what extent the wisest of the goyim can be brought to a state of unconscious nai vete in the presence of this high conceit of themselves; an d at the same time how easy it is to take the heart out of them by the slightest ill-success, though it be nothing more than silencing the applause they enjoyed, and reducing them to slavish submission for the sake of winning a renewal of success.\"11 Much has already been written about Bolshevism be ing led by Jews;12 the same applies to it in Mexico , China and Spain, where the systematic violence and terror ism, oft alluded to in the Protocols as Jewish mean s of exercising power, have had full play. War is now wa ged against civilization in Europe and the United S tates, but it assumes another aspect. The ascent of the Je w to power in those countries is made on the ladder of Fabianism, of which Socialism, Marxism, Communism, Bolshevism and Internationalism are the chief rungs . The definition and aims of Fabianism are given by the Fabians themselves as follows:— Basis of the Fabian Society The Fabian Society consists of Socialists. It therefore aims at the reorganization of Socie ty by the emancipation of Land and Industrial Capit al from individual ownership and the vesting of them in the community for the general benefit. In this way onl y can the natural and acquired advantages of the country be e quitably shared by the whole people. The Society accordingly works for the extinction of private property in land, with equitable conside ration of established expectations, and due provision as to t he tenure of the home and homestead: for the transf er to the community, by constitutional methods, of all such i ndustries as can be conducted socially: and for the establishment, as the governing consideration in th e regulation of production, distribution and servic e, of the common good instead of private profit. The Society is a constituent of the Labour Party and of the International Socialist Congress: but it takes part freely in all constitutional movements, social, eco nomic and political, which can be guided towards it s own objects. Its direct business is: (a) the propaganda of Socialism in its application to current problem s; (b) investigation and discovery in social, industrial, political and economic relations; (c) the working o ut of Socialist principles in legislation and administrat ive reconstruction; (d) the publication of the resu lts of its investigations and their practical lessons. The Society, believing in equal citizenship of m en and women in the fullest sense, is open to perso ns irrespective of sex, race or creed, who commit them selves to its aims and purposes as stated above and undertake to promote its work. The Society took the name of Fabian from the poli cy of temporizing it adopted, claiming to imitate t hat of the Roman dictator, Fabius Cunctator, during his fight against Hannibal, whom he eventually defeated at Ta rentum, 215 B. C. Frank Podmore, well-known spiritualist and occult ist, one of the founders of the Fabian Society, is quoted as saying to one of its earliest members:—\"For the rig ht moment, you must wait, as Fabius did most patien tly, when warring against Hannibal, though many censured his delays, but when the time comes, you must stri ke hard, as Fabius did, or your waiting will be in vai n and fruitless.\" The Fabian Society waited forty years, striking a continual series of covert blows at the political, economic, social and religious structure of England, and in 1 924 it came to power with the advent of the first L abour Government, which can be called the offspring of th e Fabian Society."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"The period had been fruitful, if long. There is no gainsaying that the Fabian Society ha s been first and foremost a gathering of intellectu als—a rebellious Intelligentsia whose accomplishments see m the realisation of Weishaupt's dream of Masonic Illuminism, cleverly combined with Moses Mendelssoh n's dream of Jewish Illuminism (Haskalah). Historically, it was founded in 1883 at the time when in the realm of philosophy and metaphysics, th e political economy of John Stuart Mill, in England, and the Po sitivism of Auguste Comte, in France, had thrown perturbation into the minds of numerous thinkers an d given abundant food to the Freethinkers of the ep och. Henry George's book on Socialism, Progress and Pove rty, was in great vogue. The direct influence leadi ng to the formation of the Fabian Society was, according to E. R. Pease, its historian, exercised by Thomas Davidson, the founder of The Fellowship of the New Life, whic h society culminated in The Ethical Society of Cult ure in New York. Considerable impulse was also given to th e budding association by its assimilation of Robert Dale Owen's socialistic principles. Among the intellectuals who joined The Fabian Soc iety soon after its inception in 1884 was the Irish man, George Bernard Shaw, who was elected a member in th at year. At that time, The Fabian Society had completely s eceded from the Fellowship of the New Life and had formulated its own Socialistic programme. The follo wing year, Sidney Webb, now Lord Passfield and ex- Minister of the Colonies, as well as Sydney Olivier , now Lord Olivier, who has held several Government appointments, were elected members of The Fabian So ciety. Soon afterwards, the late Mrs. Annie Besant, later head of the Theosophical Movement, also was elected a member. Fabian Socialism, at the outset, groped its way a long all the beaten paths of the Social Revolutioni sts who had preceded them. It also made incursions into Babouvi sm, Marxism, Bakounist Anarchism and the then exist ing various Social-Democratic groups. Being, however, m ainly composed of intellectuals, bureaucrats, civil servants, journalists, etc., the Fabians, whose fun damental slogan was the righting of the wrongs of t he working class, had no keen desire for riotous street manife stations and confined their earliest activities to drawing-room meetings. It does not enter within the limits of the presen t sketch to retrace the history of the Fabian Socie ty, but the point which should be regarded as of great importan ce is that out of the drawing-room meetings alluded to above, there emerged the truly Fabian tactics of te mporizing and the decision taken and followed of pe netrating into or, as Bernard Shaw himself expressed it, of p ermeating numerous existing societies with Fabian s ocialistic ideas and principles. This method of penetrating into organizations, po litical and economic, and of boring from within, ga ve, in time, remarkable results. Fabians, mainly Civil Ser vants, easily found their affinities in Liberal cir cles and, moreover, owing to their loudly proclaimed socialis tic profession of faith, obtained the confidence of the working classes. They were indeed sitting on both s ides of the fence and recruiting the good-will of b oth Liberal and Labour organizations. The study of Fabianism is one of almost unparalle led opportunism. Fabians seemed to have formulated no original creed of their own, but were animated by a n unswerving resolve to get to the top and govern E ngland. They accepted the creed or tenets of any camp into which they penetrated and, by degrees, converted it s adherents to their own views. In this manner Fabian members secured their positions in political, indu strial and educational fields. To suit even Anarchism, they fo rmed a special Fabian branch which bore the name of The Fabian Parliamentary League. No field of exploitation seems to have been overl ooked by these socialist intellectual Illuminati: I. POLITICS.—In Politics, their range of activiti es has been well defined by one of its leaders, Ber nard Shaw, in a paper he read at a conference in 1892, at Esse x Hall. The policy of \" permeation \" of the Fabian Society was clearly outlined and much stress laid upon the enumeration of results already achieved. Within a y ear of this conference, in January 1893, The Independent L abour Party was formed by the grouping of the local"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Fabian societies then in existence. These groups, u nder the leadership of Keir Hardie, Friedrich Engel s (co- worker with Karl Marx), and Marx's daughter, E. Ave ling, had accepted, as their code, Marxism thus summarised:—To establish a Socialist State where La nd and Capital will be held by the Community. On su ch principles was Russia transformed into Soviet Russi a in 1917. The author of The History of The Fabian Society d oes not fail to point it out as the Parent Society, emphasizing the fact that the Marxist Independent L abour Party was but its offspring. Thus, leading, o n the one hand, Marxist Socialism and having, on the other, s o permeated the Liberal party that they also practi cally ruled it, the Fabians were soon able to take part in loca l elections, and propose their own candidates for a ppointments on School Boards, Vestries, County Councils, Women' s Liberal Federations, Liberal and Radical Unions, etc. They spared no pains in pushing forward the autonom y of municipalities as well as the various schemes for National Insurance, Old Age Pensions, Tariff Reform , Employers' Liability, Workmen's Compensation, etc . Politically also, through their offspring, The In dependent Labour Party, they asserted their defeati st and anti- patriotic tenets during the Boer War of 1899-1902, when they expressed their wish \" to see the Boers s uccessful and the British Army driven into the sea.\" By 1903, The Independent Labour Party, after 10 y ears of indefatigable efforts among the Trade Union ists, gave its parent, The Fabian Society, the opportunit y and satisfaction of presenting England with a ful l-fledged Labour Party. Up to that time, Fabian candidates ha d contested and won seats in Parliament as Liberals . The practice of the policy of interlocking directorates had never been better evidenced than by the tactic s of Fabianism. The outbreak of the War in 1914 furnished the Ill uminati of Socialism with the opportunity of manife sting their anti-patriotic feelings much more openly than they had done during the Boer War. It was then tha t their policy of interlocking directorates bore abundant f ruit. What one might call the \" melting \" property of The Fabian Society became more evident for, as such, it did not create a record of anti-patriotism. That p articular task was entrusted to its members of the Labour Par ty andthe Independent Labour Party who took a promi nent part in the formation of the Union of Democratic Co ntrol, which counted the Zionist Jew, Israel Zangwi ll, amongst its leading band-masters. The shameful defeatist, pro-German activities of the Prime Minister of England, Ramsay Macdonald, Fa bian and Labourite during the World War, and the open su pport given to Bolshevism by his Labour Party have for ever sullied the political honour of England and ar e a matter of history. Yet another aspect of Fabianism is the great part it took in the formation and, later, direction of The League of Nations, which Bernard Shaw calls an incipient inte rnational government. II. ECONOMICS.—In the realm of the Economic, Indu strial and Financial life of England, The Fabian Society played no less a part than in politics. Wit h its slogan of \" Progressive Policy \",1? it invade d Agriculture, preaching the Nationalisation of land, in other wor ds, the confiscation of landed property. The first blow to Industry was struck in Lancashi re, the stronghold of English industry, in 1890, wi th the help of the late Mrs. Annie Besant,14 as chief spokesman and agitator. Later, the Cooperative movement was captured and Fabi-anised and subsequently delivered over to the Independent Labour Party and Labour Pa rty. It is due to the Socialists having been so successful in conquering industry that, during the World War, sabotage assumed such appalling proportions in the munition factories in England. As to the financial \" ideas \" of The Fabians, who se basic principle is the ruin of Capitalism, they became realities when taxation of the people took undue pr oportions in the shape of income tax, super-tax, de ath duties—, and are to be followed by Capital Levy. Th e promised benefits to the working class to be deri ved from such schemes as the National Health Insurance and Workmen's Compensation and Dole, Old Age and Widow's Pensions, have proved a myth. Yet they have gone a long way towards furthering the plans expos ed in the Protocols, which aim at reducing to bondage the Goyim, rich and poor alike."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" III. EDUCATION.—In the matter of Education, the F abian Illuminati have followed a theory which is no ne other than that suggested by one of the souls of Ba varian Illumin-ism, Nicolai, in the 18th century. H aving secured posts on the School-boards of the country, it became very easy for Fabian socialists to instil their educational de-Christianised principles in the scho ol curriculum. Their attack on religious teaching w as subtle but deadly, as seen in the Education Act of 1902. T hey boasted openly of having in their ranks several Anglican bishops and divines, the list being headed by Bisho p Headlam, one of the earliest Fabians. Eventually they won, having, as has always been their wont, resorted to intensive propaganda, generously distributing their tracts and leaflets. From Our Political Correspondent. The Government is to be presented with a brand ne w policy. Certain ministers are to take part in its preparation. It is called a \" long run\" Under Fabian educational schemes come the formati on of the Educational Groups and of \" The Nursery,\" the latter designed as a kind of training school for ve ry young prospective Socialists. Women's groups wer e also formed, the members of which participated in all mo vements tending to a fuller feminist emancipation. But, by far, one of the most important steps taken by the F abians along educational lines has been their inaug uration in existing Universities of \" University Socialist Soc ieties,\" which in 1912 were finally grouped by Clif ford Allen into \" the Universities Socialist Federation.\" Fert ile seeds of Fabian Socialism are also sown at the Summer Schools organized annually by the Society, which E. R. Pease rightly terms a \" propagandist society \". The culminating triumph of the Fabians, in the realm of education, was the creation of the London School o f Economics and Political Science at the London Unive rsity where, today, one of the chief lecturers is t he Jew socialist, Harold J. Laski, Member of the Executive Committee of the Fabian Society and Chairman of it s Publishing Committee. As has been suggested already, and as can be seen from the succinct expose here given, Fabianism lef t no field unexplored or unexploited. For fifty years, it has treated England to doses of both pure and diluted M arxism, mostly diluted, as the English, by the very nature of their steady and conservative characteristics, a re not easily aroused to excesses like those perpetrated by the P aris \" Communards \" of 1871. But, on the other hand , they have been thoroughly permeated, and their poisoning has been one of long process. The results are, to the naked eye, the history of England since the War, politically and economicall y. Lloyd George's Coalition Government had been kind to Socialism, but the real harvest-time came when the Labour Party won the election In 1924 and its membe rs governed, or rather misgoverned, England. It nee ded nothing short of the Bolshevist alliance which Macd onald wished to force upon the country to provoke t he remaining sound reaction of the English people and prompt them to overthrow the Labour Government. But this show of resistance was ephemeral. How pitiful it is to know that the return of the La bour Party to power, in May, 1929, is entirely due to the incompetence of a Conservative Government, in which the people trusted for sane administration of the affairs of State. Yet, the Prime Minister, Leader of the Co nservative Party, Mr. Baldwin, could not claim igno rance of the Judeo-masonic plans contained in the Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion. He found it easier deliber ately to disregard them. Be that as it may, England was once more in the hands of the Labour Party with the ine vitable and ubiquitous Ramsay Macdonald and, according to t he latest report issued by the Society \"eight Fabia ns are members of the Cabinet and fourteen others hold off ices in the Government without seats in the Cabinet .'\" From the Jew-led Fabian Society issue the chaotic words and deeds which are steadily wrecking not on ly general prosperity, but also combating with interna tional forces drawn from all quarters of the globe any attempt at national readjustment such as the presen t movement in Germany."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" The drawing-room meeting system described by E.

Out of these meetings gre w the new Fabian Research Bureau (of which Major Attlee is ch airman and Mr. Cole secretary), which received the official blessing of the Labour movement two months ago and is now established in premises in Abing-do n Street.17 the invitation of Major Attlee and Mr. Cole at tomo rrow's meeting. AFTER THE WEEK-END PARTIES. The new policy—or the plan for a new policy—had i ts origin in a series of house parties held last ye ar at Easton Lodge (the Labour Chequers),16 when Socialis m. It is with this new policy that we are presently concerned. Outside of England, the Fabians are affi liated with strong Socialist groups professing the same ideas i n Denmark, South Africa, Canada and Australia, Japa n, United States, Spain and Germany. Lectures by Fabia ns were also given in Paris at the Comite d'Etudes Nationales, founded and directed by the Jew, Albert Kahn, and also at the Club du Faubourg, organized by the Jew, Leo Poldes, as well as to the French Socialist Party, headed by the Jew Leon Blum. On November 1, 1930, the Evening Standard, alread y, quoted, contained the following lines:— GOVERNMENT BY FABIANS tion has been made from the membership of the Socie ty, the latest examples of which are the new Air Mi nister, Lord Amulree, and the new Solicitor-General, Sir St afford Cripps. I am told that at least 90 per cent of the members of the Government are on the rolls of the S ociety, and that, contrary to regulations, so are a good many highly placed Civil Servants. The Civil Servan ts would probably defend themselves by saying that the Many Labour members are talking about the dominan ce in the Government of that very academic body, th e Fabian Society. I find that many people believed th at this organization, through which many intellectu als entered the Socialist movement, had ceased to exist .

The League for Industrial Democracy19 is the Amer ican counterpart of British Fabianism. It runs para llel to the Ethical Culture Society, founded by the Jew, Fe lix Adler, the Conference for Progressive Political Action, the Intercollegiate Socialist League, the Intercoll egiate Liberal League, the American Civil Liberties Union, and countless other subversive groups. Under the headin g \" Other Fabian Organizations \", mentioned in the Fabian Society's annual report for 1932, one reads:— \" Active relations are maintained between the \" F abian Society and the League for Industrial Democra cy of America...with the Public Ownership League of the U .S.A.\" Is not one forcibly reminded of the following sen tence? \" We appear on the scene as alleged saviours of the worker from this oppression, when we propose to him to enter the ranks of our fighting forces—Socialis ts, Anarchists, Communists—to whom we always give suppo rt in accordance with an alleged brotherly rule (of the solidarity of all humanity) of our social masonry \" .20 Not less than English Universities, have the Americ an colleges been permeated with Fabian theories, an d hardly any of them are without a branch of the Nati onal Student Forum (long headed by John Rothschild) or of the Intercollegiate Liberal League,21 founded at Ha rvard in 1921. Particular attention must be drawn t o the Rand School of New York, founded in 1905 which, ten years ago, was raided by order of the United State s Government on account of its Communist teaching.22 The penetration of Fabianism in the church of Ame rica is fully evidenced by the subversive activitie s of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America.23 As President Roosevelt's \" brain trust\" was recru ited from such centres, it is clear that the compos ition of both the British and American Governments is similar. It is Jewish-radical or, to use plain language, Jewis h- bolshevist. Both governments are run by men who are merely puppets in the hands of Jews highly placed in the secret councils of the central Jewish Kahal, the pr esent-day Zionist World organization, whose object is the ultimate destruction of all our religious, social a nd industrial institutions and the annihilation of our freedom. It is therefore interesting to note that plans, evolve d in the numerous bolshevist-socialist centres crea ted by Fabians, Liberals and Socialists, are being execute d in both the British Empire and the United States. It is curious to compare these wonderful socialis t economic plans with those which were to have been the basis of the ideal Jewish State in Palestine, after the Balfour Declaration. They were formulated in 1 919 by Bernard A. Rosenblatt, a prominent Zionist, in his book Social Zionism. From it we cull only the follo wing lines, not devoid of a certain interest:— A. The Jew as a social force in history: (1) The prophets of Israel as the preachers of pol itical, social and economic democracy. (2) The rabbis as the teachers in a democratic sch ool of Jewish students. (3) The Jewish figures in political history a lmost invariably the leaders in Liberalism, Labour and Socialism: (a) Examples: Karl Marx, Lasalle, Hess, Lasker, Bernstein, Joseph Fels, Brandeis,24 Gompers25 (b) Even unreasonable extremists like Trotzki sho w only the necessary evil involved in this Jewish t endency toward social justice.26"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" The press notice of Rosenblatt's book in the Amer ican Jewish News is headed Will the Jews again lead the world?\"27 The \" experiment\" of this ideal socialism having originally failed in Palestine, it is to be tried n ow in both England and America. In England, the centralisation of all the plans for the \" new policy \" has, for q uite some time, been worked under the name of \" Political and Economic Planning\" or \" P. E. P. \", and in America it has taken the name of \" N. R. A. \" (National Recovery A ct). The plans of both are identical, only the meth od of execution is different. Whereas the English must be dealt with slowly, and as it were taken unawares, the American people, on account of the ignorance and th e primitiveness of the masses, can be treated bruta lly, as is being done by Hugh Johnson28 and other henchmen of President Roosevelt. In America, coercion is the or der of the day; \"freedom\" is now a meaningless word; wh ereas the Englishman is asked to forego his freedom for the sake of patriotism, the American masses, aliens to the Anglo-Saxon race, are swayed only by cupidi ty and the promise of material prosperity. Both methods pr oduce the same results: the concentration of all ma terial resources in the hands of the Jews, the lowering of our standard of living, and complete physical and moral degradation.29 1. \"Who will ever suspect that all these peoples we re stage-managed by us according to a political pla n which no one has so much as guessed at in the course of m any centuries? \" Protocol No. 13, supra, p. 152.

II FREEDOM AND PLANNING The following document entitled Freedom andPlanni ng emanates from the Jew Israel Moses Sieff, Chairm an of the Fabian P. E. P. (Political and Economic Plan ) in London. Mr. Sieff is, according to The Jewish Year Book, a Zionist worker, Grand Commander of the Orde r of Ancient Maccabeans, First Honorary Secretar y of the Zionist Commission to Palestine and Vice-Presi dent of the English Zionist Federation. He must therefore participate in all the secret c ouncils of Zionism. He is, moreover, Chairman of th e chains stores of Marks and Spencer, where the dumping of R ussian and other foreign goods has made possible th e underselling of other firms dealing with British ma nufactured goods, paid according to the tariffs of British labour. It is therefore no wonder that the chain st ore movement, standardising cheap goods and materia ls, should be advocated by him. The views which Mr. Sieff expresses in this docum ent are therefore those which must have had the app roval of the Elders of Zion. It must be noted also, lest once again the document be proclaimed the forgery o f some Russian Tsarist, that on March 29, 1933, at a dinne r of the P. E. P., given at The Savoy Hotel in Lond on, and at which a large number of government officials were p resent, and subscribed funds, Mr. Sieff made use of most of the contents of Freedom and Planning. He was followed on the platform by Mr. Kenneth Li ndsay, his docile secretary of the P. E. P., who am ong other achievements, was third chairman of the Labou r Club of Oxford University1, Labour candidate for Oxford City at the 1929 elections, and one of the m oving spirits in the foundation of the Oxford Unive rsity Labour Federation in 1921, the aims of which were t o make \" labour opinion definitely socialist.\" He a lso spoke in 1926 before twenty-three colleges in New England and the Middle Atlantic States (U. S. A.) under th e auspices of The League for Industrial Democracy. We have therefore, in the P. E. P., the plain evidenc e of Jewish-Fabian alliance. We shall now quote in full Mr. Sieff's document, which was privately circulated among the members of the very inner circle of the P. E. P., and was marked \" Confidential.\" Collapsing Civilization This generation is faced with the threat of a Wor ld collapse of modern civilization and the advent o f a period comparable with the Dark Ages which followed on the collapse of the Roman Empire in the fifth century A. D. We are apt to regard such statements as pleasantl y scarifying, pardonable exaggerations in the mouth s of those who are trying to spur us to action against the ver y real ills of the times, but not meant quite serio usly. The threat is serious. Chaos will overtake us if we cannot show intellig ence enough to extricate ourselves. For more than a year now nothing has enabled civi lization to keep some sort of course and to ride ou t the storm except the immense momentum of ordinary econo mic processes and the inertia of habit and custom. It is the resisting powers of these forces and not human intelligence which have thus far staved off the col lapse. They cannot bring us back prosperity, but they ma y suffice to carry the world through the immediate crisis. If so, we shall for a time be able to live on our capi tal, the material capital stored up from past gener ations, the"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"intellectual and moral capital of men and women tra ined for civilisation and citizenship. But what cha nce will the next generation have, if half of them find no e mployment for their youthful energies, and all of t hem are living under the oppression of hopelessness and dec ay ? What forms collapse will assume no one can forese e. It may not come suddenly. More probably there wi ll be a gradual decline with fleeting periods of revival. Shrinking Credit and Shrinking Trade Modern life depends on world-wide interchanges of goods and services. These in turn depend on confid ence and credit. Confidence and credit are being progres sively impaired. Without them it is impossible to m aintain for long not merely existing standards of life but even life itself for a large proportion of the worl d's population. Imagine the plight of Great Britain if the comple x economic and financial machinery which supplies t he vast bulk of our population with its food were to cease to function. Such a catastrophe is not, it is true, as yet in sight, but this machinery depends wholly on confide nce and credit, and with dwindling world trade and social and political trouble growing in other countries th e moment is not far off when we shall be unable in these islands to support either present standards or our present aggregate population. Applied science puts at man's disposal food-stuff s, raw materials, services of all kinds, in ever gr owing abundance, enough not alone to maintain existing st andards of life but to raise those standards for al l far above the highest now enjoyed by any of us. Only our intelligence and powers of organization and our moral and spiritual capacity to work in mut ual co- operation with each other are proving insufficient to meet the growing complexity of the machinery for regulating production, distribution and consumption . First one, then another vital part of the machine is being thrown out of gear. Increasing friction i s being generated in the effort to distribute to the consum er that which man is producing. The quantity of thi ngs produced and things consumed declines. The volume o f world trade, both of internal trade within each c ountry and still more of international exchanges of goods and services, is progressively lessened. World-Wide Economic Distress Cracks are appearing everywhere. In China and in India economic distress is both aggravated and conc ealed by the social and political unrest of which it is t he main root. In South America revolution has become endemic an d all but one or two of the most solid countries ar e financially in default. In Central and South Eastern Europe financial def ault is imminent, but that is by itself of little m oment, in comparison with the consequent social and political upheaval which will follow. It is open to question whether the populations of Germany and Central Europe can b e fed and kept alive next winter and how long any organized Government can control the situation in t hese countries. In the U. S. A. loss of confidence is absolute. T he strain of material suffering in a population, no ne too homogeneous, accustomed for generations to rapidly increasing prosperity, may lead to a breakdown of e xisting institutions and forms of Government. The outcome i s unpredictable but the consequences throughout the globe may be catastrophic. World disorganization, famine, pestilence, and th e submergence of our civilization are visible on th e horizon. Why? Not because nature has been niggardly. Not becaus e individual human achievement or capacity have gro wn less. They have won ever greater and greater triump hs over nature and throughout the material field in the last two generations."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" Those triumphs have been won by an ever wider and ever bolder application of the principle of divisi on of labour, till man's powers of-large scale organizati on have been overstrained. He can control and adapt the forces of nature, but the task which he has now set himself requires more than that. He has still to l earn so to control and adapt his own human nature and so to wo rk together with the human nature of his fellows as to fit them and himself into their proper places in the or ganization without losing for himself and for them all that makes life worth living. \" Mankind is not clever enough to control the mac hine which he has created.\" There is no lack of human goodwill and desire to serve our generation. Yet all of us are acutely con scious of the exasperating frustration of our best efforts. W e see the evil plight to which we and the world are being reduced, and we confess that for the moment human i ntelligence seems bankrupt. A Respite? This essay cannot concern itself with remedies fo r the immediate crisis or with the means by which w e may hope to restore for a time some semblance of order in the world's economy. It is necessary to assume h ere that, whether with or without the help of intelligent hum an leadership, the economic structure will find wit hin itself enough powers of resistance to secure for us a temp orary respite. The respite will be a short one. We must use it t o make a new start or our doom is sealed. Britain's Plight Great Britain and some parts of the British Empir e have in some degree improved their own position s ince last autumn. Absolutely the improvement in Great Britain has been small, though relatively to other countri es it is striking. This achievement is of real value to the world, e ven though some part of it has been made at the exp ense of added difficulties for others. It has been attained thanks to a remarkable demon stration of self-discipline and well-disposed spiri t of public service and the sober imperturbability and reasonab leness of the British citizen in face of a crisis. It is in this evidence of British character that the best hope for the future rests. Britain's Need of a Prosperous World Britain cannot, however, prosper in a distressed world. Entirely dependent on external trade for her food and raw materials Britain cannot escape world catastrop he by isolating herself. Moreover that world-wide loss of control of the mac hinery of civilization is all too visible in Britai n and in British institutions. If Britain is to save herself and give the world that leadership which is urgently demanded, the fir st need is for complete reconstruction of our national life on lin es fitted for the new deeds of the twentieth centur y. Here a fundamental difficulty must be faced. Econ omic nationalism is no solution. On the contrary it is among the main causes of the world's troubles. Recovery d epends on building up afresh and extending even mor e widely than before world-wide exchanges of goods an d services which everywhere cross national and poli tical boundaries. The United Kingdom is far too small in area to fo rm to-day an economic unit commensurate with the va st scale of modern commercial and industrial operation s. The aim must always be the widest possible intern ational co-operation."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" To assume however that for this reason the first steps must be international would under present con ditions result in mere futility. Action, if it is to be bot h practicable and advantageous, must be taken withi n the sphere now open to us. Economic reconstruction within that sphere will moreover, at least in the earlier stag es, tend to draw other countries within the orbit of returning prosperity. Our attention must first be directed to the Unite d Kingdom and to those regions, whether within the British Empire or in countries of complementary trade, wher e political and economic associations offer promisi ng opportunities of effective co-operation. Every care must however be taken to secure that, in focusing our gaze on our own sphere of action, w e do nothing to exclude the wider vision, and that we wo rk gradually for the extension of complementary pla nned relations over the widest possible area. The Need for Planning \" Almost all British constitutional safeguards ar e safeguards against being governed.\" \" Communism is a tremendous extension of governme nt and consequently a great encroachment on liberty .\" \" Mussolini understood that what was keeping the people slaves was their determination to be what th ey called free.\" \" No real business that had to do positive work c ould achieve anything on the British Parliamentary system.\" None of these aphorisms of Mr. Bernard Shaw can b e rejected as untrue, even though they offer no pro of that Communism or Fascism are either necessary or desira ble. Their truth can be illustrated in every branch of our present-day life. We have allowed the numbers of our feeble-minded to double themselves in the last twenty years. We have watched the purchasing power of our curre ncy fluctuate wildly and play havoc with our econom ic life, and have been powerless to help ourselves. The Road Act of 1910 gave powers both to build mo tor roads and to prevent riband-building, but we st ill permit it and spoil our countryside and our motor r oads. Notoriously unsuitable candidates \" get themselve s elected \" (this is our habitual way of speaking o f what happens) to Parliament and local Councils. Prime Ministers get nervously worn out in the mer e effort to grapple with the everyday business whic h faces them. In the Imperial sphere there is practical unanimi ty as to the need for organizing the Empire as an E conomic Family and yet we have the spectacle of the Imperia l Conference of 1930. In the sphere of foreign affairs the nations sign the Kellogg Peace Pact and arm themselves to the t eeth. Or again we keep alive the pretence that Reparati ons and Inter-Governmental Debts will continue to b e paid; and, because we dare not settle these obligations o n terms which seem to involve inequitable distribut ion of the sacrifices involved, we wait with folded hands for the enforced default which will involve even greate r inequity and will strike a further blow at the foundations o f the world's economic life. A year ago a broad-min ded settlement would have restored economic activity an d staved off the financial crisis. To-day, though a n essential step on the road to recovery, cancellatio n of these obligations will by itself be of little avail. Its chief value now would be the evidence it would give of ou r capacity to reach international agreement."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"The Failure of our Political and Economic Machinery . Our political and economic machinery is breaking down. The great fund of individual and corporate go odwill, greater probably than at any previous period of our history, goes to waste, and all our wills are frus trated for want of a large-scale plan of national re-organizat ion. Neither in politics nor in economics have we gras ped that the first and urgent necessity is planning ahead. Particular projects often of great potential valu e are put forward in Parliament or elsewhere withou t any effort being made to relate them to each other or to a nat ional plan, and they either break down or function imperfectly through needless friction engendered by absence of ordered planning. Frequently where public opinion has become exaspe rated at its failure to get something done to remed y a defect which everyone recognises as intolerable, ou r distracted legislators with desperate unanimity u nite to pass into law a compromise which is wanted by no on e and merely aggravates the evil. It is a common occurence for a Government to be p ursuing two or more mutually inconsistent policies at one and the same time. Can we save our Freedom? Mr. Bernard Shaw's mordant words pose directly th e poignant question. Is national reconstruction pos sible without sacrifice of the essentials of personal and political freedom? For all their differences Bolshevism and Fascism have two outstanding features in common. Both stres s the primary need for conscious forward planning on a na tional scale. Both repudiate the claims of personal and individual freedom. In this country we hold fast to the concept of fr eedom as one of absolute validity. We know in our hearts that we are in imminent dan ger of losing both our freedom and our material wel l-being if we go on drifting. But if indeed national re-organization has to be bo ught at the price of losing our freedom, many of us feel that it would be better for humanity to descend once again into the abyss of barbarism and struggle back painf ully at some later epoch to a civilization capable of satis fying both its material desires and its spiritual a spirations. Is the dilemma absolute? Can conscious forward pl anning of our economic life be reconciled with the essential and over-riding claim of freedom? Is it true that what we need is more government a nd a great encroachment on liberty ? Observe that it is in the sphere of our economic life, in the sphere of material things only, that c onscious forward planning is demanded. May it not be that an unprejudiced re-examination of what we call freedom may reveal unexpected possibilities ? Our ideal is a nation of free men and women self- disciplined by an active social conscience. Freedom and the Motorist The growth of a code of law and of custom for mot orists shows what can be done by free co-operation. The law and the custom are dynamic; not static. They ar e continually developing. At the moment indeed the toll of life and limb on the public roads is evidence of th e urgent need for further improvements both in law and in"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"custom. As a rule the law steps in only to interpre t the collective will already expressed in a code o f behaviour, and to put compulsion not on the motorist in genera l but only on the road-hog. Self-discipline and collective action enable the motorist to enjoy a large measure of freedom. Witho ut the help of the code and without the intervention of authori ty to help him to enforce it, the will of the motor ist in general would be everywhere frustrated and he would enjoy f ar less freedom than is now secured for him. Is this \" more government and a great encroachmen t on liberty?\" Can we not do for ourselves as a nation what we a s motorists have done for ourselves as motorists ? \" The law came in because of sin,\" but in so far as we are self-disciplined and our social conscienc es are active, we have won true freedom for ourselves in t he particular field of motoring. We do not rely solely on the enlightened self-int erest and unregulated competitiveness of motorists to serve providentially the greatest good of the greatest nu mber, and sternly forbid legislative intervention. Yet so long as we worship at the altar of laissez -faire as the guiding principle of our economic lif e, we are trying to conduct our industry and commerce in exac tly that spirit which we have wisely rejected in th e field of motoring. Laissez-faire represented a reaction against the doctrines of mercantilism and in its day has served this country and the world admirably, but our free institutions were won long before the principle of laissez-faire was enunciated. There is no a priori reason for regarding freedom of thought, freedom of speech, freedom of conscien ce, free institutions, as incompatible with conscious forwar d planning of our economic life. A Substitute for Laissez-Faire The problem then is to find a new economic philos ophy to replace the doctrine of Laissez-faire. The great virtue of this doctrine was that it seemed to provi de a miraculous self-adjusting system of regulating the flow of production in accordance with demand in a freely co mpetitive individualistic world. Even to-day there are unrepentant individualists whose cry is for a retur n to unrestricted laissez-faire. Sweep away, they u rge, all governmental and bureaucratic interference, abolish unemployment insurance and health insurance and al l these new-fangled social services. Reduce taxation corres pondingly: and industry will look after itself. It is not always realised how fortuitous and temp orary were many of the conditions on which the succ esses of laissez-faire depended in the nineteenth century. In many cases the economic life of the world has become too complex, the scale too large, the marvel lous stream of new scientific invention too bewildering, the annihilation of distance and the speed of tran sport and communication have drawn the nations too closely to gether, to allow of any return to nineteenth centur y methods. The mere size of the modern industrial uni t is alone enough to destroy the effectiveness of t he old methods. And the social conscience of mankind has rightly revolted against the brutality of the economic adju stments on which in the last analysis depended the self-reg ulating machinery of the system of laissez-faire. Moreover, however firm their faith in the doctrin e, statesmen and governments always tempered its ri gours with pragmatic justice by intervening at this point and at that to enforce factory acts, acts restrict ing hours of labour and the like. And the rigidity of trade unio n regulations to-day is part of our evil inheritanc e from the intolerance of laissez-faire doctrinaires. With the advent of the twentieth century and part icularly after the war, government intervention beg an rapidly to operate in increasingly wider spheres. And by th is date, the nature, form and extent of government"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"intervention tended to be more and more uneconomic and anti-economic in their results, precisely becau se they were conceived and applied by Local Authorities. Go vernment Departments and Parliaments and Cabinets which still did lip service, without conscious hypo crisy, to the principles of laissez-faire. It was in principle permissible for the State to levy taxation on industry according to the needs of the Public purse. It was in principle permissible for the Stat e to make laws and regulations restricting the free dom of business activities in the interests of health, san itation, safety of life and limb, conditions of lab our. It was not permissible in principle for the State to recognise responsibility for the efficiency or remunerativen ess of business. That was intolerable State interference i n a region which it had no right to enter. The rigidity of the doctrines has indeed been rel axed in many directions and with the advent of a pr otective tariff we have entered on an entirely new era in th e relations between State and business. Yet it rema ins true that taxation and regulation of industry have been excessively and needlessly hampering in their effec ts just because our political and economic philosophy forba de the State to \" interfere with the free-play of n atural economic forces.\" It must be left for separate essays to deal in grea ter detail with suggestions for building up a plan of national reconstruction in the special fields of agricultura l and industrial production, finance, marketing, tr ansport, housing, town and country planning and the like. The purpose of this essay is rather to examine ho w far it is true that conscious forward planning in volves encroachment on freedom. The Freedom of the Consumer The basic principle of human economic activities, except in Soviet Russia, is, and has been ever sin ce the first steps in the direction of the division of labour we re taken, that the would-be consumer determines for himself which of his competing wants he will satisfy within the range of choice which his available purchasing power (even when he was living under a system of barter b efore money was invented) and the available supply of goods and services offered. It is the consumer's choice which settles the rel ative prices of the various goods and services whic h the producer (or middle-man) oifers for sale. The Communist system attempts to fix relative pri ces and to deny to the consumer the right to exerci se this fundamental freedom of choice. The reason for this is that the Communist ideal is a mechanised State w hich will produce, according to plan, the maximum output of consumable goods and distribute them with maxim um efficiency. The State accordingly fixes by decree t he quantity and quality of production of all kinds and cannot afford to leave it in the power of the human consum er to cause variations in demand by exercising a fr ee choice among his competing wants. The consumer in fact is treated not at all as a c onsumer but as a part of the mechanism of productio n requiring a given quantity of fuel,_etc. to keep him going as a producer. There is no reason whatever to regard this ultimate denial of freedom to humanity as necessary to conscious forward planning. Reasonable standardisation of some articles of or dinary consumption and some limits to excessive sti mulation of the demand for the satisfaction of mere whims wh ich arises from unbridled competition among those w ho cater to them may indeed be welcomed. But the econo mic aim of a free community must always be to give the consumer the widest opportunities for satisfying as many of his wants as possible. If there is to be a planning authority, its funct ion must be to attempt to forecast demand and to re gulate production and distribution accordingly, not to con trol or dictate consumption. Control of consumption in special cases, e. g. of alcoholic liquor, may be necessary for reasons ari sing out of human weakness, but the limits of such control are narrow, and its existence does not invalidate the g eneral argument."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" Again rates and taxes levied for such purposes as the provision of free education or for a display o f flowers in a public park involve the enforcement of a form of collective consumption, but the individual is not c ompelled to use the public park or the free education if he has the desire and the means to choose alternatives . This last example is however a significant illust ration of our ready acceptance of collective restra ints in our own or the general interests without feeling that o ur freedom is being filched from us. A Planning Authority Conscious planning leaves the consumer free but i nvolves the substitution of some organized control over production and distribution on behalf of the commun ity to take the place of that free play of supposed ly automatic economic forces on which laissez-faire re lied. Control implies a controlling authority. To the a verage man and woman among us there jumps to the mi nd at once the picture of a large number of new governmen t departments and hordes of new officials attemptin g to take the place and to do the work of the business m an, the manufacturer, the farmer, the banker, the s hopkeeper, or at least to tie them all up hand and foot and di ctate to them in the management of their daily affa irs. And we see further a glimpse of Parliament and Local Bodie s finally overwhelmed by the task of fulfilling the ir new functions. Few people to-day would deny that the old sociali st idea of putting the whole business of the nation s into the nands of bureaucratic government departments would prove a hopeless failure in practice and would be n o improvement on present conditions. Is there not a middle way, or better still a new way, of meeting the need for organisation and co-or dination of those economic tasks which the breakdown and laisse z-faire is leaving unaccomplished ? The Public Utility Concern Without much distinction of party, successive Gov ernments have tended in recent years to try, in var ious fields, to find a way forward through the setting u p of Public Utility Bodies, of which the B. B. C, t he Central Electricity Board, and the projected London Passeng er Transport Board are outstanding examples. These bodies are not Government Departments and their methods of management and direction and control are modelled rather on those of commercial concerns. Their purpo se is to perform collectively for the community cer tain functions and to provide collectively certain servi ces, in which monopoly rather than competition is, in the general belief, likely to give the best results. Fo r this reason it is felt to be necessary to put the emphasis on the rendering of public service and not on the securing of profits, while insisting that the work ought to be done on a self-supporting basis and not be dependent on a s ubsidy from the rates or taxes. In all the instances cited the earning of surplus profits for private shareholders is excluded, and this must no doubt be the usual arrangement where monopoly is in volved. It need not, however, be an invariable rule . One special merit of this form of organization is that it claims to give flexibility of management a nd avoid the major risks of red-tape, and while maintaining the ultimate control of Parliament and the nation provi des for a large degree of self-government and so reduces rath er than increases the amount of governmental interf erence. It is possible to envisage a considerable extensi on of this form of organization of the nation's bus iness. A new picture begins to emerge in outline of industry, ag riculture, transport, etc., enjoying, if not Domini on Status, at any rate wide powers of local self-government, with the Cabinet, Parliament, and the Local Authorities liberated from duties to which they are not ideally suited and free to perform their essential functio ns on behalf of the community. The Analogy of the Electricity Grid System The analogy of the Grid system of the Central Ele ctricity Board, not itself undertaking the producti on of power nor the final distribution of electricity ser vices to the consumer, but providing a co-ordinated system of"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"carrying the electricity produced from the big gene rating stations to local distributing centres all o ver the country, can be suggestively applied to other servi ces. Imagine the dairy farmers of the country or of va rious regional divisions of the country as the milk generating stations, and the retailers of milk as the local di stributing centres, with a Central Milk Board condu cting the business of bulk marketing of milk as the providers of the Milk Grid of Britain. Already under the Agr icultural Marketing Act there are signs of the coming of such a Milk Grid as a natural development to meet the n eeds of the day. An extension of the system with suitable a daptations to other agricultural products easily su ggests itself, and even more directly as a method of deali ng with the needs of modern transport by rail, road , water and air. Organized Production When we come to the organization of producers, ag ricultural, industrial and extractive, the Central Electricity model becomes more difficult to follow, Generally s peaking, organization on public utility lines seems to be adapted rather to the rendering of services in the sphere of distribution than to the business of prod uction. It may be significant that the Central Electricity Boa rd was excluded from the ownership of generating st ations. For reasons which have their roots deep in our huma n nature, we seem to be much readier to admit the principles of controlled monopoly and the dominatio n of the motive of public service over the motive o f private profit in the sphere of distribution than in the two spheres of original production and final re tailing, between which distribution services are in termediate. Methods of retailing cannot indeed be left entire ly unchanged in the face of twentieth century needs . The multiple shop and the chain store are already bring ing about notable modifications. The waste involved in the 500,000 or more retail shops, one shop for every tw enty households, cannot be allowed to continue to b lock the flow of goods from producer to consumer. And re-org anization of retail methods is necessary to achieve adequate organization of production. In general, ho wever, it will probably be found that there is a la rge place in the business of retailing for the continued play of individualism and personal enterprise. The individ ualist consumer and his free choice call for some correspo nding individuality of outlook in the retailer who caters to him. Not so in the sphere of production. The business of production must be planned if it is to possess a dequate means of keeping the volume and quality of the good s produced in reasonable relation to demand. The development of an organized Grid system for t he distribution of milk must, it is certain, lead t o a profound modification of the traditional individual ism of outlook of the Dairy Farmer. And so it will be in other producing industries. Co-operative organization of the business of distribution cannot fail to bring a bout conditions in which both the need and the will to o rganize themselves on a co-operative basis will ari se amongst the producers whether they be agriculturali sts, or producers of coal or of iron from the mines , or manufacturers of steel or of cotton or of wool. Whether we like it or not—and many will dislike i t intensely—the individualist manufacturer and farm er will be forced by events to submit to far-reaching chang es in outlook and methods. The danger is that in re sisting them because he regards them as encroachments on wh at he calls his freedom, he will make things worse for himself and for the community. Resistance is likely to play into the hands of those who say that tinke ring is useless and that full-blooded socialism or communis m are the only cure. Or he may be tempted to flirt with Fascist ideas. In either case he loses his cherishe d freedom, and it is only too probable that Fascism and Communism alike would be but short stages on the ro ad to barbarism. The Conditions of Economical Freedom It is idle to deny that some at least of the chan ges required when conscious forward planning extend s into the field of production are of a revolutionary characte r."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" It is all important therefore that we should appr aise them soberly and without prejudice and disting uish clearly between unavoidable alterations of methods of econo mic organization and fundamental attacks on our per sonal and political freedom. Our economic freedom must be and always has been tempered by the conditions of our environment and b y our relations with our fellows, without whose mutua l aid we could not enjoy the advantages which mater ial well-being brings. Spiritual freedom in a highly or ganized and complex society of civilised men and wo men is attainable only by ready co-operation in so arrangi ng our economic life as to provide the best attaina ble material surroundings. Planning and the Producer Without entering more deeply into details than sp ace here allows, the position of the farmer and man ufacturer under a system of planned production can only be sk etched in broad outline. He may be conceived of as remaining in full contr ol of all the operations of his farm or factory, bu t receiving from the duly constituted authority instructions as to the quantity and quality of his production, and as to the markets in which he will sell. He will himself have had a voice in setting up his constituted authorit y and will have regular means of communicating with it and of influencing its policy. He will be less exposed tha n at present to interference from above, that is from Go vernment Departments and Local Bodies and their inspectors. He will be less free to make arbitrary decisions as to his own business outside the region of day to day operation of plant or farm. It must be presumed that the constituted authorit y will be armed by an enabling Act of Parliament an d by a majority decision of its own members, presumably el ected by the votes of those with whose affairs they deal, to exercise powers of compulsion over minorities in cl early specified cases. All this is not very different from what already occurs in particular organized industries, but must be conceived of as applying generally to most if not a ll of the major fields of production, and as part o f a consciously and systematically planned agricultural and industrial organization. A National Plan in Outline An outline of the organization contemplated would be somewhat as follows:— A National Planning Commission, with advisory not executive functions, subordinate to the Cabinet an d to Parliament, but with clearly defined powers of init iative and clearly defined responsibilities, its pe rsonnel representative of the nation's economic life. A National Council for Agriculture, a National Co uncil for Industry, a National Council for Coal Min ing, a National Council for Transport, and so on, all stat utory bodies with considerable powers of self-gover nment, including powers of compulsion within the province with which they are concerned. A series of statutory or chartered Corporations, e.g. a Cotton Industry Corporation, a Steel Industr y Corporation, a Milk Producers Corporation, organize d on the lines of Public Utility Concerns, serving at least to federate, and in suitable cases to own, the plan ts, factories, etc., engaged in production. A series of Public Utility Corporations dealing w ith distributive services, e. g. the Central Electr icity Board, the National Transport Board (or a number of Region al Transport Boards), the National Milk Marketing B oard. In the constitution of these bodies provision wou ld naturally be made for suitable representation of interests, including organized labour, and for their due co-or dination by means for example of the election by th e various corporations of some of their members to serve on t he National Councils. To all of them Parliament wou ld delegate considerable powers to regulate the affair s of their particular industries. Compulsion and Private Ownership of Land"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":" From the standpoint of encroachments upon freedom , apart from the denial of the tenets of individual ism, the most obvious targets for attack are perhaps the pro posed grant of powers to compel minorities and (poi nt not yet mentioned) the probable necessity for drastic c hanges in the ownership of land. Powers of compulsion of minorities are not unknow n even under present conditions and will probably n ot arouse very violent antagonism on grounds of high p rinciple. The question of private ownership of land is one which never fails to encounter deep-rooted passions . It is also one which arises immediately in almost every aspect of consciously planned reconstruction. The conclusion seems inescapable that whether in the field of Town and Country Planning or in that o f Agricultural (or Rural) Planning or in the organiza tion of Industry it is not possible to make reasona ble progress without drastic powers to buy out individual owners of land. This is not to say that land nationalisation,^ th e ordinary sense of the term, is either necessary o r desirable. Far from it. Nothing would be gained by substituting th e State as landlord. What is required, if only with a view to equitable treatment of individuals, is transfer of ownership of large blocks of land, not necessarily of all the land in the country but certainly of a large propor tion of it, into the hands of the proposed Statutor y Corporations and Public Utility Bodies, and of Land Trusts. In many cases all that would be needed would be t he conversion of rights of ownership of land into r ights of participation as share-holders or stake holders in the new Corporations or in Land Trusts. It would be possible further in a large number of cases to leave managem ent undisturbed, together with the enjoyment of man y of the amenities which at present go with ownership, s ubject to the transfer of title to the Corporations or Trusts. Here again limits of space preclude fuller treatm ent of the subject. All that is here relevant is th e inevitable conclusion that the planned economy which the natio n needs to meet the demands of the twentieth centur y must clearly involve drastic inroads upon the rights of individual ownership of land as at present understo od. Finance Thus far in this essay Finance has been purposely left aside. The assumption is that consciously planned recons truction of the economic life of the nation will in crease, and indeed is necessary, to maintain the present nation al dividend. There is no reason to believe that ove rhead charges for government and administration will be i ncreased. On the contrary they should be diminished by the elimination of the friction and waste arising from the present lack of planning and disorder. It should be possible also with industry and prod uction replanned and co-ordinated so to re-arrange taxation as to take from the national dividend that part of it which is required for collective expenditure by the community at an economic cost less burdensome to the nation t han is involved by our existing rates and taxes. From the standpoint of the national and local bud gets therefore there is no cause for anticipating f inancial difficulties. The question remains what changes are required in the financial machinery of the country. It is in t he sphere of Distribution, and especially in that important part in the mechanism of Distribution which belongs to Finance, that the worst disorders of the present economic sy stem have shown themselves. In no sphere is the evidence of our loss of contr ol of the Machine of Civilization more evident than in that of Finance. The catastrophic fall of prices has resulted in c omplete disequilibrium between -the costs of produc tion and the price which the consumer can pay, and in partic ular between the relative prices of agricultural an d manufactured products."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":" Mismanagement of the standard of value is apparen t throughout the world. It is by no means so clear how recovery is to be brought about. Cheap money is obviously essential b ut it is only if and when it leads to a revival of activity, to increased demand for goods and services and an increase in the volume of trade, followed by a recovery of pric es to a remunerative level that it serves any usefu l purpose. Mere manufacture of paper purchasing power is of little avail, more especially if with waning politi cal confidence the basis of credit shrinks faster than the manufactured paper money increases. This is not the place to examine the problem of e scape from the immediate financial crisis. The same assumption must be made as was made earl ier in this essay that the inertia and momentum of the economic structure and of habit and custom will car ry us somehow through for the moment and that we sh all be given a respite. Stable Money One basic need of the new economic organization i s the stabilization of the purchasing power of mone y. Stable money and conscious forward planning are mut ually dependent. The elimination of violent fluctuations of the ge neral price level will immensely facilitate improve d organization of production and distribution. No question arises of fixing the prices of indivi dual commodities. Once equilibrium between costs of production and prices to the consumer has been re-established, our first efforts must be directed to securing stability of t he purchasing power of our money. This question is dealt with at length in a separa te essay and the conclusion must perforce be taken for granted here. Stable money cannot be secured without considerab le extension of control on behalf of the community over the flow of investment and the uses which the indiv idual makes of his capital. While as consumer he can retain full freedom of c hoice as to which of his competing wants he will sa tisfy, there are real difficulties in leaving him entirely free to invest his savings in any way he chooses. It'is probable that many of these difficulties ca n be solved on the one hand by extension of the sys tem of insurance, on lines to which recent developments of the motoring law again supply suggestive analogies , and on the other hand by means which, while leaving the sm all capitalist untrammelled, will so canalise the f low of both long term and short term investment of the lar ge sums which are at the disposal of banks and fina ncial institutions, as well as funds in the hands of larg e insurance companies, as to ensure that adequate c apital is available for the big industrial, agricultural and distributive corporations already envisaged. It is necessary to insist that Finance shall take its proper place as the servant and not the master of industry and comm erce. The stabilization of the purchasing power of money will by itself go far to secure this subordination. The Banks and Planning The Bank of England has in the course of its hist ory lost practically all of its original profit-mak ing characteristics and become in fact if not in form a leading example of a Public Utility Corporation de voted to rendering public service. It has also many of the f eatures of a self-governing institution, its relati ons to the Government delicately adjusted so as to combine bot h due subordination and administrative independence , so as to offer a significant parallel to the new insti tutions suggested earlier in the spheres of industr y and distribution. It would appear to be sufficiently fl exible to enable it to adapt itself to filling its place in the new order without requiring any radical changes in its constitution."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" The logical completion of the process of amalgama tion which has reduced the number of the major Join t Stock Banks to five would clearly be to merge them all in one and to give them some monopolistic privi leges in return for converting themselves into a real Public Utility Corporation. This is a delicate process and it may be unwise t o force the pace, seeing that natural developments are tending to bring about much the same results without outsid e intervention. Careful study is needed of the relations between planned industry and the Stock Exchange, the Accept ance Houses, the Issuing Houses, and other parts of our financial machinery. It may well be that, with indu stry, agriculture, transport, etc., organized in the line s suggested, and with the adoption of the steps nec essary to stabilise the purchasing power of money, the proble ms which are, in prospect, somewhat terrifying of b ringing about a suitable re-organization of our financial i nstitutions will be found largely to have solved th emselves. For Finance as the servant of industry can have no motive to do otherwise than adjust itself to the ne w needs. Labour Little has been said hitherto on the subject of o rganized labour. Clearly Labour must have effective representation and play an adequate part in the new Statutory Cou ncils and Public Utility Corporations and in all the activiti es of the re-planned nation. The most difficult task will perhaps be to reconc ile the Trade Unions to the re-modelling of many of their existing regulations and to the change in outlook w hich conscious planning requires. Stable money and the discarding of the doctrines of individualism and laissez-faire will between the m make obsolete many of the objectives and many of the iss ues which at present bulk largely in the minds of T rade Unionists. In planned industry the employee takes h is true place more clearly than before as a partner in production. The changes required in the organization of Labou r are obviously not such as can rightly be describe d as encroachments on freedom. Difficult therefore as the right solution of the knotty problems which arise may prove, they need no t detain us further in this examination of the relations of pla nning to freedom. The Social Services Nor need we pause here to examine what planning m ay mean in other parts of the structure of our econ omic life, education, health services, housing, provisio n for leisure. Each of these subjects and others will need detai led investigation and the methods of organization a dopted must be fitted into and form part of a complete who le with the new model for Industry. It is high time that man should make effective use of biological knowledge t o improve the human race and make himself more fit for his twentieth century responsibilities. In the heal th services and the province of medicine it is urge ntly necessary to shift the emphasis from cure to preven tion, from negative to positive health, and this ma y well call for a big change in the organization of the Medical Profession, which has at present too often a veste d interest in disease. But there is no reason for supposing th at in order to deal with these various questions an y new invasions of freedom will be called for which in de gree or in kind go further than what has already be en contemplated in the industrial field. Imperial Planning Many of the problems of national reconstruction e xtend into the imperial and international field. Th e United Kingdom by itself is far too small to provide an ad equate economic unit for planning."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" A planned economy for Britain implies as the next step a planned imperial economic family. Considera ble interrelations, imperial co-operation from the outs et, is essential as a minimum, for success in certa in directions. The stabilization of the purchasing power of mone y calls for action not only in the Empire but also in such countries as Argentina and Scandinavia, which belon g to \" Ster-lingaria,\" the area where British Sterl ing is indisputably the international medium of exchange. Tariffs and agreements for industrial co-operation with other parts of the British Empire will have to be f itted into the framework of our national industrial system in order to make reasonably possible the successful fu nctioning of such projected bodies as the Steel Ind ustry Council or the Statutory Cotton Corporation. The su bject matter with which these bodies will deal incl udes large questions of export trade, and is not as in t he case of the Central Electricity Board confined t o the provision of services within our national boundarie s. International Planning The inter-relations of National Planning and Inte rnational problems are peculiarly difficult. An ide al national plan cannot be framed and brought into operation wi thout complete international co-operation. Yet to w ait till conditions are propitious for an intelligent intern ational reorganization of our own and the world's e conomic life will not help us. And with Russia and Italy embarked on plans which definitely override the claims of freedom, complet e worldwide agreement is not within reach. The better is the enemy of the good. Within the b oundaries of the United Kingdom we have ample opportunities, if we set ourselves wholeheartedly t o the task, to achieve within the British Empire an d even beyond it in countries whose economic ties with Bri tain are historically close and whose trade is complementary, we have reasonable prospects of secu ring fruitful results by political and economic co- operation. We dissipate our strength and over-strain our res ources if we attempt more before first putting our own house in order. It is not selfishness or aggressive natio nalism or imperialism which puts a limit on our imm ediate sphere of action, but a sober estimate of our polit ical and economic powers. The goal of world-wide international co-operation must never be lost from sight, and advantage must be taken of every opportunity for bringing it nearer. The ve ry fact that it extends planning across existing po litical boundaries is of special value. Nevertheless our fi rst task is to replan Britain, with an economic org anization that will fit harmoniously into the planned imperia l economic family, and in so doing to give leadersh ip and new hope to a distressed world. Man's powers of large scale organization and of h armonious co-operation will be further tested by th e need for economic planning which transcends national boundar ies and in due course demands world-wide co-operati on. National and imperial and ultimately international political and economic practices and institutions w ill doubtless undergo profound modifications in adaptin g themselves to the twentieth century. The constitutional development of the British Emp ire may indeed provide a model more suitable for adaptation to the needs of world co-operation than any at present in existence. The harmonious and fre e co- operation within a single system of a number of Sta tes enjoying sovereignty and independence as equal partners in a commonwealth of nations would appear to offer possibilities of extending itself indefinitely till it covers the whole world. Proof of the ability of the Britis h Commonwealth to provide its citizens with an econ omic organization that ministers effectually to their we ll-being will be the surest way of winning world-wi de approval. The only rival world political and economic syste m which puts forward a comparable claim is that of the Union of Soviet Republics. If planning and freedom are to be reconciled, the solution must be found along the lines of the Brit ish approach."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Planning and Politics Effective planning on the economic side and even the introduction of desirable reforms in detail has become impossible without a drastic overhauling both of Pa rliament and the Central Government and of the mach inery of Local Government. Political and economic plannin g are complementary and supplementary to each other and must be carefully inter-related. We need new ec onomic and political institutions to match the new social adjustments which applied science has created, and a new technique both in politics and in industry to enable us to find intelligent methods of surmounting new diff iculties and complexities. It has been suggested more than once in the cours e of this essay that devolution of powers to statut ory bodies will be an important feature of the new order, and that in the result Parliament and the Cabinet will be relieved of some part of their present duties and set free t o the great advantage of themselves and of the nati on for their proper tasks of directing and guiding public policy . Big consequent changes will follow in the machine ry of government. The British constitution is howev er accustomed to changes of this sort. It is continual ly developing and adapting itself to new conditions . The further development now contemplated will be a natu ral evolution along lines consistent with British t raditions. Here as elsewhere vested interests will doubtless feel themselves challenged, and be inclined to res ist. That is inevitable; but the essentials of constitutional fr eedom will remain unshaken. In some of its aspects the Tariff Advisory Committee already suggests the nucleus of a National Planning Commission. In due course we sh all perhaps be astonished not at the magnitude of the c hanges but at their relative smallness. Planning and Economic Freedom One further question remains to be touched upon b efore the summing up is reached. Let it be granted, a well-disposed critic may say , that what you propose involves no fundamental att ack on freedom : granted that your plan of reconstruction is not open to the charge of encroaching upon spiri tual freedom and, if successful, would provide a better material environment for the realization of humanit y's higher aspirations : do you not run the risk of so trammel ling and shackling man's economic freedom that the result will be less production, not more, less enterprise and initiative, a drying up of the incentive to pro gress, and final loss, not gain, in material well-being ? One possible answer is of course to refer our cri tic to what was said at the outset as to the immine nce of catastrophe if we continue to drift. We must regain control of the machinery of civilization if we and it are to survive. Reluctance to embark on a doubtful adventure dese rves a less negative treatment. The dangers which our critic fears are real dange rs. Red-tape is not confined to Government Departme nts. Our Statutory Corporations and Public Utility Boards ma y all too easily become unadventurous obstacles to progress, determined enemies to all new ideas. It may be indeed that one of the lessons we have to learn from our present distresses is that scient ific invention itself required some planning in its application to the economic structure of the nation. The problem of progress is no longer the problem of getting enough change to prevent routine from de adening effort, but the problem of preventing change from d estroying both routine and all social stability. This however is no justification of institutions which deaden effort. Our proposals must rather be defended by the clai m that they will liberate the spirit of initiative and not deaden it, in that they will provide means by which the energetic man of business may escape from the disheartening frustrations and failures which are c aused by the complexity of the machine, and will gi ve him"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"scope, for serving his generation in a larger kingd om than the narrow field of competition with rivals in particular industrial or commercial pursuits. Though organized on public utility lines with mon opolistic privileges, the great Chartered Industria l Corporations will find ample room for energy and in itiative in performing their primary task of combin ing maximum output with minimum costs of production. Th e executive heads of particular factories will not lack the spur of competition. The Profit-Making Motive It is no part of our plan to enshrine equalitaria n doctrines or to eliminate from business life the desire to better oneself and the motive of personal reward. Subordin ation of the motive of profit to the motive of serv ice does not imply that the motive of profit has no useful p art to play, even within a Public Utility Concern n ot working for profit. It is not absent in the B.B.C., nor in the Central Electricity Board. Nor is it suggested that Public Utility Concerns or bodies analogous in character should be set up t o deal with any but the major or \" Key \" business activities of the nation. For example the specialized steel industries of S heffield would not, unless by their special desire, find a place within the organization of the Chartered Steel Corp oration. They would be ancillary to it and would no doubt co-operate with it in suitable ways, but would rema in independent. In general, specialized production and skilled cr aftsmanship would continue to be the field of indiv idualistic effort. So also would retail business. Experience alone can prove the justice of our cla im that economic freedom will not be fatally shackl ed by the effects of conscious forward planning. Experience t oo will be needed to make clear the boundaries of t he province within which individualistic effort can be st be relied upon to secure the highest national di vidend. But we do make the claim that national reconstruc tion along the lines indicated is not only urgent a nd essential to salvation, but is also rightly calculated to imp rove the economic environment of our national life. A Conservative Evolution Indeed the Socialist or the Communist will condem n our planning as mere tinkering with the outworn m achine of capitalism. To him it will appear as a hopelessl y conservative and anaemic attempt to stave off the red- blooded revolution which alone can satisfy him. Our plan is, we claim, conservative in the truest and best sense. It is constructive not destructive and builds solidly upon the present and the past. It faces the issues boldly and is not afraid to challenge veste d interests and deeply-cherished habits of thought and action. It d oes not however propose to expropriate anyone, and in requiring the application of compulsion in a limite d sphere it is not doing more than to extend and ma ke explicit and give systematic application to tendencies and p ractices already at work. The purpose of this essay is not to put before th e reader any complete or fully worked out plan of n ational reconstruction. That can be done only in a series o f separate essays and even then much of the necessa ry detail would have to be left out. Such sketch, in the broadest outline of the lines which reconstruction might take (as has been given here), must inevitably raise more questions in the mind of the attentive reader than it answers.

In the haphazard and disorganized economic struct ure of to-day, men and women are baulked alike of economic and of spiritual freedom. If by conscious forward planning they can escape present frustrations, they will rightly be judged t o be more truly free. 1. See Red Oxford, by M. P. Ashley and C. T.

Conversion of Governments into Dictatorships. \" At the moment (February, 1945), there does not appear to be much likelihood that the German contri butions to the general hell will be overlooked, and if ther e is any truth in the statements that the German at rocities have been largely directed against the Jews, they will n ot be. But it is obvious that the International-New -Deal- Peppers-and-Planners are counting on using Germany as the scape-goat to which to divert attention from the consolidation of their war gains. That in this coun try not less than America, the Managerial State—\" A ll Power to the Official \"—was decided upon in 1931 if not l ong before, and organised in the sure and certain h ope that a nice big war could be provoked and kept going while its position was buttressed \" in war, or under thr eat of war \" is so clear that only wilfulness or unfamiliarity with the facts can obscure it. We do not think we are likely to see a period of crude deflation on the cessation of hostilities, because the dog has learnt that trick . But that both individual purchasing-power and individual freedom of initiative will be curtailed by every possible m eans, and there are many, is evidenced by the care with which \" the threat of war \" is being prepared to replace \" war.\" And God wot, the threat of war is not far to seek.\" We quote this paragraph from The Social Crediter of a year ago because it provides for those \" unfam iliar with the facts \" an excellent perspective of the past ye ar's events. The military phase of the war ended wi th the terroristic demonstration of the atomic bomb; and i t is clear in retrospect that hostilities were prol onged, despite the efforts of the Japanese, to enable the dropping of those bombs. On the conclusion of the military phase, the \" threat of war \" phase was substituted without so much as a day's delay, and the \" administrative adj ustments \" referred to by Lord Rothschild were set in train. During the war, arrangements were consolidated to ensure a condition of apparent world famine. We ar e indebted to an editorial from the London Sunday Exp ress, reprinted in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of Fe bruary 26, 1946, for a demonstration that the appearance i s false. This article reports that world stocks of wheat next June will be 2,000,000 tons more than in June, 1938 . Elsewhere it has been reported that Argentina is burning grain in locomotives. Thus the \" threat of war,\" plus artificial famine , provide the necessary background for the conversi on of governments into dictatorships. In Eastern Europe t he process is crude; totalitarian governments have been installed under the guidance of Soviet Russian-trai ned Russian agents, and are backed by Russian arms. Thus in Jugoslavia Marshal Tito has been installed. Tito is a Josef Broz, or his double; there is some doubt. The real Broz, after early Communist activities in Jugoslavi a, took part in the Spanish civil war, then returne d to Moscow, where he received special training. In 1941 he returned to Jugoslavia as head of the Secret International Terrorist Organisation (Tanya Interna tsionalna Terroristichka Organizatsiya—i.e. T.I.T.O .). There is a report, however, that the real Broz \" disappea red \" under Russian auspices, and was replaced by a double, provided from the same larder. Again, in Poland, a Russian sponsored totalitaria n government has been installed under M. Bierut, wh ose real name is Krasnodebski. This man in 1921 accepted Sov iet citizenship. \" Attached at once to the Polish s ection of the Commintern, he spent several years on theoretic al training and practical courses in Moscow. In Dec ember, 1924, he was sent to Poland for the first time, and almost at once became one of the leading personali ties of the Communist Party. For a time he was organising demon strations and riots to undermine the institutions o f the Polish State.\" (The Tablet, July 14,1945). Later he became head of the Polish section of the OGPU.

Upon the ir arrival"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"at the Soviet capital they introduced themselves as the Polish National Home Council, and the only ' g enuine representation of the Polish Nation.'' The Times, and the socialist Press generally, con nived at all this, and at the same time prepared th e ground for the Socialist victory at the British General Electi ons. This achieved, the next step was taken. Withou t warning, American Lend-Lease supplies were cut off, precipit ating an era of intensified austerity which could b e held to justify the totalitarian measures of the new Govern ment. A drive for exports took the place of the \" perio d of crude deflation \" which followed World War I. This is very important. Industry has grown up from its begi nnings to serve the multitudinous needs of individu als. But \" export trade,\" like war, provides an over-riding objective. It provides a reason, an excuse, for the organisation of industry; and the organisation of industry impli es the organisation of the community to serve it. The measures known collectively as Social Securit y are, in reality, nothing but the administrative arrangements underlying the total organisation of t he Community. They were originally developed for th at purpose in Germany. The essential principle involve d is to prevent the individual accumulating savings , and hence independence, and thus to force him into subj ection to the mass of detailed regulations governin g every aspect of existence, which are brought into being u nder special enabling clauses of the main Acts. Thi s is the \" Managerial State—' All Power to the Official.' \" Managerial State Legislation—First Section Brit ish National Socialist legislation can be seen, in perspective, to fall into two chief divisions. The first compris es Lord Rothschild's \" administrative adjustments,\" and includes the various measures for organisation of i ndustry and community—nationalising of banking and industry, control of investment, and the reduction of all members of the community, except Government officials and bureaucrats (including the managerial class and labour Gauleiters), to a common level, \" the managed.\" Included in this is the equalisation of i ncome through controlled devaluation of money (plan ned inflation), plus taxation. The inflation—i.e., rise in prices—rapidly reduces the real value of profes sional and small business incomes; this process is offset by w age increases for the low wage earners. The objecti ve is an approximate equalisation of all non-official income s at a level which will not permit of individual sa vings. It is important to observe that this level may include, l ater on, a moderately high standard of living; but that standard will be compulsory, in order to absorb all income. The contingencies which normally would call for sav ings will be met by so-called \" insurance.\" This is not genuine insurance. Contributions are simply taxatio n, and benefits are the provision of a minimum income, or special services (e.g., medical treatment) under na rrowly defined and regulated conditions. Thus independence for the individual will be impossible. So long as he does as he is ordered to do—i.e., remains \" fully employ ed \" in the various jobs to which he is directed—he will be well-fed, and by degrees adequately housed and amus ed. If, however, he endeavours to assert his indepe ndence, his income will be cut off, and he will have no sav ings to carry him on, and no free-choice of alterna tive employment. The propaganda for \" Social Security \" is merely an elaborate disguise for the conditions that obtai n in the Army, and it is not improbable that once the total organisation of the community, with the abolition o f all independence, is achieved, the disguise will be dro pped. But this is chiefly a question of administrat ive convenience. Managerial State Legislation—Second Section Th e second division into which legislation falls comp rises sanctions—means of enforcing the \" administrative a djustments.\" Under this heading are grouped international commitments, propaganda, and direct c oercion. International commitments (with which the export drive may be classified) provide a justification, a \" total \" objective. Contributions to UNRRA, maintenance of o ccupation forces, acquisition of dollars, membershi p of UNO, etc., etc., are super-national objectives, and hence external to national politics, and hence out side the sphere of the individual. Now quite casual inspecti on of supernational politics of the present day rev eals that it is a mass of lies, murders, corruption, wars and de struction; Satanism. But the reader may call it wha t he will, so long as he will judge contemporary supernational ism by its fruits. He may find his own interpretati on for the expression \" Possessed by the Devil.\""},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" Propaganda is quite obviously \" possessed by the Devil.\" It is driving Man to destruction. Internati onal \" News \" is derived from international news-agencies; but it is not, for the most part, news, but propaganda, and at times of decisive importance, it carries the policy of international Communism. On the principle of ad mitting freely what is already known, it is now freely enou gh admi tted that we made a \" mistake \" in supporti ng Tito. It is now clear, in retrospect, that the Press clamour , lead by The Times, in favour of E.L.A.S. in Greec e might have been fatal to the British Empire; and it will become clear that the international propaganda camp aign against Franco is in order to promote fatal develop ments. Under cover of the situation created and maintain ed by international commitments and propaganda (\" t he threat of war \"), the means of direct coercion are being steadily consolidated. Russia and its satelli tes are undeniably police-states. In Great Britain, the pol ice forces have been centralised, the Ministry of S ocial Security—i.e., of central control of the individual —set up, and officials of various departments have been armed with powers of entering private homes on vari ous pretexts, and of securing 'evidence' in connect ion with industrial accidents. Every day sees an increase in the power of the official to mind the individual's business, with, of course, a reciprocal decrease in the indiv idual's self-determination. The State of the World is not an Accident. If people are deceived by the ostensible objectives o f socialist legislation, they will pay the price. \" By their fr uits shall ye know them.\" By their fruits: not by the advertisements. It is only atural that these things should be put forwar d in disguise; and if we cannot distinguish between words and thin gs, we shall perish. Judge by the socialism we have ; judge by falling production, rising prices, murderous tax ation, increasing anarchy, loathsome austerity; tha t is policy in practice, the proletarianising of the community. How can the sincere Socialist—the one who merely votes Socialism—believe that the tin-pot mechanism of the Party vote will enable him to overthrow the ult imate possessors of power? Does he seriously think that the ' Capitalist' Press will assist in its own overthrow? On the very premises of the Socialist, Socialism a s advocated must be a ' Capitalist' plot for the final enslavem ent of the worker. But the ' Capitalist' is not the independent business-man; he is the International Capitalist—th e Cartelist and the Financier, who control the inte rnational news-agencies, and own government debts, and who th rough those debts hold a lien on the physical asset s of every country, and who, under the guise of Socialis m, are putting the bailiffs in. It is childish to b elieve that Socialism has come into power against the will of t he ultimate International Power. The state of the world is no accident; for those who will look, it bears every mark of design. The M ark of the Beast. And? F. A. Voight, in Nineteenth Century and Afte r writes: \" The question What can we do ? has many answers, and whoever gives an answer may do so acco rding to his knowledge, his capacity, and his stati on (there are many, indeed, who give answer beyond all these). But one answer, at least, is possible to t he humblest: To bear witness. It is the duty of all wh o can do so, whether in print, in their letters, or in talk, to withstand or rectify, in however restricted a manne r, the cumulative falsification of history perpetra ted by the principal media of-publicity in our time . . .\" One of the functions of the Press is to mislead p ublic opinion, even informed public opinion, as to the timing of the plot. The public is taught to think that if after all they don't like \" Socialism,\" they can si mply change the Government in five years time, and revert to freedo m. It is not so. Under cover of party politics, the shackles are being bolted. It is intended that when we find we don't like what we've got, it will be too late t o do anything about it. And that won't take long. \" In this, the gravest crisis of the world's hist ory, it is essential to realise that the stakes whi ch are being played for are so high that the players on one side, at le ast, care no more for the immolation of the peoples of a continent than for the death of a sparrow.. . .

On February the 18th, Mr. Churchill was closeted in Miami with Mr. Bernard Baruch and his U.S.A. Bra nch Manager, Mr. James Byrnes. On March the 5th Mr. Chu rchill gave the signal we have been expecting. From 1942, when Germany double-crossed Russia, until, vi rtually, March, 1946, the international news-agenci es have systematically concealed the development of th e situation. Under cover of the \" line \" that we mu st secure Russia's co-operation, and therefore must say nothi ng which might offend her, we have sacrificed the P oles, and connived at the installation of police-governments run by specially trained Russian agents in every co untry traversed by the Red Armies. The facts that have no t been concealed have been explained by the plea th at Russia is \" nervous \" (poor mighty child), and ther efore entitled, at any cost of human slaughter and suffering, to make her boundaries secure by extending those bo undaries by the incorporation of her neighbours and the \" social-engineering \" of their populations. British foreign policy, in particular, appears se nseless. Not content with the outcome of the policy of appeasing Germany, we have adopted the identical po licy as regards Russia. To try to reconstruct our f oreign policy is like trying to piece together a jig-saw p uzzle that has a key piece missing; it won't hang t ogether. And there is the vital clue. There is a piece mis sing. The essential fact to grasp is that national foreign policies are the resultant of the natural foreign policy plu s an international component. And because in genera l the nature of the international policy deflecting the n ational policy is unrecognised, foreign policies ar e essentially unpredictable, and we are plunged into a series of wars which we do not want, and which could certainl y have been avoided by a realistic national foreign policy . Wars are actually outmoded, in the sense that mod ern industrial development provides potential plenty fo r every nation. The British Empire, however it came into existence, is not now in any sense an aggressive en tity. For some time past it has practised the essen tial requirements of non-aggressiveness—economic and pol itical decentralisation. Yet the British Empire has been chiefly concerned in the last two wars, and is clea rly to be involved in the next—hence Mr. Churchill' s speech. It can be stated quite definitely that our contin ued existence as an Empire, as a set of Nations, an d as a culture—all three or any of them—depends on our rec ognising, and dealing with, the alien policy which deflects our own. The situation is analogous to a c hemical experiment in which the results do not conf orm to those predicted, because of the unsuspected presenc e of an impurity in the reagents. Discover and elim inate the impurity, and theory and practice coincide. This alien policy has been described and analyse d by Major C. H. Douglas in his books The Big Idea, Programme for the Third World War, and The Brief fo r the Prosecution. It has, as its immediate objecti ve, the elimination of the British Empire and its culture. To describe the situation very briefly: In additi on to the recognised Great Powers in the world—let us say, the Big Three—there is a fourth. The fourth Great Power is the Jewish nation, which, because it has no fix ed geographical State, is overlooked as such. Neverthe less, it has a Government, which is largely secret, and that Government has a policy. The policy is derived from the mystic philosophy of the Jews—the belief that they are the Chosen People, with a mission to organise a nd govern the other peoples of the world. Now, since this Power has no country, and no army , its foreign policy must be pursued by other than the methods of direct armed conquest. Its most importan t weapon is Finance—money-power. Thus at the centre is Jewish State policy. Outside this, as it were, is t he organisation of International Finance, which is predominantly, though not entirely, Jewish. Interna tional Finance, as such, has a policy; but that pol icy is derived from, and furthers, Jewish State policy. The technique of the policy is really absurdly si mple; in essence it consists of mortgaging property , and foreclosing. The foreclosure is, in practice, the d ictation of policy. Thus all governments are in deb t, and all have to borrow. The conditions on which they can bo rrow are conditions dictated by the policy of Inter national"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Finance, and put forward as principles of \"sound fi nance.\" Now financial policy dictates economic poli cy, and economic policy, as things are, delimits politics s o-called. Theoretically, virtually the assets of the whole world are mortgaged to the banking system—i.e., the Money Power; legally, there is no reason why the Money Po wer should not take possession. But practically it is impossible, because public opinion would revolt; so that some form of police force to prevent revolt m ust be established. So that over and above the purely fina ncial technique by which the Money Power has establ ished its claim to ownership of the world, on behalf of i ts hidden masters, politics have been controlled so as to lead to a world police-force. This is being achieved by the elimination of nati ons through wars, and the subordination of the rema ining nations to their bureaucracies through Socialism. In 1942, Major Douglas wrote: \"Socialism, or to g ive it its correct name, Monopoly, is not a product ion system, which is exactly what one would expect from its origins.\" The idea so skilfully inculcated that confiscatio n of property will assist in the distribution of we alth is, of course, completely without foundation. Socialism is a restriction system, as any examination of Social istic practice in the Trades Unions will confirm, and it has two well-defined principles—centralisation of p ower, both economic and political, and espionage. \" That is to say, every advance towards Socialism is an advance towards the Police State . . .\" (The Big Idea.) Nearly a year after the end of the war, condition s in Great Britain are much worse than during the w ar. This means, not that Socialism has failed, but that it i s succeeding. It is doing what its true authors int ended it should do— reduce the people to a condition of penury and slavery. Politics and economics are both predominan tly in the service of the secret Fourth Great Power. Now the operation of this fourth major foreign po licy in the world must normally be to call forth a \" healthy reaction,\" both economic and political, to it. But as the policy is a secret policy, the effect is sim ply a confusion of policies, until the threat is so obvious that a distinct policy does emerge. The British policy tow ards the threat of Russia can be seen more and more clearly to have been absurd; but equally, the threat is becoming s o obvious that only one British policy is becoming po ssible. But, of course, immense damage has been don e. The main strategy of the Fourth Power is destruct ion of the national institutions of the other three Powers from within, and the manipulation of the three Powers in to conflict with each other. As the fourth Power \" owns \" each of the others, it will dominate the world when one of the three dominates the world. But, since R ussia already has a developed secret-police system, and i s militaristic, Russia may be billed to eliminate t he other two. But in the meantime the next phase is apparent ly intended to be the destruction of the British Em pire by Russia. To this end, by paralysis of British resist ance, the strategic position of Russia has been eno rmously strengthened, while the economic position of Great Britain has been ruined. Food and coal reserves hav e gone, industry has been wrecked by interference and the t hreat of nationalisation, and morale has been virtu ally destroyed by a combination of Utopian but impossibl e promises, and austerity. Moreover, Russia has an enormous fifth-column in all countries of the Briti sh-Empire, and the integrity of the Armed Forces ha s been sapped by the propaganda of the Services' \" educati onal \" organisations. We have been manoeuvred into a position where it is too late to do anything about the military situa tion. That was intended. If anything can be done about the gen eral situation, it can be done only by a direct cha llenge to the power of the Fourth State. The genuine national s of the British Empire and the United States will have to eliminate the power and the policy of the Internati onal Jew. Once that is done—and only if it is done— Russia may be stayed. But God knows how little time remain s. Only a few weeks ago, there was but an occasiona l bare whisper in the daily Press that Russia just conceivably, in certain circumstances—if we offende d her by saying so, for example—might become a thre at. We were told just enough to warn us of the danger o f saying more. But that phase has passed. Mr. Baruc h has given the \" go \" signal to Mr. Churchill, and Mr. C hurchill has passed it on through all the modern re sources of"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"controlled propaganda. Even the fatal words \" appea sement \" and \" Munich \" are once more becoming comm on currency, and with the aid of little daily doses of instruction, the Common Man is rapidly becoming an expert in foreign affairs, and soon should be able to realise that the Third World War is on the way. Marxist Strategy and Tactics. The Russian Government is the exponent of a fairl y highly elaborated dogma derived from a philosophy known as dialectical and historical materialism. Th e doctrines involved in this dogma have various ori gins and histories, but their modern expression began with t heir formulation as a system by Karl Marx (Mordecai ) and Frederick Engels, and their extension by Vladimir L enin (Ulianov). The current system is generally kno wn as Marxism-Leninism. Marxism-Leninism has, however, be en further adapted by Stalin, whose pronouncements are surely authoritative. Russia is governed through the hierarchy of the C ommunist Party. Party membership is absolutely cond itional on a thorough grounding in Marxism-Leninism, and pr omotion in the hierarchy requires a high degree of \" theoretical\" knowledge— i.e., knowledge of the theo ry of Marxism-Leninism. The over-all policy pursued by Soviet Russia is, of course, derived from the belie fs so thoroughly inculcated. According to Marxism-Leninism, the real social st ructure of the world, under Capitalism, consists of its class structure, and nation-States are quite secondary. T hat is to say, men are united primarily by their cl asses, so that to belong to the proletarian, or \" toiling masses,\" class, over-rides considerations of nationality. T he proletarian class is considered to be a world fact; the class i s homogeneous, and opposed in interest and outlook throughout the world to all other classes which it will, \" ste p by step,\" hurl from power. The picture is, therefore, that of two forces lik e two armies, radically opposed throughout the worl d. Because of the inherent defects in the Capitalist system wh ich gives the Capitalists and their sub-classes the ir power, sooner or later, and somewhere or other, the prolet arian force must \" break through\" the line of the C apitalist forces. Once this happens, the whole nature of the struggle is changed, for the victorious segment of the proletariat becomes the leader of the rest of the w orld-proletariat, and strategy alters accordingly. Stalin describes the strategy of this stage, whic h was reached with the October Revolution in Russia , quite explicitly: \" Objective: to consolidate the dictatorship of t he proletariat in one country, using it as a base f or the overthrow of imperialism in all countries. The revo lution is spreading beyond the confines of one coun try; the period of world revolution has commenced. The main forces of the revolution: the dictatorsh ip of the proletariat in one country, the revolutio nary movement of the proletariat in all countries. Main reserves: the semi-proletarian and small-pea sant masses in all developed countries. Direction of the main blow: isolation of the pett y-bourgeois democrats, isolation of the parties of the Second International, which constitute the main support of the policy of compromise with imperialism. Plan for the disposition of forces: alliance of t he proletarian revolution with the liberation movem ent in the colonies and the dependent countries.\" (Foundation of Leninism.) (Italics in original. Our paragraphs. ) \" The fundamental question of revolution is power .\" (Lenin). In order to achieve the maximum power, it is necessary for the first country achieving the initi al victory of the proletariat to organise itself in such a way as to obtain the greatest power. That is to say, it must organise itself on totalitarian lines under the dir ection of a General Staff under a Chief of the General Staff; i n short, it must become a fully organised army, in order to play its necessary part in the continuation of the world revolution. This is the true and only meaning of the term \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\" Jokes about \"dic tatorship over the proletariat\" are entirely beside the point. \"Dictatorship of the proletariat\" is purely and sim ply a technical term in the vocabulary of Marxism-L eninism, and relates to the strategic concept of having a pr operly organized force available to assist revoluti on as it"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"occurs elsewhere in the world. \"The revolution in t he victorious country must regard itself not as a s elf- sufficient entity but as an aid, as a means of hast ening the victory of the proletariat in other count ries.\" (Stalin). Similarly, the terms \"petty-bourgeois democrats\" and \"parties of the Second International\" refer to what we call \"Labour\" or \"Labour-Socialism.\" The formation of such groups is regarded by the theoreticians as a natural phenomenon in the development of the world revoluti on. Their role is to demonstrate to the oppressed t oiling masses that only revolution can succour them! and o ne of the first tasks of the victorious revolution must be to liquidate these \"compromisers with imperialism\" who have committed the crime of betraying the revoluti on, and who are rivals for the leadership of the prolet ariat. The appearance of these groups is only a dem onstration of the progress of the general revolution, which, a ccording to Lenin, would take some decades to run i ts course, during which the deepening crisis would be marked b y depression, unemployment, and war, as well as by such \"petty bourgeois expedients\" as Fabianism and Socia l Democracy. All this would have to be, however; th e first country to achieve revolution could do no more than help to intensify the crisis, act as a beacon to t he toiling masses, and prepare for the decisive moment by buil ding up its own strength and organisation. While the strategy of Marxism-Leninism remains st eady and consistent through this period (i.e., the period between the Russian Revolution and World Revolution ), tactics, which are largely the concern of the Communist Parties in various countries, vary with \" the ebb and flow\" of the developing situation in th ose countries. Any criticism of the contradictions of C ommunist activities therefore misses the point enti rely; there is no variation in strategy, which is centred in th e General Staff (Politbureau) in Russia, and which is consistently preparing for general revolution; but it is in the very nature of tactics to vary with th e fluctuating fortunes of the struggle. For example, the recent I ron Workers' strike is said to have resulted in a d efeat for the Communists. That is not so. The objective of the st rike was to reduce the reserves of critical materia ls—iron and coal—in order to hasten on the \" nation-wide cr isis,\" and \" weaken the Government\"; and in that it succeeded. The tactics were designed to lead the wo rkers in and out of the strike, covering both manoe uvres with suitable slogans and propaganda. From the stra tegical point of view it was essential that the str ike should \" fail \" at a point short of a full crisis. The strat egical objective of all such tactics at present is to worsen the lot of the community, and increase the difficulties of the \" petty-bourgeois \" (compromising) Government. The recent Coal Report is striking evidence of the strategical success of tactics as applied to the coal industry . It must be admitted that the Marxist-Leninist the ory appears to find practically complete confirmati on in the state of the world. The end of the \" Imperialist wa r \" (into which Russia was, despite her detachment, drawn) finds the \" Capitalist crisis \" still more intensif ied, and \" petty-bourgeois governments \" still less able to cope with it. The changes \" demanded \" by the oppressed masses are quite clearly not alleviating their cond ition, and the various factions of \" the ruling classes\" (incl uding Labour parties) are at loggerheads. A fresh o utbreak of revolution is anticipated in Greece, and local tact ics are being directed accordingly. France is highl y unstable, and would detonate into revolution if fresh civil w ar could be promoted in Spain. The British Empire i s distracted by \" liberation movements in colonies an d dependent countries \" and by threats to Empire se curity as in Persia and Palestine. Financial Rules favouring Revolution can be changed . There is, however, another side to the picture. T he vital and fundamental premiss of the Marxist-Len inist theory is the automatic and inevitable nature of th e \" contradiction \" in Capitalist economy. The Capi talist does not oppress and exploit the Worker because he likes it, but because he cannot avoid it. He, like the W orker, is caught up in a System he cannot control. As Lenin e mphasised, Revolution would be impossible unless a general crisis arose. The central aspect of the Capitalist system is mo ney. The Capitalist \" produces for profit,\" and pro fit is taken in money. That is to say, the vital aspect of Capit alist economy is in its relation to the financial s ystem and the financial system itself consists of certain \" princ iples,\" or rules, or laws; for example, the princip les of \" sound finance.\" Thus the Capitalist conducts his business and makes his profits according to the rules which govern the use of money. The Marxist-Leninist position therefore rests ult imately on the question of those rules. Are those r ules in the nature of things, genuine \" laws \" like the laws of physics; or are they conventions, man-made ?"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" On the hypothesis that the rules are laws, and th erefore unchangeable, it follows that the Capitalis t is helpless, and faultless; the case for his liquidation hardly rests on a very satisfactory moral basis. But it al so follows that no improvement is possible, even in Russia's case, unless the use of money is abolished; but Russia ha s not abolished money, and claims an improvement; in poin t of fact, Russia has modified the rules. In genera l, however, it is quite clear that the rules are modif ied constantly, not only by Russia, but everywhere. Whether or not a country is on the gold standard is a case in point—it is the result of a decision. But the \" law s \" of a strict gold standard are different from the \" laws \" of a dollar or sterling standard. Thus the Marxist-Leninist strategy is applicable to a situation that has its origin in the results o f the operation of rules of finance. Who is responsible for those r ules ? Although there is some overlapping of personnel, especially in the case of Big Business and the cart els, through interlocking directorates, it is quite clea r that the production and the financial systems are separate entities. It is also clear that the financial syste m is far more highly centralised than is the produc tion system. In practically every country there is now a Central Ba nk, which has well-defined functions, including esp ecially the regulation of the volume of money. But these Ce ntral Banks in turn come under a super-Central Bank , the Bank of International Settlements, though at the mo ment there is some indication that this Bank's func tion will be transferred to the World Bank working in co-oper ation with the International Fund. However that may be, it is the case that there is a world centralised finan cial system. In the case of industry—the production system—on the other hand, such world centralisation as there is relates only to specific industries, notably the chemical industry, while the greater part of industry is rel atively independent, and unco-ordinated. Now in the nature of things an unco-ordinated ind ustry cannot impose a consistent policy on centrali sed world finance; but, by setting up and maintaining the rul es of the system, finance can, and does, impose a p olicy on industry. Broadly, the rules are in the system of a ccounting, and in the necessity of making a financi al profit, according to the accounting conventions. Marxist-Leninist strategy is derived from and dep endent on an intensifying crisis; and that crisis d erives from the financial rules under which industry is conduct ed. If the crisis disappeared, Communism would retr ogress. Now as long as finance and production are lumped together under the term \" Capitalism,\" there appear s to be no escape from the necessity for Communism. But fin ance and production are not identities; they are en tirely separate systems. To fail to discriminate, of cours e, adds to the confusion, for what is required is n ot any re- organisation of industry, but an alteration in the financial rules which impose a policy on industry. An alteration in these rules was proposed by the Government of Alberta, and was opposed by financial interests; not only opposed, but prevented. Further than this, there is documentary evidence that International Financiers financed the Russian Revolution. Surely, now, the nature of the situation is plain . The greatest power in the world is wielded by Int ernational Finance, which directs its policy to produce an int ensifying crisis as a result of which World Revolut ion is promoted, the effect of which would be a world dict atorship through, in the first place, the agency of Russia. The purpose is to disposses every individual of any form of property which could confer independence, and centralise all ownership in institutions themselves centralised under a World State. Misunderstanding of this situation at this stage only accelerates our progress to disaster. It must be realised that every effort is made to maintain the fiction o f class-war on the one hand, and the threat of Russ ia as a great national power on the other. As a result, perfectly well-meaning, sincere and able politicians constan tly make the situation worse. Russia is not a \" Great Power \" in the national sense; she does not want war or territorial aggrand isement in the ordinary sense. Russia is a reservoir of streng th and highly-trained personnel awaiting, expecting , and promoting revolution which she is prepared to back. Every intensification of the crisis brings the cri tical moment nearer; the greater the confusion, the easie r her task. Therefore the apparent threat of war ai ds her, and"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"the confusion as to her policy—i.e., whether she ju st wants to secure her boundaries, or whether she i s following Hitler's path of aggression—makes the sit uation more favourable for revolution. We can now put the whole jig-saw puzzle together . The responsible agents in the world are the men controlling the international financial system. Thr ough financial power— the indebtedness of governmen ts and institutions to them— they can either dictate or he avily influence policy. Their efforts are directed along two main lines: the maintenance of such financial rules as must lead to a world crisis, and the sponsoring of the Marxist-Leninist theory and its exponents to take a dvantage of the crisis to institute a World Police State. Financial power has enabled them to secure control of all the main channels of publicity, especially t he international news-agencies through which a bias ca n be imparted to the presentation of world news so as to intensify the crisis. During the war, they secured the setting up of UNRRA whose purpose is to restric t the distribution of food, and lead to famine in Europe. Through such institutions as the London School of Economics and Political and Economic Planning, as w ell as the more frankly Socialist organisations, th ey have disseminated doctrines which have gradually resulte d in the institution of a system of bureaucratic so cialism in Great Britain which has strangled private initiativ e and paralysed recovery from the ravages of war, a nd transferred power from Parliament to a junta concea led behind the bureaucracy. Europe has now been brought to near-detonation po int. Its peoples are being driven to desperation by gross food-shortage, and lack of recovery from the desola tion of war. Greece and France are in a highly unst able condition, and might be precipitated into revolutio n at any time. Whenever this happens, Russia is wai ting to come to the assistance of the \" victorious proletar iat\" and to set up the Federated States of Soviet E urope. In the commotion, the life-lines of the British empire, al ready frayed, will be completely severed, leaving G reat Britain easy prey for either \" liquidation \" as \" r eactionary petty-bourgeois \" or its own revolution. Once this strategic situation is grasped, it beco mes clear that the well-meaning words of, say, Mr. Menzies, are like petrol as a fire-extinguisher. It is also clea r why Mr. Baruch, the international financier, gave Mr. Churchill the go-ahead signal, providing Russia was misrepres ented as a military menace. The situation is indeed formidable. Now, obviousl y a strategy opposed to a misconception can do noth ing but worsen the situation. That is to say, as long as ou r policy is based on the assumption that Russia is a potential aggressor in the ordinary sense, every move is like ly only to lead to irrevocable disaster. And simila rly, every attempted denunciation of, or opposition to, the ta ctics, as such of the local Communists only further s their strategy, because it helps to intensify the crisis. The vital necessity is rapid amelioration of the c risis, combined with frank exposure of the real situation. We most earnestly appeal to those with the potent ial power to deal with the situation to examine wha t we say impartially, and to realise that a great deal of wh at they believe and take for granted is the result of years of the most careful and subtle propaganda; that certain co urses of action, unorthodox in appearance, are prac ticable and urgently necessary.1 1.

APPENDIX II THE BERNE TRIALS.1 \" A lawyer, who assisted at the two trials, publi shed in the review Hammer of December, 1937, a stat ement according to which the Judge (of the Lower Court) w as in debt to a Jew at the time of the trial. This very serious allegation has never to my knowledge been d enied. The Neue Berner Zeitung of October 29, 1937, formulated a not less serious complaint against the same Judge, who was obliged by his superiors to ta ke an action against the paper. At the time of writing th e action is not yet over. It would seem that the Ju dge was hardly the proper man to decide such a delicate que stion. \" It must be remarked also that, contrary to what appeared in many newspapers, the Court of Appeal f ound that, in spite of the prescriptions of the law, the reports of certain depositions had been drawn up b y the private reporters of the Jewish plaintiffs. ' The proceedin gs as carried out in the Lower Court were not in ac cordance"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"with custom and law. .. . The manner of drawing up the reports was in contradiction with the binding prescriptions of the law (Art. 92 and 215 Str. V).' 2 \" That seems clear and definite. Besides, the rep orts had not been read to the accused and had not b een signed, as the law prescribes. In addition, witnesses for t he defence had not been convoked and the Judge (of the Lower Court) had accepted from the plaintiffs, as coming from Moscow, photographs which had been insufficien tly legalized as well as faulty translations of Russian documents. Is it astonishing then that the accused were condemned by the Lower Court and that the Jews rejo iced? The proof that the Protocols were a forgery h ad been furnished at last. \" But they had to change their tune. The Bernese Court of Appeal quashed the judgment of the Lower Court. The Higher Court found fault with the setting-up of a commission of experts to examine the question of the authenticity of the Protocols, since the authentici ty or non-authenticity of the Protocols did not con cern the Court. Moreover, the Court of Appeal severely criti cized the choice of the experts, especially the sel ection of the third. ' If we leave out of account the complet ely unnecessary expense of the other judgments, in the circumstances, this would have been satisfactory, p rovided that the third expert selected had been com pletely impartial and unprejudiced. C. A. Loosli, however, had already, in 1937, published a pamphlet entitled Die Schlimmen Juden, in which he had characterized the Protocols as a recklessly malevolent fabrication an d had heaped scorn on them as a forgery, in a manner that was purely polemical and absolutely unscientific. The form that Loosli's judgment in the matter would take was , therefore, capable of being to a large degree cal culated in advance, so that he did not enjoy the requisite con fidence of all parties'.3. The Court then drew the obvious conclusion: ' Such a mode of appointing an expert i s not up to standard.' \" It will be enough to mention one fact in order to justify this criticism of the expert, Loosli. A few pages back I showed that the testimony of Radziwill was valuel ess, since it has been proved that the Protocols ha d already been published in 1903. Loosli wanted, nevertheless , to make use of Radziwill's testimony in his profe ssional report of October, 1934. To get out of the difficul ty, he simply changed the date of Radziwill's testi mony from 1903 to 1895. \" The result of the second trial was never in doubt . The accused (Fischer and Schnell) were acquitted, and one of them had to pay 100 francs costs out of a total of about 28,000 francs. Here it is interesting to n ote that the whole Jewish Press took good care not to mention th at this slight penalty had nothing to do with the P rotocols. You will remember what I said at the beginning, nam ely, that the Jews had included other publications in their action. The 100 francs costs were imposed on Mr. T. Fischer because of the article entitled Shweizerma dchen hiite dich vor schandenden Juden. \" A more disastrous result for the Jews could har dly be imagined. And what made it harder for them t o bear was the fact that the Bernese Higher Court alluded to a judgment of the Federal Court, in which it was stated that the Swiss Law does not forbid and ' could not forbid journalists to express even very advanced op inions on the Jewish question, however painful these expressi ons of opinion might be for the Israelites.' \" The Jews however are already ' putting across ' their own version of the trial. The Jewish Daily P ost of April 28, 1935, wrote that the first trial had shown \" th e success that could be achieved by means of good J ewish organization \". This excellent organization was rea dy to go into action after the disaster of the seco nd trial, as a couple of examples will show. \" The Jewish Chronicle of November 5, 1937, wrote that the Court of Appeal had declared the Protocol s a forgery and had held that they must be regarded as trashy literature. The same review asserted that th e Court found that the falsity of the Protocols had been pr oved. In reality the Court of Appeal had declared t hat the authenticity of the Protocols had not been proved, which does not mean that their falsity had been pro ved. The Higher Tribunal added that the Lower Court should n ot have entered upon that question at all. ' To ent er upon an expert examination of that question and carry it out was altogether superfluous '.*. The statement of the Jewish Chronicle must be stigmatized as contrary to the truth. \" The Revue de Geneve (Jewish Review of Geneva), in its issue of November 1937, and the Journal des Nations, in its issue of November 3, 1937, were nea rer the truth and sinned only by omission. They wro te that \""},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"the proofs of the authenticity of the Protocols had not been furnished,\" but they left out that the Lo wer Court had been blamed for having raised the question of a uthenticity, as that question did not concern it. \" It is a universally admitted principle of histo rical criticism that when a document has been disco vered, that document must be held to be authentic so long as it s lack of authenticity, in other words, its falsity , has not been proved. This has always been the rule in regard to historical criticism. When it is stated that proof of the authenticity of the Protocols has not been furnishe d, the cart is put before the horse. It is for the Jews to prove that the Protocols constitute a forgery, and we kno w that all the attempts to prove this have been lam entable failures. What is more, it is known that the Provis ional [Russian] Government of Prince Lwow, Freemaso n, handed over to the Jew Winawer, all the documents c oncerning the Protocols that were to be found in th e Russian Home Office or at the Police Headquarters. If a proof or even a shadow of a proof, of the fals ity of the Protocols had been found amongst these documents, t he Jews would have published it immediately. \" I do not intend to weary my readers with the ac count of other misrepresentations and skilfully con cocted affirmations similar to those I have mentioned. It is a pity that writers, whose good faith cannot be called in question, take their information from such dubious sources. They make the mistake of not subjecting th ose sources to the severe criticism indispensable in a matter that aroused so much passionate feeling, and they neglect to consult the official documents. They thu s contribute to get the false Jewish version accept ed. They consider that they are acting charitably in defendi ng unfortunate victims of persecution and calumny, while in reality they are working for the triumph of the Jew s. \" A Belgian religious wrote a short time ago that the decision of the Higher Cantonal Court confirme d the judgment of the Lower Court magistrate with regard to the falsity of the Protocols. The same author al so asserted that the Court declared the Protocols to b e ' a document written in bad faith, a malignant an d poisonous forgery'.5 The Reverend Father is wrong. It was not the Court, but the barristers for the Jews who att acked the Protocols as the vilest product of the printing pre ss ever published in Switzerland. I have carefully perused the 53 folio pages of the judgment and I can affirm tha t the Court nowhere declared the Protocols to be ' a document written in bad faith, a malignant and pois onous forgery.' That statement is absolutely oppose d to the truth. \" The Court certainly made use of some very sever e epithets, such as ' stupid Jew-baiting,' ' attemp t to defame the Jews as a body,' but these were employed with r eference to the article Shweizermadchen hiite dich vor schandenden Juden, which had nothing to do with the Protocols, but which the Jews had cleverly include d in their case. \" The Court declared that the Protocols were ' s hoddy or trashy literature in the aesthetic and lit erary.. . sense.' With that judgment we are in complete agreement. Wh at remains to be determined is who is the author of this ' trashy literature.' On that point the Court declare d itself incompetent.\" 1.

He was Economic Adviser to U.S.A. Peace Commission in 1st World War and Master Mind of the New Deal Policy which has been called \" Sovietism by Stealth.\" He was often denounced by Senator Huey Long, who was shot dead in 1933. He first made his money in W all Street and is now credited with owning 50 million d ollars. He is generally regarded by Jews throughout the world as their leader and champion, a position prev iously held by Jacob H. Schiff (died 1920), the hea d partner in the Jewish Wall St. Bank of Kuhn Loeb and Co., w hich financed the Communist Revolution in Russia, providing considerable material and moral aid for T rotsky. Schiff personally had taken a close interes t in promoting the revolutionary movement in Tzarist Rus sia from the days of the Russo-Japanese war which h e financed for Japan, Baruch then is the successor of this man described by the Jews themselves as their \" beloved leader.\" Felix Frankfurter—Judge of the Supreme Court; des cribed as the Man behind the Men behind the Preside nt.

The Zionists' own mouthpiece, The Jewish Standard , October, 1950, published the following revealing figures: Before the end of the British mandate, Palestine' s Christian population (excluding British officials , police and army personnel) totalled 145,000. Of these, roughly 100,000 are estimated to have lived in the area no w known as Israel. At present, Christians in Israel number between 4 5,000 and 50,000. Roman Catholics have dropped in number, since 194 7, from 30,000 to 5,000; Protestants from 6,000 to 1,500.
