The Creator Force spoke to a woman and asked if It could use her mind. Most of the information was given directly to her in a clear and unmistakable voice from within. It also communicated in other ways to other people and validated the accuracy of all of It's information with many small miracles. The message was to tell people how to construct magnetically activated devices for our continuance, along with some details about how our universal systems actually function. To that end, we carefully recorded how the devices were to be made, and we are attempting to share them by sending drawings and explanations to people around the world. We were told that all of these units are already functioning at different places in the Universe. A summary of the basic message that was repeated to us over the years explains exactly WHY we need to start using magnetic current for our survival. Here then is the heart of the message we were instructed to share. First, we must stop creating certain forms of pollution. Electrical, nuclear, and chemical pollution must stop. The worldwide overuse of electricity is thinning and destroying the ionosphere which we depend on for our survival. The radioactive pollution we have created is slowly damaging our cellular structure. The chemicals we release into our environment will prevent the regeneration of life if we continue to poison ourselves. Second, in the near future the magnetic axis of the earth will shift. The message of the greatest importance is that after the shift, ELECTRICITY WILL NOT WORK. The new Earth polarity will not allow present generators to gather magnetic molecular structures from the ionosphere and then form them into electrons. It is time for a new scientific paradigm to emerge on this planet. We must abandon all theories and practices that do not ensure our long-term survival. This information for survival is directed to the general population and is kept very basic. We must at least make some of these magnetic devices and then use them as SEEDS to spread magnetic energy after the pole shift. We can usher in our golden age of civilization where everyone can use free magnetic energy, or we can continue along our current path of destruction and our struggle to survive will take place in an unbelievably harsh environment. We are providing information to construct a number of magnetic devices that can supply all our energy needs. Please use the principles provided on this web site to complete your own projects, we may have the missing links you need. The circuitry, the magnet compositions, the hardware compositions, the revolutions per minute, the coil arrangements - please gather as much insight for your own free energy projects as you can. This technology will work after a pole shift. In an enlightened world all people are provided with their basic necessities simply because they are human. With this technology, food, water, shelter, power, transportation and essential material goods can be given to all people without depleting the system. In order to be consistent with this philosophy we cannot charge people for this service. We urge you to freely disseminate all this information as much as possible in hopes that companies, organizations, governments, etc. can help people out of the oppression of lacking the basics for survival. The magnetic energy we are referring to could be called the Life Force Energy. It manifests in an infinite variety of forms, sustaining all life. These devices harness this natural flow allowing us to use this limitless supply of energy. Our current methods of providing energy have negative, often"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"2 deadly effects on all life forms. These magnetic energy devices provide pollution free energy, and they will not deplete our natural resources. The following devices all utilize different forms of magnetic flowing current. It is important to note that we are redefining the term 'magnetism'. Magnetism is not simply a manifestation of North and South polarities, but has unending varieties and forms. The generating units on this web site each produce a specific magnetic current that is only compatible with the device(s) designed to receive that energy form. Also, each unit contributes important theoretical information explaining the various properties of magnetic energy. Some important points are repeated on several units. We feel that because these devices are truly gifts from the Creator Force, we cannot take credit for them, so names will not be mentioned. Please note that it is critical to follow the assembly instructions, even if they do not appear to make sense; all the necessary understanding should become clearer as you begin to explore these new principles. We will answer any questions you have regarding theory and construction. The drawings are simple enough to be user friendly on the internet but complete enough to work with. We will provide larger drawings upon request. Thank you for assisting us in this dissemination of information; together we can begin to help people think \"magnetically\"."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The Control Factor Formula: C - 2 + 14 z = 710Y + 409 430 OUT OF BALANCE! Note: We were given the majority of this information in 1985. This formula describes a molecular structure just outside the earth's rim that is the CONTROL FACTOR that governs the complete particle interchange process of our solar system. The balanced formula is given as C C C C - - - - 2 + 14 2 + 14 2 + 14 2 + 14 z z z z = 710Y + = 710Y + = 710Y + = 710Y + 409 409 409 409 , however the current situation on our planet has the formula reading something like C C C C - - - - 2 + 14 2 + 14 2 + 14 2 + 14 z z z z = 710Y + 430 = 710Y + 430 = 710Y + 430 = 710Y + 430 – – – – which is out of balance. which is out of balance. which is out of balance. which is out of balance. Two main technological advances, electricity and radioactive particle production (and the spreading of those particles through explosions, power plants, etc.), are creating an imbalance in this formula. Evidence of this imbalance is becoming more and more apparent. The ozone holes (which continue to worsen), the increase in storms, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions; the gravitational fluctuations and the sun’s erratic behavior are all indications of a serious imbalance in the system. We will briefly discuss this evi dence of imbalance. The ionosphere is not merely an \"ozone layer\" or \"invisible gases\" but it is a rim of pulsing neutrons that is the DISTRIBUTION ZONE for the energy that supplies this planet. Electrical power plants are now forming ionospheric neutrons into electricity at a rate whereby the FEED SOURCE that provides our planet with energy cannot sustain this protective rim, thus ozone depletion is happening. REPEAT: ELECTRICITY IS THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF OZONE DEPLETION. It is imperative to generate energy from a natural attract-attract principle. People"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"will s oon be able to observe the core structure of the electron, then the need to stop generating electricity w ill be well understood because the effects of electricity w ill be clearly observable. The molecular structure C C C C - - - - 2 + 14 2 + 14 2 + 14 2 + 14 z z z z = 710Y + 409 = 710Y + 409 = 710Y + 409 = 710Y + 409 governs the conditions within the entire earth system, including the conditions of our atmosphere. As this governing molecular structure is affected by electricity and radioactive particle production, our environment reaps the consequences. For example, storms start as an imbalance in the magnetic field that creates the physical manifestations (tornadoes, hurricanes, lightning, etc.) that are attempts to regain balance. The storms will get worse as humans throw off the m agnetic harmonies of the earth with more and more destructive technology. REPEAT: THE EARTH’S MAGNETIC REBALANCING IS THE PRIMARY CAUSE FOR THE INCREASE IN VORTEXUAL STORMS. Like wise, almost all geological activity is the result of the earth regaining or reestablishing balance in the magnetic grid. The earth depends on atomic consistency in the elemental vibrations. Humans have created elements that do not occur in nature and then humans spread those elements throughout the system. This radical mol ecular contamination is far more serious than scientists have realized. The future of our species depends on redistribution or nucleic breakdown of radioactive particles. THERE IS A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN HUMANS THROWING OFF THE PLANET’S ENERGY GRID AND THE UPHEAVEL OF THE ELEMENTS TO REGAIN BALANCE. The energy exchange between the earth and sun is continuous and largely interdependent. The conditions on earth are reflected by the sun and visa versa. The earth and sun w ill purge the system of radi oactive waste and a new magnetic grid will be establis hed for earth. The variables in this formula (C, z, & Y) represent energies that are constantly changing to keep both sides of the equation in perfect balance. This formula represents a system in motion. The molecular structure (represented by this formula) is designed to keep perfect harmony between the Center Point or KING PIN, around which the total Universe takes its preordained"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"course, and the Earth. The left side is the energy from the Universe coming into our Solar System and the right side is the manifestation of that energy. The problem is that we are currently experiencing an imbalance of energy on earth because of our technological influence. This imbalance is causing an unwanted change to the Y part of the formula. Fusion, fission, and electricity are creating harmonic rifts in the Universal tapestry that must be mended. The impact of electricity and radioactive particles is now responsible for the destructive distortion of the 710 units of combustible factors. Humans have misused natural forces to create unnatural elements , which are now a major contributing factor to the timing of the DRASTIC EARTH CHANGES that are about to occur. The earth, and the system it is part of, is in the process of rebalancing itself with a pole shift and a series of gravitational/energetic changes. Some people w ill say that God is punishing the people on earth for their sins, but nothing could be further from the truth. The current and coming earth changes are critical to our survival. We will try to explain the formula further: At this stage of our human understanding this formula serves more as an explanatory tool of the workings of our solar system, compared to a scientific equation for taking measurements. C is the magnetic light, in this instance, without considering time and space. - 2 is the number of planets Earth is away from the center of our Solar System, identified as Z or Jupiter. +14 z is Jupiter at 14 ° , the 14 being the magnetic light arc as it travels from the center, Jupiter, to the Earth at a 14 ° angular . The Z represents the units of magnetic energy coming from Jupiter to earth. When the left side of the equation is calculated, it equals 710 units of combustible factors; these factors are multiplied with Y. All of the combinations of combustible factors result in the production of 409 elements that structure the Universe. Y is the combustible factor of the elements. Y represents every energy polarity or signature necessary for the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"manifestation and redistribution of any molecular combination. Y helps organize the 710 combustible factors into the 409 elements that make up the physical world. Everything that exists within our planetary system has a s pecific energy vibration that keeps every group of molecules together or allows them to separate – these energy vibrations are represented as Y. All elements have a specific energy combination that can be formulated or broken down. All elements are combustible with the right energy field or polarity. The magnetic lock that holds all molecules together can be opened or closed with the proper energy field, and this process does not require heat as we are used to thinking. Of course all elements can be burned with high enough heat, but that is not the kind of combustion we are talking about. The combustible factors can transmute elements into the pre- ordained patterns that are imprinted on their molecular templates or break down the molecular structures into a more neutral polarity. The process is continuous and the number of energy polarities represented by Y adjusts as necessary. Humans have used destructive technology to force certain molecules to separate and join in a manner that does not naturally occur. This violation of natural law produces drastic consequences that the system must rectify. The 710 combustible factors are variations of magnetic energy and are concentrated in our atmosphere. These combustible factors are combinations of earth, air, sound, speed and light and they provide the polarities to form the 409 elements of the physical world. We are not experiencing many elements available to us at this time. Living energy systems on earth must exist within these combustible factors to operate at full potential. If a living energy system attempts to exist or operate outside of the ionoshere, it w ill not maintain normal f unctioning. For example, if humans leave our atmosphere and do not have the appropriate energy field on their spacecraft, their bodies w ill not function properly. Gravity, or compressed magnetism, is the overseeing force that allows the combustible factors and elements to exist. The letter C commonly denotes the speed of light in scientific equations. The element light mentioned as one of the"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"factors of Y is not the light identified as \"C\" at the start of this molecular structure equation. This is important to note. This formula explains how pulsed light particles emitting from the center of the Universe travel to our solar system at variable 'speeds' outside of time and space. This formula is primarily concerned with how the high speed pulsed light energy, represented as C, is transmuted into magnetic energy which then creates a speed change that is considerably slower. This formed magnetic energy is captured by our Solar System and is then transmuted into an energy that supplies and sustains our Sun. The light pulses then leave our Sun (and other stars) at about 4 times the speed of light waves (light waves are about 186,000 miles a second). The pulses elongate into waves when they come into contact with something. This formula is primarily for our Solar System. Contrary to popular opinion, Jupiter, not the Sun, should be seen as the center of our Solar System when trying to understand the energy dynamics of the system. To understand the full impact of the formula, it is necessary to look at the solar system with Jupiter as the center. Again, a nearly infinite number of combinations of the 710 units of combustible factors produce a nearly infinite number of combinations of the 409 elements (which are a combination of earth, air, sound, speed, and light). The left side of the equation is designed to equal the right side: near infinity = near infinity. This formula is in keeping with the fact that, \"All energy was and is created ongoing from the SOURCE of a ll.\" Note that the primary energy force in the Universal system is the vortex. The presently held LAW of entropy is completely false. All magnetic molecular structures are in a constant state of change forming and re-forming with the action always resulting in 100% efficiency. All universal systems pr oceed to take their prescribed course of action with pre-ordained precision from the Creator Force, utilizing a pr ocess of time during the forming and reforming of structures until 'given evolution' results. Yes, scientists have observed randomness in the cosmos, and they believe the events they observe have no order, however, the randomness is not RANDOM. The Universe functions perfectly in a PATTERN AS NEEDED while repeating in a random sequence."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"As the scientific community makes advances in the field of magnetic pulse detection, people w ill be able to monitor exactly how many units of combustible factors arrive here from Jupiter at any given moment, thereby maintaining the Earth's energy needs. People w ill observe that the energy from Jupiter is then used by the Earth as needed, and the Earth simultaneously imparts energy to our Sun where it helps to sustain the Sun's energy that is again returned to Earth. The Earth is the vacuum of our planetary system, the final point where energy is recycled back into the Universal system. The pollution pr oduced on Earth affects not only our planet, but other planetary systems as well. Contaminated magnetic energy travels from our planet instantaneously to other systems forcing other beings to cope with our pollution. We are truly connected to a much larger community than we like to think. We must stop seeing our Earth as an independent, isolated and non-contributing part of this Universe. We must begin to understand that we can no longer move against nature but we must now utilize what is being offered for the benefit of the world. We have long overlooked, through greed, the use of FREE magnetic energy, and the time to expand our minds is now at hand because our planet is soon to find itself extinct if we do not.

Throughout the different stages of development of this unit for cleansing and purifying water, there has been the hope that this unit would ultimately be used for the good of all people. Now that something new is put forth, new principles must evolve that best explain this technology; these new principles will then branch out and contribute to a whole new area of science. Most scientists have limited the science of harnessing magnetism because they believe and teach that magnetism cannot be insulated, when in fact it can be insulated by various methods. Current technology contradicts what is now being disclosed, but a new paradigm is emerging that will embrace these new concepts and expand on them. This purifier relies on the polarity clearing energy found within the swirling field of a vortex. Vortexes occur naturally and they can be produced through magnetic devices; either way they remove energy polarities from molecular structures leaving neutral magnetic structures that can be given new polarities. The dynamic principle of the vortex has long been overlooked in its proper connection with magnetic energy. James C. Maxwell, in the 1800’s stated that, \"The magnetic force is the effect of the centrifugal force of the vortices and that electromagnetic induction of currents is the effect of the forces called into play when the velocity of the vortices is changing.\" Michael Faraday even went so far with his interest in this phenomenon as to conclude there must be currents created in rivers and streams by the passing of a conducting fluid, such as water through the magnetic fields of the earth. In a more recent time frame (1958), the work of the great scientist/inventor from Austria, Viktor- Schauberger, showed the world a device operated with a similar principle, and 40 years later we are not utilizing these units. WHY? Literature supplied by the Swedish Institute of Ecological"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"10 Technique (Nygatan 60~ S—902 47 Umea, Sweden) proves that certainly this technology has been available to the science community. The major factor that will open the door to this ‘energy technology’ is simply recognizing the neutral magnetic field. Historical research shows that at least one person with vision identified this energy form. In the year 1885, a physicist, C. A. Bjerkness, had the idea that energy could be explained as small spheres that pulsate at some unknown universal frequency. The positive result of Bjerkness's theory is that, if the pulsations are in phase, the particles attract according to the inverse square law; if they act out of phase completely, the particles repel according to the same law. The same principle pertains if they are halfway between being completely in, or out of phase, they are then neutral. Bjerkness's ideas help explain how this unit functions and why certain particles respond to the magnetic fields the way they do. As you review this unit keep in mind that the magnetic particle reactions occur at a nearly infinite velocity; magnetic energy is not limited to the speed of light as many people believe. In order to fully grasp the dynamic principle of the vortex in its proper connection with magnetic energy, we must expand several areas of our present teaching. A force which has come to be called gravity plays a part in all systems and so it does with this unit. Unfortunately the word gravity is already defined to mean an unchangeable force which is too limiting to explain the workings of this unit. Gravity is in fact COMPRESSED MAGNETISM, the catalyst for all energy. It is important to focus on this idea to understand the processes of the unit and the principle behind it. All things move toward the earth because of two compatible yet distinct forces, a push and a pull, with one force not able to manifest without the other. Keeping this in mind as a ‘basis of knowledge', it will later be shown how the flow pattern within this unit is affected by this push/pull phenomenon. We will now explain the sequence of actions and reactions within the unit to give a better understanding of the unit’s functioning. The copper spiral water spray unit capitalizes on rotational effects of the earth's system. The magnetic force within this unit is a natural phenomenon caused by the centrifugal force as the water is given to take a specific design and direction. The specific water configuration is formed by the rotating unit inside the bowl; however, the best rotational direction is determined by the location where this unit is to be operated. The test of establishing this rotation is to observe nature’s handiwork. Whatever swirl direction the water takes going down a drain or sump hole is the rotational direction for best cleansing results for a unit operated in that area. The Earth is perfectly balanced into two flow directions, clockwise and counter—clockwise. For simplicity sake, we are supplying drawings for a counter—clockwise flow unit, which takes care of a portion of the world. (The copper tubing needs to be wound in the opposite direction if the rotational direction is to be reversed.) It is important to note the reason for calling the influencing energy 'compressed magnetism’. In speaking of this magnetic force it is imperative that it not be viewed from a positive—negative stance. Thus in explaining the unit, to this point, the force itself (compressed magnetism) must be considered neutral. Yes, neutral, until activity influences it. Compressed magnetism can take on an infinite variety of polarities that are all magnetic in nature. The use of the word ‘compressed’ to define this magnetic energy is explained as a large amount of magnetic energy that is put into a small amount of space. That small amount of space should be viewed and compared as the Earth in relationship to the Universe. (See enclosed formula in the Research and Development section.) North and South denominations inaccurately describe magnetic polarities because we state that north attracts south, north repels north, south repels south. This implies that opposite energy fields attract and similar energy fields repel. Magnets are open systems with energy flowing in and out of them. The similarity of the energy flow is what attracts magnets to each other. Magnets unite"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"11 inflow to outflow to form a larger system that maintains a similar flow; the systems attract in the most compatible formation to each other because it enables the energy to continue flowing smoothly. As the drawings and part list are reviewed they will show how galvanized, magnetized, small metal pieces are caused to flow through the center of a vortex thus creating an actual current formed by magnetized structures within this vortex This is the beginning of the principle for this unit. Passing through the vortex we have a containment flow path that is a circular anodized aluminum (Alminal W16) screen. As the metal pieces move downward inside this screen they are actually within a centralized magnetic field. Not until the metal pieces are within this field is the polarity established. This polarity can now be considered an attract polarity as a result of the unwanted molecular structures contained within the sludge being attracted to the like polarity of the magnetized metal pieces. As these metal pieces are deposited into the top of the center tube, part #25, there is a free fall until the pieces reach the beginning of the screened area, (part #28). From this point on, the pieces no longer continue as a free fall but are guided through a weightless environment with ‘spraying water’ being the directive force. Because of the vortex principle there is no longer a downward force on the metal pieces, in other words, \"gravity\" is being altered inside of this unit. The magnetic energy in a vortex formation creates a wavelength that temporarily alleviates the effects of compressed magnetism. Conditioning is conditioning is conditioning and we too were conditioned to think gravity cannot be altered until we began to look into the field of magnetic energy. The 47 water spray jets are all directed to strike the screen and it is precisely at this ‘contact point’ that the separation process begins. The screen itself is made of a special aluminum alloy called Alminal W16, which when in this ‘particular’ field manifests as a very powerful magnetic force. This force field does not respond as an action that causes the sludge or metal pieces to adhere to this alloy directly, but is a response that attracts these items to the screen’s interior which is the center of the magnetic field. With the bonding of these molecular structures to the metal pieces through the force of the water, it now enables the sludge to move downward through the non—screened exit tube part #29, and thus be washed onto the vibrating separator screen #35. This screen shakes the metal pieces from each other and also from the sludge. With the removal of the sludge the magnets have an opportunity to once again strengthen their magnetic field as they pass by the D.C. charger. There is an intense magnetic oscillating process that is administered to the water and as this clean water exits the unit it remains in a high state of magnetic excitation. It is desirable to have the water continue in this excited state because certain molecular changes will take place that will bring the water to its full ‘ripeness’ ready for drinking. The water’s continued motion is the only requirement to administer this final process, therefore, the water is pumped through copper tubing of a certain configuration and length before being deposited into the fresh water storage tank. To build this unit and enjoy the tremendous amount of clean water it is not necessary to conduct a deep study of magnetic energy. However, one might be inspired to investigate the actual ‘circuitry’ which causes this cleansing action. Electrical principles cannot explain magnetic energy, electricity (as we know it) and magnetism (as we are presenting it) are distinctly different fields of study. This magnetic flow can understood by viewing the action of the coaxial cable attached to the unit. This cable is not used as a grounding ‘safety factor’ because voltage or spark are not manifest when this unit operates. A particular ‘magnetic flow transfer’ happens between the center screen and the ground as this cable is connected, thus without its use the unit will not function. A coaxial cable"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"12 is needed because it supplies the needed ‘path of circuitry’ for this energy. This cable’s ‘core wire’ must be steel that is copper coated. Every process in the unit creates different patterns of magnetic molecular structures that accomplish different purposes. If we could peer into the various forms of energy within this unit we would see many different patterns of magnetic structures within the electrons of the hardware, the water, and the space within the unit. Contrary to current teaching, electrons are not homogeneous, unchanging spheres of energy, they are more like snowflakes. No two are exactly the same, but their similarities cause them to be attracted to each other. The various elements, motions, and magnetic fields within this unit establish the polarities that the electrons follow. Magnetic energy has an infinite variety of uses, it just needs the proper conditions to be useful. In the past scientists provided hard evidence to show that the electron must have a core structure. The fact is that each electron has an identifiable core structure of its own composed of magnetic molecular structures. Identifying the core structure allows us to have greater control and manipulation of electrons. When Albert Einstein held to the view that the relative relationship of one particle to another did not matter, he was in error. Each particle is a molecular structure. Einstein’s error was not so much the calculations but the verbiage. Had he said \"molecular structures\" different ideas may have evolve from his work. People did not take the word \"particle\" any further. His view then suggested that the redistribution of particles was not possible. The problem has always been with our understanding the manner in which the redistribution takes place. When a molecular structure breaks down there is a transfer of energy to the greatest part which is the attracting force. When groups of molecules break down, the attract energy between them is transferred to the individual parts giving these parts the freedom to attract to other molecules that are similar to the individual parts. The sludge and the water are subjected to a field that releases the attract energy between them. The sludge attracts to the metal pieces because these pieces have polarities similar to the sludge, and the water attracts to the outer wall because it has a polarity similar to the polarity manifesting near the wall. The universal principle of attract - attract applies to this situation as with every situation. To learn how the earth system functions, people must understand that MAGNETISM IS A CONSTANT, the very GLUE of the Universe. Although this unit can be used in a more complex manner (example, the cleansing of radioactive particles from water), the desire here is simply to present this unit to the world to provide a means to clean water and environmentally reconstruct our Earth. MAGNETIC OSCILLATING WATER PURIFIER PARTS LIST 1) MAIN FRAME— 1—3/4\" SQ. TUBING, 25\" x 25\" SQ. BY 61\" HIGH.

A steel frame would interfere with this draw factor. 2) COPPER BOWL, 22\" HIGH, 19¼\" O.D., 1/8\" THICK, CONE SHAPED TO 4—3/4\" O.D.

TO ROTATE PART #7 AT 1700 RPM. This motor is not to be bolted directly to Frame #1, but should be mounted on a separate frame. Electrical wires are only a point of transference where an exchange takes place. We must allow this unit to draw the needed magnetized magnetic molecular structures from the atmosphere without interference. 11) 3/4\" HOLES FOR WATER INTAKE DRILLED INTO PART #7. This water intake passageway becomes possible because of the shape of part #7. 12) STATIONARY WATER HOLDING CHAMBER BOLTED TO FRAME #1. The chamber is shaped around for 360 ° to allow the incoming water to be circuited into part #7 without slowing the water volume. 13) TEFLON WATER SEAL TO FLOW WATER INTO PART #7.This is a standard water seal which directs the water into part #7. 14) DIRTY WATER INTAKE PIPE (52 pounds PRESSURE) TO FEED 3/4\" COPPER LINE. This incoming water must be screened in advance to remove particles larger than .045\". (See Figure 7 for suggested screen design.) 15) COPPER SUPPORT RING BOLTED To PART #7 MEASURING 16\" O.D.

PIPE, 1/8\" WALL THICKNESS SHAPED AS SHOWN. This copper unit when rotated at 1700 RPM’s builds a certain magnetic charge that must not be allowed to dissipate into the drive hub part #7. The mica insulation, when 1/8\" thick (part #16), serves as an effective means to prevent any undue energy dissipation. For winding details to form this copper coil unit see Figure 5. This coil’s shape and size are of critical importance because this unit, when rotating, creates a very special water configuration. 19) 47 SPRAY NOZZLES, ½\" LONG, WITH 3/16\" DIA. ORIFICES. These spray nozzles are facing slightly downward to serve the purpose of being the directive force to drive the metal pieces through the vortex magnetic field. (The final few lower spray nozzles are directed slightly upward, as shown, to help prevent water from entering the lower tube by simply passing in front of the rotating coil unit.) The water volume, spraying inward from the rotating copper tube assembly must be a heavier flow, through the center portion, therefore the spray nozzles are spaced around on the copper wraps as shown in Figure 5. (Example — the first top five wraps have only 3 nozzles each.) The spacing pattern is completed as shown in Figure 5 spaced equidistantly around. 20) SPECIAL NON—METAL WATER FITTING TO FLOW WATER FROM PART #7 TO PART #18. This ‘union type’ fitting, being non—metal, allows the water to flow to the copper unit #18, however it does not dissipate the magnetic charge into part #7. 21) A SERIES OF 1\" long by 7/32\" by 1/2\" LONG COPPER SPACERS TO HOLD COIL WRAPS 7/32\" APART. These pieces are all welded to part #18. This spacing controls the volume of water which will flow to the space between the copper bowl — part #2, and the outside area of the rotating copper unit part #18. It is important that this 7/32\" space be maintained exactly, therefore the actual number of spacers used should ‘be enough’ to produce a structure which can"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"14 withstand the rotational speed of 1700 RPM’s. After welding, this coil assembly should be properly balanced. 22) NINE ALUMINUM FRAMES, EACH TO HOLD THREE PERMANENT MAGNETS. These frames are equally spaced around for 360 ° and mounted to the outside surface of copper bowl part #2, spaced away 1/8\" using nylon washers and screws. The top of the magnets in each frame are 2—3/4\" below the underside of the top flange which supports the copper bowl. A full size top view of one frame is shown in Figure 4. Figure 2 shows the picture frame design which allows magnets to be inserted from the top and then held in place by the top aluminum retaining bar. 23) 27 PERMANENT MAGNETS MOUNTED INSIDE PARTS #22, EACH BEING 3½\" LONG, 2\" WIDE, ¼\" THICK. A very special coil and water charging event takes place as these magnets are arranged as shown in Figure 3. Shown in Figure 3 is one holder that has three south magnets inserted to designate which magnets are put into groups of three. The remaining 8 holders must have the magnet polarities spaced as shown. The magnets needed for this unit are the powerful iron—boron neodymium. The unbalanced magnetic polarities shown in Figure 3 cause a certain ‘sharing of magnetic fields’. This sharing process manifests as two circles of ‘magnetic energy flows’ with one circle going around clockwise and the other counter—clockwise, which is a ‘directional flow’ likened to a double vortex action. As the unit is rotated during start—up for a 22 minute period, these magnets take part in charging up the water and copper coil assembly until finally the total unit manifests as a very powerful magnetic force field. A 22 minute charging time is required with the water’s flow—through volume cut back to 25% of its full flow rate. The intake and exit valves can be fully opened after this charging sequence to allow the passage of the full flow rate of 47 to 52 gallons per minute. In that the energy influence from the 27 permanent magnets is never ‘shut off’ it could be stated that these magnets serve the purpose of supplying the needed conductive activity to the generating force. The water's rotational velocity is very substantial because the charge to the copper bowl creates an action that manifests as an almost negative resistance to the moving water. 24) A NYLON COLLAR, 1—3/8\" I.D., 4½\" O.D. by 7/8\"THICK HELD TO TUBE #29. This nylon collar serves two purposes. A) It serves as a safety factor to the copper coil assembly. If this coil unit, for whatever reason, started to vibrate and move its lower section from side to side, then the nylon collar would become a safety bump surface to limit sidewise movement until necessary repairs are made. B) This collar also serves as a water stop to prevent an undue amount of water from passing ‘in front of’ the bottom copper wrap. 25) BRASS TUBE BOLTED TO FRAME #1, BEING 13—3/4\" LONG, 1\" I.D., 1/8\" WALL THICKNESS. As metal pieces are deposited into the top of this tube they have a free fall until reaching the screen area. 26) TWO NYLON 1/4\" DIA. RODS PRESSED INTO PART #25. 27) 1/8\" THICK MYLAR INSULATION TUBE FASTENED TO PART #25, HAVING A 1— 1/8\" I.D. 28) CENTER ALMINAL W16 TUBE (ANODIZED), 18\" LONG, 2\" I.D., 1/8\" WALL THICKNESS, WITH .050 HOLES, TIGHTLY SPACED, DRILLED INTO TUBE. This tube is inserted from the bottom of the unit by having two 1/4\" wide slots fit around nylon rods — part #26. The tube is rotated to lock in these nylon rods before being bolted at the bottom. The 1/8\" thick mylar tube #27 insulates this tube from part #25. When the unit is ‘fully charged’ this center tube has a certain magnetic ‘energy potential’ that responds to a ‘charge potential’ built up in the copper coil assembly. The needed action that happens is for the water to complete this circuit. This"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"15 then explains the reason for insulating both the center tube and the copper coil unit. This center tube is anodized after the holes are drilled, which then allows for the correct energy flow pattern. Alminal W16 is ideal for building and holding the magnetic charge because of the elements used during this metal’s formulation. These elements are M-1273, M—1274: 3 Cu, 4 Mg, 0.6 Si, 0.6 Fe, 1 Mn, 0.2 Ti, 4.0—8.5 Zn, bal Al. WP—temper: 78,000 — 85,000 TS; 67,000 — 74,000 YS; 5-4 El. For structural members: age—hardened, high strength. 29) LOWER PORTION OF CENTER TUBE, (SAME MATERIAL), 21\" LONG, 1—3/8\" I.D., 1/8\" WALL THICKNESS WELDED TO PART #28, NO HOLES, (shaped as shown on drawing). As the clean water swirls around this tube the water actually contacts the outside surface of this tube and continues to be magnetically activated during this downward exit path. The reason for not having holes in this tube is because we do not want to 're—mix’ the sludge inside this tube with the clean water which is swirling on this tube’s outer surface. 30) IDENTIFIES AREA WHERE HOLES ARE DISCONTINUED. 31) BOTTOM SUPPORT FLANGE TO HOLD CENTER ALUMINUM TUBE ASSEMBLY PARTS #28—#29. 32) 1/8\" THICK MICA INSULATION TUBE BETWEEN PARTS #29 AND #31. This insulation tube is needed to insulate the center tube assembly at this bottom location. 33) COAXIAL CABLE SECURED TO PART #29 TO CONNECT CENTER TUBE TO PART #28 TO GROUND. This coaxial cable should have a center wire made of steel that is copper coated. This wire is connected to a copper/brass shaft put into the ground 5 feet. 34) CLEAN WATER EXIT LOCATION PIPED TO CLEAN WATER PUMP #42. Eight 1/2\" I.D. pipes spaced 360 ° around lower part of tube remove clean water. This is to prevent a turbulent back—wash. The water, when arriving at this bottom location, is still moving at a needed swirl velocity, and the water removal is spaced to compliment the water’s rotational movement. 35) VIBRATING SHAKER TO SEPARATE SLUDGE FROM METAL PIECES. This shaker should be slide mounted to allow quick removal of metal pieces from the center tube, which is downward. As time passes, this center tube will need to have the holes flushed out and then be re— inserted. If this maintenance job is accomplished quickly, the unit can be charged and put back in service with a minimal amount of downtime. 36) SLUDGE CONTAINER. This tank should be wheel mounted for quick cleaning action. 37) LIGHT WATER SPRAY TO CLEANSE METAL PIECES. As the metal pieces vibrate downward along the top of the shaker screen, this light water spray helps to cleanse the sludge away from the metal pieces. 38) VERTICAL SCREW CONVEYOR, 63\" LONG, 2—1/8\" SCREW DIA., NON— MAGNETIC METAL CONSTRUCTION. As the metal pieces fall from the shaker they travel on a slide pan for a short distance and fall into the bottom hopper of this screw conveyor and are carried upward. 39) TOP CROSS SCREW CONVEYOR 17\" LONG, 2—1/8\" SCREW DIA. The hopper at the tail end of this screw conveyor is shaped to receive the metal pieces from the exit top end of conveyor #38. This conveyor then drops the metal pieces into the center opening of part #25. 40) A TOTAL OF 18 POUNDS OF MAGNETIZED GALVANIZED METAL SHAPES TO FLOW IN SYSTEM. Each piece measures 1/2\" long, 1/4\" wide by .005\" thick (rounded corners). As a metal shape enters the top tube part #25, a time frame of 6 to 7 seconds will pass before this same metal shape exits at the bottom. It is during this ‘travel path time frame’ that it will collect the sludge that attracts to it. These metal pieces will ‘clump together’ along with the sludge as they travel downward."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"16 41) A D.C. charger to once again strengthen the field of the metal pieces (if necessary). This charger is shown mounted on the bottom surface of the slide plate which carries the metal pieces from the shaker to the vertical screw conveyor. 42) A 2 H.P. CLEAN WATER PUMP. This pump is used to drive the water through the final water cleansing stage. 43) A VERTICAL PATTERN OF 2\" COPPER PIPE SPANNING A 12 FOOT DISTANCE, (See figure 6). 44) A FINAL PARTICLE REMOVAL PROCESS BEFORE THE CLEAN WATER IS DEPOSITED INTO THE CLEAN WATER TANK. Figure 7 shows an open ended drum that is supported from a back plate. The front end is opened to allow the water from Part #43 to go into this drum. This drum rotates a 5 micron stainless steel screen which is fastened on the outside of its aluminum rod assembly with this ‘rod assembly’ welded to the front plate. As the water is deposited onto the inner bottom surface of this screen, the water passes through the screen falling into the tank. The screen intercepts any particles larger than 5 microns and then slowly carries these dirt particles around 180 ° where a set of air jets gently blow the captured dirt into a catch box. This ‘rotating screen’ results in all the incoming water being cleansed by passing through a clean screen. Thus we can say that in a 24 hour period this process will produce 50 gallons per minute x 60 minutes equaling 3000 gallons per hour by 24 hours equaling 72,000 gallons of clean water per 24 hour period. This concludes the parts list/explanation. ADVANCED DATA AND ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON THE WATER PURIFIER To review, a rotating copper coil assembly is spun inside a copper bowl. The space distance between the spinning copper coil and the inside of this copper bowl is of CRITICAL importance. The reason is this. The 27-iron/boron neodymium magnets send their energy charge inside this bowl creating an ANTI-friction surface for the water that arrives there BETWEEN the 17 wraps of one-inch pipe. This water then rotates AT THE SAME SPEED as the outer surface of the rotating coil. If the space distance between the pipes and the wall changed, the water SPINNING action would be reduced to then cause less magnetic charging of the water. Next, we address the magnet polarity placement. This particular magnet arrangement causes a blending of magnetic circuitry as the water passes through these fields. This action then produces TWO magnetic rotating forces, one rotating WITH the copper coil and a second field OF EQUAL STRENGTH rotating backwards. Next, we focus on the ground cable. This wire is secured to the bottom part of the center tube. However, when stating the wire then GOES TO GROUND, we need to expand on just WHAT TYPE of ground. We DO NOT use a standard electrical ground rod that is copper-coated steel. The ground rod should be the same thickness and distance into the ground as an electrical ground rod BUT it should be made of a copper/brass metal combination. Magnetic current tends to GRAB the steel part of the electrical rod that then STOPS THE FLOW causing what could be called a magnetic short circuit. There are many modifications that could be made for maintenance reasons. For example, what if some of the 47 spray nozzles become clogged due to the input of very dirty water? The center alminal tube can be removed and the copper flange (part #4) taken apart. Next, someone could flush out the tube by removing the plug from the last wrap and inserting a hose to pressurize the non-rotating coil assembly to see exactly which spray nozzles need cleaning. At that point, one can inspect the nylon collars (part #24) to see if the bottom coil wrap contacted this collar. Naturally, if it did, the coil would need to be remounted and balanced. This nylon collar is only a safety factor to the coil assembly. Its primary use is to serve as a water stop as stated. NOTE: the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"17 last copper coil wrap DOES NOT ride on the nylon collar. This coil assembly is held together as a solid unit through the welding parts 21, which are a series of 1” long, 7/32” thick copper spacers. These spacers create the needed SPACE GAP between the coils for the proper water flow. This flow pattern allows the rotating volume of water to build to a water wall THICKNESS that can be measured. The measurement is from the inside of the copper bowl to the inside surface of the copper tubes, a distance that does not interfere with INCOMING WATER from the 47 spray nozzles. It is necessary to focus on one primary action of this unit. The rotating water, charged by the magnets, can be likened to a large rotating magnet. The CLEAN metal pieces cannot fall through this field. Thus at the upper part of the screened area, the pieces COLLECT into a given VOLUME. This assembly of pieces then captures sludge which is driven DOWNWARD by the angle of the 47 spray nozzles. Only when the ½” long by ¼” wide by .005 thick metal pieces become weighted (by collecting sludge) do they travel downward to fall onto the shaker part #35. This collection of sludge, onto the pieces, is caused to happen because of their magnetic CHARGE which attracts to the sludge. The center alminal tube (part #28) serves as a magnetic dividing line. As the 47 spray nozzles send their sprayed water toward this tube, the magnetic charge, to the tube welcomes the sludge inside while causing the clean water TO NOT enter this tube. This water, now in a SPRAY STATE, then moves outward to gather into flowing water that passes between the 7/32” spaces between the copper coils. It goes without saying that proper water seals need to be installed so as to allow the 52 pounds of water pressure to flow into the system. However, the two ball bearings with a 3-1/2” ID (part #6) MUST NOT be made of a material that allows a magnet to adhere to them. This unit operates with a very sensitive magnetic current flow. Thus standard steel ball bearings could cause a magnetic short-circuit that would negate the water cleansing process. The work of many visionaries who capitalized on a similar principle should no longer be suppressed. Simply constructing this Magnetic Oscillating Water Purifier, can help usher in our golden age of civilization, thus allowing magnetic energy to take its rightful place to not only meet our energy needs but to help clean up the environment."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"18 MAGNETIC WATER PUMP • Water pump causes underground water to flow to the surface without the use of electricity • Magnetic current is required to run pump • Magnetic current provided by Romag-Generator or Celestial Particle Transmuter • No special alloys needed • Powerful permanent magnets required • Designed to provide enough water for a 100 acre farm • Requires water pressure for start-up This unit transforms magnetic current into magnetic energy that charges ground water, an action which causes the water to move up to the Earth’s surface on attract. This unit is a vivid demonstration of how matter (like water) can be given a polarity and be caused to move to a similar polarity on attract. The principles behind this unit can be applied to nearly any type of matter. It is a water-pumping device that will help to reduce atmospheric pollution caused by the burning of fuel to supply electricity for pumping ground water. This new method of charging water with magnetic current is accomplished through a special process whereby water is attracted up a copper tube. This is a magnetically powered device that receives magnetic energy from another energy generator like the Romag Generator or the Celestial Particle Transmuter. The propeller has secured to its blades an arrangement of wires and contacts that, when charged, cause propeller rotations. The rotor has a permanent magnet, which rotates and provides incoming magnetic current with needed polarities. The device has a system of contacts that are spaced so as to have a stop gauge effect to the pulsing action which then controls the speed. HOW THE UNIT FUNCTIONS A magnetic current generator circuits magnetic energy into the four electrodes part #17. Next, water pressure is fed down into tubes #4. This causes spray jets #19 to contact the propeller so as to rotate the unit. The spacing between the six rotating copper contacts and the 4 stationary contacts is such that 4 pulses are always pulsed ON (that is 2 sets of wings) while 2 contacts are OFF. Naturally, the thought might be, why not just have 6 stationary contacts, which would then activate all six wings at one time. This idea would not allow the needed polarities to take place. Each set of wings needs the OFF TIME that is set up by the spacing of 4 stationary electrodes. Without this off time an unwanted condition of CROSS CURRENTS would happen stopping the water rotation process. Once the water is rotating with a magnetic charge, it causes the copper tube to become charged. The water then gets pushed upward while being attracted upward by the charging of the copper tube. The propeller does not DRIVE the water upward. If we can allow the thought that gravity is in fact compressed magnetism, then we can understand how the magnetic charge to the water reverses the normal downward movement. The charged water has a polarity that is ATTRACTED UP to the Earth's surface. Once the propeller is rotating, the spray jets are shut off and water arrives at the top of the well."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"19 A secondary benefit to having magnetically charged water in the well is that this charge sends ATTRACT ENERGY into the ground which causes water, at a deeper level, to then be attracted into the same well. Reasons for the Propeller design: The thickness of the wings are .225\" because as the unit operates we need to minimize the effect of having the wings expand outward. This expanse condition might cause a hitting of the electrodes and stop the pulsing action. The wing ends are BLUNT (.225\" square) because we do not want the water sliding around these wings, but instead a water punching action is needed. This then creates a certain water movement, which aids in the magnetic charging action, an action that prevents the propeller from accelerating faster than the required 1600 RPM. The blades are not designed to drive the water upward because this is not necessary, nor is it the principle behind this unit. The blunt edge design assists the water in becoming magnetically charged and to then be ATTRACTED upward with the propeller simply serving as a tool that nudges the water in the desired direction at 1600 RPM. This particular wing SHAPE helps to prevent a water BACK WASH condition. This is one reason to have the wing ends be 1-3/8\" from the closest point to the next wing. There should be a 20 thousandths thick coating of acrylic on the total propeller. This is not for insulation purposes but to prevent wire RATTLE that could result in broken circuits. Magnetic current does not interact with acrylic so it's the best material for coating. Other coatings (such as electric motor varnish) could actually destroy the magnetic activity. The reason for having Part #5 be one inch wide and angling down at 42 degrees is because it aids in guiding the water just before the water arrives at the 6 wings. The reason for a rounded bottom to the propeller shaft is to aid in creating a smooth upward water movement. Also, if one wanted to do maintenance on the propeller they could simply have a metal object, on a rope, contact the center magnet and pull the propeller up and out of the well. The rounded end would then aid in relocating the shaft back into the bearing, after the maintenance is completed. (for example changing part #6, the Delrin flange bearing). The 3/8\" wide copper contacts need to be connected to wires #13 in a special way. The wire should be under the 3/8-inch side face located on the outer edge. The electrodes #17 will then pulse the magnetic current through the copper to the steel wire’s core. This action expands to the copper that carries the charge for the full 3/8\" face distance. The wire then goes to the back side of the copper by maintaining contact along the side of the copper before taking the winding travel path (see Figure 1). At all points where wires #13 curve around the wings (front and back), the wings should have 15 thousandths deep half round grooves. These grooves help to prevent the copper coating from being scratched. This grooving of the wings is the ideal wing wrapping process. PARTS LIST I) A standard length of metal well pipe, non-porous 2) A copper tube (length as needed) measuring 1/8\" thick, 9\" Inside Diameter held into the center of Part #1. 3) A non-metal bottom ring with O ring seals to firmly hold Parts #1 and #2 together 4) Are six lengths of 1/2\" Outside Diameter heavy wall plastic tubing. These tubes get connected at the top of the well and travel the full distance down along the outer surface of Part #2. 5) A shaft portion of the propeller 1-1/8\" OD and 2-1/2\" long 6) A Delrin flange bearing firmly secured to the shaft Part #5, measuring 1-1/8\" ID. 1-3/8\" OD, 2- 1/8\" long."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"20 7) Three copper support bars secured to Part #2 and bolted to a hardened #400 series stainless steel support tube. This tube allows Part #6 to rotate inside, 8) Center hub portion of the propeller, 2\" OD with a center cavity 1-3/4\" dia. 1-3/4\" deep. 9) Six .225\" thick propeller blades all cast onto a center hub as a single casting made of 80% Aluminum, 10% Magnesium, 10% Manganese. These blades are mounted at a 42-degree angle forming a propeller dia. of 8-1/2 inches. The tip of each blade should be 1-3/8\" from the closest point of the blade next to it. The blade ends are blunt edged measuring .225\" square. 10) A 1-3/4\" dia. by 1-3/4\" long iron/boron/neodymium permanent magnet, powerfully charged, located in the center hub. The magnet charging position is to have half of each polarity on the top of the magnet extending to the bottom. 11) Are six ‘U’ shaped pieces of 1/32\" thick copper clips. These clips are secured 1/2\" from the end of each blade measuring 3/8\" wide with the open end on the inner side. These clips serve as contacts and should be shaped on the outer surface to form a curved radius measuring 4-5/l6 inches. 12)Are six numbers assigned to each blade (see figure I). 13) Are three lengths of .032\" thick clean copper coated steel wires. Each of these lengths gets wrapped around two blades. To explain, the first wire is firmly secured to part #11 then this wire goes around blade #1 with seven wraps spaced as shown on figure I. After blade #1 is wrapped, the same wire crosses over the center of the magnet and arrives at blade #4. At this point, the wrapping rotation for blade four is reversed as shown. Blade four has the same number of wraps and is then firmly secured to copper clip Part #11, Next, the other two lengths of wire are wrapped in like manner. Note that the wires from blades #1,2 and 3 cross the north half of the magnet. This establishes the magnet alignment when located in the hub. 14) A star connection for the three wires that crossed the magnet. These clean wires all make contact TO EACH OTHER as they are firmly bonded directly to the center point of the magnet. As neutral magnetic current is pulsed to blades 1,2,3, the attract circuit is to the north half of the magnet then returned to a center NEUTRAL POINT. Also, as blades 4,5,6 form an attract circuit for the incoming neutral magnetic current, the south half of the magnet completes the attract circuit, then returns to a neutral flow. Thus, the water becomes charged with TWO magnetic polarities which becomes the propeller’s driving force. 15) A 1/4\" thick copper tube 2-1/2\" wide fanned to fit on the outside dia., of Part #2. This tube is to add support to Part #2 in order to hold contacts with a firm circle support while keeping the shaft centered. 16) Are 4 insulation tubes spaced into groups of two at 60 degrees apart. Each tube measures 1/2\" long, 3/8\" OD by 1/8\" ID pressed into part #15 and #2. 17) Are four boron Carbide electrodes marked A,B,C,D, that are pressed into Parts #16. These electrodes are 5/8\" long, 1/8\" dia. having a rounded contact surface facing inward. These electrodes clear part #11 by being positioned as close as possible without actual contact. 18) Are two coaxial cables having a size #14 center copper wire. Each cable gets circuited to 2 electrodes. 19) Are six water spray jets secured to Part #2. These spray jets feed water through Part #4 to cause startup rotation. To finalize, this water pump unit utilizes flowing magnetic energy to produce an ongoing water flow. The magnetic flow causes the propeller to rotate by setting up a response from wing to wing that completes a circuit. This is an energy circuit that magnetically charges the underground water causing the water to rise to the Earth’s surface while being PUMP GUIDED upward."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"22 MAGNOGEN MOTOR • 480 HP Magnetic Powered Motor turning at 4,800 RPM • Requires mechanical startup • Suggested use: Transportation • Special magnets needed to retard the generation of spark This motor could revolutionize the transportation industry.

We must stop limiting our potential as a species and see beyond the poisonous technology we hold so dearly. Explore this unit, marvel at it's design and imagine quiet transportation and clean skies. It is appropriate to briefly discuss the question 'What is Magnetism?' Many visionaries from the past have chosen the WORD ‘Magnetism’, to explain the many different workings of the Universe. It is important to define magnetism as a total variety of energies. The word \"magnetism\" denotes an attraction between varying energies, thus it best describes the basic force of nature which is attract-attract. The energy of the Universe is a constant, and it is correct to state that magnetism is a constant. When we focus on just HOW magnetism is a constant, it is best to know that EVERYTHING is made of magnetic molecular structures. The total Universe IS magnetism. It never needs to travel to or from somewhere because it is already there. It is where it is attracted at a nearly infinite velocity. All light in the Universe is a form of transmuted magnetic energy. If we identify a particular location where the point of transference starts (for example, a particular star) this light energy is magnetically CONVEYED at a velocity that cannot be described within our present framework which locks in time and space. Thus, magnetism does not NEED or HAVE a point of no return. This ENERGY is the Universe which is always transmuting with 100 percent efficiency. Magnetism can be used as \"MAGNETIC CURRENT\". Fifty years ago, Dr. Ehrenhaft stated, \"It is purely magnetic force which permeates throughout the known Universe.\" Printed in Nature, January 4, 1941, Dr. Ehrenhaft stated, \"There must also be a STATIONARY MAGNETIC FIELD in the beam of LIGHT with potential differences since SUPERPOSED MAGNETIC FIELDS accelerate or retard the MAGNETO-PHOTOPHORESIS. It can be observed that some particles stay at rest and that their motion commences suddenly, or that moving particles appear to change their velocity and even reverse it. This is due to changes of CHARGE. The movement of magnetic ions in a homogeneous magnetic field is a MAGNETIC CURRENT.\" When Faraday had become world famous for his invention of the dynamo (about 1850) he was not satisfied with his limited success. Faraday wrote the following after testing the first magnet powered generator, \"There is a wheel in the physical mechanism of the action that is missing, whereby electricity (energy) should be derived from MAGNETISM without the expenditure of mechanical energy.\" Additional comments about magnetism are: magnetic current is an energy that can flow through a wire, it can jump a gap and change form, it can be conducted through air and space, it can take on an infinite variety of polarities, it will not shock the body but make it numb depending on the intensity, it flows when it is attracted to something, it can produce matter or break down"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"23 matter in the right conditions, it can produce force fields, it can assist in momentum, it can assist in particle detection up close or far away, it can produce heat and cold in the right conditions, it can enhance or detract from literally any energy form, it can be polarized into fields that can serve an infinite number of purposes, it does not deplete the earth's atmosphere like electricity, it occurs in various levels throughout nature, it can be monitored like electricity but it is not the same, nature does not produce electricity - it produces magnetic current that can be measured as electricity, magnetic current can move at a nearly infinite velocity, and it can be altered by the elements it interacts with - this is why the composition of the magnets is so very important - the composition or the elements determine the characteristics of the magnetic current, magnetic fields can unlock molecular bonds, magnetic fields bind each molecule together with a unique polarity with similar polarities attracting and forming larger structures, magnetism is a constant - always present and always changing, magnetic energy exists everywhere - there is no \"space\", gravity is compressed magnetism that can be intensified or alleviated. Finally, magnetism can manifest as NEUTRAL. In the year 1885, a physicist, C.A. Bjerkness, had the idea that energy could be explained as small spheres that pulsate at some unknown universal frequency. The positive result of his theory is that if the pulsation’s are in phase, the particles attract according to the inverse square law. If they are out of phase completely, they repel according to this same law. The same pertains if they are halfway between being completely in or out of phase, they are then neutral. Bjerkness was talking about neutral magnetism. Neutral magnetism can become an infinite number of polarities. That is how all magnetic units function, they change neutral magnetism into different magnetic polarities that perform specific functions as they interact with certain hardware. There are magnetism’s in the Universe that have only been minutely utilized by our societies, and discovering these magnetic energy forms will greatly enhance our lives and help our planet thrive. To understand the workings of the Magnogen motor, we need to do our best to review the sequence of events for each revolution. We will attempt to trace the circuit flow. But first the magnetic flow should be understood as being DIFFERENT than an electrical flow. As we know, electricity sparks and argues, short circuits, etc. The strength of the ATTRACT pull determines the amount of magnetic flow. A magnetic current only goes WHERE it is needed and HOW it is needed to cause a desired result. It is of paramount importance to know that magnetism travels with an INTERACTION going in BOTH DIRECTIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY. This action is a set LAW OF NATURE totally activated within a CAUSE and EFFECT process. We will look at the motor BEFORE it is ready for start-up. The magnetic fields inside are already in a vast number of motions, all waiting to GET TO WORK the moment spin charging begins. For the sake of pulse COUNTING we pick a single rotation when the Motor is already doing work by turning the output shaft. As we select a START point for one single rotation of 360 degrees, we can then COUNT the magnetic pulses which DO happen. Let us focus on a start point where the control brush from the generator is contacting magnet coil commutator bar #52. The generator winding’s pulsing is the FIRST countable magnetic action. Each of the 84 generator magnets pulses TWICE for movement of one generator slot. The count of pulsing for one rotation then is 2 times 84 magnets times 104 slots equals 17,472. Next, the same action happens with the 84 driver magnets as they respond to 118 driver winding slots. This pulse counting is 2 times 84 times 118 which equals 19,824. To this point we have 37,296 pulses for one rotation. Next, the generator control brush in one single rotation activates a total of 16 magnet"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"24 coils. These coils get a jolt of magnetic current in what is called groups of two with only one coil being activated during a given moment. The next coil of the group is activated instantly after the first. These groups of two are always activated at a distance of about 180 degrees apart. At this point in time, we next identify the DIFFERENCES between the pulses. All smaller pulses ACCUMULATE to become part of LARGER PULSES. For example, the pulsing of the magnet coils are MASSIVE as compared to the pulsing of the generator and driver pulses. Next, we note there are smaller pulses between the forty-two rows of magnets, as each of the four magnets in line top to bottom accumulate pulses in a calliope action. This creates an elongated magnetic field pulse which eventually arrives at a given MAGNETIC speed. This charge is ready to be attracted to an attract structure. The attract location is to any combination of the magnet coils which have pulsed 180 degrees across from each other. When this massive pulse crosses through the winding assemblies, we find the pulse is NOT to the magnet coils at their MOMENT of pulsing, but after pulsing. To explain, spaced between the pulsing of any group of magnet coils, are spacer magnet commutator bars which go under the control brush but are not completing the circuit. These varying number of OFF BARS create a time frame when the coil’s magnet CHARGE is available for an attract polarity change. Thus the space gap of 4 inches, (the distance between the outer magnet pulse and the magnet coils) is crossed directly through the generator and driver windings as one massive magnetic pulse shock. So, next we add these so called POWER PULSES to the total number of pulses for one 360 degree rotation and arrive at the following totals, 37,296 + 16 magnets coils, + 8 large calliope pulses equals 37,320. These pulses are caused to happen (because of the changing number of OFF bars) at RANDOM INTERVALS. Any one row of the 42 rows of magnets might pulse to any CLOSE BY magnet coil with basically only eight of the large pulses for a 360 degree rotation of the shaft. These massive PRIMARY pulses respond as a SHOCK condition which reaches OUTSIDE of the motor to the ionosphere. Thus we find the calliope action (up and down) to each of the 42 rows of magnets happens in a random order. When understanding universal PULSING, we must know the RANDOMNESS IS THE ORDER. The magnet coil pulsing occurs when the control brush from the generator contacts Bar 52 (see print), the magnetic charge goes into magnet coil #8. Then instantly (when contacting Bar 51), into magnet coil #5 located about 180 degrees across. The circuit is completed to any one of the three magnet coil brushes which have their shunt wire wrapped around with clean .020 inch thick copper wire. Viewing the print shows this thin copper wire is wrapped around the generator and driver shunt wires with three loops. This is a crucial bit of knowledge which must be understood. This wire wrapping circuit is the MAJOR separation between an electrical and magnetic flow. If the unit DID generate ANY volts, a short circuit would happen at the first contact to this thin copper wire. This fact shows the flow is MAGNETIC, and each of the four locations (of 3 loops) gets to share in completing the magnetic flow. For future study, the pulse is listed as follows: Bar 52 - ON to Coil 8 Bar 51 - ON to Coil 5 Bars 50, 49, 48, 47 are OFF Bar 46 ON to Coil 7 Bar 45 ON to Coil 4 Bars 44, 43, 42, 41 and 40 are OFF Bar 39 ON to Coil 6 Bar 38 ON to Coil 3"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"25 Bars 37, 36, 35, and 34 are OFF Bar 33 ON to Coil 5 Bar 32 ON to Coil 2 Bars 31, 30, 29, 28 and 27 are OFF Bar 26 ON to Coil 4 Bar 25 ON to Coil 1 Bars 24, 23, 22, and 21 are OFF Bar 20 ON to Coil 3 Bar 19 ON to Coil 8 Bars 18, 17, 16, 15, and 14 are OFF Bar 13 ON to Coil 2 Bar 12 ON to Coil 7 Bars 11, 10, 9 and 8 are OFF Bar 7 ON to Coil 1 Bar 6 ON to Coil 6 Bars 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 are OFF The OFF bar pattern then is four, five, four, five, four, five, four and five. These OFF bars add up to 36 and when added to the 16 USED bars from the magnet coils, we have a total of 52 bars. It is difficult to take what is stated and to then expand this pulsing information to the full understanding of the motor’s actions. The action being called a pulse is actually a CHANGE of magnetic POLARITY. The more complete understanding of magnetism is to first learn the CAUSES which result in a change of magnetic polarity. An analogy that is very helpful is the color spectrum whereby we see basic colors combine to form new colors; and so it is with magnetism as new magnetic structures form to create varying magnetic fields. However, there are basic differences between ALL magnetism’s: a) the particular magnet's composition, b) the magnetic intensity, and c) the pulse rate. If all or only ONE change takes place, the POLARITY is affected. The release condition (to the ionosphere) happens ONLY after the pulse has had its momentum built up and accelerated by being pulled (every which way) until the PROPER magnetic release speed is attained. With a constant output shaft speed, it would appear that the energy is NOT random. While the pulse is not a one, two, three counting order, the Universe operates in a PATTERN AS NEEDED WHILE REPEATING IN A RANDOM SEQUENCE. 480 HP MAGNOGEN MOTOR PARTS LIST: 1) Aluminum base plate l\" thick by 29-l/4\"OD 2) Vertical outer wall made of 81% aluminum and l9% magnesium, measuring 17-1/4\" high, 27-3/4\" ID, 29-1/4\" OD. This wall as knurled on the inside from top to bottom. 3) A delrin ring measuring 27-3/4\" OD by 25-3/4\" ID by 1/2\" thick. This ring is bolted to part #2.

The inside diameter has 42 rounded shapes which are pulse points."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"26 6) A carbon ring located on top of part #3 measuring 27-3/8\"OD by 25-1/2\" ID, by 3/8\" thick. This ring has 168 holes 7/32\" dia. made to match holes in Part #3. These holes are the same spacing pattern as the outer holes of parts #4 and #5. The inside diameter has 42 rounded shapes which are pulse points. 7) Are 168 rods, 13-5/8\" long, 7/32\" thick made of hardened aluminum alloy. 8) 84 magnets for driver winding, measuring 3/8\" thick by 1\" wide by 1-1/2\" long, Magnets made of 58% iron, 37% neodynium, 4% ferrous sulfate, 1% boron 9) Are 84 window frames which hold parts #8. Each of these frames are held in place by 4 rods, Parts #7. There are two of these rods on the sides of each magnet and these rods are slid into 7/32\" holes in this part which are located at the side edges of the magnets. (See drawing.) These frames have a .010\" thick by 1/8\" wide ledge, front, back and bottom allowing the magnets to be inserted from the top only. The material for these frames is 81% aluminum and 19% magnesium. Thus the total support for parts #8 are these 168 rods, as these rods hold in place these window type frames. The air space around each magnet is as important as the magnet itself. Without this space the magnets lose their energy over time. The method of supporting the magnets results in both sides of the magnets being clear of any obstruction. 10) Are pieces of acrylic tubing having a 7/32\" inside diameter. These tubes are used as spacers between and above the magnets to serve as stops which hold the frames #9 and magnets #8 in place. 11) Are 84 rods, 7-3/16\" long by 7/32\"dia. Held in place by inserting them into holes at the inner diameters of parts #4 and #5. 12) Is a ring made of 8l% aluminum and 19% magnesium measuring 22-3/4\" ID by 23-3/4\" OD by 3/8\" thick. This ring has 84 holes measuring 7/32\" dia. which are used to support the bottom location of rods #11. 13) 84 magnets for generator winding measuring 3/8\"thick by l\" wide by 1-1/4\" long made of the same material as Part #8 14) Are 84 window frames to hold parts #l3. There are two rods located on the side of each magnet. Thus, these frames are different than frames #9 because each frame, with its magnet is held in place by only two side rods, part #11. These frames and magnets are also held in place by pieces of 7/32\" dia. acrylic tubing. NOTE: The frames make contact to the magnets as well as to the rods. These frames complete a magnetic flow which is a circuit that includes the actual energy which is caused to flow by the frames materials. These frames are charged because of their location, which is between powerful magnets. 15) Fourteen copper square pieces 1/4\" spaced around for 360 degrees. These copper squares serve as a magnetic boundary between the two magnets and they balance a field. These pieces are centered at the driver housing with a 1/32\"clearance from Part#16. 16) Casting for driver housing is 26\" OD, 13\" high with 24-1/2\" ID. Casting is made of 72% copper. 9-1/3% nickel, 9-1/3% manganese, and 9-1/3% magnesium. The magnets #8 clear this casting by 5/32\" space distance. To pour driver housing we use 72% copper, 9-1/3% nickel, 9-1/3%manganese and 9-l/3% magnesium. The driver casting is to be 10% less weight than the generator casting, 197 pounds for the generator and 177.3 pounds for the driver. To melt elements for the driver casting, start by melting the highest to the lowest by dropping down, then add, then drop down again. No vacuum is being used; however, before adding the magnesium, drop down as low as possible, being careful to not let the blended"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"27 materials solidify. In this manner, the chances of causing the magnesium to react to an unwanted degree are minimized. 17) Explanation for 5/32\" space: The magnets need to be further away from the driver casting because magnetism needs to manifest as an attract pole with space for the molecular energy to manifest its field. 18) Secured to the lower extension of Part #16 are 44 rounded contacts made of 7.8% magnesium to a ratio of 2.5% nickel. These contacts are located to have a .002\" clearance from the inner contacts of part #5. They are 3/8\" in dia. shaped as shown on the 90 degree section. 19) Casting for generator housing measures 22-3/4\" OD by 11-1/4\" high by 8-1/2\"ID made of 42% zinc, 25% copper, 9.25% sulfur, 9% magnesium, and 2% tin. The Magnets #13 clear this casting by 1/16 space distance. As the generator allows a magnetic energy flow to leave, through a giving it up process, the return flow is guided and directed by a magnetic molecular interchange; the function that is controlled, to a point, by the weight and composition of the two alloys as they interact to each other. Rods #7 and 11 aid in this molecular interchange process. This sharing of fields, up to down or down to up in each row causes a calliope effect to the magnetic energy flow traveling vertically as the magnetic rotary response happens. 20) Are 44 rounded contacts made of 7.8% magnesium to a ratio of 2.5% nickel. These contacts are located to have a .002\" clearance from the inner contacts of Part #5. As contacts #18 pulse to Part #6 they pulse at the same moment as these contacts pulse to #5. This action sets up a magnetic pulse rate which aids in the total magnetic flow. 21) Are two mica rings secured to Part #2 located at the outer edge of Parts #5 & #6. Each ring is 3/16\" thick by 5/8\" wide. This mica is used to prevent magnetic leakage to Part #2. 22) Winding for driver casting has 59 coils, each coil fills two slots (total of 118 slots). Each coil has 140 turns of #26 cotton coated copper wire. There are 12 coils at 1-3 span, 47 coils at 1 to 4 span. 23) Winding for generator casting has 104 coils (104 slots). Each coil is made of 280 turns of #28 cotton coated copper wire. Coils span 1 to 5 having 52 groups of two coils per group. 24) Insulation mica tube located at the inside diameter of the generator housing measuring 3/32\" thick by 4\" high. Also, a mica plate 3/32\"thick is under this generator housing. 25) Copper tube to support driver casting measuring 24-1/2\" OD, 24-1/4\" ID by 12\" high. 26) Center aluminum hub is 81% aluminum and 19% magnesium to support 3 major parts: the generator housing, the motor housing and the eight magnet coil assembly. There are 8 coil shapes cut into this part for a clearance which allows l/8\" mica between the coil and the hub. 27) Eight magnet coils equally spaced around, located inside machined holes in center Hub #26 forming an inside diameter of 10-1/4\". Each coil is wound onto a coil form (see size on print) which hold 3 winding layers to add up to 280 turns of #16 cotton coated copper wire. These coil forms are 8 steel frames, .030\" thick. Each frame is 6-1/4\" high, hollow core and makes firm metal to metal contact to the mounting base. These coils are hollow and do not have a top cover plate. The 280 turns of wire are held in place by a top lip of steel, .030\" thick. When these coils are inserted into the generator housing cavities, they are a close fit with the cotton coating of the wires directly against the generator casting. This prevents coils from shaking and allows the coils to send their pulsed magnetic energy waves into the generator casting which then aids an setting up the needed pulse rate for the unit. As these"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"28 coils rotate, their hollow centers create a certain vacuum effect likened to a vortex. Whenever a vortex is present, magnetic energy is free to flow. All this magnetic action is aided by the materials which comprise the assembly of the coils. For example, coil size, metal thickness, wire size, turns, connections, etc - all take part in helping to create the needed Coil Collapse timing. The magnetic energy when removed from the center commutator impacts the coils at 26 pulses per complete revolution then 26 X 4800 = 124,800 pulses per minute activating these 8 coils. These 6-1/4\"high coils send part of the rising and falling magnetic energy field into the generator housing which is in contact with the coils. As the Generator becomes impacted by this PULSED magnetic energy flow it then affects the release timing of the magnets. This timing affects the revolutions and the revolutions affect the pulsing, and the pulsing determines the outlay of the magnetic current from the Generator to the Driver winding which then helps to establish HP. When the unit is driven by the 9 HP starter Motor, the magnet coils send their energy storage charge first into the aluminum laminated Plate #28 through the actual contact of the Steel Frame #27. This laminated Plate then transfers an energy charge through the brass connecting arms Part #34 and into the magnesium plate #30. This magnesium plate remains charged after the unit rotates faster and disconnects the arms. This charged plate becomes a massive holding attract the moment the control brushes circuit generates energy into the 8 magnet coils. This massive attract results from half of the laminated Aluminum Plate being charged with one set polarity and the other half an opposite polarity. This action can be likened to one giant magnet and the connection pattern for the 8 magnet coils cause this action to happen. 28) Mounting base for the 8 magnet coils is a ring shaped assembly measuring 11-3/8\" ID by 18-3/8\" OD by 3/4\" thick (5+sheets of .002 thick sheet metal shim stock). This ring is made of six pieces of aluminum (Alminal W16) each being 1/8\" thick by 18-3/8\" OD, 11- 1/8\" ID. Between each of these rings is placed one piece of .002 steel shim stock measuring 18-3/8\" OD by 11-1/8\" ID. The assembly is bonded together with nonmetal epoxy glue and held with nylon screws to form the 3/4\" (+) thickness. All 8 coils have their bottom steel surface making direct contact to the top aluminum ring with nylon bolts going into threaded holes is shown on print. 29) Delrin ring with a 8\" ID, 19-3/8\" OD by 1\" thick secured to part #26. Part #28 is secured to this ring. 30) Magnesium ring measuring 11-1/2\" ID by 18-1/8\" OD by 1/2\" thick. This part is mounted so as to be located as close as possible to the bottom of part #28 without making actual contact. 31) Mica ring located under part #21. This ring measures 11-1/4\" ID by 18-3/8\" OD by 1/8\" thick. 32) Hardened aluminum driver plate which is secured to the center shaft with a left-hand thread. This plate measures 18-3/4\" OD with 1-1/2\" ID (threaded to the shaft) shaped as shown on print. Parts #30 and #31 are secured to this plate with non-metal screws. 33) Six machined grooves cut into the 3/4\" thick aluminum assembly. 34) Six brass curved connecting arms that swivel on shafts which are mounted to the magnesium ring. These brass arms are lightly held into the aluminum assembly and accomplish two purposes. First, they allow the inner rotor to be spun by turning the center shaft. Second, they carry a magnetic charge from the 8 coils through the aluminum and into the magnesium ring to transfer the needed HOLDING charge. As these arms are caused to"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"29 rotate faster than the start-up speed, they move out and away causing the charge to the magnesium to serve as a holding clutch which then allows the rotor to drive the output shaft. 35) Six safety stop rods, screwed into the magnesium to prevent the brass connecting arms from moving too far out of position. 36) Six brass shafts secured into part #30 which allow parts #34 to move as needed. 37) Center brass shaft 21\" long, made as shown with the center portion being 1-3/4\" in Dia. The lower section has a left hand thread which allows part #32 to be firmly secured to the shaft. 38) A brass plate 4\" OD, 3/8\" thick which is a pressfit onto the center shaft. This plate adds support to firmly hold part #32. 39) A brass spacer washer to prevent the rotor from shifting downward with the center ball bearings. 40) Are two double-wide ball bearings measuring 1-1/2\" ID by 2-3/4\" OD. These bearings allow the center hub part #26, to rotate free of the center shaft. 41) One ball bearings held by the cover plate, measuring 1-1/2\" ID by 2-3/4\" OD. 42) A bearing housing to support parts #41 and is bolted to the cover plate. 43) Top cover plate measures 29-1/4\" OD, 5/8\" thick. Made of cast semi-red brass. Description: Al 0.005 max Cu 75.0-77.0 Fe 0.40 max, Ni 1.0 P 0.02 max Pb 5.5-7.0 S 0.08 max Sb 0.25 max Si 0.005 max Sn 2.0-3.0 Zn 13.0-17.0 Other Cu may include Ni; for continuous castings, P 1.5 max. The Cover becomes a conductor of the particle activity that is generated on the rotary magnets and serves as an incoming and outgoing point of magnetic transference. 44) A bottom double-wide ball bearing measuring 1-1/2\" ID, 2-3/4 \" OD mounted into the bottom ball bearing mounting housing. 45) Bottom ball bearing housing, made of aluminum measuring 4-3/4\" OD, by 2-3/4\" high, bolted to part #1. 46) Two hand activated brass shafts which are caused to be pushed upward, to then compress brake material up against the bottom of casting part #26 to stop the rotor for maintenance purposes. 47) Commutator made in 3 layers 7-1/4\" OD, 4\" total width. There are three sections of 52 bars per section, each bar has a .030 mica between bars. A total of 120 connecting brass pins, 1/16\" thick are secured to these bars. The brass pins are comprised of 72% copper, 9-1/3% nickel, 9-1/3% manganese and 9-1/3% magnesium. The holding core of this commutator assembly is brass with a 3-3/8\" ID. NOTE: The center commutator has only 16 of these brass pins secured at the proper bars. (See print for details) 48) One brush holder to hold a grouping of 9 brushes, 3 for the generator, 3 for the magnet coil commutator, and 3 for the driver. This brush holder is aluminum with nine non-metal insulation jackets between the brushes and the aluminum. 49) Nine soft carbon brushes with very light spring tension to hold the brushes to the commutator bars. 50) One brush holder to hold only two brushes, one for the Generator and one for the magnet coil commutator. 51) The connection pattern which circuits the brushes as needed. 52) Jumper wires located at the commutator. 53) Drilled holes to allow the wires from the winding to be circuited to the commutator."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"30 54) One shaft seal to hold a vacuum interior measuring 1-1/2\" OD by 2-3/4\" OD by 1/2\" thick. 55) Two \"O\" rings, one in part #1 and one in part #43. 56) Are 6 holes, 5/8\" dia. Drilled and tapped into the bottom plate to use to hold motor as needed. 57) A vacuum pipe with valve to pull a vacuum to the unit or add oxygen as needed. 58) A 2\" dia. View port sealed with see-through acrylic to observe the brushes during operation. 59) An insulation ring, 6-3/8\" OD, 1/4\" thick by 1-3/8\" high. The inner surface of part #2 is knurled because as particles strike this inner knurled surface they are caused to be defused by the angles of this surface contributing to the needed bombastic particle action within the unit. This knurled aluminum housing holds and utilizes the needed molecules that would otherwise simply penetrate the wall. This captured energy gets to be circuited to the 168 rods which are 7/32\" thick, creating a needed thermos bottle effect at this major energy zone. The 168 rods which are 13-5/8\" long and the 84 rods which are 7-3/16\" long serve the purpose of creating a needed POLE DIVERSITY charge system between the charged Generator Housing and the charged Motor Housing. These rods become charged with neutral magnetic fields and cause the motors magnetic fields to respond to these rods creating a vibration stabilization. Thus magnetic energy becomes stored in the carbon plates which almost contact the upper and lower castings to then supply the needed return field for the generator winding. These rods also create a condition that expands the draw factor for the driver magnets, an action that keeps the magnets properly charged. 60) A delrin ring having a 24-1/4\" OD, 21-1/2\" ID by 2-7/8\" high. This part is held as a support spacer between copper tube #25 and part #19. 61) 118 brass wedges, 3-1/2\" long by 7/16\" wide, by 1/32\" thick (same alloy blend as the driver housing.) 62) Brass wedges for 104 generator slots are 3-1/4\" long, 7/16\" wide, 1/32\" thick, same alloy blend as the driver wedges. 63) NOTE - the top row of generator magnets protrudes 3/16\" up past the slot area of the generator winding.

These wires go through tubes #13 and exit from the bottom of Part #1. When the wires pass through part #1, the holes are only large enough to allow the wires to slide through without being loosely fit. Since the generator housing encases these coils, there is an alternating magnetic pulse rate being registered throughout this housing. This pulse rate condition becomes the driving force which creates a magnetic flow PRESSURE. As the 44 rotating contacts take their travel path with the generator housing, the pulsed energy is ready to seek out ATTRACT locations. The 252 rods which are in contact with the carbon ring Part #5, have become magnetically charged, a condition which forms an ideal attract structure. As these rotating contacts pulse to 44 carbon rounded shapes, this energy jumps the gap because of having the needing alternating magnetic pulse rate. This pulsed energy has an unbroken flow pattern, (no off time), as 44 rotating contacts pulse to 42 stationary carbon electrodes. Every time pulsing takes place, it happens at two pulse points, 180 degrees apart. Each moving contact pulses 42 pulses per revolution with two of these contacts always pulsing at the same time. This equates to 147,840 total pulses per second. This pulsed energy sends its magnetic flow along the rods to complete a circuit to the bottom carbon rings, Part #6. These lower 42 carbon shapes then pulse to 44 moving contacts which rotate with the driver housing Part #16. All of the magnetic energy flow between these contacts gets completed by jumping a space gap. All the magnets, Parts #8 and #13, attract to the windings by jumping across given space distances. Magnetic POWER can only be put to work (within a unit of this design) as it is caused to cross over to a given ATTRACT structure. Each magnet has its own magnetic pulse rate which is in tune to its draw factor to the atmosphere: however, as the 252 rods are positioned next to the neutral edges of these magnets, these magnets acquire a new magnetic pulse rate. This new pulse flow arrives at the magnets from the generator housing (along with the 252 rods) causing a CHANGE to each magnets draw factor. This change is manifest as an interruption of the magnets' attract pull condition, a desired action which aids in the COIL RELEASE activity. All of the magnets then become INTUNED to one massive pulse rate which then serves as one draw factor for ALL the magnets. This pulse rate is manifest at the cover plate, Part #43, which is a point of outgoing magnetic transference. The incoming transference is partly caused by the magnetic vibration of the 252 rods. As these rods attract and release the windings, they MOVE (a minuscule amount) to cause a magnetic frequency of sound waves, which then TAPS INTO the energy of the Ionosphere. The generator winding constantly draws energy from the generator casting as it circuits its flow down to the driver winding. This energy needs to FLOW BACK to the generator casting; the outer magnetic circuit (which utilizes the rods) helps to feed back the magnetic flow to then be recycled. The unit constantly recycles a stabilized magnetic energy (not electro magnetic), because magnetism is a constant."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"32 MAGNETIC CURRENT GENERATOR FOR LIGHT BOX • Produces magnetic current for lighting magnetic light devices • Suggested use - will light six light boxes in homes, businesses, greenhouses, etc. • Requires Rhodonite (Manganese Silicate) inside the unit • Requires mechanical startup • Consists of two rotors turning opposite directions simultaneously The present unit utilizes power by directly capitalizing on the natural resource of magnetism. This unit demonstrates that every element has a unique range of vibrations that can be harnessed to give magnetic current a distinct polarity. This unit uses Manganese Silicate (Rhodonite) to produce a flowing magnetic current that produces light in the Magnetic Light Box. People will probably substitute many different elements in this unit to see how they effect the magnetic current being produced. The motor works as follows: Figure 1 shows an outer rotor rotated by a brass shaft at 5,610 RPM, which causes the winding assembly to pass between permanent magnets. When this outer rotor is rotating, a second inner rotor is rotated opposite the first rotor. This action then causes the outer rotor to continue to rotate at 5,600 RPM with the inner rotor also continuing to rotate at 2,200 RPM. Magnetic flowing energy is then removed at the six energy removal locations as the unit rotates 24 hours per day at a rate in excess of the equivalent of a one horsepower standard electrical generator. The driving force that actually rotates these rotors is a perfect harmony of attract polarities which create a release timing caused by the interaction of both rotors.

Two circular 3/8\" dia. carbon brushes, 3/4\" long. These brushes are lightly spring held to the top surface of Parts #12. Thus the top surface of Parts #12 need to be machined to allow the brushes to slide as needed. 2. Are two brush insulation jackets with springs to hold Part #61. These brush holders are secured into Part #17, the brass top ring. These jackets are located 180 degrees apart, centered between the magnets that have the same polarities (two north inward faces together and 180 degrees across, two south inward faces together. These brushes remove magnetic charges from the rods for every 180 degrees of rod travel. This removed energy is used as needed. 3. Are two insulated coaxial cable wires that go to a device needing magnetic current. Explanation as to how the interaction of both rotors takes place: On the inner rotor which rotates backward, there are 132 flat rows of #27 insulated motor wire with 60 turns per row. Between each flat row is a spacer made of .012\" thick plastic magnet material. These 132 flat rows of wire are wound as six separate circuits with one end of each circuit connected to one copper bar Part #36. The other end of each circuit is connected to one copper bar of Part #43. Each of the six separate circuits has 22 rows of wires. All of the wires from any given circuit are wound in the same direction, thus three circuits are wound clockwise and three are wound backwards or counter clockwise. Next, after five more layers are added to this first coil, then this seventh layer (from circuit #1) again gets wound clockwise. Circuit #2 again gets wound counter clockwise and this pattern continues for all six separate circuits. As these 132 flat rows of #27 wire get pulsed 'ON', half of them setup a pulse of one kind of polarity and half of the opposite polarity. When magnetic energy is allowed to be circuited from the six boron carbide contacts, a current flow through these coils causes a slight SPEED change to this inner rotor. The inner rotor has a 2-3/4\" to 1 speed ratio; however, this speed will vary due to the load from a high of 2500 RPM to a low of 2200 RPM. As these two armatures rotate, they create a certain VORTEX condition that draws energy into the generator. At the high of 2500 RPM, each set of the six circuits get turned 'ON' a total of six times per complete turn, because of crossing over the six carbon brushes Part #29. Thus we have six circuits activated six different times for ONE complete rotation which equals 36 x 2500 RPM or 90,000 pulses per minute. These charges become amplified by the 133 plastic magnets and cause a certain magnetic pulse rate to influence the inner 8 permanent magnets. This action is an influencing factor, which causes the start-up shaft speed of 5,600 RPM to be maintained. Explanation of Parts #52: Note that these plastic magnets are located between North and South magnets. This particular placement causes the fields of the outer permanent magnets to become extended, and in the process, these plastic magnets become charged, somewhat like magnetic capacitors. The magnetic pulse sequence that occurs within the framework of the 8 coils, Part #16 has a very definite purpose. This action has to do with the amount of driving power achieved. The polarity of the plastic magnets is such that the 2 permanent magnets (one on each side) are BOTH attracting these 24 pieces of plastic magnets."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"36 This action SETS UP A MOVING MAGNETIC CHARGE that travels in the direction of rotation. This moving magnetic charge also contributes to the rotation by ATTRACTING and RELEASING the rods that pass directly in front of these plastic magnets. When we speak of a MAGNETIC generator, do not equate this unit to an ELECTRICAL generator. Remember this very important principle, that 'MAGNETISM CAN MANIFEST WITH A PULSE-RATE,' which gives it directed harmonic power to perform multiple tasks. The various magnetic currents within this unit flow to their destinations because they are attracted there. Each part of the unit contributes to the formation of a unique magnetic current polarity that performs specific functions without interrupting the other polarities. These many different currents can work side by side in harmony much like a healthy human body that has many different processes constantly working for specific purposes. There is a continuous transmutation process taking place whereby magnetic energy continually generates an energy that manifests a MEASURABLE current. This measurable magnetic current is caused to happen through the use of PARTICULAR pulsing action. This pulsing action is established by ALTERNATING the magnetic attract of the magnets. To establish the actual pulse frequency of this unit we simply COUNT the polarity changes per minute. As the eight generator coils take their circular travel path, one would suppose that as these coils pass through powerful sets of permanent magnets, surely this activity would generator SPARK. This does not happen because electricity is the BY-PRODUCT of a troubled magnetic field and the movement of these coils DOES NOT trouble the fields of these magnets. The INNER rotor CHANGES the magnetic pulse-rates of the permanent magnets, a magnetic action that prevents an elastic HOLDBACK to the coils. The generating of electricity DEPENDS UPON a resistance FACTOR. Thus, without resistance, or the TROUBLING of the magnetic fields electricity will NOT be produced. This unit should be POSITIVE PROOF that an electron is simply a grouping of magnetic molecular structures that were caused to gather because of the TROUBLING of a magnetic field. The 244 rods that are located at the outside and inside surfaces of the eight generator coils contribute to the changes in the magnets' pulse rates. These rods are CAUSED to partly REDIRECT the attracting action between the NORTH/SOUTH fields of the permanent magnets. This redirecting of the lines of force also AIDS in preventing an elastic holdback condition to the coils. To explain, when a rod starts to arrive in front of, let us say, a NORTH magnet, this rod instantly grabs (or acquires) this same north charge. This charge is then ATTRACTED upward to the connecting bar that has secured to it a rod that is passing in front of a SOUTH magnet. The magnetic fields are caused to be STRETCHED upward instead of needing to ONLY penetrate directly through the copper coils. This action becomes responsible for breaking a massive number of 'lines of magnetic force,' as the attracting magnets send their force fields BETWEEN the rods, to then penetrate the coils. This activity creates TWO separate magnetic pulse-rates, one group of pulsing is UP and DOWN (as well as down and up) while the second set of pulse-rates pass directly through the coils. All of these pulsing actions COMBINE with a certain blending of magnetic circuitry that then flows as MAGNETIC CURRENT to the light box. Another action that aids in preventing a HOLDBACK condition (of the coils) is the magnetic charging of the rods. When any given rod travels past a magnet FACE, it picks up a LIKE charge that is carried PAST this magnet. This charge is an ATTRACT polarity to the magnet it is approaching and thus gets PULLED in the direction of rotation. This is a NEEDED rod charging action because it aids in maintaining the speed of this outer rotor. These charged rods will only maintain this driving activity for 360 degrees if the rods are cleaned of this magnetic current. The"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"37 two brushes that contact the Nickel connection bars accomplish this cleaning, or charge removal action. This removal process produces USEFUL magnetic current. However, if this energy did not get circuited away from these rods, it would result in MAGNETIC FLOW stoppage as the magnetic molecular structures transmute into a GROUPING PROCESS identified as ELECTRONS. This energy would then manifest with a discharge of SPARK to the permanent magnets. The design of this generator is arranged to NOT produce spark in that spark argues, short- circuits, etc. Magnetism manifests as a FORM of light inside the generator, light that is not electrical in nature. ALL light can be categorized as being a light FORM of magnetic energy. PULSE RATE FOR THIS UNIT WHICH IS PARTLY SUPPLIED BY THE 244 RODS. As each rod travels a 360-degree rotation it will completely change polarities at six different locations. One might suppose that since there are eight sets of permanent magnets, surely the rods would change their charge every time they travel between each of these magnet sets. However, there are two of these magnet sets that DO NOT change polarities. This arrangement (of the magnets) creates two massive magnetic fields located 180 degrees across from each other. Thus, this unit has a magnet arrangement whereby eight sets of magnets respond as only SIX sets of magnets. This arrangement of magnets builds the DESIRED pulse-rate for the rods. The pulse counting of the rods is found as we take 244 rods times six pulses equals 1,464 rod pulses PER ROTATION. Next, we take these 1,464 pulses times the rotations of 5600 RPM and arrive at 8,198,400 pulses to the rods per minute. The rods' pulses are LONG, up and down pulses, that cause a certain kind of WAVE FRONT COLLISION to the lines of magnetic force that pass BETWEEN these rods. This action IMPACTS the eight generating coils with an INDUCTION charge that SETS POLARITIES inside the coils. Every time the magnet polarities are changed on each side of the copper core (of the coils), this copper grabs the induction charge of magnetism to then get circuited into the eight coils of wire. Because magnetism can travel without speed restrictions, these events happen instantaneously. CHARGING OF THE EIGHT GENERATOR COILS Each of the eight generating coils gets charged every time it passes between a set of permanent magnets. Thus, each coil is charged eight times PER ROTATION. However, the coil's FULL POWER GENERATING ACTION is in-tune with the timing of when the coil is caused to complete a FLOW CIRCUIT. This flow sequence is best reviewed as we study the actions of the six carbon brushes (part #29). Each of the eight coils has two wires. These sixteen wires get connected to sixteen copper bars (one wire per bar). The six carbon brushes always pulse to FOUR coils activated as 'ON' while FOUR coils are being OFF. Next, during a rotational travel distance of 15 degrees, for the coil assembly, all of the ON coils get circuited to being 'OFF' coils while all the OFF coils are then ON coils. To expand on this pulse counting we find 24 coil polarity changes happen in just 360 degrees of travel (one rotation). Next, to arrive at the coils pulse-rate, that is set by the six carbon brushes, we take 24 pulses per rotation times 5600 RPM to then equal 134,400 coil pulses per minute. Of importance is that EACH coil is charged eight times per rotation. There are 64 coil CHARGE pulses in 360 degrees. Next, take 64 coil charges times 5600 RPM and arrive at 358,400 CHARGES per minute. Thus, each coil is being charged more than twice as much as the coil CIRCUIT REMOVAL action is. This DELAY of energy removal causes the charge, in the coils, to build-up to a charging volume whereby it JUMPS a (very close) SPACE GAP between the sixteen copper bars and the six carbon brushes. There is a strong attract field between the eight generator coils and the six carbon brushes. The inner counter-rotating rotor contributes to the attract force of the generated magnetic current"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"38 of the eight coils. The ACTIVITY of the inner counter-rotating rotor requires a deeper understanding if we are to focus on HOW magnetic current is generated. To begin this investigation of the inner rotor, we first review the motor JUST BEFORE the inner rotor is installed. We note the eight powerful magnets are arranged in a close circle, where EACH magnet is caused to have its field COMPRESSED. We could equate this action to each magnet as having its field squashed, likened to compressible spur gears. This arrangement results in each magnet DEMANDING its share of the center space. Next, the inner rotor is inserted and all of these compressed fields REDIRECT into the plastic washer shaped magnets. These plastic magnets are then TOTALLY CHANGED in magnetic strength as they ACQUIRE these fields from the permanent magnets. This activity CAUSES the permanent magnets to change their pulse rate. Then as the outer rotor is driven, these inner magnetic fields rotate backwards. Magnetism always operates in two directions simultaneously; this is a natural phenomenon. These rotors demonstrate this phenomenon because the energy of the permanent magnets saturates the plastic magnets which willingly take on a new polarity similar to the permanent magnets. The plastic magnets are the manifestation of the naturally occurring reverse fields of the permanent magnets. When the inner rotor is given a pull-start BACKWARDS, it then quickly accelerates up to the speed of 2200 RPM. This rotating action sets in motion a PULSE CHANGE to the OUTER permanent magnet fields. The polarities of the inner and outer magnets blend to create a locking harmonic resonance that is stable. This activity results in both rotors continuing to rotate, backward of each other. PULSE ACTION OF THE PLASTIC WASHER MAGNETS. Now we will focus on how the plastic washer magnets are caused to pulse. Every plastic magnet has a coil of wire located on each side. These flat coils of wire are used to circuit magnetic current from the eight large generator coils to the six output brushes. The magnetic current, stored in the carbon ring, is NEUTRAL, that is to say, it will attract to whatever polarity it is offered. The plastic washer magnets have a set-charge ON EACH SIDE, let us say NORTH on one side and SOUTH on the other. As the neutral magnetic current from the carbon ring is attracted into the flat coils that are on (for example) the NORTH sides of the plastic magnets, this incoming energy grabs this north polarity of the plastic magnet because the incoming energy traveled through only the north coil of the plastic magnets. This action creates momentary NORTH poles that manifest from the bottom to the top of the plastic magnets. Then, the South coils around the plastic magnets get pulsed with neutral magnetic current from the carbon ring. This action creates SOUTH poles that now manifest from the bottom to the top of the plastic magnets. This action of polarity switching continues as it responds to the permanent magnets inner fields causing continuous rotations. PULSING TO THE BOTTOM SURFACE OF PERMANENT MAGNETS. These magnets need to be fed RETURN magnetic energy from the load in order to remain fully charged. There is a vastly different magnetic pulse-rate that impacts the carbon brushes. These carbon brushes pass 'very close' to the bottom surfaces of the sixteen permanent magnets. To focus on the pulse number we note that as ONE carbon brush travels under one magnet, the brush is charged half north and half south. This is because this bottom surface of the magnet shares lines of force with both polarities, then when the brush travels to the next magnet; this charge is SWITCHED from one side of the brush to the other side of the SAME brush. There are eight carbon brushes that travel under the sixteen magnets (eight at the inner magnets and eight at the outer magnets). This particular location of the magnets has the flux lines VERY compacted into zones where half of this surface is one polarity and half the opposite polarity. As these brushes CRASH THROUGH these flux lines, they CAUSE a MAGNETIC VIBRATION to the magnet's"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"39 magnetic energy waves. This activity helps to FORM new magnetic pulse-rates to the magnets, which impact the total generating process. To find the pulse rate to these eight carbon brushes, which are all connected to one contact wire; we count the pulse rates for a single 360-degree rotation. We total the sixteen magnets times 8 carbon brushes to equal 128 pulses per rotation. Next, 128 pulses times 5600 RPM equals 716,800 pulse charges per minute. This magnetic current then travels along a copper-coated steel wire (coaxial cable) as it INTERACTS between the light box and the magnets' return location. Thus, while all magnets have a draw factor to the atmosphere, it is a necessary part of a magnetic flow to return magnetic current back to the magnets to then be recycled. FINAL COMMENT The functioning of this unit violates many current scientific principles. Most scientists assume that current theories, rules, and laws are true, and so they do not seek to develop technology that may violate accepted truths. Our current technology is a product of accepted scientific principles. Our current technology is killing us. We must begin to explore new principles and new technology to ensure our survival. For the sake of our survival we urge you to begin to think \"outside of the box\", the current scientific paradigm that is leading us into destruction. Our destructive technology was all developed out of fear; fear of not having enough money, fear of dying, fear of losing control...it is time to start creating devices and machines out of love!

This is a magnetic device that encases molecular structures in a see-through box and then causes them to manifest as magnetic light. This device, aside from supplying light, will also aid in proving that the bulk of molecular structures are magnetic. The light occurs partly due to the arrangement of wires that function as LIGHTING FILAMENTS and do not produce heat as we know it. This device has the needed atmospheric interior that causes magnetic current to manifest as light through a series of magnetic interactions. The device has the correct wiring arrangement, which causes magnetic energy to be subjected to a change of motion that contributes to the manifestation of light. This light box is made of 3/8\" thick acrylic measuring 29 inches high, 18 inches deep and 12 inches wide. This box has the bottom acrylic fastened so as to be removable and secured to hold 5 pounds of air pressure. Magnetic current is circuited into this box in such a way so as to travel around all the interior edges, then be returned to the generator. The magnetic current is attracted back to the generator, but the wiring controls how much current returns to the generator causing a magnetic energy build-up in the box. This energy build-up in the pressured environment causes a molecular reaction that is nuclear in nature with minimal heat and no radioactivity. It is a form of cold fusion as the reaction between the wires spreads and releases the transformed magnetic energy as light. The acrylic box is sealed to hold 5 pounds of air pressure and magnetic current is circuited into the box. This energy travels 50 percent of its distance in one direction and then completes its return circuit by interacting with the flow of the wire only 1/8-inch away. This magnetic activity becomes transmuted into a light form of magnetism as it utilizes the 5 pounds of air inside the box. There is some modest heating but the wires' temperature could be called COLD when compared to electrical filament heating. This light box illustrates that most molecular structures are MAGNETIC. People will call the energy inside this unit electricity, but this energy is more accurately described as a LIGHT FORM of magnetism. All light is a form of magnetic energy. Electricity is the misuse of magnetic energy, and electrical light is a form of magnetism that creates unnecessary and unhealthy bi- products. As this unit demonstrates, light can be produced without damaging the environment. If the air is taken out of this unit the light stops showing that the air is a magnetic conduit. Other gases can be mixed in the box to bring various results. Magnetic fields around the box will produce different results. This simple unit has endless possibilities for scientific investigation.

The wire wrapped around in one continuous length of clean #27 copper coated steel wire. 5. Acrylic wire holding spacers shafts bonded to all 17-corner locations. These shafts allow wires to be firmly tightened so as to maintain a 1/8-inch spacing between all wires. 6. Viewing figure 1. To begin, a small spool of #27 clean copper coated steel wire is located inside the box. This wire should be similar to the wire inside a coaxial cable. Next, the wire is secured into one wall by having an acrylic tube fastened on the box and bonded to the wire's insulation jacket that is on the wire outside the box. This wire should have enough length to go to the Magnet Current Generator which supplies the energy to power this light box. Next, with the top and bottom open (top to be glued in place after wiring), the wire from the spool is placed over a 1/8-inch short acrylic spacer shaft located at position #1. This wire is held firm by an acrylic snap collar (see figure 1), and is then circuited to point #2 where another collar is pressed into place to keep the wire tight. This winding pattern goes around for all 17-wire holding locations until arriving back at start point #1. This same spool of wire now reverses and goes backwards 1/8 inch away from the first set of wires until arriving back at location #1. The end of this wire is left DEAD ENDED. Next, this wire end is bent into a hair pin shape that places it 1/4 inch away from the wire which has entered the box at the start of the winding. The final wire connection inside the box is as follows. The dead-ended wire has a very special connecting method that then returns its flow back to the generator. (See Figure 1). A second copper coated steel wire is secured and protruding inside the box that goes to the magnetic current generator. This wire has a clean #40 copper wire securely attached. This thin wire serves somewhat like a fuse as it makes contact to the dead-ended wire. This thin wire controls how much magnetic current leaves the light box; it keeps a certain magnetic pressure in the box to create bright light. These two wires, while being held 1/4 inch, apart are wrapped around with three wraps of #40 wire. As shown, this contact surface is only 3 BACKSIDES of contact. The use of this thin wire, and its minimal contact prevent the magnetic flow from returning to the generator with a volume that could drain the energy from inside the box."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"42 ROMAG-GENERATOR • Produces magnetic current equivalent of 50 H.P. output • Suggested use is for running magnetic devices including the Magnetic Water Pump and the Pyramid Molecular Vibratory Exchanger Unit • Requires startup spinning to achieve 1850 RPM • Requires special sintered magnets ABSTRACT The Earth is surrounded with a sea of energy that is pulsing and is constantly being supplied by a Universal energy system. This energy field that we call the Ionosphere supplies all of the energy needs on our planet. Like the other units we have presented, this Romag-Generator taps into this energy field, converts the energy into something that we can use, and then releases the energy back into the system. This unit, like the others, recycles the Earth's magnetic energy, in fact, all these units cannot function if the energy is not getting recycled because the buildup of energy causes them to stop working. When we present machinery that connects to the Universal energy mechanism, we are opening a whole new world. These concepts are nothing new, but we have yet to see them implemented in our societies.

Magnetic energy is not confined to the simple force people observe between two magnets. Magnetic energy is more accurately described as an infinite variety of energy manifestations that are multidimensional in nature. This unit would have absolutely no connection to the Ionosphere if magnets were as simple as most people think. When magnets are spun at the proper speed and their fields are harnessed with the proper elements, they produce a frequency very similar to the ionosphere, and something magical happens. Because of the Universal phenomenon of attract- attract (where similar energies are attracted to each other), energy structures in the ionosphere begin to gather and swirl into a vortex as the unit attracts them. The small signal generated by the unit travels at a speed beyond space and time, and energy structures similar to it are attracted to it at the same velocity. This attract-attract phenomenon allows magnets to assist in a tremendous amount of energy generation. This motor is a magnetic device incorporating the use of permanent magnets turning in a rotor to generate a magnetic/electro energy which is then circuited to other mechanisms to do useful work. PRINCIPLE BEHIND THIS ENERGY SOURCE This motor attracts neutral magnetic energy into the rotor magnets, sets up a response between various components which then complete a circuit that becomes the driving force to turn the structure. SUMMARY OF THE DEVICE An important objective of the present invention is to provide a revolutionary new concept concerning the utilization of power by directly capitalizing on the natural resource phenomenon of"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"43 magnetism. Electrical power is the result of expending energy to drive a copper wire through a magnetic field. But magnetic energy is a natural resource needing a specific mechanism to draw on. There is no incorporation of a secondary energy source, except at start-up, to cause this magnetic/electro unit to continuously function. HOW THE UNIT FUNCTIONS The Ro—Mag magnet motor/generator must be charged up by driving the main shaft at 1350 R.P.M. for 67 seconds. This charging process manifests as magnetic energy within the 10 coils of copper wire, the copper tube supporting these coils and the copper coated steel wires wrapped around the magnets. This charging is accomplished while the ten coil connection wires are making contact and setting up their alternating magnetic poles. After the 67 second charging time one of these coil connection wires must be opened and this circuit again completed through an energy draw process. As current is drawn from the ten coils this ‘draw’ sets up magnetic poles which are a response between the rotor magnets and the coils. This response then causes the main shaft to be rotated by the permanent magnets as they attract and build a release field. Then the driver unit is disconnected allowing the unit to rotate with the load being the activating driving force. Do not use ‘electrical teaching’ to presuppose how much of an energy flow is allowed to leave the coils by focusing on the wire size of these 10 coils. The magnetic current flow being circuited out through the copper wire has no dependency on this wire’s inner structure, in that the wire is only a point of transference where an exchange takes place, while producing ‘no heating’ of the wires/coils. The fields of the magnets must be maintained during their spin movement. These magnetic fields which are encapsulated are achieved by the wiring system. The attract/release of the magnets is a function caused by several factors. First, the magnets attract field between north and south is completed by taking a crossing path of attract (top of one row to bottom of next, etc.). This action has the effect of fields blending into fields, and a hold-back attract does not happen. Each time a magnet set passes a coil an interchange of like energy between the coils around the magnets and the generating coils sets-up neutral polarities which are ‘release fields' and prevents a hold-back attract. One important magnetic assembly is the circuitry that allows this interchange of energy. This is a recycling of a stabilized magnetic/electro energy not electro/magnetic because the field of force is not a case of electrical input, an input that created the magnetic, but rather a build-up of magnetic energy which caused an energy thrust. In further defining the workings of this unit it is important to understand that although electrical and magnetic (energy) work with similar attitudes, the manner in which they work sets-up a differing energy effect. One of these effects is that magnetic structures want to share their flow, compatible to the Universal Force, while electrical flow argues, (short circuits, sparks, etc.). Because of this fact the working responses (within the unit) take place, ‘how they are needed’, and ‘when they are needed’ which results in a functioning unit. There is a continuous transmutation process taking place whereby magnetic energy continually generates an energy that manifests a measurable current. This ‘removed current’ is best described as low voltage at very high amperage and if this energy is used to its maximum potential then it will outproduce the power produced by a standard 50 H.P. electrical generator. With a constructed unit that functions continuously, there comes an awesome awareness that by allowing the now set laws of physics to be changed error is corrected. We can then discover that magnetism has a true value and is not an obscure by-product. From this mental freedom will come discoveries heretofore unknown concerning magnetic fields. The following are claims to summarize important points about the unit:"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"44 1) A magnetic powered device that utilizes a natural, neutral and universal magnetic energy and makes the energy available for use to a different device that is designed to attract the energy from this unit.

In the past, inventors have sent devices and drawings to Patent Offices claiming they had invented perpetual motion. We state that this motor, which is driven totally by permanent magnet power, in no way can be compared with perpetual motion in that the principle is not the same. When perpetual motion is discussed, it is mentioned in terms of unknown factors which produce an unknown force. Here, in this Ro-Mag Generator, the force of attract-attract to attract-release within the magnetic structure can be observed, thereby producing the generating force to turn the rotor which in turn produces the outflow of power. This power source is not predicated on a continuous flow of energy but predicated on the consistency of the transmutation process of the magnetic molecular structures within the Earth’s pressure flow.

This unit demonstrates that magnetic principles can be utilized in units of various sizes. Magnetic units can be microscopic or a mile wide, as long as the correct principles are maintained. When magnetic fields are properly harnessed, when the magnets and housing are a certain composition, when the magnets are rotating at the proper rpm, and when the energy is given a redistribution path, a very powerful phenomenon occurs; the natural flow of Universal magnetic energy begins to escalate. All magnets draw energy in to maintain their power, but under the right conditions magnets can assist in attracting large quantities of magnetic energy that can be used for numerous purposes. PRINCIPLE BEHIND THIS ENERGY SOURCE This motor utilizes neutral magnetic energy from the Earth's energy field by attracting the energy through the proper magnetic harmonic. The unit captures the energy and changes it into a polarity that magnetic devices can accept. This simple unit is like a water wheel, it only functions if a flow is moving through it, and it will continue turning as long as it is being used to power something. An important object of the present device is to provide a revolutionary new concept concerning the utilization of power by directly capitalizing on the natural resource of magnetism.

This charging process manifests as magnetic energy within the six coils of copper wire, the copper tube supporting these coils and the copper coated steel wires wrapped around the magnets. This charging is accomplished while the six coil connection wires, Part #22, are making contact and setting up their alternating magnetic poles. After the 42 second charging time one of these coil connection wires must be opened and this circuit again completed through an energy draw at what could be called 7 amps. See load Part #23. As current is drawn from the six coils, this draw sets up magnetic poles which are a response between the rotor magnets and the coils. This response then causes the main shaft to be rotated by the 12 permanent magnets as they attract and build a release field. Then the driver unit (hand crank) is disconnected allowing the unit to rotate with the load being the activating driving force."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"49 The fields of the magnets must be maintained during their spin movement.

This power source is not predicated on a continuous flow of energy but predicated on the consistency of the transmutation process of the magnetic molecular structures within the Earth's pressure flow. Some additional points may be useful in understanding the functioning of this unit. The thin web of brass between the magnets is important because it acts somewhat like a magnetic insulator. Each section of brass, on the sides of the magnets becomes charged, somewhat like a capacitor. This builds into a force which TAKES PART in causing the rotations. The magnets have a particularly low charge, but their charge is only a catalyst at the onset. It is during the SPIN charging that this blend of alnico elements draws neutral magnetism from the atmosphere that then manifests with the proper magnet strength for continuous running. This 2.2 peak energy product is the power needed that becomes a point of INCOMING and OUTGOING magnetic transference. Too much charge would solidify polarities that would then negate the needed VARIETIES of DIFFERENT magnetic fields. This mini-Romag unit cannot run horizontally. The magnetism of the earth system FEEDS this unit from the top. Gravity is compressed magnetism. The spinning rotor CAPTURES this compressed magnetism. Without the copper coated steel wire around the magnets no activity would take place and here is why. As the rotor is spun, an action that MUST happen is that the fields around the magnets need to stay with the magnets. These fields do not manifest as individual flux lines if the magnets are not wrapped as disclosed. The copper-coated steel wire becomes a MAGNETIC"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"50 CONTAINMENT FIELD as these wires take on THEIR OWN charge. These SETUP fields then serve as ISOLATOR fields which keep the magnets' flux lines in their place. The reason these copper-coated steel wires need no insulation is because the COPPER COATING ITSELF builds into a magnetic flow, which insulates the primary flow that travels inside the steel portion. This action results in a magnetic flow circuit that is GUIDED by the activity of the copper coating. This action should serve as a TEACHING to show how magnetic current can be sent through conductors that are TOTALLY UNLIKE the standard electrical insulators. The primary USE of this field (set up by these wires) is that it serves as a RELEASE AGENT that breaks the elastic hold-back during the generating cycle. The reason for the U-bent wires is that they serve as a CONDUIT that causes the magnets flux lines to take their travel path very close to the magnet. This circuit path is around the back surface and both side edges. This action can be likened to compressing a balloon. The result is that the field on the front or WORK SURFACE is greatly extended OUTWARD. This outward extension impacts the copper stator core, which then FEEDS captured magnetic current into the stator windings. PARTS LIST AND CONSTRUCTION DETAILS When building your first unit we suggest using the stated materials. 1) Aluminum Base Plate 2) Sleeve Bearing, 1\" long, ½\" inside diameter, oil impregnated brass. 3) 4\" long by ½\" diameter Brass Shaft 4) Brass 2\" diameter Rotor, 1—3/4\" long 5) Six rotor slots, each 1—3/4\" long by .260 deep by 23/32\" wide. These slots are spaced exactly 60 degrees apart. 6) One slot cut in center of Brass Rotor, 360 degrees around, ¼\" wide by 5/16\" deep. 7) 12 slots (formed from the six slots as the 360 degree cut is made). Each slot is lined with .010 thick mica insulation. 8) A total of 228 pieces of U—shaped .040 thick copper coated steel wires. Each slot (Part #7) has 19 pieces of these wires fitted into the Mica, thus these wires do not contact the Brass rotor. The lead edge of these wires (See Figure 7) is flush with the Rotor’s outer surface and the trail edge protrudes 1/8\" above the Rotor’s outer diameter. 9) Eleven complete turns of .032 thick copper coated steel wire. These 11 turns or ‘wraps’ accumulate to 3/8\" wide and the same pattern is placed around all 12 magnets. When placed into the bent wires #8, they are a snug fit making firm contact. 10) Are 12 pieces of .005\" thick mylar insulation inserted into the cores of the wires #9. 11) 12 permanent magnets, insulated with the mylar, to not contact wires # 9. These magnets measure 3/4 \" long, 5/8 \" wide, 3/8\" thick and are made of a special composition and strength. Alnico 4, M—60; 12 AL, 28 Ni, 5 Co, bal Fe, Isotropic permanent magnet material cooled in magnetic field, Cast 9100 TS. 450 Brin, 2.2 Peak energy product. When inserted in the rotor the outer faces of these 12 magnets are not to be machined to a radius. The center of these magnets pass the center of the coils with 3/32\" clearance. The edges, where the wires are wrapped, pass 1/32\" away from the coils. This ‘changing magnet spacing’ aids in not only the release cycle but also contributes to rotational movement. (Sharp magnet edges which are facing the coils are to be sanded to a small smooth radius.)"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"51 12) Magnet polarity placement into Rotor. (See Figure 5.) 13) Connection pattern for wires wrapped around magnets. (See Figure 6.) The 12 wire wraps are divided into two sections, upper and lower of six each. There are no connections between these sections. The magnetic flow direction between the upper 6 wraps and the lower 6 wraps is attained by the ‘flow direction’ as shown in Figure 5. Viewing Figure 6 shows the wires wrapped around the magnet starting at the top ‘north’ half and then after 11 complete turns the wire exits at the lower ‘south’ half. As this wire then goes to the next magnet it arrives at an attract wire which is its ‘north’ side. Thus all wires get interconnected from south to north magnet half or north to south magnet half. The actual connections should be crimped copper clips not solder with insulation tubing to prevent contact to the Rotor body. 14) A .030 thick copper tube (stiff material) 2\" long by 2½\" inside diameter. 15) Are six slots cut at the top of tube #14. These slots are 5/8\" wide by 1/32\" deep spaced at 60 degrees apart. 16) Are six slots cut at the bottom of tube #14. These slots are 5/8\" wide by 5/16\" deep and in line with the upper slots #15. 17) Six copper tube mounting points. 18) Acrylic ring to hold Part #14, measuring 3—3/4\" O.D., 2¼\" I.D., 3/8\" thick bolted directly to Part #1. This ring has a .030 wide groove cut ¼\"deep to allow the six copper tube mounting points, Part #17, to be inserted. 19) A .002\" thick plastic insulation paper to be placed around the inside and outside of Part #14. 20) Are six coils of insulated copper wire, each coil having 72 turns of .014 thick wire. Each coil is wound with two layers, the bottom layer to completely fill the 5/8\" wide slot with 45 turns and the top layer to span 5/16\" wide with 27 turns. To be sure each coil has the exact wire length or 72 turns, a sample length wire is wrapped then unwound to serve as a template for six lengths. A suggested coil winding method is to fill a small spool with one length then by holding the copper tube at the lower extension, then start at the plus wire in Figure 2 and temporarily secure this wire to the outer surface of the tube. Next, place the pre—measured spool of wire inside the tube, wrapping down and around the outside advancing clockwise until the 5/8\" slot is filled with 45 turns. Then, return this wire back across the top of the coil for 15/32\" and winding in the same direction again advance clock—wise placing the second layer spanned for 5/16\" with 27 turns. This method should have the second layer perfectly centered above the first layer. After winding this coil, repeat the process by again filling the small spool with another length of pre—measured wire. A very important magnetic response happens as all six coils have their second layers spaced as disclosed. 21) This number identifies the top view of the second layer. 22) Connection pattern for six coils shown in Figure 2. When the unit is driven at start—up (hand crank) for 42 seconds at 2100 RPM, all six jumper wires must be together which means the plus wire goes to the minus wire connected by the start switch. After 42 seconds the load is added to the circuit and the start switch is opened. To double check your connections between the coils, note that the finish wire of coil #1 goes to the finish wire of coil #2, which is top layer to top layer. This pattern then has start of coil 2 (bottom layer) going to start of coil 3 (also bottom layer). When the copper tube with the coils is placed around the rotor, the distance from any magnet to any coil must be identical. If it measures different, acrylic holding shapes can be bolted to the aluminum base, protruding upward, and thus push the copper tube in the direction needed to maintain the spacing as stated. 23) Wires to load. 24) Wires to start switch. 25) Rotational direction which is clock—wise when viewing from top down."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"52 26) Acrylic dome for protection against elements. 27) Coating of clear acrylic to solidify rotor.

This unit provides evidence that altering the vibration of molecules can exchange matter into a pure energy form that the human eye cannot see. We use the word \"exchange\" because all matter has a template that exists at a higher vibration, and this unit exchanges matter with it's matching template that is free of environmentally caused changes. Molecules are held together by magnetic force; this force can be alleviated, allowing the molecules to separate, leaving the molecules that are naturally attracted to each other remaining in tact. For example, injury and disease caused by environmental influences are not part of an organisms matching template, therefore, after an organism is subjected to the energy field of this unit, injury and disease are no longer part of the organism. This unit has an arrangement of pyramids which when magnetically activated, serve as test chambers where matter is exchanged. The magnets that rotate above and below the pyramids produce vortexing magnetic fields that encapsulate the pyramids. Two walls of wires on opposite sides of the pyramids, are charged with flowing magnetic current from the Romag Generator or the Celestial Particle Transmuter to produce a magnified SOUND OF VIBRATION that aids in creating the proper field for matter exchanging. The wires that line the pyramids aid in producing REFRACTORY LIGHT which becomes part of the process that makes the object under test APPEAR as though it is not there. The arrangement of hardware causes sound waves to influence the magnetic energy to manifest as pulses. Magnetic pulses produce powerful VIBRATORY CHANGES to the molecular structure of molecules that change the object into energy that human eyes cannot see. What changes is the VISIBLE matter.

One panel of the large pyramid is not used but the flat wire remains in place. This open side allows a direct viewing of the small pyramid. After the magnetic current is circuited into the walls of wires Parts #20 and #24, the top magnet is rotated using Part #7. When the speed is 2000 - 2400 rpm during the 1-1/4 minutes charge time, several magnetic charging actions happen. A. The wires Part #12 get charged. B. The wires Part #17 get charged. This charging of the wires causes the top magnet to follow these charges in route to attracting the bottom magnet, which now gets pulled around in the same direction. C. This rotating of the bottom magnet completes another magnetic circuit between the bottom location of the wire walls Parts #20 and #24 and the 1-1/2\" thick side section of this magnet. After the 1-1/4 minute charge time the bottom magnet, being influenced by the magnetic circuit to the walls of wire, continues to rotate serving as a rotating stabilizer that now pulls the TOP magnet around, at a somewhat slower speed. All of this magnetic activity creates sound that is turning into waves that then cause magnetism to come out as pulses. The center point of this massive magnetic action is the small pyramid that starts a vibration likened to a salt shaker on a shaking table. The hamster has now been changed into a form of energy that the human eye cannot see. What has changed is the VISIBLE matter. All of the magnetic activity was caused to happen as this newly formed energy was being setup in the wires around the pyramids. This is why the small pyramid is held from above with a length of the same wire, (part #17), a wire that also contacts the wires around the large pyramid. When it is stated that the hamster is subjected to VIBRATION, we are referring to an enhanced molecular vibration. ALL matter vibrates at the molecular level and enhancing this vibration is a natural process. This molecular shaking does not cause harm to the hamster. Comments about the wire walls: These wire walls are wound with .020\" thick clean copper coated steel wire for a reason. This thinner wire, when pulled as snug as possible, responds with a desired LIVELY BOUNCE. This action produces the stated, 'sound of vibration.' If the wire used were thicker, or just copper, the response would be likened to a THUD without the needed vibration action. Thus, in order to wind the wire wall tightly, the threaded brass rods are used to keep the brass bars, Parts #19 and #23 from bending. Comments about the Magnet Mounting Method: These magnets will constantly attract together with a south face from the top magnet attracting to a north face on the bottom magnet. Flange bearings are used to keep the magnets at their set space distance. Of great importance is the requirement to use all non-metal shafts, bearings and bearing supports both above and below the magnets. Another point--these magnets are NOT to be made from an assembly of smaller magnets but cast as one single 4-foot diameter magnet, 1-1/2\" thick. This one-piece structure causes the magnets to respond with the required activity throughout the casting with 21% Boron doing a special work (when blended with the elements listed). LOCATION FOR TESTING The bottom magnet needs to have a clear DRAW-FACTOR to the Earth. Therefore, the best testing location is outdoors on regular soil and NOT on cement."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"56 This unit demonstrates that atoms can be changed without heat. Atoms are magnetic molecular structures that have unique RYTHMIC VIBRATIONS and are in a constant state of change. The bottom line for understanding ALL universal action and events is that there is NOTHING BUT energy, which is in a constant state of change. All energy is ALWAYS forming and reforming until what we call MATTER results. All matter is made of various combinations of magnetic molecular structures which maintain a unified field of cohesion through a synchronistic vibration. The energy we call matter is constantly changing. Some energy is systemically changing faster than other energy. The molecules of an energy system, a rock for example, are held together by an attract force that is unique, harmonious, and synchronistic. Objects attract to each other o the degree they are similar. For every structure that is known (whatever name we have given it) there are equal structures being made, off shoots, if you will. Every component of energy (or matter) generates energy that is constantly vibrating and producing the pattern of its structure. All matter sings a unique song that can be slowed down and formulated into additional matter under the right conditions. For every energy structure combination that we perceive there is a structure combination outside of our perception, and these structures blend into an unending variety of combinations not unlike the vast array of color combinations available within the color spectrum. A change in substance NEED NOT NECESSARILY BE a change in molecular structure. Molecular structures can (and do) maintain their OWN integrity while simply incorporating themselves into DIFFERENT structural formations. If the PMVE unit is used as a tool to expand what has just been stated, it will be a great advance for science. The advancement will be in finding that an intertwining of magnetic circuitry produces the ability to MONITOR what is called a magnetic pulse-rate. For example, when the hamster is under test inside the small pyramid the very STRUCTURE of this animal becomes the FOCAL POINT for the conductive activity within the total generating force. The hamster is made of elements with every single element emitting three different TESTABLE magnetic responses that are exclusive to each element. A) Each element has a given magnetic pulse- rate, B) Each element as a given magnetic intensity, C) Each element will respond with a GIVEN polarity depending on the conditions surrounding it. Thus, while the hamster is in this new PURE ENERGY state we might find that to exist as this particular animal, the creature must have certain essential properties uniquely specifiable for each part of each element. We might say the properties are essential in the sense that as the PMVE unit is shut down all of the elements must be conserved. Naturally, the proof of conservation is the fact that the hamster is unharmed. The Universal Mind is offering this unit to us to expand our understanding of the Universe and to heal the ailments we have brought upon ourselves through environmental pollution. The human body is designed to live for countless years if it is free of disease and impurity. Some people who have mastered the ability to raise their vibrations are naturally performing a function very similar to this unit. These spiritual masters are known to heal their own bodies and those around them. This unit can assist people in learning to work with their energy systems to stay healthy and live free of physical problems. There is no flaw in the human design, it is the choices that we make that create the limitations we experience. The applications of this unit are nearly endless. This basic model can be extrapolated from to produce a vast array of devices incorporating this unit's principles. One day GROUPS of these units just might be arranged to REPLICATE all kinds of elements from other elements. People will use these principles to explore other dimensions, to travel by teleportation, to create unimaginable works of art, to explore micro-cosmos and macro-cosmos, and perform countless other endeavors."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"57 MAGNETIC PISTON • Operates at 5600 piston strokes producing 7 HP per piston • No exotic materials needed • Requires strong iron/boron/neodymium magnets • Suggested use: Power for vehicles of any type • Requires mechanical startup • Provides magnetic current to power magnetic devices, drive magnetic motors, etc. The object of this unit is to provide people with a complete and revolutionary mechanism for utilizing and converting the Earth's magnetic energy field into a usable physical energy. This unit demonstrates that there is order in the apparent randomness of the particle world. Order cannot come from chaos. The reliability of this unit is totally dependent on the consistency of flowing magnetic particles within the Universal system. This machine would not function if the Universe is or ever was chaotic. Nearly all electrical generators in use today produce a counter—electromotive back pressure and this back pressure is presently overcome by the expenditure of energy from prime movers such as fossil fuel engines, water wheels, etc. With the piston disclosed herein the energy generated during the cycle does not manifest as back pressure. Because of the unit’s unique energy recycling system all of the energy generated by the generating coil is fed back into the magnetic-electro system. This accomplishes two primary purposes: a) to charge up stationary plastic magnets that are in close proximity to the coil, thus causing the coil to generate and manifest with a given attract polarity; b) at the proper moment, the coil causes a release of the piston armature magnets through a unique process that reverses the energy flow with a magnetic electro balance thus allowing a completed piston stroke. To further define the workings of this unit it is important to understand that although electrical and magnetic (energy) work with similar attitudes, the manner in which they work has a differing energy effect. One of these effects is that magnetic structures want to share their flow, compatible to the universal force, while electrical flow argues, (short circuits, sparks, etc.). Because of this fact the working responses (within the unit) take place ‘how they are needed’ and when they are needed’ which results in a functioning unit. There is a continuous transmutation process taking place whereby one form of energy is constantly changing into the other (magnetism to electro or vice versa), however, the beginning point of energy starts as ‘neutral’ magnetism and after being utilized returns to its original state (which was neutral). Note: when we speak of \"electro\" energy within this unit, it is an energy created without forcing any physical process that results in pollution; as you will see a magnet moves freely through a coils field producing an energy form similar to electricity. Because of this working relationship between magnetism and electro, this unit is without the need of a primary mover. It utilizes the energy of permanent magnets by freely converting the existing magnetism into a magnetic-electro energy. It then utilizes the energy, allows it to return to a magnetic state, as stated, and in this the recycling is achieved. This unit is operating proof that magnetism is a constant, always present and always changing."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"58 The unit has a centralized magnetically pressurized coil that serves as a magnetic reservoir whereby magnetic flowing current is removed as needed and circuited to various devices to do work, i.e., power magnetic lighting fixtures, drive magnetic motors, and more. Also, this unit capitalizes on the Universal flow of magnetic molecular structures, enabling it to function during space travel. The basic shape of this aluminum housing was determined by the needed crank diameter and the length of the crank arms which hold the steel piston (length being set by piston stroke). The upper tube diameter was selected to allow space around the copper/aluminum cylinder for the needed wire assembly. The unit works as follows. Using Part #61 can start the unit, which is a battery driven starter; however, if this method is not available, a hand crank unit is an alternative. A hand crank (or other method) is used to start the piston moving in and out of the cylinder. After the 54 plastic magnets (part #67) are fully charged (these parts could be called capacitors), they release a magnetic/electro charge into the number 22 motor wire, Part #76, which is wrapped around the 3/8\" wide flat insulated copper motor wire (part #73). This charge creates a pulse. This pulse will not properly activate the unit until the magnets on the piston arrive 1/4\" inward of the 'stationary magnets' beginning point (parts #67). This is crucial to the timing. When the piston is in the 'OUT' position to the cylinder, the wire at the entrance of the cylinder is energized and the opposite end of the wire is momentarily 'CAPPED OFF'. The flat copper wire through an induction process then absorbs the magnetic electrical charge. As this charge goes around, the piston follows it and moves into the cylinder. As the charge moves upwards through the flat wires, the magnets respond with an attraction that continues to follow it. The stationary plastic magnets are used as a point of control for USE of the power. This generates an attract field to the piston magnets that is a pull of concentrated magnetic energy. It is important to note that the moment the first pulse starts the piston will travel inward for a distance of 1/8\" before the next pulse happens and this pulsing continues for a total of approximately 56 pulses for the full travel of the piston's inward movement. When the piston is 7/8 of an inch from the completed inward stroke, a magnetically activated trip switch sends a charge from the part #64 (called a capacitor coil) into the opposite end of the number 22 wire located at the top of the cylinder. This action then reverses the polarity of the 54 plastic magnets releasing the piston magnets and allowing for a completed cycle. The number 22 wire is (at the bottom location) momentarily capped off during the reversal of flow. When this polarity is reversed as described only one pulse needs to be sent into the number 22 wire and the magnetic response from that point on causes a chain reaction that continues to release the piston magnets on their way out of the cylinder. FURTHER EXPLANATION AS TO WHY THE PISTON MAGNETS MOVE IN AND OUT OF THE CYLINDER. When the coil wires (#64) are wound from top to bottom, or INLINE with the piston magnets travel path, the piston magnets are not yet cutting lines of force. As the piston magnets start into the cylinder, their lines of force attract to the 54 plastic (stationary) magnets pulling the piston inward, this inward movement however is NOT breaking lines of force and therefore electricity is NOT YET being generated that will charge the plastic magnets (called capacitors). These lines of force ARE being broken, THAT IS FOR SURE, but by a completely separate magnetic flux line that has a breaking action. When the piston magnets are first attracted in and out of the cylinder, using the hand crank, the magnets are driven along side of the copper rods part #30 which is a squirrel cage with nine copper bars. This action builds up a magnetic field in these bars as well as the copper plate holding"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"59 the 9 copper bars. This action responds to the moving (rotating) magnet assembly, part #34 that starts a rotation. This rotation IS ALSO caused to happen by the mounting angle of this magnet. The incoming piston magnets attract TO this magnet and take part in causing it to rotate. The hand driven movement of the piston's path starts a charging of the 54 plastic magnets because the piston magnets DO break a portion of the lines of force as they EXIT the cylinder, and this happens until a pulse takes place through the number 22 wire. This pulse is then manifest through the generating coil and to the rotating magnet assembly allowing the magnet to pass the first copper rod. This copper rod then repels the rotating magnet assembly so it passes using the well-known motor action of copper revulsion, not unlike a standard bar wound rotor. The moment this rotating magnet begins these rotations, the rotations break lines of force that are crossing through the generating coil to the stationary magnets. This action starts a necessary flow of generated electricity, which is used to charge up the 54 plastic magnets. These magnets respond as CAPACITORS. This coil produces electricity at its maximum potential because it is pressurized between two magnetic forces, one inside the coil and one outside. When the plastic magnet capacitors are fully charged, the pulsing of number 22 wire causes a continuous action to the piston. There is an important reason why these powerful attract lines of force are broken by the rotating magnet. Proof that there is no backpressure (counter electro-motive force) is that the magnet continues to rotate without a secondary drive system. A close examination of the actual magnetic circuitry will show that the approaching faces of the magnet determine these lines of attract-force. They are then momentarily diverted as they pass through the generating coil and at this exact division point the rotating magnet passes through the field. To conclude, this unit does not have the trappings of so called perpetual motion in that we are not working with unknown forces. In this unit the forces producing FREE ENERGY are KNOWN as magnetic/electro responses. PARTS LIST 1). Crank housing aluminum bottom plate 18—5/8\" square by 1-1/2\" thick. 2). Crank housing aluminum top plate 14\" square by 1—1/2\" thick. This plate is machined to allow the crank arms movement and has slots as shown in Figure 1. 3). Crank housing vertical bearing support, 12—1/2\" square,3—3/4\" thick. During the start—up, this piston unit will go through a shimmy cycle before reaching the full speed of 5600 r.p.m. and a heavy duty aluminum support frame is needed to prevent any damage which could result if a weak frame were used. 4). Crank housing vertical support 1—1/2\" thick, 12—1/2\" square. 5). Piston unit upper 8\" diameter tube, 1\" wall thickness 21—1/8\" long. This tube is machined to be a tight fit into top plate part #2. After this tube is pressed into part #2 a series of 8 bolts are used to firmly secure these two parts. A slot at the top of this tube allows a coaxial cable assembly to be slid into the tube after being connected to various wiring areas. 6). Piston unit top cover 8\" diameter, 1\" thick. This top cover has a starter motor firmly bolted to it. The slot machined on this cover’s underside is a tight fit to a copper/aluminum cylinder. A series of 8 bolts are used to secure these parts, the bolts are 10—32 brass. No insulation is used between the copper/aluminum cylinder and the top cover. The assembly procedure is to lower this top cover and the pre—wired cylinder into part #5 allowing its cable to slide into the tube from the top thus the reason for a machined slot. 7). Brass output shaft, 11—1/2\" long. A brass output shaft is used because this shaft ‘passes through’ the distributor housing and certain magnetic activity inside this housing would be disrupted if this shaft were made of improper material. The 1—1/4\" thickness is to withstand the start—up shimmy and to carry the full seven horsepower load."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"60 8). Outside crank bearing, 1—1/4\" bore, 2—1/2\" O.D., 7/8\" thick. 9). Inside crank bearing 1—1/4\" bore, 2—1/2\" O.D., 1—5/8\" thick. 10). A copper disk 1/2\" thick, 3—3/4\" O.D. and a 1—5/32\" I.D. This plate is bolted in place and serves as a magnetic flow control preventing energy from escaping into the bearing housing. 11). Circular bearing housing, 6—1/2\" O.D., 4—1/4\" long. 12). Circular steel plate, 1—1/4\" bore, 2—1/4\" thick, 11—1/2\" O.D. This circular steel plate is made ‘lighter’ on one side by drilling the holes as shown, this ‘weight removal’ is adjusted to counter balance the piston unit assembly. The correct weight for counter—balance will be found by first bolting on the counter—weight part #13 and this bolted on weight and steel plate counter balance the piston assembly. This assembly includes the crank arm and bearing, etc. After a balance is established the steel piston housing part #20, with its magnets mounted, is removed from the crank arm upper housing part #18. This ‘assembled’ steel piston is next checked for weight and whatever this piston weight is, exactly 25% of its total weight is removed from the counterweight part #13. This initially will create an ‘out—of—balance’ condition. This will cause ‘start—up shimmy’; however as the magnetic attract activity accelerates the unit to 5600 r.p.m., this 'wrong’ counter— balance becomes the ‘correct’ balance. If 25% of this piston weight were not removed from the counterweight, the unit would ‘lock—up’ therefore the exact counter—balance, as disclosed, is critically important to the piston’s performance. A magnetic holdback force to the piston creates the need for this 25%less weight. 13). Counter—weight shaped 5\" I.D. 180° around with 11—1/2\" O.D. 14). Fastener secured to output shaft. 15). Two ball bearings — 1—1/4\" I.D., 3—1/4\" O.D., 3/4\" thick. 16). Fly wheel crank shaft 1—1/4\" diameter, 5—1/8\" long. 17). Crank arm aluminum bar 13—1/8\" long, 2—1/2\" wide, 1—1/4\" thick. This aluminum crank arm is designed in the manner disclosed because of the need to gain an even pull to the piston as these arms are on both sides of the center support shaft. 18). Crank arm upper housing 5—1/2\" long, 3—1/4\" high. This crank arm housing is made to allow the cam follower bearings to be inserted from the outer edge inward, which then allows them to be made in one piece as shown. Nine bolts hold this housing to the steel piston due to spacing of the nine permanent magnets. 19). Two crank arm bearings, 1—1/4\" wide, 1—5/8\" O.D., 1/2\" shaft. 20). Steel piston housing 7\" long, 2—13/16\" O.D., 1—5/8\" I.D. The actual shape of this steel piston accomplishes several different functions. The length of 7 inches is set by the need for a 7 inch long magnet to be attracted into the cylinder. The inside bore of 1—5/8\" needs to travel over the generating coil, thus this steel piston is supported by a bottom bearing only. The 9 magnets need to be mounted at the exact angle as shown, thus the need to have these nine ‘magnet shelves’ machined as disclosed. All the nine magnets face the same polarity ‘outward’ which creates very powerful opposite poles between the magnets. These opposite poles are utilized by copper bars that are held 1/16\" away from the steel piston housing at the area machined between the magnet locations (see Figure four). The magnets are machined on the outer surface as shown to attain a smooth release, ‘by—pass’, for the single rotating magnet. 21). Nine permanent magnets — 7\" long by 1/2\" wide by 1/4\" thick. These nine permanent magnets, 7\" long are among the most powerful magnets now available for purchase. These magnets are secured directly onto the steel housing, (with no insulation between). During assembly, as the ‘ninth’ magnet is brought to its steel shelf, the repel from the other eight magnets attempt to ‘rotate’ this magnet and thus not allow it to attract to its steel piston shelf. The magnets therefore are bonded, one by one, to the steel piston by the use of a very thin coating of a non—metal bonding"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"61 agent and also by being captured between the two end holding supports. The need to have all the same polarity facing ‘outward’ necessitates this mounting method. Viewing Figure 4 shows the outer surface of the nine magnets machined in a special way. When the piston is operating, the nickel tube rotates clock—wise (viewing the unit from the top). This rotation is assisted by the curvature of these magnets in that the rotating magnet approaches each of the nine piston magnets from the thick magnet edge that has had very little magnet ‘ground off’ to form the outer radius. As the rotating magnet leaves each piston magnet, it breaks free on the edge that is ground off thus having the holdback polarity somewhat weakened. We see therefore that the direction of rotation for the nickel tube is established partly by the magnet mounting angle which then caused one edge of all nine magnets to be ‘changed’ in favor of the needed magnetic passing response. 22). Aluminum end ring 1/8\" thick, 1—5/8\" I.D., 2—13/16\" O.D. This aluminum end ring serves two purposes. First, it contains the nine piston magnets from pulling free of the steel piston during the high speed stroke action. Second, aluminum is a reflector of magnetic energy and this ring helps to contain the magnetic power of the magnets to the steel piston housing. Brass screws are to be used to secure this ring plus a thin coating of a good non—metal bonding agent. 23). Piston unit center shaft, 1\" brass shaft, 22—1/2\" long. This center shaft is made of brass to prevent an expansion of the magnetic field. (For example, stainless steel which a magnet does not adhere to would still be unusable in that certain magnetic responses would expand the field.) Brass has the unique quality of completing a magnetic circuit without manifesting as a magnet. All along the path of the steel piston this brass shaft is being magnetically influenced, however this captured magnetic ‘flow’ travels to a usable point which is primarily the core area of a small coil where it completes the needed magnetic flow circuit. The spline section of this shaft is needed to prevent any torque movement or sidewise movement to the piston magnets. This prevents damage to the crank arms and bearings. When the piston starts into the cylinder, after the unit is operating at full speed, the nickel tube is rotating at a speed of 1400 r.p.m. and the piston magnets attract to the single rotating magnet thus causing a momentary stopping of this tube. This stopping of the nickel tube causes a slight torquing of the piston in the direction of the nickel tube’s rotation. Thus a potential problem is alleviated because of the spline bearing’s holding action which does not allow sidewise movement. 24). One splined non—metal bearing, 1\" bore, 3—1/2\" long, 1—13/16\" O.D. 25). Splined section of center shaft 11—7/8\" long. 26). Copper wire coil, 5—1/4\" long, 1—1/2\" O.D., 3/16\" thick, number 27 wire, 850 turns. 26A) One wire 26B) Second wire This coil is wound with standard plastic coat motor insulated wire in even layers having thin paper between layers, however it is important to not wind the coil wraps too tightly. The coil is firmly held by non—metal spacers that contact the center shaft. The piston’s center bore must pass over this coil with only 1/16\" clearance thus a firm holding is needed to prevent coil damage. This coil’s wires need to be circuited up through the center shaft by use of coaxial cable wire, because this coil generates an energy which could dissipate along the wire’s transfer path if standard insulated copper wire were used instead of wire having an outer jacket of metal. As the piston unit goes inward this coil generates an energy polarity’ which is usable as is, thus this magnetic electro energy is circuited directly to the large generating coil. However, when the piston magnets pass along this same coil on the ‘out—stroke’ this creates a different energy flow. This flow is not to be circuited to the same coil but this reverse flow energy is then circuited to a plastic magnet where it is ‘pulse fed’ to plastic magnet material thus causing the energy to build up and jump across a 1/2\" space gap to the piston"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"62 magnets. This action then results in an instant ‘recharging’ of the piston magnets before they again enter the generating coil assembly. This coil creates a centralized pressure that expands and enhances the power of the permanent magnets. During the out—stroke, when the nickel tube is rotating clockwise the energy direction flowing around the coil must be rotating in the opposite direction of the nickel tube, which then helps to create the needed ‘centrifuge’ condition inside the nickel tube. To accomplish this opposite flow it is important to wind the coil in the direction as disclosed on the drawing. 27). Three nylon spacer rings, 1—1/4\" O.D., 1\" I.D., 1/4\" thick. 28). A 3/8\" hole bored into brass shaft, 3—1/4\" deep. 29). Two coaxial cable wires fitted into shaft which goes to coil. 30). Copper squirrel cage, 8—3/8\" long, top to bottom. Nine copper bars are held from two mounting points at the top and bottom of each bar. As the steel piston and magnets go up and down they pass these copper bars and cause a magnetic field to build up in the bars. This captured ‘field’ must not be allowed to dissipate, therefore the end plate mounting is of particular importance. Brass is used for the top plate because it does not draw energy away from these bars, thus this top brass plate can be bolted directly onto the center brass shaft, no insulation necessary. The placement of this part is such that as the steel piston arrives at its full inward stroke, the aluminum end ring #22 comes within 3/32\" (safety distance) from the bottom surface of this brass top support. The nine copper bars are shaped as shown to clear the piston and magnets by 1/16\". (See Figure 4.) This view shows how these bars are caused to cut the magnetic ‘flow’ that takes place between the nine piston magnets, thus getting them charged with magnetism. This ‘charge’ not only supplies the needed polarity to cause the single magnet and the cast—iron counterweight to rotate the nickel tube, but also to charge as needed the nickel tube itself. The outer curvature of these nine copper bars are held within 1/16\" from the inner surface of the nickel tube and this captured magnetic energy ‘influences’ the nickel tube with a needed magnetic polarity. As this unit’s operation is further defined it will show how the ‘natural’ attract of the nickel tube serves as a catalyst for the ‘total— attract—structure’ which becomes the driving horsepower for this piston. The bottom support plate for these bars is a welded copper ring because, at this point a common energy flow plate is needed between and to all 9 bars. This copper bottom support could discharge energy therefore to prevent a loss of magnetic energy from this support ring, a .010 thick mica insulation plate is put between this copper ring and the frame (the frame being the bottom surface of the cylinder). Non—metal screws are to be used for this mounting. One suggested method for making this squirrel cage is to use the steel piston housing as a holding fixture (before the magnets are inserted). The curved 7 inch long slots are first fitted with a 1/16\" thick shim stock material. Next the nine copper bars are firmly held (with clamps) into these slots. The brass top ring is machined with 9 curved holes to allow this ring to go around the nine bars and then this ring is welded only at the top end. While still in the steel piston fixture, the lower copper ring is also welded. Finally the fixture is used to rotate these bars in a lathe to cut the outside diameter of 2— 13/16\". The finished squirrel cage will now have all surfaces of the nine bars a distance of 1/16\" away from the steel piston. The reason for welding the copper bars quickly to only the top surface of the brass plate is to prevent a ‘heat warpage’ along the length of the copper bars. 31). Nickel tube, 2—15/16\" I.D., 1/8\" wall thickness, 6—3/8\" long. The nickel for this tube should be an alloy consisting of not less than 92% nickel with the remaining 8% composed of ‘magnetic material’. Nickel is used for this very important pact because it exhibits extremely high magnetic permeability, but more important for this use is its ability to ‘acquire ' high magnetization. This"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"63 important feature is necessary because the tube becomes the central point of attract for the coil and plastic magnet assembly. The 1/8\" thickness of this tube is very important. As an expanded understanding of all the parts becomes known, it will show how several items all contribute to allowing the nickel to exhibit its extremely high magnetic permeability, but more importantly, to exhibit the ability to allow this strong attract field to be released, with the thickness being critically important to the release process. The length of the nickel tube is important in that this length allows several magnetic actions to happen. First the nickel tube extends downward past the plastic magnets and this extension allows the magnetic hold to the piston magnets to remain unbroken when the piston is in the ‘full out’ stroke. This maintained ‘magnetic attract’ is compensated for by the pounds of counterweights as was disclosed. Second, the nickel tube does not extend upward into the 7/8\" reverse polarity zone, which then allows the needed magnetic conditions for the release of the piston magnets. The diameter is important in that this nickel tube passes only 3/32\" away from the generating coil. Inserted into this nickel tube are two items, the 6—3/4 inch long permanent magnet and the cast— iron counterweight of the same weight and length. The mounting procedure for these parts actually causes the nickel tube to be cut almost into two separate halves. This zoning of the magnetism causes a back and forth magnetic flow from one half to the next which assists in charging the generating coil. This nickel tube also has a ‘charge flow’ that causes the piston magnets to accelerate their inward attract by the action of an interior atmosphere called a centrifuge attract action. This nickel tube is magnetically influenced ‘differently from the magnets inserted into its 1/8\" wall as opposed to the cast—iron’s counterweight influence. The magnet is insulated from the nickel tube and magnetic energy that builds up in the nickel ‘crosses’ this thin insulation paper and then, using the magnet as a conduit, flows into the upper insulated copper ring, then into the generating coil. The cast—iron counterweight however is not insulated from the nickel tube and becomes attracted 'differently’ to the piston magnets as related to the nickel’s attract. This different attract manifests along the length of this counterweight and during the ‘out—stroke’ becomes a point of twisting attract that aids in rotating the nickel tube. The function of this counterweight is therefore more extended than just being a counterweight. It also serves as a spacer to divide the nickel tube into two separate zones of polarity. 32). Slot machined into outer surface of nickel tube. 33). Insulation paper .002\" thick placed into slot #32. 34). Six permanent magnets, 1/4\" sq., 1—1/8\" long, fitted into slot #32. 35). Second slot machined into outer surface of nickel tube. 36). A cast iron counterweight placed 180° (back to back) away from magnet #34. 37). Insulation paper for bottom of nickel tube. 38). Brass ring secured to tube #31 with 2—15/16\" I.D., 3—5/8\" O.D., 3/8\" wide. Brass is used for this ring instead of copper because the brass is to allow a magnetic flow through it, not to become a magnet. Also it serves as a contact point for the nylon ball bearings. 39). Slot machined into ring #38 to allow magnet #34 to make firm contact. 40). 1/4\" SQ Boron carbide brush that contacts bottom surface of ring #38. Boron carbide is used as ‘brush material’ to carry the magnetic/electro flow because this material has good stability. 41). A silicon insulation brush holding arm for pact #40. 42). A pull spring that forces brush #40 to contact ring #38. 43). Brass ring to hold 18 nylon balls, 1/8\" dia., ring is 3—3/4\" I.D., 4—3/4\" O.D., 3/8\" thick. Eighteen nylon balls are selected because there are nine plastic magnet stacks at the bottom of the cylinder to which the ring will be bolted. Between these plastic magnets is the only area where"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"64 screws can be placed, therefore nine screws are used, one between every other plastic ball and between each stack of plastic magnets. 44). 18 nylon set screws to push nylon balls toward inside area. 45). A Mica insulation ring .010\" thick, 3—3/4\" I.D., 4—3/4\" O.D. 46). Bottom copper support part of #30. 47). Nylon screws to hold lower support ring #46. 48). A strip of .002\" thick insulation paper secured to part #54. 49). Copper ring to go above insulation #48. Ring is secured to part #54; 3/8\" wide, 3—1/4\" O.D., 1/8\" wall thickness. This ring clears the inside of the generating coil by 1/32\". This ring is up against the nickel tube with .002\" thick insulation paper. 50). Contact clip to secure magnet #34 to copper ring #49. 51). Boron carbide top brush makes contact to ring #49. 52). Silicon brush arm to force brush downward. 53). One compression spring to hold arm #52 downward. 54). Brass framework bolted to nickel tube #31. This brass framework is pressed into the nickel tube with thin brass pins for safety to prevent vibration from shaking the two pieces apart. The magnet that makes contact to the copper ring #49 is fitted to this ring by having a small opening machined into this brass framework to allow the magnet to make good contact to the copper ring but not to the brass. Care must be taken to not allow the magnet to contact either the nickel tube or the brass framework. There are several reasons for this brass framework being made in this particular manner. The inside bore is 2—27/32 inches which gives minimal clearance to the piston magnets as they enter this framework. If necessary, as a safety measure, the top area of the piston can be cut back for a 7/8 inch space (an amount of 1/32 inch). This close fitting is necessary to allow the copper ring #49 to have a 1/8 inch top surface which is the contact point for brush #51. When this brass framework is rotating it is prevented from moving downward by having a spacer washer up against the top surface of the squirrel cage’s top brass plate. The slot opening construction serves various purposes. a) It affords openings to allow air to escape as the piston takes its inward path. b). It serves as a magnetic fan, so to speak, by dissipating the magnetic energy that builds up at this upper area, primarily during the release stroke. c). It also serves as a mounting surface for the start—up spur gear and the ratchet gear. 55). Sleeve bearing pressed into part #54, 1/8\" bore, 1—1/4\" long, 1/8\" wall thickness. This sleeve bearing is an oil impregnated bushing having an oil packing reserve, thus not needing continuous maintenance lubrication. This bearing is a loose fit of .005\" which allows this assembly to rotate with a vibratory action, side to side of .005\". The lower brass ring is also contained by the nylon ball bearings which then allows this same movement. The 5600 piston strokes per minute will cause a vibration to this nickel tube in that during every inward stroke of the piston, this tube is stopped momentarily. The rotating magnet and steel counterweight will cut the proper amount of lines of force as this tube is allowed to vibrate, in this manner, as it rotates at 1400 r.p.m. 56). Fiber spacer washer mounted to part #6 to allow part #54 up travel movement of 1/32\". 57). Fiber washer above part #30 to allow part #54 to be supported from moving downward. 58). Ratchet gear secured to part #54, 3—1/2\" O.D., 2\" i.d.,1/8\" thick. 59). a). Ratchet gear holding arm to stop part #54 from going backwards. b). Manual release mechanism. 60). Start—up drive spur gear fastened to part #54, 2\" o.d.1—3/8\" I.D., 1/4\" face. 61). Battery driven starter motor with spring return gear clutch. During start—up (after setting release arm 59 b), this starter motor rotates the nickel tube counter—clockwise (looking at the unit from the top down) at 1400 r.p.m. After only a few seconds the generating coil becomes"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"65 magnetically charged and the starter is then disconnected. Next, the piston starts its up and down motion by first being released, then again getting attracted in. When the nickel is rotated backwards in this manner, during start—up, it builds up magnetic momentum somewhat like tightening a spring. 62). .007\" thick copper tube, 6—11/16\" long, 3—9/16\" O.D. Care needs to be taken to bond this thin copper tube into the 3—9/16\" O.D. as needed. A special fixture needs to be supplied whereby this tube is held at the correct size during the bonding to prevent out—of—round forming. The tube is lapped for bonding, 3/32\". 63). Insulation paper, .005\" thick wrapped on inside and outside of tube #62. After the tube is at the correct size, the insulation paper is bonded inside and outside with a 3/32\" strip of insulation on each end. Thus when the winding begins, the end insulation can be somewhat supported by this ‘glued together’ insulation. Without the inside and outside insulation papers having this strip of .005\" paper to cap off the ends, the wires could compress these ends and ground out to the copper core. 64). Coil of plastic coat copper wire, 7\" long, 3—3/4\" O.D., 3/16\" thick, wound inside to outside with 3200 turns of #28 wire (wrapped around part #62 & 63). One of the ways to wind this coil is to pre—wind about 3500 turns of #28 wire onto a seven inch long nylon bar which is notched to contain the wire. Next the insulation paper, inside and outside the tube should be marked with lines going from top to bottom to serve as wire guides for correct wire placement. Finally, brown masking tape 3/4\" wide is cut to a 6—3/4\" length and a glue stick is used to secure this tape to the inside surface having the tape’s glue side out. The wire then is placed one row next to the other by having each loop held by the masking tape’s sticky surface. This process can continue until 4 layers of wraps are accumulated which will total slightly over 3200 turns of #28 wire. Using #28 wire, each layer of wire will total about 888 turns, thus four layers should accumulate to 3,352 turns. As the coil is wound there is a definite winding pattern that must be used because the energy flow through the coil creates a magnetic rotating pattern that assists in rotating the nickel tube. Viewing Figure 7 shows the insulated copper cylinder just as the winding pattern begins. Point \"A\" on the bottom of the cylinder is where the wire is temporarily taped to the exterior of the insulation which is fastened to the copper core. This winding then goes up along the outside of the cylinder and down inside progressing in a counter clockwise pattern as shown (looking at the coil top down), until four complete layers of #28 wire are wrapped around this tube. The top of the coil remains on top as this coil is slid into the cylinder. The ending wire at the final outside layer (after completing the four filled layers) goes to the brush at the top of the nickel tube. The flow then going from this brush takes a path up along the outside of the coil, and down inside, but also the flow travels around the coil rotating clockwise which then assists the rotating nickel tube. The wire at the bottom, or the ‘start’ end is circuited to the pulse ring inside the distributor, part #103 wire to ring #101. The magnetic energy at this inside wiring layer is under a power strain because of being pressured from both sides, therefore it has a strong attract polarity which wants to get to the outside of this coil. This condition then makes it possible to circuit this energy to the exterior of this coil by first allowing it to pulse to the plastic magnets and then back to its attract point, which is its home, the exterior of the coil. The flow through the coil aids in rotating the nickel tube as the nickel turns during the ‘out’ stroke. On the ‘in’ stroke the flow travels along the outside of the coil going up and around and on the inside going down. This down flow causes a strong attract, close to the coils inner wall, which then strongly grabs the nickel tube creating a centrifuge condition on the inside of the nickel. This centrifuge condition is further enhanced by the reverse flow of the small coil part #26. This ‘magnetic atmosphere’ inside the nickel tube causes a powerful attract inward for the piston magnets."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"66 65). Winding \"start\" wires from coil #64. 66). Winding \"finish\" wire from coil #64. 67). 54 plastic magnets, each measuring .092\" thick, 7\" long, 3/8\" wide, spaced into 9 slots, 6 magnets/slot. When these plastic magnets are placed in the slots they will fit snug into the 5/8 inch wide machined grooves. Each stack is arranged whereby all six plastic magnets (of each stack)attract into a stack with .002\" thick steel shims placed between. Care must be taken when placing each stack into the slot because all nine stacks must have the same attract ‘edge’ facing the piston magnets. When correctly mounted, each attract edge will face directly toward its attract location which is one of the permanent magnets of the piston spaced apart 40 degrees. The thickness and number of plastic magnets controls the magnetic flow which results in the 5600 r.p.m. 68). 45 steel shims, .002\" thick, 7\" long, 3/8\" wide, placed between magnets #67. 69). Aluminum cylinder 9—3/8\" long, 4—1/8\" I.D., 1/16\" wall with nine 5/8\" slots machined to hold parts #67 and #68. This aluminum cylinder should be machined so as to fit snug into the copper cylinder part #71 so as to have good metal to metal contact between each surface. It is important to machine the slots in these metals separately because of the machining system used to cut the slots in the copper cylinder. The aluminum should be fitted onto a steel fixture that has the slots ready to accommodate the 5/8 inch wide tool and this fixture then supports this thin aluminum shell as the slots are being cut into it. This aluminum tube protrudes past the copper 1/8 inch at the piston entrance. The aluminum tube completes a magnetic/electro circuit from the flat 3/8 inch copper wire which goes directly to one of the aluminum strips that is between the plastic magnets. This strip does join all the other eight strips by circuiting up to the non—cut area at the top of the plastic magnets, however the circuit needs to join all nine aluminum strips at the same exact time. Another circuit action must happen between the aluminum and plastic magnets in that the bottom edge of all nine plastic magnets stacks must be capped off with aluminum to properly contain the magnetic force field. Thus separate aluminum 1/8 inch thick plates not only serve to join the nine aluminum strips between each set of plastic magnets but these plates also cap off the magnets as stated. 70). Set of nine aluminum end plates, 1/8\" thick, 5/8\" wide, 3/8\" high, filled to bottom surface of parts 67 and 68. These are the nine aluminum end plates that complete the aluminum’s magnetic circuit. These plates make firm contact to the 1/8 inch aluminum extension that protrudes past the copper cylinder. The aluminum serves as a magnetic reflector which causes a magnetic flow to impregnate the generating coil, thus squeezing this coil from the outside surface inward. The magnetic centralized pressure squeezes the coil from the inside surface thus the coil maximizes its generating potential, not unlike the action of an orange juice squeezer. The flat wire end part 74 gets connected directly on one of the nine inner aluminum strips located between the plastic magnets. This magnetic flow not only needs to be circuited to all nine strips of aluminum but this circuit must accomplish another purpose. The bottom end of each plastic magnet stack has an energy which needs to be captured and circuited. To accomplish this circuit the aluminum tube protrudes 1/8 inch past the copper and plastic magnets. Next nine aluminum plates measuring 3/8\" x 5/8\" are snapped between all nine of the aluminum strips and then go up against the bottom of each plastic magnet stack. As the energy from the flat wire enters one of these inner aluminum strips the flow is attracted by a plastic magnet (at this bottom contact point) and quickly flows up along all nine aluminum strips. It is important that these nine plates’ parts #70 do not contact the copper cylinder, only the plastic magnets, (being held by the 1/8\" extensions of the nine aluminum strips). Using this arrangement the nine aluminum plates make the circuit go over the bottom of these magnets, which is the desired flow."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"67 71). Copper cylinder 9—1/4\" long, 4—1/4\" I.D., wall thickness of .300, 9 slots machined to hold parts 67 and 68. Part #69 fits inside snug fit. This copper cylinder is 9-1/4\" long because above the plastic magnets there needs to be a zone where needed magnetic activity must take place for the release reverse polarity. The best way to make this part is to machine the I.D. and O.D. to size and then machine the nine 5/8 inch wide slots. In that the slots are not cut through 5/8\" holes ace drilled at the 7 inch length to serve as chip removal ports. These holes are then plugged with copper plugs to give the needed backing to the plastic magnets. After the aluminum tube is inserted and pinned with copper pins, then the holes for wiring can be drilled through both metals at the same time. The pinning is to prevent the aluminum from moving inward during this hole cutting operation. The actual thickness of copper left after each slot is cut is about 3/32 of an inch. This then is a very thin copper wall between the backside of the plastic magnets and the bottom surface of the 3/8 inch flat wire which is wrapped around this cylinder. The magnetic action from the flat wire therefore need travel a very short distance to influence these plastic magnets. No insulation paper goes against this copper cylinder where the plastic magnets are located, thus good clean contact is maintained between the steel shims as well as the plastic magnets and the copper. The steel shims must be against this copper surface because they serve the important purpose of allowing certain magnetic molecular structures a place to go during the polarity change. Without these shims the plastic magnets would have their polarities destroyed after a given period of run—time. This copper/aluminum cylinder must be firmly secured into the top cover part #6 with an accuracy that would allow this tube to rotate concentric if the top cover were held in a lathe and rotated. This tube serves as a bearing support housing for the lower nickel tube bearing and also the machined surface of the plastic magnets serves to hold the generating coil in a perfect alignment for clearance. 72). One coating of .002\" thick insulation paper on outside of part #71. This thickness of insulation paper is a minimum amount because it insulates against an energy that could be identified as having a force the equivalent of only 32 volts. Thicker insulation would reduce the effective passage of the magnetic flow which would then be counter—productive. 73). Twelve turns of 3/8\" wide by .008\" thick insulated copper motor wire wrapped around outside of part #71. As these twelve turns of plastic—coat motor wire are wrapped around the copper cylinder the wrapping starts 3/8 of an inch from the cylinder opening. By spacing 1/4 inch between each wrap the final top wrap will be 3/4 of an inch from the top plate part #6. Nine of these wraps, starting from the bottom, get pulsed during the ‘in’ stroke, however twelve of these wraps get pulsed during the reverse cycle. During the ‘in’ stroke the flow from the generating coil goes into this flat wire by ‘total induction’ because no direct wire—to—wire contact is made to the flat wire during this ‘in’ cycle. (The top flat wire is open during the ‘in’ stroke.) At no time during this piston’s operation is the flat wire removed from the entrance location where it is firmly secured to the aluminum. During the ‘release cycle' the generating coil wire goes directly to this flat wire at the top of the cylinder and the flow is then finalized at the entrance location where it contacts the aluminum. By starting the release flow 3/4 of an inch from the top plate #6, the area above the plastic magnets gets ‘magnetically charged’. One might ask that if the piston magnets do not go into this area, what is the purpose for charging this upper area? The answer is that as the piston arrives 7/8\" from its full inward stroke, the release circuitry is activated. This release action causes a momentary attract field to set up above the plastic magnets thus the piston magnets switch their hold from the plastic magnets to a field ‘above’ the plastic magnets. This action results in the piston magnets not arriving at a top grab—lock position but in fact continues to move in, then outward. To prevent a re—attract to the plastic magnets, the release cycle is maintained for 50% of the"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"68 outward travel of the piston. At this point no chance of re—attracting could happen thus the circuitry instantly begins the needed magnetic charging process for the next inward attract pull. Looking at the cylinder from the top down, the wrapping of the flat wire starts at the bottom of the cylinder being wrapped counter—clockwise. This wrapping direction is backward of the rotation for the rotating nickel tube. When the piston enters the cylinder (about one fourth of its inward distance) the nickel tube is then stopped, therefore the pulsing circuit going around the flat wire counter—clockwise has no effect in that the nickel tube has stopped. When the piston leaves the cylinder the tube then starts to rotate clockwise and this corresponds to the reverse polarity flow which when pulsed from the top downward, goes around the cylinder in a matching rotation which is clockwise, complimenting the rotating magnet by adding needed magnetic rotational pulsing. 74). 'Start' end of wire #73 at cylinder entrance wound counter—clockwise. 75). ‘Finish’ end of wire #73 near top of cylinder. 76). One continuous coil length of #22 copper motor wire wrapped around #73 with 444 wraps. As this wire is wrapped around the flat wire it has four turns around between each loop. There are 93 loops going from the bottom side of the flat wire and into the copper/aluminum cylinder thus to total the wraps, 93 x 4 = 372. This wrapping continues around the flat wire as the flat wire makes two additional turns at the top without any loops, thus an additional 72 wraps are needed for a total of 444 wraps. The wrapping starts outside down as shown on Figure Two. To accomplish this kind of wire wrapping and loop forming, one good way is to pre—wire a length of the 3/8 flat wire. The proper length of flat wire is suspended from each end and the #22 wire is next wrapped around this wire using 4 wraps. Next this wrapping stops at pre—marked locations where the loops need to go into their prescribed elongated holes. A spacer is then used to form one larger loop (the size needed to go into the cylinder). This spacer remains contacting the flat wire to hold this loop away from the flat wire and the next four wraps are then accomplished by hand turning a small spool of #22 wire. This process continues until 93 loops are formed with four wraps between each loop, somewhat like a spaced ‘w’ pattern. When completed this assembly is carefully brought to the cylinder and the flat wire is placed next to the cylinder as the first loops are ‘closed down’ to where this double wire goes into the first elongated hole. All of these wires are fed into the 93 holes as the flat wire takes its circular path. Finally the flat wire is gently ‘forced against’ the outside surface of the copper tube before the inside loops are actually opened to be formed into 5/8\" circles. When complete this number 22 wire should not be grounded to the copper/aluminum tube and it should have unbroken plastic—coat motor varnish to the flat wire, thus not making metal to metal contact. To add a safety feature the flat wire should have rounded corners to prevent sharp bends to the number 22 wrapping wire. Now another factor must be considered. On the opposite side of this flat wire we need to locate 46 crimp points 1/2\" long. These crimp connectors can be added as the winding is accomplished as next described. The actual spotting of these crimp points is accomplished by first wrapping the 3/8\" flat wire around the cylinder and by using Figure 2 for crimp locating points the flat wire can be pre—marked with these 46 locations. When wrapping the flat wire for this purpose it is necessary to add the correct thickness of a spacer to the underside of the flat wire to simulate the distance away that the flat wire will be when the #22 wire is between the cylinder and flat wire. 77). ‘Start’ end of coil wrapping part #76 near cylinder entrance. 78). ‘Finish end of wrapping wire part #76 near top of cylinder. 79). 99 elongated holes .200\" long by .100\" wide, cut through parts #69 to 71. 80). 99 pieces of insulation tubing fit into part #79."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"69 81). 99 loops formed with parts #76, each loop is inside parts 69 to 71 measuring 5/8\" diameter circle (passing through tubing #80). When these 93 loops are formed into 5/8\" circles of wire (using a dowel rod) each loop will fit away from the plastic magnets by 1/16\". This is a desired spacing because the magnetic energy must jump this space gap and in so doing it manifests as a magnetic flash that can then do its needed work. These loops when installed, should be up against the .002\" insulation spaced away from the plastic magnet by 1/16\". To hold each loop in this manner, it is advisable to place a small drop of fast setting glue on each side of the circle to be assured that the loops do not get misaligned during cylinder assembly. Figure Two shows that the 93 loops are formed into two kinds of loops, 46 loops having ‘no turn’ and 47 loops having a ‘half—turn’. When a loop is half—turned the energy flow goes backwards thus creating an oscillating current flow that bombards the coil with an alternating flow. This results in a complimentary flow pattern that causes the repel side of the plastic magnets to attract thus adding more pull—in power to the piston by allowing the opposing side to pick up a positive. When forming this first row of loops every other loop is half—turned. 82). Eighteen holes drilled through parts 69 to 71, nine near bottom, nine near top, all measuring 1/16\" diameter. 83). Nine lengths of #23 plastic coated copper motor wire circuited from outside bottom of cylinder to inside and exiting out upper end of parts #69 to 71. To actually accomplish the wrapping of this #23 motor wire it is best to prepare as follows. First, place the cylinder on a holding frame and have only the bottom row of loops protruding ‘inward’ with the other eight rows held temporarily ‘out of the way’. Next starting at the first loops near the cylinder entrance, have this loop supported by a 5/8\" dowel rod which has a small slot at the top. The #23 wire is next wrapped around the #22 wire twice and because of the dowel support, this #23 wire can be pulled to form ‘close’ wraps around the #22 wire. Next, while in the standing position, this loop is held in place by spacers as the same dowel rod is fed into the second loop. The spacers which are snapped into this same dowel rod serve to secure the first loop as the two wraps are next pulled around the second loop. The spacers set the length of the #23 wire as it is circuited from loop to loop. This method then results in a smooth snug wiring pattern that can be pushed flat against the insulation paper when each row is completed. Care must be taken to not pull the #22 wire against the 93 pieces of insulation tubing with a force that could break this insulation. The wires going through the copper/aluminum cylinder must not be grounded to it. After all nine rows are wrapped with this #23 wire the top ends are pulled through the insulated holes and soldered directly onto the top brass ring. Next the bottom ends are pulled through the insulated holes and all nine of these wires are soldered to the lower brass ring. A #16 brass ring is used as a circuit completer because brass carries the magnetic/electro energy without an undue amount of manifesting as a magnet. (Using copper rings would cause unwanted rings of magnetic energy outside the copper cylinder). Before the actual brass ring is formed into a completed circle, pieces of insulation tubing are slid over this ring which are then slid over the nine soldered connections. 84). Size 16 brass wire ring 4—7/8\" I.D. at entrance of cylinder parts #69 to 71. Nine of part #83 at entrance are soldered to ring. 85). A size 16 brass wire ring 4—7/8\" I.D. located near top of parts #69 to 71. All 9 wires of part #83 located here are soldered to this ring. 86).

We are on the threshold of opening a new paradigm of science that will produce pollution-free technology. This power source is dependable and controllable, but we do not recommend it for transportation (unless this unit is modified) because it must remain level. There is a Universal perspective that could greatly assist people in bringing forth a new scientific paradigm. Empiricism is holding back the development of technology that could heal our ailing planet. Science has resisted the belief of multidimensional energy and omnipresent energy fields that can be easily harnessed. Ironically, science has also resisted the idea of a Creator Force that is omnipresent and unlimited in nature. It is time for people to stop ignoring evidence that contradicts current theories that are leading us into destruction. We must embrace theories and technology that hold promise for our future, that reach beyond the current limitations we have arbitrarily set for ourselves, and we must begin consciously working with the Creator Force that we are one with to create a world that will flourish in love. This unit does not work on conventional nuclear principles. It is a misconception that heat is required to perform fission or fusion. Certainly, high heat can produce nuclear reactions but this process is not natural, nor is it the process stars utilize. Magnetic fields of certain vibratory frequencies allow molecules to be blended without high heat to produce various results including heat, light, and usable energy. Harmful radioactivity is not necessary to perform nuclear reactions. It should go without saying that people should avoid working with chemicals and elements that harm humans, animals, and the environment. As with the other units we have presented, this unit did not evolve through trial and error, it was produced through a series of revelations. Other cold fusion experiments may not be at this level, but given the condition of our planet, we cannot afford to lose many years to development of a concept that could be critical to our survival. We welcome other researchers to finish their projects with this information. Natural magnetic energy from the earth's magnetic field can be used for our benefit and safely recycled, allowing us to harness an unlimited supply of energy. This unit is a vivid demonstration of the power of blending certain elements, in certain conditions with flowing magnetic current to produce mechanical power that is useful. This unit is basic model that can be modified to produce various results. All energy is magnetic molecular structures with some of these structures being magnetized and some not. To explain this unit, certain forms of ‘influencing energy’ can not be ignored,"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"74 therefore when referring to \"all energy\" it includes what is now called gravity, which is actually compressed magnetism, the catalyst for all energy. Gravity plays a critical role in most technology, including this unit. All magnetic molecular structures are in a constant state of change, forming and re—forming with the action always resulting in 100% efficiency. Magnetic structures draw from an unlimited source of energy that is multidimensional in nature. When magnetic structures are in need for restructuring they automatically attract the necessary structures that respond at a nearly infinite velocity. For every molecular structure that is known, there are equal ones being made, offshoots if you will, so that ultimately there are no unknown structures. The offshoots of the molecular structures exist at a higher vibration, but the proper magnet field can lower the vibrations of the offshoots and allow those structures to be utilized for various purposes. This utilization of energy offshoots is precisely how this unit maintains a consistent supply of energy. For every unknown structure combination there is a known structure combination. There are unending varieties, not unlike the vast array of color combinations available within the color spectrum. Using this background of knowledge, let us now address the unit’s mode of operation. The main shaft is first driven at 5700 r.p.m.s, and a 3 volt power source is caused to feed energy into the system. (When applying the voltage do not misconstrue the amperage required.) This action starts a charging process which manifests as magnetic bubbles. It could be stated that the copper screen, part #15, after building a magnetic charge, has this energy move basically in an ‘upward direction’ (as minute bubbles). Simultaneously magnetic waves from the permanent magnets flow through the 96 palladium plates which creates a disturbance factor. The disturbance factor intermingles the molecular structures that are already (recycling of itself) present, fusing them together in a giant mass that ultimately creates the liquid surface tension, which then resolves itself by recycling. We see therefore the basic mechanical design of this unit is to incorporate a system of hardware to capture this energy during its recycling transfer movement and thereby produces continuously 12 horsepower of energy. The capture of this energy is achieved at the surface of the liquid through use of a certain ‘polarity charge’ that is manifest within and on the top row of 32 palladium plates. Palladium is used because it stimulates and motivates to movement after being contacted. The contact to these plates ‘must be at’ only the very bottom surface. The unbroken bubbles are drawn to the magnets through the palladium to itself. Thus we see the bubbles are captured just before they break. It is important to note that the bubbles being drawn through the palladium are compatible with the magnets. The liquid level needs to be exactly maintained. The key to correctly capturing this ‘bubble’ magnetic energy is to capture it ‘while in the bubble state'. The liquid level or height of the surface tension is one important feature for this correct 'flow capture’. A second action almost of equal importance is to offer this surface tension magnetic energy the proper field to go into, a field having a particular polarity. How does this unit produce this desired polarity? The method used is to drive, at start—up, a generator winding made of insulated copper coils ‘in front of’ permanent magnets. These coils are connected as closed loop windings that have each start wire connected to its compatible finish wire. As the north and south magnetic faces bombard these closed loop coils the magnets appear to cancel each other. However, what is created is a usable, neutral energy. This neutral magnetic energy flow is the 'offered polarity’ that is compatible to the ‘bubble energy’. As this ‘captured’ energy then joins the flow system of the permanent magnets, these magnets respond as very powerful force fields. This explanation allows our thinking to expand and entertain vast possibilities of the neutral magnetic molecular structures blending into LIKE ACCEPTANCE thus eliminating the idea that an attract field is required."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"75 The following explanation of the parts will be given ‘proper attention’ as we continue to address this subject of magnetism . One must observe and take note that the pulses which drive the motor are achieved by the magnets as they interact in two different directions in a simultaneous manner. This pulsing happens as a result of the fact that a magnetic flow (as opposed to electrical) is doubled in speed. To accommodate this magnetic flow activity, jumper wires are secured to the motor commutator that actually cause a double turn of commutation. These jumper wires allow a ‘flow balance’ to happen. For example, the connection pattern shows the motor has a 1,2,3 pattern of flow, however, each group of coils’ does not build up an exact charge from the passing of the magnet faces. The magnetic energy in the bubbles flows to the surface randomly thus some groups of coils charge—up more than others. The jumper wires (and the graphite ring) allow this energy to be distributed in a pattern as needed to the motor coils that are ‘ready for’ a new energy charge. To simplify the matter, the magnetic pulse sequence is being identified as if there were only one kind of magnetic energy involved. With a greater desire to learn how this motor functions, further investigation will reveal that there are differing kinds of magnetic charge. The copper bars (as stated in the theory of copper revulsion) establish an opposition to the polarity herein. The generating coils, as their pulse charge exits, set up a magnetic response that, in turn, contributes to rotation. As this charge ‘crosses over’ to the graphite ring #17, it causes the motor commutator to attract the 'graphite charge’, which adds to the speed control and horsepower. When the motor coils ‘pull toward’ the permanent magnets and are momentarily shut—off, this magnetic energy flow then instantaneously joins the generating flow, recycling a stabilized magnetic/electro energy. Therefore, the concept that is connected to the word ‘magnetism’ is inadequate to describe the total variety of like and compatible energies which have been left, to date, unidentified. One final item needing to be addressed, before the actual commutator circuit is explained, is that if only ‘electrical flow knowledge’ is applied to check out this circuit then a problem of understanding will result. For example, the two commutators (generator and motor) only pass very ‘close to’ the graphite ring #17 and their travel path then shows what in electrical terms would be called an ‘open circuit’ or ‘shut down’. It is important to know that when focusing on the ‘magnetic circuit’ inside this motor, cut—off time does not mean a shut down of the magnetic power driving this motor. The set—up poles maintain their strength to a needed degree without a continuous flow crossing over from the graphite ring to the motor commutator. HOUSING CONSTRUCTION It now becomes important to focus on the statements made about energy in order to avoid making serious mistakes during motor construction. The desire is to have a motor produce 12 horsepower for an indefinite amount of run time without any loss of power. The materials used for construction have a direct bearing on ‘how long’ the energy production will remain constant. The permanent magnets have a draw factor to the atmosphere and draw the needed magnetized magnetic molecular structures to remain constant in energy. Thus the magnets must remain in correct relationship to the atmosphere which then allows this draw factor to take place unobstructed. Other than the steel laminated armature frame #5, there are no metals used that could cause the magnets to expand their field. For example, if the outer housing were made of iron, as is common in electric motors, then a magnetic short circuit would happen and this negative event would quickly manifest as a problem of energy dissipation. EXPLANATION OF FIGURE ONE DRAWING This full size side view shows the relationship between the motor/generator windings and the permanent magnets as well as the palladium plates. The following parts list explains how to"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"76 construct this unit. However, we wish to draw a strong focus, at this time, on very important magnetic/electro activity that ‘helps to’ create the ‘disturbance factor’ which results in structures fusing together in a giant mass that ultimately creates the needed surface tension. Notice the point where the two center permanent magnets are 1/32 of an inch apart. A very powerful magnetic activity takes place because of this 1/32 inch spacing. The tank thickness of 1/16 inch is the distance that the 40 thousandths thick steel wire is away from the magnets. The steel wire is copper coated. This wire forms a ring 13—9/16 inches in diameter. All along this ring a total of 64 powerful permanent magnets are attracted to the inner steel core of this wire. The copper coating is not influenced by this same ‘attract condition’. Next, we focus on the action of the 3.5 volts Direct Current being fed into this wire and for the most part the copper coating is the flow path which circuits this voltage. We see therefore, for the magnetic attract to ‘get to’ the steel core, it must cross through the copper coating which is flowing the 3 volts D.C. This copper coating makes firm contact to the palladium plate on the side facing the permanent magnets. Copper, in this instance, serves somewhat like a magnetic insulator and must not be scratched, exposing the steel core. The palladium plate responds to this magnetic/electro action by allowing a magnetic/electro flow to pass through this plate enroute to attracting the plus wire which is firmly mounted to the opposite face. The ‘core’ of this ‘plus’ wire, being steel, attracts the magnetic flow through the palladium. Now as we focus on the plus wire, we find that it is actually completing a magnetic attract circuit of opposite polarity to the bottom palladium plates, which have permanent magnets penetrating these plates, thus causing an attract field to pass through them. This intense magnetic/electro interaction is happening while submerged in the hydrogen peroxide. As the motor coils get ‘charged up’ by the graphite ring this energy ‘crosses over to’ either north or south permanent magnets because it is neutral energy. Thus an alternating current flow, caused by rising and falling coil charges, constantly bombard the ‘structures’ which are inside the liquid, To grasp the full excitement of this wonderful circuitry demands very close attention to detail. PARTS LIST lA,B,C) Brass base, brass center shaft and non—magnetic ball bearings. Brass is ideal in that it does not expand the magnetic field. The 12 H.P. of energy is removed for use through this shaft which is located at the bottom of the unit. This shaft is also used for start—up ‘spin charging’ of the unit. 2) Outer wall made of aluminum because it allows the motor to build a certain magnetic circuit that ‘enhances’ the draw factor to the atmosphere for the permanent magnets. 3) Copper bars bonded to outer aluminum wall, 1/8 inch clearance from steel core. Their relationship to the magnets is aligned to the spacing between the magnets. These copper bars are located at the upper motor winding area. The ‘polarities’ of these magnets are arranged to pull to the magnetic/electro coils. These copper bars respond by manifesting as a ‘push’ or opposing field. 4) Brass support plate rotates the parts shown without expanding or ‘interfering with’ the magnetic flow of the unit. 5) Ring of laminated steel assembled by using standard motor laminations with each lamination measuring 25 thousandths thick. Before winding, this part should first be firmly bolted to part #4 and balanced at 5700 r.p.m. Next, this welded laminated core could be removed and coils inserted. (Row weld, as needed, on the back side only.) The space opening for inserting the coils should be minimal. 6) Motor winding inserted at top core winding location with coil wires having a thin tubing cover. Next, these wires are circuited through the generator slots, directly to the motor commutator (using holes in part #4 as needed). The insulation between groups of coils and the slot liner need be minimal because high voltage is not produced as this unit operates. The generator slots could be"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"77 used as a circuit passageway because the 144 turns of #26 copper motor wire in each slot will ‘easily fit’, thus allowing room for these motor coil wires to ‘pass through’. 7) The generator winding is wound with the identical coil turns and groups. However, as each group of two coils is inserted into the slots, the wires should be left long enough to be circuited ‘directly to’ the generator commutator. As these wires travel to the commutator they are to be gently twisted together (with the plastic coat varnish insulation not removed) and an insulation tube slid over both twisted wires. The generated magnetic/electro energy travels across from wire to wire as the energy advances, thus keeping these two wires in ‘close tight proximity’ allows for the best energy transfer. 8) Partial cover plate allows quick access to the center of the motor. This ‘open area’ inside the motor is used as a liquid storage area with the storage tank supported from the underside of the center cover. As time passes, this tank will need to be removed for refilling, thus a partial cover plate allows for quick, easy maintenance. NOTE: The liquid does not need to be changed or replaced, as for example, changing your oil. The liquid gets used but does not have its properties destroyed. Explanation of Part 8. By saying the liquid gets used but does not have its properties destroyed, we mean that the properties were used in a transmuted form — hydrogen peroxide and water into energy, which is their basic property anyway, (the peroxide being the catalyst for the hydrogen). Nothing exists outside of energy; it is the basis of all life and all matter. So although the level lowers it isn’t that it’s been dissipated, merely transformed into another use. You simply add to continue the transforming or transmuting, if you will. 9) Tank made of aluminum (if cost is a factor). Ideally, this tank could be made of injection molded material having no metal, thus eliminating the need to insulate the palladium plates. Do not change the liquid volume of the tank because this volume has been adjusted to produce the required magnetic surface tension, which is the exact amount needed to feed a 12 H.P. unit. 10) Tank liquid, a blend of two/thirds Hydrogen Peroxide (3% solution) to one—third distilled water. Liquid is readily available through any pharmaceutical supply company. Deuterium is not used as it is of paramount importance that the bubbles be captured ‘before they break’ and deuterium is TOO HEAVY. The Hydrogen peroxide produces very light bubbles, and because of the vacuum inside the unit these light bubbles maintain their strength and ‘transport’ the energy as needed to the place where capture takes place. Think of this liquid as a conduit which transports the magnetic energy. 11) Magnets are new powerful iron/boron/neodynium, mounted with a 1/8 inch clearance from the steel armature, part #5. There are two sizes. The top and bottom rows are 1—1/4 inches high by 3/4 inch wide by 1/4 inch thick, totaling 64 pieces. The two center row magnets are 1 inch high by 3/4 inch wide by 1/4 inch thick for a total of 64 magnets. The generator/motor has a total 128 magnets. Enclosed is a drawing showing the magnets’ polarity placement. A very intense magnetic activity happens as the center magnets are mounted 1/32 inch apart. For safety reasons, after the magnets are bonded to the outer surface of Tank #9, it would be wisdom to use armature bonding tape (non-metal tape) about 1 inch wide. Wrap this tape around the exposed face of these magnets for a thickness of 1/32 inch. 12) Two sizes of palladium plates. The top and bottom plates measure 1—1/4 inches high, 3/4 inch wide and 1/8 inch thick, totaling 64. The center row of 32 palladium plates measure 2 inches high, 3/4 inch wide and 1/8 inch thick. All 96 plates are held to the tank by their ‘side edges’ only, with mylar insulation between. The inner face of all these plates has a 1/16 inch space clearance from the tank wall. This space gives access for the liquid to fill in the middle and bottom rows. The top row has the liquid level only covering the very bottom of each plates which necessitates a level mounted motor. A measurement then, from the face of the permanent magnets to the face of the palladium"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"78 plates is 1/8 inch. This 1/8 inch is comprised of 1/16 inch tank thickness and 1/16 inch space for liquid. 13A,B) Represent the wire circuit explained previously. The wires must not exit the tank enroute to the D.C. 3 volt power source by being circuited through the liquid surface line. This circuit placement, understandably would be simpler, however, a certain energy disturbance would result causing a break in the surface tension. For this reason, the drawing shows the wires exiting the tank at the tank’s inner vertical surface. 14) Permanent magnets measuring 1—1/8 inches long, 7/8 inch wide and 1/4 inch thick, bonded directly into machined holes located in Part #4. They are positioned as alternating polarities to influence the copper screen located inside the bottom of tank #9. These magnets are also iron/boron/neodynium. 15) A 40 thousandths thick copper screen of close weave. This screen covers the bottom of tank #9 and measures 10—1/4 inches inside diameter and 13—1/4 inches outside diameter. As magnetic energy waves ‘bombard’ this copper screen from the 14 permanent magnets, this energy starts to migrate away from the screen, going ‘basically’ in an upward direction. 16) A 1/8 inch thick coating of mica insulation secured to the tank as shown. Energy that is captured within the tank would dissipate into the motor interior if this inner surface were not properly insulated. 17) Ring of dense graphite held by the tank but insulated from it. This ring is held ‘so as to’ allow the commutators to pass above and below it, as close as possible. This ring of graphite not only serves to ‘store and discharge’ the generator coils’ energy, but also serves as a ‘modulating’ filter sponge that slows down the energy going into it and then accumulates and discharges the energy with ‘controlled pulse charges’. Without the use of this ‘transfer material’ air ‘structures’ would attempt to join the magnetic pulse stream and cause an uneven flow of energy. Therefore, we could say it screens out air ‘structures’. 18) Top commutator for the motor winding needs to be made a ‘special way’. Enclosed is an isometric drawing that shows how mica is not to be between the bars, at the location above the graphite ring part #17, because as the graphite energy charge transfers over to the motor commutator, an attract pulling happens that utilizes this ‘space between bars’ as a pull zone. Ideally these bars should pass ‘as close as possible’ to the graphite without actual contact. Of primary importance is the need to align bar #1 to slot #1 as these parts are secured to brass rotor #4. Figure 2 highlights this placement with a red center line. The group of motor coils in slots #1 and #4, also in #2 and #5 are to be connected to motor commutator bars #50 and #52. This is a vital connection circuit and must be accomplished exactly as shown. 19) 51 jumper wires secured to motor commutator on a 1 to 4 span as shown. Also shown are the jumper wires formed by taking two #26 insulated copper wires and tightly twisting them together, making the needed loop for soldering to the commutator. As stated previously, magnetic energy ‘advances’ by jumping from side to side, somewhat like a tight spaced W pattern, thus jumper wires are formed to accommodate magnetic travel needs. 20) Brass support tube serves as a container to secure the motor commutator. For simplicity this tube could be welded to rotor #4. 21) Mica insulation to insulate commutator from rotor #4. 22) Generator commutator shown in Figure 2, ‘not being aligned’ to the motor commutator bars. The placement as shown is important because the energy is circuited to ‘go first’ in the direction of rotation, thus the generator winding group in slots 1 and 4, and slots 2 and 5, get their start and finish wires connected together, then get circuited ahead of the #1 motor commutator bar, (as shown)."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"79 Using this circuit pattern all the generating coils energy gets transferred to the graphite ring where a ‘graphite charge’ makes the connection flow to the motor commutator. The generator bars protrude 1/8 inch past the mica (that is between them) which allows for the needed ‘pulse transfer space. Again, the generator commutator should come as close as possible to the graphite ring without actual contact. 23) Mica insulation to commutator from rotor #4. 24) Holes pre—drilled into part #4 to allow insulation tubing and wires to be circuited to the commutators. For long run time, these holes (after circuit is complete) should be filled with insulating wax to prevent breakage from static vibration. Also the windings should be encapsulated as needed for this same reason. 25) This number represents the Center Cover Plate, all motor joints, including the shaft, which need to be sealed to hold a vacuum. 26) D.C. power source to supply needed 3.5 volts to the palladium plates. 27) Liquid add assembly includes reserve tank inside center portion of this motor (tank not shown) and sensing switches to register liquid level. This liquid level must be controlled within 1/8 inch to prevent loss of power. The bottom of the top row of palladium plates must not be totally out of liquid at any time, otherwise the flow circuit is broken. This concludes the parts list/explanation. It appears as if the major factor which will open the door to this ‘energy technology’ is simply recognizing the neutral magnetic field. Historical research indicates that at least one person with vision identified this energy form. In the year 1885 a physicist, C. A. Bjerkness, had the idea that energy could be explained as small spheres that pulsate at some unknown universal frequency. The positive result of his theory is that, if the pulsations are in phase, the particles attract according to the inverse square law, and if they are out of phase completely they repel according to this same law. The same pertains if they are halfway between being completely in, or out of phase, they are then neutral. History shows that Bjerkness’s great work was rejected because of the \"speed of light \" theory which has now become priori true, when in fact the very word, theory, suggests possible change. The scientific community stated that for his system to function properly the action would need to happen at an infinite velocity. In our limited knowledge we have determined that there is nothing faster than the speed of light, but that is merely because we have not allowed ourselves to discover it. It’s called a comfort zone which produces complacency and destroys true progress. Theories can be more than limiting; they can become a scientific prison forming a darkened state while being called enlightenment. Constructing the enclosed unit and correctly explaining the observed phenomenon, should result in a lifting of the ‘mental anguish’ that has resulted from the limited use of words. For example, when Albert Einstein held to the view that the relative relationship of one PARTICLE to another did not matter, he was in error. Each particle IS a molecular structure. Einstein’s error was not so much the calculations but the verbiage. Had he said molecular structures the door of the mind could not have been closed. Scientific minds being what they were could not take the word ‘particle’ any further. His view then suggested that the redistribution of PARTICLES WAS NOT POSSIBLE. The problem has always been with our understanding the manner in which the redistribution takes place. When a molecular structure breaks down there is a transfer of energy to the greatest part which is the attracting force. Because of Einstein’s statement that others have taken to be written in stone , any further discoveries are automatically limited. We believe that Einstein’s mind was too far reaching to inhibit further discoveries and if he were here today, he himself would be willing to discover and he himself would ‘discover’ by questioning his own theories. This is true genius."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"80 A Popular Science magazine dated October 1925, states, \"The Einstein theory of relativity soon may fall, and we may have to look for another explanation regarding the mysterious movements of the Universe. Professor Einstein himself has just admitted it.\" He spoke for himself and left an OPEN door to the world of science. The past is past, but not forgotten. The work of a multitude of visionaries who capitalized on this same principle should no longer be suppressed. The science community, by simply constructing this Fusion Unit, can usher in our golden age of civilization, thus allowing magnetic energy to take its rightful place to meet our energy needs. Additional items of importance: ITEM A. As the 14 permanent magnets rotate around at 5700 r.p.m., their magnetic fields will somewhat scatter, resulting in being less effective. The method needed to contain and properly utilize these magnetic fields is as follows. Each 1/4 inch high magnet is wrapped in a wire jacket (steel wire copper coated) of seven strands of .040 wire. Mylar insulation .010 thick is placed between the magnets and the wire jackets. Because of the actual location of these wire jackets they will capture and store a harnessed energy and thus serve the purpose of becoming Connective Distributors. A necessary connection pattern between the fourteen wire jackets allows the built—up charge, stored in them, to be discharged in such a manner as to allow the motor to rotate at 5700 r.p.m.’s. To explain, as the fourteen magnets pass under the 32 steel wire loops, part #13—A, the magnets attract to the wires and would attempt to slow down the main rotor. This attract ‘hold back’ does not happen because of the connective distributors (wire jackets). When the fourteen magnets actually pass under the wire loops only two magnets arrive at an attract hold back position at any given time. The stored harnessed energy from all 14 wire jackets rushes to the two wire jackets which have taken over the attract hold back and next discharges their energy into the two wire loops causing an instantaneous release. The fourteen wire jackets are interconnected whereby the area of the wire jacket located at the north half of the magnet is connected to the magnet next to it at its north half. Also the wire jacket located at the south half is connected to the magnet next to its south half thus forming a complete connection circle. (See Figure 1.) This connection pattern allows like poles to attract and create a ‘flow balanced’ energy storage system. Mylar insulation is used between the wire jackets and the magnets so the wires do not discharge their captured magnetic charge into the magnets. The outside surface of these metal jackets should have .010 mica between them and plate #4. The wire jackets with magnets inside are secured properly to withstand the rotating action. The bottom surfaces of the magnets need 1/8 inch thick mica under them to further contain the magnetic fields. See Figure 2. Of primary importance is to have the wire jacket’s top loop wire be flush with the top of the magnet to allow the ‘attract transfer' to correctly switch as stated. ITEM B With this release system it is now possible to gain a further magnetic response between the 14 magnets and the 32 loops #13A by mounting the magnets 3/16 inch closer to the outer diameter of plate #4. Again see Figure 2. The 14 magnets will then form an outside diameter of 13—1/4 inches and cause one edge of each magnet to pass directly under all 32 loop wires. The action of transferring a harnessed energy from these metal jackets to the 32 wire loops is important, not just to prevent an attract hold—back, but to capitalize on this new captured energy. This activity causes a magnetic flow which contributes to the surface tension. This new tension then sets off another release of magnetic energy which allows another tension to form. The surface tension is maintained"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"81 but is not stagnant. These various magnetic actions, as described, all have a part in releasing an energy which is best identified as a COMPOSITION OF MOLECULES. ITEM C Further clarity on the motor coils connection sequence. While each of the 104 coils are connected in groups of two, this grouping terminology is in reference to a set of two coils being connected to the same commutator bars. However, all 104 coils respond as separate attract structures. To correctly assemble this motor winding, 104 coils must be wound, each with two wires that get circuited to the motor commutator. The start wire of coil #1 (the coil in the top of slot #1 and in the bottom of slot #4) goes to motor commutator bar #50 (as stated previously). The needed reverse polarity happens as the finish wire of the coil located in slots #2 and #5 is connected to this same bar — #50. The finish wire of coil #1 then goes to bar 52 along with the start wire of the coil located in slots #2 and #5. See Figure 3. Yes, Coil One’s start wire and Coil Two’s finish wire are together, at the commutator. However, they also need to be twisted together with the plastic coat varnish not removed, from the coil area all the way to the commutator. Next, a single insulation tubing is placed over both wires. This is the needed ‘vehicle’ for properly transferring magnetic energy. Magnetic pulses control and establish the 5700 r.p.m.’s, therefore the pulse figures are as follows. There are 104 coils, with each coil having two wires, thus 208 wires get connected to 52 motor commutator bars (4 wires to each bar). Every time a graphite electrode pulses to one bar it sends its magnetic energy charge into four separate locations. Therefore we take 104 x 52 which = 5408. Next the total number of permanent magnets used for the motor winding, which is 64, then gets multiplied by four separate pulse locations which = 256. We then add 5408 + 256 = 5664 r.p.m.’s. The 36 r.p.m. differential is the ‘Rev’ time. ITEM D There is a very important time spacing between the pulses from the graphite as they pulse to the motor commutator. This pulse time is controlled by the thickness of the 52 graphite electrodes which should be .170 of an inch thick for their full 9/16 inch length. They should pulse to motor commutator bars that are .100 of an inch thick along their full contact surface (no taper). As these electrode thicknesses are used, the result is slightly less than 2° of travel off time, which is the needed quick pulsing action. Again see Figure 3. ITEM E As we review graphite ring #17 it shows exposed surfaces at the top and front locations. This graphite will store and hold its charge best if these exposed surfaces are covered with a 1/8 inch thick mica covering, (bond with a non—magnetic glue). The work of the generating magnets and the generating winding is to maintain the graphite charge, therefore correct ‘charge containment’ will allow the generating magnets to do their work — to balance to the proper flow. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON COLD FUSION UNIT Item A). Another kind of necessary magnetic field is set—up to power the unit as the graphite part #17 is also positioned above the motor commutator part #18. Item B). The previous drawing disclosed how 32 copper coated steel wires bonded just above the copper screen. To complete the needed circuit each of these wires should be continued downward and be curved under and up through the copper screen as shown without scratching the copper coating. There must be copper to copper contact. This upward travel is 1½ inches —maintaining a 3/16 inch distance away from the bottom palladium plate, then connected as shown, using a copper clip (not solder)."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"82 Item C). The 13—5/8 inch diameter ring wire now behind the middle palladium plates must have a mating ring wire behind the lower palladium plates. A jumper wire made of the same material should connect these two rings. Item D). If tank #9 is made of aluminum then mylar insulation (.005) should be placed under the copper screen. Item E). Wire 13—A contacts the faces of the palladium plates, however as these wires get joined to the incoming ‘plus’ wire, all 32 wires are to be curved around to join as one. A single common ring wire is not to be used. (Again use a copper clip, not solder.) Item F). To charge the unit, drive it at 5700 r.p.m.'s for 12 to 15 minutes. Item G). The peroxide is the catalyst for the hydrogen. Item H). After a motor run time of 36 days, under full load, operating 24 hours per day, the liquid level will drop 1/8 inch thus causing a shut—down (unless more liquid is added to tank #9)."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"TiAlCo-B Metal : We are prov iding this information out of lov e to help h eal our planet.

Blending the Space Ship Metal ***A vacuum chamber is not recommended to make this metal, as it will prevent the necessary molecular interactions. This process requires four crucibles, with separate temperature controls, that will allow the metals to be poured from one crucible to another. "},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" First, in crucible #1 melt 3.85 pounds (10.8%) Magnesium at 648.8 ° ° ° ° C. Next, cool to 419.58 ° ° ° ° C. at which point 4.28 pounds (12.0%) of Zinc is added as chunks into the Magnesium. (NOTE: all blending of elements requires mixing.) The temperature should not fall below 419.58 ° ° ° ° C. The Zinc, considered the dispensable element is not dispensable in the sense of doing without, it contributes to the transformation process. The Magnesium ignites when it is heated because it is attempting to redistribute it’s energy in the easiest manner. When Magnesium is offered magnetic energy and a alternative redistribution path, it will utilize the energy and basically heat itself to the required temperature. The mini romag is ideal for providing this function to the Magnesium. Next, in crucible #2 heat 10.59 pounds of Aluminum (29.7%) melted at 660.37 ° ° ° ° C. This Aluminum is then (over a period of several minutes) poured into the Magnesium/Zinc mixture using continuous mixing. The Magnesium, Zinc, and Aluminum blend is then heated up to 1,000 ° ° ° ° C to prepare it for the next step. In crucible #3 melt 3.17 pounds of Manganese (8.9%). This Manganese is then cooled to the temperature of molten Copper. Then add 5.24 pounds (14.7%) of Copper powder. This adding of the Copper should be slow with the needed heating, so as not to drop the temperature. The temperature of these two elements is then adjusted to have 4.85 pounds (13.6%) of Red Brass Cast added. This Red Brass Cast must be made of Copper - 84.15%, Tin - 4.40%, Lead - 5.42%, Zinc - 5.13%, Iron - 0.17%, Antimony - 0.12%, Nickel - 0.58%, Phosphorus - 0.007%, Sulfur - 0.019%. After this blending is completed, the Manganese/Copper/Red Brass Cast is slowly added to the Magnesium, Zinc, and Aluminum blend (which should be at 1000 ° ° ° ° C) The heat on this blend will next be raised up to 2,000 ° ° ° ° C. in readiness for the next process requirement. Next, 2.25 pounds (6.3%) of Chromium is melted. Next, added to the Chromium is 1.43 pounds (4.0%) of Titanium Dioxide. VERY IMPORTANT: Before the Titanium Dioxide is added to the Chromium, the blended elements (all of which are in one crucible) must be up-heated to 2000 ° ° ° ° C. The MOMENT they reach the 2,000-2,100 ° ° ° ° C., IT IS THEN that the Titanium Dioxide is added to the Chromium. The time lapse should be as short as possible between when the Titanium Dioxide is mixed with the Chromium and these two blended items are added to the other elements. Thus, after a minute of mixing these two elements, they are quickly poured into the crucible containing all the other elements. The mix MUST NOT go below 2,000 ° ° ° ° C. The metals, when blended, should be at no less than 2,000 ° ° ° ° C. and no more than 2,100 ° ° ° ° C. Finally, all the metals are stirred for one minute and the mixture is quickly poured into a mold. SILICON NITRIDE MOLD A preheated mold of this material should be at 700 ° ° ° ° C. and the mold should be filled AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"85 CELESTIAL PARTICLE TRANSMUTER • Unit produces vast amounts of neutral flowing magnetic current for numerous uses • Requires special alloy • Capable of powering 4-10 HP Magnet Motors • Provides magnetic energy that can be transmitted through space • Requires mechanical startup The subject matter is a Celestial Particle Transmuter. This is a unit that works on the magnetic principle of attract—attract. The following explanation will summarize the working unit. Please review the drawings to clarify the text. This unit uses a method for generating power from a source not commonly tapped. This unit works within a relationship between particles that exist on the outer rim of the earth’s surface (ionosphere) and particles in and on the earth itself. The function of this Transmuter is to create a structure of varying particles to produce a source of energy. The magnetic structure within the unit attracts the necessary particles needed to generate the electrical impulses to produce an ongoing, continuous flow of energy. This unit is so fundamentally important in the field of magnetic energy that it can be likened to the invention of the wheel, it can lead to countless discoveries in the future. The drawing shows a brass chimney two and one-half feet high consisting of an outer chimney, nine inches diameter with a six inch diameter pipe firmly center—mounted inside the nine inch pipe. These chimney openings lead into the main unit. There is a transference of particles which is the main purpose of the chimney structure. The chimney as viewed is attached to the generator itself which also has two housings. The inner housing is twelve and five—eighths inches in diameter. It is completed with a dome lid which covers the inside and a plexiglass covering which seals the outer housing. On the following pages will be found all the necessary information for the assembly of this Transmuter. Part #1 is the inner housing that contains the mechanism of the generator. It is constructed of aluminum and is 12—5/8 inches outside diameter by 6—3/4 inches high with a 1/4-inch wall thickness. A slot is cut along the bottom measuring 1—3/4 inches high by 15 inches long which is used to accommodate the chimney structure. Holes are drilled into this wall to hold other parts located within. Of paramount importance is the fact that this part #1 has its inner wall surface completely knurled from top to bottom. Particles that strike this inner knurled surface are caused to be defused by the angles of this knurled surface thus contributing to the needed bombastic particle action within the unit. As the magnetism takes a counterclockwise rotation the knurled housing holds and utilizes the needed molecules that would otherwise (if there were no knurling) simply penetrate the wall. Part #2 is an outer Aluminum housing 15-3/8 inches diameter, 8 inches high and .030 thickness. Both housings are secured at the base. There is a plexiglass ring 1/2 inches thick which goes between the outside of inner wall #1 and the inside surface of wall 2 which then serves as a"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"86 sealing material to protect the unit against the elements. Part #2 has the same size slot at its lower portion to accommodate the chimney structure. The purpose of this outer housing is to balance out the structure of the attached chimney which equalizes the particle flow. This .030 aluminum outer wall is not adequate to do the necessary work without being coated on its outer surface with a special coating process. The function of the coating on the transmuter’s outer aluminum wall is to establish a magnetic barrier. The metal used for this coating process welcomes magnetism and completes the total magnetic pole needed for the Transmuter. The material used for coating (TiAlCo—B) is of the greatest importance. The metals combined and used in this metal coating process are needed to insure the proper particle actions. The actual coating process calls for an exacting application movement within a certain time frame along with proper metal temperature, cooling and final baking. To finish unit, the top plexiglass ring is snapped into this outer wall at the top. The inside diameter of the plexiglass fits snugly around the brass spacer located under the dome. This then allows the dome to swing open and use the top of the plexiglass ring as a safety support while the dome is open. The 8-inch height gives this outer wall a slight extension that protrudes beyond the bottom plate of the Transmuter. This gives a greater assurance of coverage for the outer set—up pole and protects the Transmuter from dust blowing up under the unit. As the subject of this metal is further defined it will show how particles enter the space between these two walls, are circulated, transmitted and are then utilized by entering the main Transmuter for use. The outer wall then has a thermos—bottle effect preventing the escape of useful particles and at the same time affording exit points for unwanted particles which then return to the earth's particle balance. Part #3 is an aluminum base measuring 15-3/8 inches outside diameter. The two thicknesses of this base can be seen by viewing Figure 26. Notice the thicker section which measures 12—5/8 inches and is 3/4 inch thick. This diameter accommodates Part #1. The thinner portion of this plate goes under Part #1 to form the base mounting for Part #2. Part #4 is a dome shaped piece of nonmagnetic metal measuring 12—5/8 inches outside diameter, 7/16 inch thick with a 2-inch high rise in the center. This dome has an opening cut 1/2 inch by 2 inches starting 2 inches from the center point. This opening is covered with a seal of plexiglass. This dome shaped part must be made by being poured into the proper mold material, using TiA1Co-B metal. The dome then becomes a conductor of the particle activity that is generated on the rotary magnets. It serves as an Incoming and outgoing point of transference which aids in the particle exchange thus contributing to the generated energy within the unit. The combination of the metals combined and used in this metal dome is needed to insure an accurate conduction contributing to the proper amount of particle activity. The small opening in the dome does afford the operator a chance to view the brushes while the unit is running, however this opening serves a very important secondary purpose. As the particles travel around in a counter—clockwise direction, this opening helps to stimulate the particle flow which in turn affects the interchanges of the particles and this action is aided by an atmospheric stimulus. To gain a deeper understanding of just how important the dome is in relating to the function of this Transmuter we need to view the 7/16 inch thickness of the dome itself. This heaviness and thickness of the dome does not have to do with any air pressure because the chimney openings are a vent directly into the Transmuter. The thickness of this material simply aids and constructs a process of slowing and capturing particles. We see therefore why the material of the dome is of the greatest importance when viewed from the particle redistribution standpoint."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"87 Looking at the window in part #4, we note the 1/2-inch by 2-inch window is covered by a plexiglass plug. Air does not enter the Transmuter through this slot. When we speak of the atmospheric stimulus we are speaking of the atmosphere built within the unit and not an external. Part #5 These are mounting parts for the dome which include a hinge pin from which the dome swings and a latch to lock the dome tight. Part #6 This is a brass extension ring 12—5/8 inches outside diameter, 7/8 inches high with a 1/2 -inch wall thickness. This part is secured to the top of the inner wall part #1 in such a manner as to not make magnetic contact with it. First a ring of .030 mica is glued to the top of Wall #1 and then counter—sunk nylon screws go into this brass ring holding it firmly to part #1. The particle activity generated between wall #1 and the dome is such that these parts must not make contact. An \"O\" ring groove is cut on the top of this brass extension which allows the dome to be sealed against the elements. The dome is mounted on a hinge pin because of the need to quickly swing the dome open. There is a radical change to the elements inside the Transmuter which creates a bombastic effect thus building a pressure within the unit. This pressure is part of the process which changes the action from attract—attract to attract—release. By swinging the dome to one side the pressure is released and the unit stops. This also serves as a shut—down safety feature. Part #7 This is a brass 9-inch pipe, .025 thick, 30 inches high; and a 6-inch .025 thick, 30 inches high, center—mounted within the 9-inch pipe. Secured to the 9 inch chimney with brass braces is a 22-inch diameter rain cover, .025 thick held up about 4 inches. This cover protects the interior of the pipes against the elements and it also aids in the above ground amplification of particles. The brass base fittings and pipe seams are all continuous welded. This welding prevents wind from going into the unit and upsetting the particle flaw. Part #8 This is a 7/8-inch thick brass shaft driven into the ground approximately 5 feet and is coupled to the center post of the unit. This shaft becomes the point of contact for the particles that are drawn up out of the ground which is needed for the particle conductive process. This grounding also serves as a safety feature. The unit will not function without this shaft. See Figure 1. Part #9 Are mounting legs to support the unit and prevent damage from wind of vibration. See Figure 1. Part #10 Is a center post support bolted to base #3. Figure 3 shows this post support. Part #11 Is a center post which is the base of the central construction and is secured into Part #10. It is important to note that this shaft has three separate diameters with a threaded portion on the top. When parts are stacked on this shaft the parts having smaller bores do not make contact with parts having larger bores therefore the shaft sizes serve as spacer collars. The Center Post, Part #11 is made of a copper/brass metal combination that is 7—5/8 inches long. The bottom section is 1- inch diameter, 2—7/8 inches in length. The middle section is 7/8-inch diameter, 1—3/4 inches length. The upper section is 3/4-inch diameter, 2—3/8 inches length with a 5/8-inch thread, 5/8 inches long at the top. Part #12 Is a tube of Mica insulation that goes between the center post and the center post support. As particles are drawn up out of the ground they do not short—circuit into the base plate #3. Part #13 Is a .035 thick copper screen which covers the inside surface of part #3. This screen is secured to a .030 thick Mica insulation plate which is glued directly onto plate #3. Care is taken to prevent any part of the screen from contacting either the inside knurled wall or any parts. When particles transmit at this copper screen, magnetism is built up and this magnetism must not be drained off by contacting metal. Part #14 Is an oil impregnated bronze bushing. This bushing turns free on the center post and becomes the mounting frame for other parts. This part is shown in Figure 5."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"88 Part #15 Is an aluminum 2-inch spur gear bolted to the bottom side of bushing #14. See Figure 5. Part #16 Is an aluminum bowl pressed onto Bushing #14. This bowl has sixteen 1/8-inch holes bored into its outer rim. See Figure 6. Part #17 Is Graphite Rope Packing bonded into Part #16. See Figure 7. Part #18 Are sixteen 1/8-inch diameter copper stranded wire ropes. These are secured into Part #16. When Part #16 is driven these 16 copper wire ropes, which are flared on the ends, cause particles to be driven in the needed direction. This particle flow pattern serves very particular generating needs and therefore is reviewed later in exacting detail. The needed direction for the particles to flow is partially up toward the bottom of the coils located in the armature plate. To accomplish this, the flared ends of the wire ropes are flared vertically, having a slight fan angle to drive particles upward. Each wire rope is composed of 75 copper strands, .010 thick clean (non-— insulated) copper. Part #19 Is an aluminum metal that serves as a center Hub for the Main Armature Plate. This hub also carries other parts as it rotates on the center post. Figure 8 shows how this hub goes above Part #16 but does not make direct contact with it. Part #20 Is an oil impregnated Bronze Bushing that is pressed into Part #19. See Figure 8. Part #21 Is a 32 Bar Commutator that is pressed onto Part #20. These two parts turn as one around the center Post. See Figure 8. Part #22 Are 6 Copper Weights, secured to bottom of Part #19, Center Hub. See Figure 8 and 23. Part #23 Are 6 nonmagnetic Flat Springs secured to weights #22, shown in Figure 23 Part #24 Are Swivel Pins to allow the weights to move up and down. When the Center Hub is not turning at a speed to lift weights, these weights are pressed into graphite Rope Packing #17 by two forces, first by gravity pulling down on weights and second by the 6 attached springs that act as a control factor that push the weights into the graphite packing. This is achieved by centrifugal force. See Figure 23 Part #25 Shows 5 Mounting Posts for 5 Spur Gears. This is shown in Figure 9. Part #26 Are 5 Spur Gears that rotate on parts #25. See Figure 9. Part #27 Are 5 Posts that serve only as mounting points for 5 other parts which are shown in Figure 9. Part #28 Is a four-inch diameter Spur Gear that engages the two-inch spur gear #15 which turns on Center Post #11. See Figure 10. Part #29 Is a Shaft that has Gear #28 locked onto it. This shaft protrudes out of the bottom of the unit and is driven during the start—up phase. See Figure 16. Part #30 Is an oil impregnated Bushing that is pressed into Base Plate #3. Shaft #29 turns in this bushing. See Figure 16. Part #31 Is a twenty tooth Spur Gear also secured onto Shaft #29. See Figure 16. Part #32 Is a Transfer Gear with twenty teeth that engages Gear #31. This gear turns on a post supported by Plate #3 as shown in Figure 16. Part #33 Is a thirty tooth Spur Gear that engages Gear #32. See Figure 16. Part #34 Is a Shaft that has gear #33 secured to it and turns in a lower bronze bushing as shown in Figure 16. Part #35 Is an oil-impregnated bronze Bushing pressed into Plate #3, that allows Shaft #34 to rotate. See Figure 16. Part #36 Is a twenty tooth Spur Gear that is also secured to Shaft #34. As Gear #33 is driven, it turns Shaft #34 which also turns Gear #36. See Figure 16."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"89 Part #37 Is a twelve-inch diameter Internal Ring Gear made of Brass. See Figure 17 for a clear view. This gear is driven by gear #36. As this large gear goes around, it causes the five other gears #26 to rotate. There is a gear speed ratio of three-to-one between gear #15 and gear #36. As Shaft #29 is driven during the start—up phase, it turns two separate gears on different tracks. First, the lower gear #31 on shaft #29 drives the transfer gear #32. This turns gear #33. Gear #33 turns Shaft #34, which has gear #36 secured to it and it drives gear #37. The large four-inch gear #28 drives the center post gear #15, which turns Bowl #16. This gear assembly is shown in Figure 10 and a full view is shown in Figure 16. Part #38 Are five stationary Rotary Bar Housings. These parts snap onto five posts #27. See Figure 11. Part #39 These are five stationary Rotary Bars that have 3 brass wedges secured to each wheel, that turn free in Housings #38. There is a magnetic action in these brass wedges caused by copper stranded wire ropes #18 in the magnetic Dispenser #16 which has a relationship to the Armature speed. See Figure 11. Part #40 These are Brass Shafts that allow Bars #39 to rotate. See Figure 11. Part #41 These six plates are called Stop Gauges. They have three Brass .015 thick wedges secured to the top of each. These wedges are secured to the tops of the six twenty—tooth spur gears. These six plates of three wedges each rotate in the same direction and serve to redirect power as needed when they are driven. See Figure 11. Part #42 Is the chimney mounting location. Notice the center of the chimney opening is aligned in the area of the two stop gauges. This location gives these stop gauges the opportunity to maximize their use by being in the main particle stream. See Figure 11. Part #43 Is a set of forty-four magnets. See Figure 12. These magnets are glued into two brass rings which are machined to accept them in the proper magnet pattern. When assembled, this part is secured to the inside wall of part #1. When mounted, the bottom of this ring of magnets is spaced above the six stop gauges with one—half-inch clearance. Milled into the brass ring are five slots which allow the stationary rotary bars #38 to fit through and protrude out of the top. The magnets are each bonded into a jacket of metal wire before being secured into the brass rings. This full size view of the actual machined brass and wire connections are in Figure 19 and 20. These metal wire jackets serve a critically important function as connective distributors and will be explained in detail later in this disclosure. Part #44 Is the armature plate. This plate is made by pouring TiAlCo-B metal into the proper mold and finishing the surface with light machining. The finished plate size is 3/8 inches thick, 12 inches diameter. In order to assemble this plate it must be bolted to the armature hub which has the commutator connected to it, therefore the shim that gets bolted between armature hub 19 and the armature plate is given the following number. Part #45 A piece of non-magnetic shim stock. See Figure 16 (See Armature plating mounting.) Part #46 Is a 1/16-inch thick graphite liner that goes into each of the 24 slots. See Figure 13 Part #47 Are .010 thick mylar high voltage insulation, one piece per slot. Fig 13 Part #48 Are a total of 24 coils of #18 insulated copper wire.

Part #57 Is an upper magnet ring that is made identical to the lower magnet ring which also has wires wrapped around each of the 44 magnets. Since rotary bars are not mounted above the armature plate there would be no need to machine openings to accommodate them. This upper magnet ring is mounted to housing #1. The bottom of this ring goes above the Armature plate not more than 1/2 inch or less than 3/8-inch clearance. See Figure 14. Part #58 Is a dome shaped brass particle distributor. This part remains stationary and is screwed directly onto the center post. Figure 14. Part #59 Is a brass brush holder base that is secured to housing #1. Figure 15. Part #60 Are six sets of carbon brush and brush holders spaced (30 degrees apart. These brushes transfer the generated power from the commutator to the six coaxial cables and out of the unit. Fig 15 Part #61 Is a cleaning brush with a coaxial cable attached to it. The following review of Figure drawings #16 on through #26 is next explained before the scientific understanding of this unit begins. Figure #16 Is a side view of the Transmuter without the chimney structure. This view shows the parts as they are assembled inside the main Transmuter housing. Notice the base which extends to include the outer aluminum wall. This is the best view for showing the start—up splined hole under the unit. It is advisable to have this view layed out before you, as the pulse rate is being explained. The close proximity between the upper and lower magnet rings shows the tremendous magnetic field that the armature is utilizing for generating power. Figure #17 This top view shows the base and the gear train. It shows the close proximity between the sixteen copper wire ropes and the six turning stop gauges. Notice the direction of rotation for the wire ropes is the same as the close edge of the stop gauges. A particle wind builds a given circulation that does not conflict between the stop gauges and the particle dispenser. Less than 1—1/2 inches away from the moving wire ropes arc the five stationary rotary bars. These wheels gain power from the wire ropes and continue to spin sending their built—up charge into the armature. It shall be noted that when the lower magnet ring is installed these five rotary bars will each be located in a magnetic area whereby the magnetic power from the magnets alone will cause the wheels to spin. The three brass wedges on each wheel respond to the magnetic power by giving rotation similar to a small motor. Figure #18 Shows a top view of the parts inside the inner wall. This view shows the six copper weights located inside the graphite bowl. The lower magnet ring is now in place which shows how each of the five stationary rotary bars is locked on three sides by permanent magnets. Figure #19 Is a magnet ring. This is a tracing of the actual .060 brass plate. This frame for holding the magnets is held apart on the outer rim by a brass spacer 5/8-inch high, 1/4-inch wall thickness. These plates are screwed into this spacer maintaining the outer size. The inner size is maintained by having 5/8 inch spacers hold the plates apart when the magnets are glued into the rings. All of the magnets face the same polarity or north on one side, south on the other. Figure #20 This drawing shows the wire connections between magnets. Figure #21 This drawing shows the placement of one magnet ring above the other. The magnets are not in line. The magnet rings face north to north. Figure #22 This view shows the proper placement of the plastic magnets in the Armature. The top magnet ring will pull plastic magnet stack A as shown. The bottom magnet ring will pull stack A in the same direction and finalizes their pull when located as shown. All 24 stacks of plastic magnets must be facing this same direction to cause counterclockwise rotation."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"91 Figure #23 Is a view of the armature hub and weight mounting method.

Figure #26 Is a cut—out view of the Celestial Particle Transmuter. BASIC THEORY AND REASONS FOR ATTRACT-ATTRACT In order to observe the force of attract—attract to attract—release, it is necessary to first gain a knowledge of the total picture beforehand, otherwise the actual viewing of this attract movement will not be properly understood. A starting point would be to explain the statement that, \"This power source is not predicated on a continuous flow of energy but predicated on the consistency of particle action within the earth’s pressure flow.\" This Transmuter does absorb magnetic power to run continuously, it is however a conduit through which the earth's particles flow and thus maintain their particle balance. It is the consistency of this particle action that needs a closer understanding. Everything that happens within the earth’s pressure flow always returns to a particle balance. Because of limited ability to observe particles during their interchange process, people have determined that there must be an annihilation of particles because they seem to disappear, but this is wrong. They are never annihilated but always return to a particle balance. Understanding this particle balance within the present teaching on electricity which states that electricity is the flow of electrons through a conductor becomes extremely difficult when trying to grasp the balancing return needed. A closer understanding would be to state that the conductor which has positive and negative particles simply exchanges them in such a manner as to create a new particle flow. When this unit attracts particles from the ground and attracts particles from the earth’s rim, they join inside the Transmuter to form a new structure that manifests itself as magnetism inside the Transmuter. This magnetism then creates a process that produces a new form of flowing magnetic current. However, when this energy is used, it produces particles which then return to the earth’s pressure flow, thus maintaining a continuous flow in this system. The teaching on the conservation of energy, which is that we never get something for nothing is the teaching accepted at the present time. This teaching stems from a statement by Albert Einstein, where he held to the view that the relative relationship of one particle to another did not matter, which would then suggest that redistribution of particles was not possible. He was in error and time has proven this to be so. You see there has never been a problem of redistribution. The problem has always been the manner in which the redistribution takes place. Our current technology produces energy that is not redistributed without negative consequences to the environment. When a molecular structure breaks down, there is a transfer of energy to the greatest part which is the attracting force. When this attracting force can be harnessed, vast amounts of energy become available. Therefore we see that all parts are not equal in producing a generating force; the proper attract fields must be established using the proper elements. The conductive materials that go into the construction of this Transmuter are of the greatest importance and need to be observed closely. It will be shown as this review unfolds that the attract—attract happens in many ways which therefore commands a closer study. Unfortunately the principle of attract—attract has always been rejected because attract—repel has always been considered a sound principle. When, in fact, it does not properly utilize the magnetic field to its greatest advantage. Inventors have also tried to build continuous motion devices by using the power of repel/repel by allowing the magnets to come together by blocking out magnetism and then pulling the blocking material free to capitalize on the repel power between the magnets. The structural"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"92 polarities of this earth negate this kind of power from being used here because there is an unequal balance in repel-repel and it does not line up with the universal system. Thus we have limited ourselves as we refused to receive greater knowledge from the Source of its origin. That being stated, let us continue. When this unit is driven at the start—up phase it generates a magnetic pulse within, that comes from a parallel source outside the earth’s atmosphere which is the beginning of attract— attract. Now as these particles come into the Transmuter from above, they interchange with particles from the ground, forming a new molecular structure that is manifest inside the unit, thus becoming the driving force. The Transmuter is therefore as stated only a conduit to what already exists. The radical change to these elements as they converge, with the excesses held in the copper screen inside the unit, produce a captivity of particles that when released add to the existing power, and so the drawing power in the unit that attracts these particles is the result of eighty—eight permanent magnets pulsed in a timed sequence which then allows neutrons to exchange at a tremendous rate, drawing on an inexhaustible source. Neutrons of themselves are not pulsed individually in a one, two, three fashion but are joined into groups of neutrons which are then called magnetrons and as these groups form they are then pulsed as individual groups. There is also, we might note, concentrated in this pulsing a resonance of frequency made up of sound waves. When these sound waves are sent out into the ionosphere they attract particles within the same frequency thus forming not only new but extended groups of magnetrons. The rotating armature inside this unit sets up the necessary attract pulse rate. By the pulse rate we speak of that magnetic field on the earth’s rim which is now utilized and formed into energy. As this energy is flowed through rows of permanent magnets located inside the Transmuter, this energy travels at the speed of 182 pulses per every 4.8 to 5.0 seconds. This pulse action then causes the Transmuter to function at a pulse figure of 873.6 to 910.0 which is the range of pulse that equals the revolving speed of the armature at the high and the low points. In order to activate this armature speed, the magnetic circuit of 182 is completed through a precise arrangement of magnetic material located inside the armature. Therefore, the pulse rate is in fact pulsed by a ratio as needed and supplied from above and from below, equaling 182 pulses as stated. As this pulse is further defined, it will be understood how in fact each magnet pulses twice during one complete pulsing circuit. The precise arrangement of magnetic material located inside the armature, which was mentioned as being needed to attain the magnetic circuit of 182 pulses, is the thickness and number of plastic magnets. (Plastic magnets composed of 24 pieces in each coil— 3/8 inch by 1 inch — .030 thick.) A magnetic pulse time—factor happens as the magnetic pulse travels from one plastic magnet to the next until all plastic magnets are pulsed. This happens in each slot respectively. Thicker plastic magnets would result in using less magnets and the timing would be wrong. This timing directly effects the speed of the magnetic pulse as it travels through all 88 magnets. The strength or charge of the plastic magnets is not a great concern because the pulse does not leave the Transmuter due to the pulse strength. The pulse releases itself to the attract force of the atmosphere after the pulse reaches a given accumulative speed. This release condition is a result of the momentum built—up and accelerated by being pulled on attract through 88 magnets which is the number needed to arrive at the needed accumulative speed. The purchasing of these 88 rare earth permanent magnets were at the time the best available for purchase. Today however, neodymium magnets are available for purchase which could lead to error, in purchasing based on power. These more powerful new magnets should not be used because this entire magnetic assembly was designed for standard rare earth magnets. That is not to say a unit will not be designed for"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"93 neodymium magnets because as this unit is understood the door of understanding will be opened to more powerful usage. And so we conclude on this thought. Let us look at the Armature Construction for rotation. The direction of rotation for this Transmuter isn’t determined by where this unit is located as to area because the earth’s gravitational pull does not control the magnetic sequence in the Armature, nor is the pulse rate predicated on gravity and its principle, in that we have come to understand that gravity is simply compressed magnetism. We repeat, gravity is simply compressed magnetism. Therefore, all things working together achieve a balanced unit. However the magnets in the Armature do determine in which direction the attract—attract will be manifested. With a new understanding of gravity we now have an explanation as to how a pulse leaves the Transmuter and how it is guided back to the Transmuter after being formed into particles. This can be understood only if science is willing to free itself from the confinements of set theories that they have attributed to the speed of light. This mental boundary must be broken and expanded. In order to understand how we see light waves we must consider that the particles that become light travel from the sun in the form of pulses at a rate four times faster than recorded light waves. As these particles make contact with other molecular structures (in this case the Earth’s rim) they take on an elongated form and in so doing have a slowing action which is viewed in a waveform and then observed. When a magnetic pulse is sent into compressed magnetism (gravity), the pulse moves at speeds not unlike the speed of light pulses. One might ask, \"Why don’t the light waves in our atmosphere become a speed limiting factor to these magnetic pulses?\" The reason the light waves are not a speed-limiting factor is because although these magnetic pulses exist in the same space as the light waves, they do not vie for each other’s attention. They are separate energy forces. Magnetic particles and light particles simply go around each other. We see therefore the magnetic pulse traveling upward moves at so great a speed that it in fact creates a magnetic track which becomes a guide for the pulse returning to the Transmuter. This assessment shows that the speed of light, although constant, is not limited to a given speed rate. To be a constant and maintain a specific speed rate are two entirely different thoughts. Light goes through an acceleration process as the pulsed particles leave the sun and are slowed, depending on the nature of the other structures in their path. It is important to broaden our understanding — and learn that light in the universe is traveling at different speeds. Drawing 21 shows one ring of magnets above the Armature and one below the Armature. The actual distance between the upper and lower magnets is one and one—eighth inches. Figure 21 shows these two rings of magnets, one colored in blue and one colored in brown. Notice that the magnets are placed between each other as opposed to being directly in line. With the upper magnet ring facing like polarity to the lower magnet ring which is north to north, one would think that this magnet placement would still have a total repel manifest between the upper and the lower magnet ring. When holding one magnet ring above the other in the position where it will be mounted, no repel can be felt. This condition is partly caused by the method for containing each magnet’s power closer to its source. The magnets' lengths are 3/4 inch deep or high, which allows for a metal wire jacket to be completely encased around each magnet. This creates a distance that separates the one side of the magnet further away from the other side which contributes to the time lag between magnet pulses as will be shown later. The benefit to viewing gravity as compressed magnetism is that we can then properly evaluate the energy being transmitted through this force field. All objects moving toward the earth do so because of two distinctly different forces, one pushing the object and one pulling the object. Of greatest importance is that there cannot be one of these forces without the other. This"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"94 understanding of the force keeping objects to the earth will lead to a new freedom of air and space travel. It will be a simple matter to exit the earth’s environment by now using a \"lift principle\", and a spherically shaped, magnetically charged space ship can travel at speeds that are not hindered by light particles because they simply accommodate another flow. The method for containing the magnetic power of each magnet is to wrap a .032 metal wire completely around each magnet, taking care not to let the metal wire actually touch the magnet. A .010 mylar insulation is first wrapped around the magnet before the metal is secured. When the Transmuter begins to function, these wires serve a critically important function as Connective Distributors. They distribute an energy flow by properly containing the magnetic power of each magnet, and at the proper pulse point release a harnessed energy. Prior to the success of any new discovery or invention, science has always insisted that unless it fits a known theory, it doesn’t work, even if it does! Given the condition of our planet, it's time for change. The full size brass magnet rings shown in Figure 19 have slots which are curved on four corners. This is the shape of the magnet when wrapped around with .032 metal wire. It is advisable not to curve the wire around the magnet in too tight a wire wrapping pattern. The size of each slot as shown will accommodate the wire wrapping and fit a layer of .015 mica. The wire should be layered to fit flush with the ends of the permanent magnets. This wire wrapping of the magnet helped to dictate a method for assembly of the magnet rings, which is to bond the top and bottom of each magnet into slots machined to accept them in an upper and lower brass ring. Here we will observe the Connections for the Connective Distributors. In order for the wire coils to perform their tasks of assisting in the release of the plastic magnets they need to be interconnected. The connection used is to allow like poles to attract by connecting the north side of one coil to the north side of the other and the south side of one coil to the south side of the other. Viewing Figure 20 shows magnet #1 which has a continuous wrap of #20 clean metal wire and a total of twenty-one turns going from the bottom of the magnet to where it is flush with the top of the magnet. The end of the wire wrap on the top of #1 goes to the top wire of magnet #44. The bottom of this wire wrap has the wire going to the bottom wire of magnet #2. These wires are twisted together but do not make contact with the brass holding plate because shrink insulation tubing is slid over the connection preventing grounding of the wire circuit. And this is the procedure. This connection pattern is repeated, which shows the top of wire wrap #2 going to the top of #3 and so forth and so on. All forty-four wire coils are connected in the same pattern. The upper and lower magnet rings are also both connected in this manner. It is very important that the wires do not discharge their magnetic pulse into the brass holding frame, therefore, .015 Mica insulation is bonded around each wire wrap before it is bonded into the brass holding ring. Around each magnet is an insulation jacket of .010 thick Mylar bonded to the magnet before it is inserted into the wire coil. Using this insulation and connection method there are no breaks in the magnetic circuit of the wire. Now viewing Figure 21, looking down from the top, we see that there are no magnets directly in line with each other and no magnetic activity in the form of a pulse is yet taking place. Notice the 24 dotted rectangular shapes. These are stacks of plastic magnets that are caused to come between the upper and lower magnets. Because there are only 22 magnets in each row, and 24 stacks of plastic magnets, all of the plastic magnets do not arrive directly between an upper and lower magnet at the same time."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"95 When a stack of plastic magnets does get properly located between an upper and lower magnet, the stack becomes a conduit that completes a magnetic pulse between this upper and lower magnet. One must observe and take note that the 182 pulses are achieved with 88 magnets as they interact in two different directions in a simultaneous manner and so without the plastic magnet material no magnetic action would take place. The stack of plastic magnets located in each coil join their power to form one attract magnet to both permanent magnets, thus creating a pulling effect to this moveable magnet of turning the Armature. The intensity of the pull is not the result of the strength of the plastic magnets but results from an attract field set—up between and by the permanent magnets that are impregnating the plastic. Since this new field is set—up by the permanent magnets, this same field is also transferred after the plastic magnets move to a location just past the original attract zone. Here is where the polarity of magnetism is reversed as it stabilizes and two like poles rather than like and opposite poles create reverse magnetism, which is simply reversed magnetic energy. One must consider a discovery that has not been explored, that magnetism is a constant, we repeat, magnetism is a constant and so molecular changes as they are created are being utilized from what has been thought to be annihilated within the earth’s atmosphere. Now let us observe the Armature. As the Armature turns between these two rings of magnets, the arrangement of magnetic forces manifest themselves, which then cause continuous armature rotation. No direct confrontation takes place between these two sets of magnets without the armature material, which is the vital source that completes the magnetic circuit. At the present time, scientists have limited the state of the art of harnessing magnetism because they believe and teach that magnetism cannot be insulated and therefore its use is limited to their form of magnetic embodiment. Their teaching then would contradict what is next being explained. That is not to say that what is being explained is not factual. Difficulty in viewing magnetism as a constant exists because magnetism has at times been harnessed in a confined manner (one that shuts off the flow), which then dissipates it. If magnetism is harnessed so as to allow an unobstructed flow, as for example in this Transmuter, it retains its constancy. The flow of the magnetic field, in order to make contact with the magnets, must be in relationship to the atmosphere. In that magnetism is a constant, it also has a draw factor. In other words the magnetic field makes contact with the magnets through that particular molecular structure that is magnetized in the atmosphere. It is important to note therefore that while everything is made of molecular structures, not all of them are magnetized. There are many conditions that influence this draw factor, and when they are all recorded and given proper consideration, scientists will understand why they had wrongfully supposed magnetism is not constant in its energy flow. The pulse that is being described which travels from one magnet to another in the existing field is not an electromagnetic pulse but a magnetic pulse, and there is a difference. An analogy that would be helpful is the color spectrum whereby we see basic colors combined to form new colors, and so it is with magnetism, as new magnetic structures form to create varying magnetic fields. However, there are basic differences between all magnetism: A) the particular composition, B) their magnetic intensity, and C) their pulse rate. If all or only one change takes place, the polarity is affected. For example, there are magnetisms in the atmosphere only minutely touched which will show that structural polarities exist in all things and in all differing measures. Two simple tests that arc useful in understanding these magnetisms are: 1) If a permanent magnet had a steel ball attached to it, the ball can be pulled free of the magnet by first contacting the ball with an unmagnetized piece of iron and then by pulling on the iron, the ball leaves the magnet, sticking to the iron. For a very short space of time the ball can be viewed as still sticking to the metal, after the metal magnet is removed even a goodly distance from the permanent magnet. Where did the magnetic power come"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"96 from? We know the magnet transferred its power to the iron through the ball. Is the magnet now possessing a weaker strength? Another example. If a mechanical device repeated this motion several million times would the magnet be drained in a day or so? No, because magnetism is a constant. The transference of magnetism from the magnet to the metal does not mean a loss of magnetism in the magnet. It has to do with the molecular structure of all elements. The reason the ball stays with the iron is that there is an additional structure in the iron that is also in the ball, producing an attracting force of likes. The reason it does not maintain the hold system is that their magnetic structure, that is the ball and the iron, are incomplete without the additional molecular structures in the magnet which is the strength needed to complete the field. The second example we need to take a closer look at is the magnetic conduit. Hold a permanent magnet in the left hand facing the north face to the right hand. In the right hand have a .030 thick plastic magnet measuring the same height as the permanent magnet. If the opposite polarity of the plastic magnet is offered to the permanent magnet, they understandably attract together. If the like face is offered, repel happens. If an edge of this .030 thick plastic magnet is offered, it will not attract to the center of the permanent magnet. It will always attract to one side of the north face or the other depending on the polarities’ edge of the plastic magnet and which way it is facing. After establishing to which side this thin magnet moves on attract, move this same edge of the plastic magnet to the other side of the same north face. Notice that the permanent magnet simply attracts this thin magnet back to the other edge and then stops there on attract. If this north face of the permanent magnet simply attracted it to the center of its face, this entire generating principle would not work. As more plastic magnets are added to the stack, the total thickness of all the stacks move past the north face and stop at the same attract edge as if only one .030 plastic magnet was used. The reason this attract edge of the permanent magnet does not simply attract to the center of the plastic magnet stack, which would be a logical assumption, is that the magnet attract pulse starts at the closest plastic magnet but then travels through the first plastic magnet, then attracts the second plastic magnet, moving at light speed and then on and through the third plastic magnet and so on until it arrives at the final magnet. When the circuit of all the plastic magnets is completed, the total attract power is focused into the very last plastic magnet. This same magnetic circuit increasing attract from layer to layer will one day possibly be accomplished with a diamond crystal magnet. However, for the time being this Transmuter will attain the necessary magnetic response by using stacked plastic magnets. This movement then of 3/8 inch, which is the total thickness of the amount of the plastic magnets used represents five degrees of travel to the Armature. Please note, it represents five degrees of travel to the Armature. Notice that the magnets used also have a 3/8-inch face. Since there are 22 magnets around each ring, the Armature has 110 degrees of pulling movement from one magnet ring. Also notice that the placement of the opposite magnet ring is located as centered as shown in Figure 21. This then allows the opposite ring to pull another 110 degrees for a total travel distance of 220 degrees. Explaining the driving attract force in this manner is helpful because it addresses the next problem as we bring it to mind. The obvious problem is how did the plastic magnet stacks get free of the attract after the movement took place. Before stating how it got free, it is important to note just what was being attracted that needed release action. The attract pull to the plastic magnets was a pull to a south pole set—up by the two north magnets. The strength of this south pole is not a built in part of the plastic magnet structure, but is the power of the permanent magnets relocating inside the plastic magnets. Now if you will remember the test where the power from the permanent magnets transferred to the piece of"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"97 iron you will understand it more. This same condition happens to this Armature only in a circular motion. Do you have it! Assuming you are clear on this point, let’s go on, and if you’re not, then retrace what it is you need to know, so you can have a clear understanding of what is going to be said next. Notice in Figure 21 that the dotted line which represents the plastic magnets, which are at a certain point on the inner magnet row. Here these plastic magnets are under attract influence from the next set of permanent magnets before the actual hold—back can manifest itself. This holdback is prevented because a generating force moves into a position of release before the holding occurs. The magnets that have pulled the plastic magnets for their five degrees of travel simply turn it free because arriving from the same direction is another plastic magnet and this power of attract switches to the new arriving stack. The switching of attract from one stack of plastic magnets to the next is an extremely important action, therefore some reasons for this polarity switching are explained. Within the framework of an ordinary magnet attracting any object, an amount of energy would be required that is equal to the attract pull in order to pull the material free. A strong focus must be put on what is actually being attracted. The charged particles relocated and stored within the plastic magnets possess a high potential for being moved out by virtue of the fact that they do not belong there. For this reason a charge of like strength is not necessary to affect a plastic magnet polarity change which causes the attract—release action. The generating force which moves into the position of release is partially supplied by the metal wires wrapped around each permanent magnet. These wires serve as connective distributors which distribute a charge that momentarily takes over the attract pull for the permanent magnet as the plastic magnets go on past. The permanent magnet then instantly redirects its attract to the next arriving plastic magnet stack. We therefore see an equal amount of strength is not necessary to break free of the initial attract pull. Viewing this action in Figure 21 therefore shows the importance of the relationship between the permanent magnet’s size and the plastic magnet’s size as they are mounted. The only way north to north magnets could be used on attract is to have them be mounted side by side as shown. Each magnet has its section of plastic magnets to impregnate, located inside each coil where it can transfer its power in an opposite polarity for attracting. Before explaining the magnetic pulse sequence it is worthwhile to identify some of the varying degrees of magnetism that are manifest inside this Transmuter. There are unending variations that are being manifest, all of which serve a useful function. For example, the plastic magnets actually accept a different kind of magnetic charge than the permanent magnet, which is one kind of polarity. The air space around each permanent magnet is as important as the magnet itself. Therefore, the invasion of this space by the metal wire jacket causes another variation of magnetism that is manifesting as a conductive/distributor. Also the particles formed inside the Transmuter form still another variation of magnetism. As this form of magnetism joins the pulsed sequence of the permanent magnets, the power joins with other magnetisms. As current is drawn out of the coils, another variation of magnetism manifests itself around the copper wires. And the list goes on. The word magnetism therefore has a limited meaning, because the word needed should be descriptive of a total variety of like energies not heretofore identified. The actual power removed from this Transmuter can be compared in strength to 7,200 watts of power at 900 volts. This power however is not the same kind of electron flow as happens when a generator is driven. This power is magnetic energy and when it is fed into new magnetically driven appliances, working on its own principles, it will seem to do the same electrical work. Therefore persons will view it as being the same, when in fact it is different."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"98 Explaining the pulse sequence. There is much to say concerning the magnetic pulse sequence, so let us begin here. The magnetic pulse sequence that occurs within the framework of the coils has a very definite purpose. It has to do with the amount of driving power achieved and it is therefore important to review how this magnetic pulse sequence takes place. In Figure 21 we see magnet #1 located on the upper magnet ring impregnating plastic magnet stack A, also impregnating stack A is magnet #45 located in the lower magnet ring. The polarity of the plastic magnets is such that these two permanent magnets are both attracting plastic magnet stack A causing the Armature to move in the direction of the arrow. This attract movement will not stop until the total amount of the plastic magnets in stack A has moved past as shown in Figure 22. This attract did not begin when stack A arrived as shown. It began when a lesser percentage of the stack was moved into this position. For explanation purposes, let’s assume that the magnetic pulse happened when this perfect alignment transpired. Pulsing then started at magnet #1 on the top level and pulsed through stack A to magnet #45 on the bottom level inside. This pulse now being located under the bottom ring on the inside row is looking for the next pulse point. The next pulse happens by the magnetic circuit jumping four magnets counter-clockwise or the direction of rotation to magnet #15 on the bottom outside row. Since the pulses are slower than the Armature speed, plastic magnet stack U will be in position before the pulse gets there. Note there are 182 pulses per every five seconds and it is only slightly more than two pulses per revolution. To explain, 900 revolutions per minute are fifteen turns around per second or seventy-five turns around during the five seconds, the pulse time of 182 pulses. In attempting to explain this magnetic pulse in terms of similar electric motor technology the obvious thought would be to relate this action to cycles per second, as for example, sixty cycles per second is power feeding the normal household. This however is completely wrong, because magnetisms travel at the speed of light and these pulses are simply the difference of light speeds to each other. Magnet #50 on the bottom pulses to magnet #6 on the top through stack B. This pulse sequence continues until all eighty-eight magnets have pulsed before magnet #1 is again repulsed. We see therefore how the pulsed speed is controlled by the revolutions of the Armature. Each time this magnetic pulse happens through these plastic magnets, a charge of particles sends a heavy attract force that intensifies the attract pull which becomes the main driving force that turns the Transmuter Armature. The copper coils however are accomplishing several important tasks while the plastic magnets drive the Armature. The coil connections which group the twenty—four coils into eight groups serve as rotating magnet poles which are being self-induced, thereby resisting acceleration beyond the 900 r.p.m. allowed speed. As the magnetic attract happens between the permanent magnets and the plastic magnets, and this magnetic field is released, the coils of copper wire build up a charge which in turn give a slight rise and fall action to the armature plate. This movement then generates particles which are gathered and removed as magnetic current by the brushes. Plastic magnets that are not used during the heavy pulsing are still attracting but they are discharging and picking up slower. As the pulse goes around it gets stronger because the accumulated magnetic power of all eighty-eight magnets is added to the pulse volume. During the start—up phase this pulse happens only by the power of these permanent magnets located inside the unit, and the pulse is transmitted through particles by the chimney structure that is a channel that amplifies the above ground particles. The pulse also is transmitted into the ground through the shaft which generates a particle flow which in turn sends particles back into the Transmuter that interact with existing particles and thus produces a flowing magnetic current drawn from the magnetic field."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"99 This then magnifies the pulse leaving the Transmuter and a speed—up of particle intensity begins to happen. This acceleration of the nuclear subatomic parts has a bombastic effect and creates a structure of mobility for other structures forming a molecular breakdown from structure to structure whereby they are contained and utilized once this harnessing takes place. It would serve you well to review the last statement made in order to assess what is happening in the correct manner. The nuclear energy released through this method of acceleration is therefore accomplished within the confines of the structural balance, and this radical change to these elements produces a captivity of power which is a constant flow of ions through the conductive use of neutrons. A reserve build—up of magnetism is needed at the copper screen inside the unit because the particles drawn in that are changed to magnetism only desire to join the magnetic pulse flow to which they are attracted. In order to control the volume of particles which should be allowed in the stream, flow control parts called stop gauges are used. These items shown in Figure 17 are driven when the flow of magnetism in the pulse circuit needs to be cut back. When the stop gauges rotate they redirect the magnetic flow by sending the particles into other locations inside the unit. The three brass .015 metal wedges on each stop gauge also catch and store particles similar to capacitor build—up. M Magnetic particles are then discharged into the stream when the stop gauges slow down. Stop gauges stop the particles from joining the magnetic current flow in a quantity beyond the needed amount. However, they for the most part only redirect the particles and do not stop them or change their speed. When the unit is completely charged up, the armature is then driven at full speed because of a charge build-up in the magnets which are a central location for the magnetic pull. Without drawing magnetic current out of the unit the only condition that could cause a slowdown of the armature is if the pulse rate were to slightly diminish. This does not happen because the stationary rotary bars continuously feed the magnetic field in the armature preventing a slowdown of the pulse rate which then maintains the full armature speed. When current is drawn out of the coils many actions take place that help to maintain armature speed. Putting a load on the armature coils does cause it to slow down to its allowed slower speed. However this slowing starts up the lower magnetic dispenser. This dispenser then turns sixteen 1/8 inch thick copper stranded wires which create a particle movement that saturates the magnetic pulse circuit thereby recharging it and adding more power to the plastic magnets. Comparing the construction between the stationary rotary bars and the sixteen copper wire ropes, one would think that the function of each is completely different. The magnetic dispenser however, is equal to the rotary bars in performance in that they both do the same basic job of pushing particles in the needed direction. It also fans particles toward the stationary bars causing them to speed up. Another action it does is to pump unwanted particles out of the six-inch chimney. The stop gauges also start-up again and interfere with the load being drawn by the pulsed generating force which is entering the coils, thereby momentarily removing the load from the armature. All this action then allows the Armature to again speed—up. The increased armature speed raises the weights which disconnects the lower drive units and again allows the magnetic build—up to enter the pulsed magnetic stream to build—up again, slows the armature and the weights lower, starting up the stop gauges which again reduces the load. This process continues and therefore we see that the normal running unit is a build-up and a slow—down. This causes the unit to have the sound of a skipping rope, so to speak, during the normal running operation. Because of this continuous speed flow adjustment it can therefore be stated that the ratio of the revolutions to the speed of the generating force needs to continuously compensate to attain a smooth generated flow of power. We repeat, because of this continuous speed flow adjustment it"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"100 can therefore be stated that the ratio of revolutions to the speed of the generating force needs to continuously compensate to attain a smooth generated flow of power. This continuous compensation becomes possible because of the speed selection. When the unit's speed is geared down as disclosed, there are less capacitors needed. North to north creates this effect. Therefore polarity is affected and the desired effect is achieved. As differing Transmuter designs are contemplated, we need to review the impact that speed will have as we think on capacitation and its effect on not only the individual parts but the whole Transmuter action. The volume of this newly produced generated power is directly related to two factors. First, the total power of magnetic power released when all the magnets are pulsed in sequence is multiplied times the exchange of particles entering and leaving the Transmuter, and secondly since there is an unlimited supply of particles to draw on, the volume of energy produced is only limited to whatever strength people can increase the power of the same pulse sequence and of course increase the hardware as needed. We will now begin an explanation concerning the Armature Construction. The conductive materials that comprise the armature housing is of the greatest importance when analyzing the volume of magnetic energy produced by this Transmuter. This material is custom made from a blend of known metals and has a molecular structure ideally suited for particle absorption. Particles drawn up out of the ground enter into the center post, travel through this metal enroute to the generating coils. This metal therefore, while being nonmagnetic, which means a permanent magnet will not adhere to it, is most certainly magnetic when viewed from a power generating standpoint. Whenever any metal is caused to be moved through magnetic fields, the normal response it produces is that it sets up magnetic currents that are unwanted, for example, eddy currents, which happen in standard generating housings. These problems are somewhat alleviated in standard generators by using a laminated iron core to dissipate the eddy currents. In this unit however these magnetic currents are not only helpful but necessary because of the particle activity they produce to help generate a magnetic flow of power. This all becomes possible because of the molecular structure of the metal used which has a trade name of TiAlCo-B. In a normal generating armature, the same metal that surrounds the coil also is used as the core of the coil. In this unit, the core as stated previously becomes the driving force to turn the armature, and this material is made up of plastic magnets. ARMATURE ASSEMBLY Viewing Figure 25 we see Part #44 Armature Plate Assembly of TiAlCo—B. This metal plate is 3/8 inch thick and twelve inches in diameter. The armature is then assembled using this base frame. Viewing Figure 25 shows Part #44 with twenty-four slots milled in the armature plate. The reason for selecting twenty-four slots is that the needed speed is 900 r.p.m. An eight-pole magnetic field must be connected to accomplish this speed. Therefore a coil number divisible by eight was desired. The size of the slot was made as large as possible without running a risk of cutting the web between the coils too thin. This web now measures .135 at its thinnest point. Part #46 is inserted first, which is a graphite liner for each slot. This liner is only 1/16 inch thick and secured by bonding into the slot with nonmagnetic glue. It extends from the top to the bottom of the plate. This material serves a two-fold purpose. First, it screens out air particles that would attempt to get into the coil by passing through the metal and insulation. Second, it serves as a monitoring filter to collect and store particles, slowing them down, then allowing them to flow evenly into the cell."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"101 Part #47 are insulated slot liners made of .010 thick mylar high voltage insulation. This high quality liner is needed to prevent sparking to ground because of the 900 volts being generated. The insulation material is extended 1/8 inch beyond the plate on both top and bottom of the plate. Part #48 are twenty—four coils of copper wire with plastic coat insulation. The coils consist of twenty-two turns of #18 wire in three layers. The first layer having eight turns, the second layer — seven turns, and the third layer having seven turns. Care must be taken to not wind the coils too tightly or it will affect the tension of the generating parts, and this point is very important. One coil wire exits at the top of the plate and one at the bottom of the plate in order to connect the coils in a smooth flat connection pattern. The wires have insulating tubing over them before leaving the slot. Since these coils are not wound around a center laminated iron frame which would become a natural holding method, the coils need special attention when being secured into the slot. The core size of the coils must be preserved in full dimension when pushing the coils into the cavity for bonding. A teflon tool that is the same size as the coil orifice or 3/8 inch by 2 inches is first inserted into the coil. Next the coil of wire is completely coated with a five-minute epoxy glue of a non- metallic nature and the coil gently forced into the insulated slot. Care is taken to center the coil between the mylar 1/8-inch extensions on each side which is for the prevention of grounding the coil. After the coil is firmly bonded into the slot, the teflon tool is removed and the cavity for the plastic magnets are ready for magnet insertion. Pre—marked stacks of plastic magnets should be ready for insertion to prevent inserting the magnets improperly. To make one stack of plastic magnets. first purchase plastic magnet sheets polarized north on one side and south on the other, .030 thick of the best grade possible. Cut twenty-four pieces, each measuring 3/8 inch by 1 inch precisely. Make two separate stacks of 3/8 inch by 1 inch noting that the individual magnets are not to be glued together when inserting into the coil orifice which is 3/8 inch thick by 2 inches long. Prior to inserting the magnets #50 into the coil, place the brass clip #51 which is 1/4 inch wide, 1—1/2 inches long by .012 thick across the coil, making sure to center it. Now, secure it by bending 3/4 inch across the coil and 3/8 inch on either side in a downward position. I repeat, now, secure it by bending 3/4 inch across the coil and 3/8 inch on either side in a downward position. Insert and glue between graphite and mylar insulation. Make sure the mylar insulation is also under the clip which prevents grounding the coil. All this must be done before inserting the coils in the plate. After the coils with clips are securely inserted into the plate, turn the plate upside down and insert magnets by gluing directly to copper coils. Part #49 represents twenty-four 1/8-inch holes needed to bring each coil wire from the bottom of the plate to the top of the plate. This wire spacing results in an orderly method for arranging the coil connections. After the wires are soldered to the commutator using care not to use magnetic solder, insulation plate #53 is secured to the armature top to firmly hold the winding connections and to prevent vibration of the wires. Let us now concern ourselves with the Armature Connection. The particular connections used between the armature coils and the coils to the commutator are such that the necessary random charging of the coils takes place without any interference. Viewing Figure #25 we see the twenty- four coils grouped into eight groups of three coils per group. Notice coil #1 is a center coil of the group. This coil is aligned as the coil centered to the mica insulation that is between commutator bar #1 and commutator bar #32. Notice the S—1 wire from the coil goes to the S—24 wire of the coil located on the right and the F—l wire goes to the F—2 wire of the coil to the left. The F—24 wire goes to the commutator bar #1 and the F—2 wire goes to the commutator bar #32. When these wires cross as shown they are insulated and do not make contact. Notice bar #1 has a jumper wire to bar #2 and bar #32 has a jumper wire to bar #31. It would be wisdom to review what has just been said so that you might retain as we go on with further explanation. These jumper wires are"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"102 simply to use a standard 32-bar commutator instead of the needed sixteen-bar commutator which is not a standard purchased item. The jumpers therefore change the 32 bars into a sixteen bar commutator. As this group of coils turns counter—clockwise the first brush removal location will be two and one—half bars counter—clockwise shown as a dotted rectangle. When the armature turns counter—clockwise, commutator bar #31 contacts this brush. Notice bar #30 will also be under the same brush when the contact takes place. If the coil group of #1, 2 and 24 has a random charge heavier than coil group 21, 22 and 23, the power will transfer at this brush contact to not only flow out of the unit at the brush but somewhat balance into the group having the lesser charge thus preventing the random charging from being a flow control problem. This wire crossing connection serves two important needs. First, it brings the proper polarities under the brush preventing sparking, and secondly, it assists in switching coil polarities. When commutator bars 32 and 1 come under this same brush the brush will momentarily cause a closed circuit to take place, because the brush will serve as a contact short circuit for just the travel distance of one—half the width of the brush. This action then causes an induction charge to momentarily build-up in this group which is similar to a bar wound rotor, thus momentarily giving a driving kick to the armature plate. As soon as bar 32 advances past this brush and only bar 1 is under the brush, this coil group again becomes a source of generated power by having current flow out of the coils through the brush. There are eight separate locations where the current flow is reversed. If eight brush stations were used, the speed would be for an eight pole or less than 900 r.p.m., and that is important to note. There are however only six brush stations and the pulse of eight polarity reversals happening simultaneously are impossible since the brushes trigger the pulse. The r.p.m. therefore is controlled by the six allowed pulses per revolution or somewhat the speed of a six pole and an eight pole unit combined which is slightly over 900 r.p.m. A comment about the statement of random energy charge should be made. The even flow of energy leaving the Transmuter would tend to show the energy being produced is flowing evenly and therefore this unit does not produce random bursts of power. The energy here is called random energy only because the coils' charging sequence is not a one—two—three confined pattern, but a selection of coil charges that pulse in a pattern as needed while repeating in a random sequence. We will now take a look at the commutator jumpers that balance a random charge. The jumper wires previously mentioned, which convert a thirty—two bar commutator to sixteen bars will not be needed when sixteen bar units are ordered. However, jumper wires are needed to complete circuits between groups of coils which will allow the generated power to be removed from the six brushes without any single brush at any given time carrying more than any other brush no mater what coil groups are generating at any given time. There are eight jumper wires required and they all connect to only the finish point wires from all eight groups. The first jumper wires go from bar #2 to bar #10. Notice the connection skips three sets of bars. The bar selection of #2 and #10 is made because these bars already have one wire secured to each which allows the jumper wires to fit the commutator slot without the need to compact four wires into one slot. This condition would have been the case if bars #1 and #9 were selected which would accomplish the same jumpering results. The next jumpered bars are bar #10 to #18 and then #18 to #26 and then #26 back to the start bar #2. This completes a set of four groups. The next set of groups are #30 to #6, #6 to #14, #14 to #22, then #22 back to start #30. Notice these two sets of four groups each are not joined by jumpers. If they were, then the pulse would always be an eight pole. Using this jumper arrangement, the brushes trigger six poles, then the connection arrangement slows the speed increase by pulsing the induction of eight coils per group to prevent the acceleration to a six pole speed. The constant speed adjustment results causing the needed 910 r.p.m."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"103 ARMATURE PLATE MOUNTING Earlier in this disclosure a statement was made that the magnetic charge is built up in the armature coils and gives a slight rise and fall movement to the armature plate. This magnetic action is caused in part by the continuous speed adjustment between the six and eight pole speed changing as was outlined during the armature connection disclosure. This up and down movement of the armature plate is magnified by the manner in which the armature plate is secured to the armature hub. Located on the top of the armature hub, on one side only, is a piece of nonmetallic shim stock #45. When installed, this shim stock will cause the outer rim of the armature plate to measure .110 higher angle than is normal. As the armature rotates, this higher side goes around with the corresponding low side, 180 degrees away, thus giving the impression of a thicker armature plate when rotating at 900 r.p.m. This vibrating movement to the Armature plate serves several important functions. It assists in the attract/release magnetic activity between the plastic and permanent magnets. It also helps the armature coils to retain and release the needed magnetism. There is also a needed movement that takes place which helps the unit maintain the ratio of revolutions to the speed of the generating force by causing the weights to respond quickly to the centrifugal force. As the armature plate takes its course of action, note that it is firm]y bolted to the armature hub which carries the weights around. A sleeve bearing in this hub gives it some lateral free movement of .100 as it rotates. This course of action of the armature plate is somewhat transferred to the hub and weight assembly which necessitates a strong focus when reading the disclosure on the lower drive connector assembly which follows. CONSTRUCTION OF THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE CONNECTOR ASSEMBLY As we have seen there is a need for the ratio of the revolution to continuously compensate to the speed of the generating force. Let us review the mechanical device which accomplishes this. Notice in Figure 23 that weights raise and lower by centrifugal force which starts and stops the lower drive assembly. Standard electric motors use centrifugal force to connect and disconnect the start windings by raising and lowering weights which gently make and break electrical contacts. There is a vast difference between the workings of a standard motor and this Transmuter and so there is also a vast difference between this gentle touching of contacts and the sharp power push which is needed to drive the weights into the graphite packing to turn the lower gear structure. Also this power push has to be accomplished within a diminished amount of speed change because of the close proximity between the high and low speed requirements to the armature. This connector design is now explained in greater detail. Weights have weight and to attain the necessary contact which would cause this lower graphite bowl to turn by using heavier weights would merely serve to add an unwanted load to the Armature. The object is to attain a maximum amount of a sharp downward action with a minimum amount of ounces to each weight. This action is accomplished first of all by allowing the weights free travel before being constricted by a flat spring attached to each weight. The up and down vibration to the armature hub caused by a specific mounting procedure produces a balance in the weight so as to modulate the action. The governing factor then becomes an increase or decrease of r.p.m. within the allowed speed limits of the armature. Notice the mounting procedure holding the flat springs. See Figure 23. Each spring is bolted to the lead edge of each weight. The spring has its tail section free to slide approximately 1/8 inch up and down in a slot out in the bottom of the armature hub. Because of the mounting position of the spring, when centrifugal force causes weights to raise up, the upward travel of the weight is not restricted to a need of immediately bending the flat spring. The back of the spring moves backwards allowing the weight to rise. This free movement then gives the weight a mechanical advantage of weight in movement before it needs to bend the spring. When the"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"104 spring bends, the pin secured to the spring contacts the weight. This causes a downward push that will be manifest the instant centrifugal force is lessened by a drop in r.p.m.’s. This method of storing downward power capitalizes on free travel of the weight which bent the spring and transferred the spring’s energy into a leverage contact point on the weight as shown in Figure #23. It is important to note that the downward push to weight will cause weight to hit graphite with some force. Note that as speed increases a bending of springs occurs. This spring bending action is controlled not just by allowed r.p.m., but according to tension of springs. The contact between the weight and the graphite does not produce and has no need of a firm holding action. When the Transmuter is operating under full load, the lower unit never completely stops and the sharp downward contact to graphite gives all the driving power needed to keep proper turning speed for the lower wire ropes and stop gauges. There are 6 weights, each weighing 1—5/8 ounces. This total weight when added to the six springs which have a bending force of approximately 14 ounces each, accumulates to the necessary force for contacting the graphite which then drives the lower unit. OUTER ALUMINUM WALL The outer Aluminum Wall, Part #2, as disclosed previously is an outer housing, 8 inches high and 15 and 3/8 inches in diameter. This part is made of .030 thick aluminum and is rolled and fitted as shown. This part however is not totally adequate at this point to change the particle activity which takes place within the Transmuter wall. It is necessary to coat the outside of this part with TiAlCo—B metal in order to achieve this. Let’s discuss the purpose of the coating. The bombastic activity that takes place within the main Transmuter housing does not complete the magnetic activity being generated. A second area where particle exchange takes place is within the wall area between the inner wall and the outer wall. The outer wall #2 is coated on the outside surface with TiAlCo—B metal, which absorbs and utilizes the particles to create a thermos bottle effect to the inner Transmuter preventing any unwanted particle escape. TiAlCo—B metal used welcomes magnetism, thus this wall begins to absorb particles and utilizes them as a magnetic force field. Particles enter the air space between the inner and outer wall from a slot cut in the nine inch chimney frame and travel in a counter clockwise direction (looking at it from the top), and then enter the main Transmuter body through a similar slot cut approximately 180 degrees away on the opposite side of the same nine inch chimney frame. The particles enter the nine-inch chimney, are then siphoned into this slot, and circulate between the walls. They are exchanged with particles already in this area, that entered this same space by coming through the inner wall and from the top in that the plexiglass ring does not hinder the entrance of particles. When these particles enter the Transmuter through the opposite slot, as they join in the magnetic pulse stream, they serve to produce a stronger magnetic pulse. The outer wall builds an attract field which completes a magnetic pole. Without coating this outer wall the magnetic pale circuit would be incomplete and the Transmuter would not function. BRASS PARTICLE DISTRIBUTOR The pressure that is built—up inside the Transmuter is a necessary one, and is controlled by a brass fitting that is called a particle equalizer which is mounted inside on the center post. This fitting Part #58 is located not closer than two inches from the under side of the TiAlCo—B dome. This distance allows the particles to maintain a flow without the hazard of an over production of particles which would then create an unwanted heat factor. FINAL ITEMS NEEDING COMMENTS BEFORE START-UP The 22-inch brass rain cover above the chimney should be finished to a dull brush finish and not be reflective. The dome on the Transmuter should also have a dull brush finish. The brass"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"105 extension ring Part #6 should be knurled on the inside surface with the same knurling finish as Part #1. CLEANING BRUSH There is a carbon brush mounted to where it contacts the outer rim of the armature plate and constantly removes particles that are then put to good use. These particles travel from this brush through a coaxial cable and are fed into the magnetic current driven motors. This cleaning brush has an insulated jacket to prevent the charge from going into wall #1 which holds the brush. The cleaning brush (Part #61) has a coaxial cable attached to it and this brush must be connected with a coaxial cable to a brush that is in contact with the TiAlCo—B rotor that is magnetically driven. The coaxial cable’s metal must be connected with a flexible metal line directly into the brush itself. The unit is now ready for start-up. TRANSMUTER START-UP PROCEDURE Reviewing Figure 16 which shows a full size side view of the unit, notice that part #29 is a short shaft with a bored splined hole slightly protruding out the bottom of the Transmuter. A mating splined tool is inserted into this hole for driving purposes. After start—up this tool is pulled free allowing the unit to run on its own power. The starting procedure is as follows: The unit is geared to 300 r.p.m. and allowed to build-up the needed molecules for approximately 10 to 20 minutes. The determined time will be established by a sound change that occurs as the molecules begin to line up. After turning the unit for approximately 10 to 20 minutes, the build—up of the molecules has a contact point in a copper screen, .040 thick, 12 inches in diameter, which is insulated from the bottom plate with .030 Mica insulation, which prevents the built—up magnetism from being dissipated. The speed is now slowly increased to 600 r.p.m. and is maintained for approximately 12 to 20 minutes. The molecule build-up is now beginning to flow toward the inner wall but not lost because of the TiAlCo-B coating on the outer wall. Finally the unit is driven to its final speed increment of 910 r.p.m. Running at this speed the stop gauges are not driven because the weights are moved upward. This achieves the full pulse rate of 182 pulses per 4.8 to 5.0 seconds. The particles arc now being drawn in at a full rate which introduces a bombastic effect which in turn creates another, and another and so on. The Transmuter will now run with the power of its own magnetic energy allowing the start—up tool to be removed. When the unit is running, the generated power will leave the Transmuter through six coaxial cables, one from each brush station, which is the way the power is transmuted for use. The reason for the use of coaxial cables as opposed to standard motor lead wire is because the energy being removed is magnetic energy and it therefore will not grab a standard motor insulated wire. Because we are limited by statements and phraseology that have always been applied to electrical generators, we use the same here as an expedient. This limitation has stopped knowledge of the full potential of magnetic current. For example, the armature was insulated for 900 volts. The insulation used should be measured as though it were going to be insulated for what we know as 900 volts. This is the ideal spacing but no volts will be registered. Because no volts will be evident at the brushes there is no line pressure to force the magnetic energy out of the Transmuter. The energy being generated is neutral magnetic energy and the only way it leaves the Transmuter is by being offered a set polarity. The stronger the attract force being offered the greater will be the flow of neutral magnetic current leaving the Transmuter. We see therefore that there is no reverse flow as in a standard generator and the switching of polarities must be accomplished within the magnetic motor itself. The neutral flowing magnetic current does not manifest as a magnetic force field until it is forced to jump an air gap enroute to the"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"106 attract field. An important benefit to this method of energy removal is that the earth or ground is not an attract field, and the motors using this new energy do not need insulation to prevent grounding. Under full load, this unit as disclosed will produce the equivalent of 7200 watts of continuous power. Motors being driven by this magnetic flowing current need no copper coils to build-up electromagnetic fields because this flowing current turns into varying magnetic fields by simply giving this energy a place to manifest as a giant magnet. The metal TiAlCo—B, is ideal for this purpose because it welcomes magnetism. The main principle therefore of new motors using magnetic current is to capitalize on magnetic energy directly. The working process of the machine is based upon a nuclear reaction taking place between differing molecules. When arranged and rearranged they produce a system that works in a compatible formula with the design of magnetic energy of the earth’s atmosphere which extends to and including the rim that encompasses the earth. All things working together create a harmonious flow of magnetism heretofore untapped. The acceleration of the nuclear subatomic parts creates a structure of mobility for other structures whereby they can be contained and utilized once they are harnessed in a proper manner. Thereby we see that nuclear energy has a structural balance. The magnetic field is not unlike this same structure. For years scientists have thought that to harness magnetism, magnetic embodiment in a particular element was necessary, but time will soon show that there are magnetisms in the atmosphere that have only been minutely touched. It is not the creative force of the universe that is lacking, but our limited knowledge that has yet to further this science. So it is that structural polarities exist in all things and in all differing measures. Concerning metals, this is one of the reasons why when they melt, some adhere and others escape but still add to the final product which thus creates varying degrees of tensil strength. It is not so much the purity level that strengthens but the manner in which things are melted in order of chemical importance and degrees. TiAlCo-B metal utilizes these principles and more as you'll see when you learn more about it. The Celestial Particle Transmuter will lead to discoveries and developments that even science fiction has yet to explore."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"107 MAGNETIC MOTOR • Unit produces 10 HP • Runs on magnetic current provided by the Celestial Particle Transmuter • Capable of being constructed in various sizes for greater output • Suggested use: household and industrial, example - this motor can drive the fan required for the Magnetic Heating Unit • Requires special alloy • Requires mechanical startup ABSTRACT This motor is a magnetic device that incorporates the use of rotors to generate physical power, which is another form of magnetic energy.

PRINCIPLE BEHIND THIS NEW ENERGY SOURCE This motor attracts the flowing magnetic energy from the Transmuter (coming from the coaxial cable) into it's rotor and sets up a response from wing to wing which completes a circuit between two stationary copper rings. In turn this completed circuit becomes the driving force to turn the structure. It is an important fact worth noting that the principle here is to show the relationship between magnetic energy as opposed to electrical current, when captivated in a particular structure. This energy form will produce the same driving force as electrical current when applied to the proper structure. This opens unlimited possibilities for the manner in which this structure can be used. This unit does not have the problems typically associated with electrical current, such as overheating, motor weight due to the use of iron, the cost of electricity, the danger of motor fires, etc To capitalize on this untapped power source - a motor design is herein used that departs from standard electric motor designs.

This view shows a brass shaft turning in two aluminum housings. Secured to this"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"110 shaft is a Hub #44, Collar #6, Snap Ring #14 and six Trip Shafts - 1/8\" thick extending 13/16\" away from the Shaft. These pins are located on the Shaft as shown, in order to lift Arm #10 differing amounts. The Shafts closer to Pin #11 will lift the end of Arm #10 slightly higher than the Shafts further away because of the changing leverage distance. As this movement is further defined, the reason for this variable lifting to Arm #10 will become evident. The electrodes #46-61 on the rotor need to be fed magnetic power in a very specific manner which can only be accomplished by camming Power-electrodes toward the 16 Rotor Electrodes and then quickly pulling the Power- electrode away. As a result a pulse spans an air gap between the vertical Power-electrodes and the Rotary Electrodes. It is important to view Figure 1 closely in order to grasp the close proximity between the two Copper Rings #91 and #88. The focal point for the driving power of this rotor is the Magnets located in the Rotor Wings. These are centered between the Copper Rings. This view is very helpful in gaining an understanding of the magnetic activity that takes place. As we review the Trip Pins we first see that the 6 Pins #8 are secured to Shaft #5 in two separate circular planes of three Pins each, 120 degrees apart. Using an imaginary center line we see the pins in one row are 3/8\" in distance from the others. As the Pins turn, they arrive at Arm #10 at 60 degrees apart. The single camming sequence is as follows: Arm #10, which has its tripping portion on the high point of Part #9 is being lifted by a Camming Pin at the closer point to Pivot Shaft #11. This action lifts the 1/4\" brass shaft out of its 1/8\" deep half-round holding slot and causes Arm #10 to pivot on Shaft #11. Shaft #11 is supported by Part #13 which is being held from moving backwards by Snap Ring #14, therefore Arm #10 moves downward on the opposite end which has a Fork Extension #12. The Fork Extension pushes against a tapered portion of Cam #18 and causes the Cam to move back toward Housing #3 at a .018 distance. During this backward movement Cam #18 compresses 3 Compression Springs #17. After this backward movement, Cam #18 contacts brake material #7 which is secured to Collar #6. Since this Collar is secured to the Shaft, Cam #18 is immediately driven in the direction of the shaft rotation for 30 degrees. As this Cam moves, Cam-follower-bearing #32 which was at a low point of the Cam becomes raised 3/8\" carrying Arm #31 away from Shaft #5. Arm #31 which is firmly secured to Cross Bar #22 then moves this Cross Bar 3/8\" away from Shaft #5. This action closed the gap between the electrodes on Bar #22 and the Rotor Electrodes, thus a charge of magnetic current is transferred across the remaining .015 air gap. When Cam #18 advanced 30 degrees, the 2 Rotor Electrodes were charged. By being allowed the travel amount of 30 degrees which was governed by machined slots within the Cam, the cam was allowed to swing on three 3/8\" shafts protruding from Cam #15. Before the Cam actually moved the full 30 degrees, it compressed three Compression Springs that are carried inside it which are located at the end of the slots. Before the actual 30 degree movement can be manifest a slowing of the cams’ forward movement happened by compressing the springs against Shaft #16. Now Cam #18 is against Shaft #16 and the forward driving power of #18 is ready to advance Cam #15. At this point note that Cam #18 has activated one stroke of the Cross Bar charging the two Rotor Electrodes. Next, Shafts #16 are pushed forward and they cause Cam #15 to move in the direction of a 30 degree rotation. During this electrode lifting action for Cam #15 which is now traveling in the direction of the rotating shaft, Cam #18 remains extended in its forward slot position because it is still contacting the Brake Material #7. Now another electrode lifting cycle is completed during the forward travel time of Cam #15 which is a 30 degree forward movement. Note at this particular time, the instant the Arm #10 is stopped in the next slot which is 30 degrees away, Cam #18 already has done twice as much electrode lifting work as Cam #15. To maintain this forward driving action for Cam #18, Arm #10 must be held in the ‘up position which then maintains pressure against Springs #17. This is done by"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"111 having the arm slide on the high section of Stationary Ring #9. The moment Arm #10 goes down into the next slot and pressure is released between Cam #18 and Brake Material #7, Cam #18 instantly goes backwards 15 degrees. This is due to Compression Springs #20 between Shafts #16 and the trail end of Slots #19 which are compressed and free to push Cam #18 backwards. The backward movement is limited to 15 degrees because this is the distance the Compression Springs are allowed to push, which is determined by their length and tension. Since the forward travel of Cam #18 stopped 15 degrees over the top of a Cam Lobe, this 15 degrees of backward movement sends its Cam-follower-bearing to the top of a lobe and again Cam #18 pulses a set of electrodes. As a result, the inside Cam does 3 electrode movements to one movement of outside Cam #15. Note then that a total of 4 electrode strokes happen in only 30 degrees of travel of Arm #10. As the following cam tripping movement is revealed it shows that the pulsing is controlled and eliminates the possibility of supplying more pulses than needed. PULSES FOR SPEED CONTROL The camming system just described is a mechanism that produces the necessary requirements which achieve the end result so when in action it has a stop gauge effect on the productive magnetic system. The rotor design has a configuration which counteracts the air speed during the sequenced joining together of the electrodes as they are held in a positional attract state. This prevents the motor from going faster than the estimated 1600 r.p.m.’s. When a load is applied to the shaft and the rotor speed is reduced, the air load in turn is reduced, thus allowing the inflowing magnetic power to be utilized with less restriction. The camming system increases its strokes as the load increases. The following camming explanation will show how the volume of flowing magnetic current to the unit is constantly being adjusted in accordance with the speed. The action is now explained with the motor in a stop position and power on the four electrodes which are waiting to charge the rotor. The shaft is now positioned where Pin A is under Arm #10. Pin A is holding Arm #10 slightly above Part #9 and a push of the Shaft begins a pulse that causes the unit to begin rotating. Pin A located on the closer row to the Pivot Shaft #11 lifts Arm #10 and passes on by. This action causes 4 cam actions or 8 pulses to happen as explained. Next, Pin B located in the row closer to Part #9 which arrives at Arm #10 just as it goes into the next slot 30 degrees away and again 4 cam actions happen or 8 magnetic pulses take place. The Shaft has now turned 60 degrees and 16 pulses have already happened. At this point, a quick acceleration of the motor speed occurs and an overflow of pulsing no longer takes place. The pulsing will now adjust to the needed amount per turn depending on the load. When the unit is running at full speed the 6 Trip Pins are no longer utilized in a 1,2,3 pattern but are skipped as needed, depending on the speed of the shaft. Now when Pin A lifts Arm #10 above Part #9, it lifts the Arm not only free of Part #9 but actually higher than the needed distance for allowing the advance. This higher amount is caused by the arm extension which telescopes approximately 3/4\" from the point of contact between Arm #10 and Pin A. This brief moment of lifting allows Pin B to pass under Arm #10, not contacting it. Arm #10 then remains stopped without electrode lifting because the Cross Bars are spring held together keeping the Cam Bearing on the low points of the cams. When Trip Pin B passed under, the main shaft advanced 60 degrees. The next Trip Pin C passes under with no contact to Arm #10. Next Trip Pin D will again raise up Arm #10 which is a Pin located 180 degrees away from starting Pin A. When pins speed on past, there is a lessening of the pulses which happens until finally at high speed a maximum of 3 stoppings to the Arm results per revolution of the Shaft which is 4 more strokes than needed. When the unit pulses, these 4 extra strokes are then used. We must take into consideration the air build-up"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"112 that is lost during acceleration. This pulsing, when operating at a minimal speed has the potential of 12 stopping stations per revolution of the Cam. This potential attains the proper one pulse per wire per 360 degree turning of the Shaft which then utilizes the 4 additional pulses before a full momentum is generated. Arm #10 is lifted higher when Pin A is the contacting pin and the Arm has less lift when the contacting Pin is Pin B. Whichever pin should happen to do the lifting there is a dependency on the speed of the Shaft. When the speed is increased, a Pin that would normally be used slips on by. If a load attempts to slow the speed of the Shaft, the magnetic power is instantly increased allowing more magnetism which converts into magnetic energy which completes the work. As the Pin A lifts Arm #10, not only does the magnetic current adjust to the load but the action also supplies the needed accommodation for a pulse pattern existing between each individual pulse stroke. In the mechanical action there is a time sequence that produces the needed magnetic pulsing. As the first pulse is manifested by Cam #18 which advanced forward independently, a given time period elapses before the next pulse happens. The increment of time that is produced results in a longer span than between the next 2 pulses. When Cam #18 pulls Cam #15 forward, both move their electrodes upward with a little time differential between them. Next, the reverse action of Cam #18 produces only a minute difference in the increment of time than the first pulse in order to reverse mass in motion. This cycle is now finalized by the cam being returned. We now have a time variation as to when this cam sequence will again occur which is dependent on the speed of the motor. This pattern of irregular timing intervals repeats. We see in all of this that this mechanical action provides the necessary movement which in turn produces the magnetic pulsing needed to drive the rotor. ROTOR CONFIGURATION The rotor configuration being disclosed serves distinctly different purposes. The primary reason for this particular rotor shape is that it affords a push-pull magnetic driving action in relationship to the stationary copper rings. A further reason for this particular shape is to provide a back-up air pressure to the driving magnetic power which then helps the pulsing circuit to maintain an estimated 1600 r.p.m.s. The design of the wings causes the magnetic energy to complete a circuit by using a wing to wing response which in turn incorporates the stationary copper rings. This wing to wing response is aided by a series of magnets that are embedded and circuited in the individual wings. The magnetic activity generated in the wing magnets becomes a determining factor in how the inflowing magnetic energy will be used. Let us closely examine the magnets and their mounting procedure. In order to clarify our thinking, a comparison is being made between magnets in a standard D.C. motor and this unit. Permanent magnets in the stator of a D.C. motor are constantly manifesting their magnetic power and the response is always between them and a set-up magnetic field in the rotating part or armature. If the armature also had permanent magnets a problem of stopping their magnetic power would be quickly evident because of the attract locking hold that would take place. However, this motor requires a set-up of a magnetic field which is then dissipated in an on-off format which sets up a continuing magnetic pole response. The need to dissipate the magnetic field thus eliminates the use of permanent magnets because of the magnetic resistance that would occur. In considering the magnetic material needed it is important that the material be one that can sustain a magnetic field and yet yield it at the proper time. This release timing is of utmost importance because without the proper sustaining and release, the whole pulsing system would be uncontrolled. Pulsing determines the amount of input of the magnetic energy which then establishes the outlay of the magnetic current or flow coming from the Mother Unit. This release timing element goes on to affect all facets of the operation."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"113 The following list includes parts and facts pertaining to them which all contribute to the timing sequence. #1 - size of each Magnet #2 - number of Magnets in each Wing #3 - particular placement of each Magnet Set #4 - molecular structure of the Metal Magnet Material #5 - amount of magnetic charge initially put into each Magnet #6 - coating of the surface of each Magnet #7 - insulation between each Magnet #8- material holding the Magnets #9 - mounting direction of each Magnet Stack #10 - size of the wire secured to each side of the Magnet Stack #11 - air space around each Magnet #12 - distance apart one Magnet Set is from the other #13 - number of Rotor Wings #14 - pulsing sequence for the Metal Magnets charge #15 - volume of magnetic energy pulsed into the Metal Magnets during each pulse #16 - pulsed sequence between all eight Wings #17 - placement of stationary Rings #19 - composition of Stationary Rings #20 - wing angle when mounted to the Hub #21 - Wing Thickness #22 - Wing configuration #23 - molecular structure of the Rotor Assembly #24 - placement of the 16 Electrodes in the Rotor #25 - wiring procedure for connecting the Wing Wires to the Electrodes #26 - bonding procedure for securing the Wires to the Wings #27 - method for bringing the power into the Unit #28 - method for building up a magnetic charge #29 - method for camming four power Electrodes in their proper timing sequence to activate the rotating Rotor Electrodes. ROTOR CONSTRUCTION This rotor is made by pouring a blend of known metals into a suitable mold which then forms a one piece cast Rotor Hub with eight Rotor Wings. This particular blend of known metals is used in this casting because of the molecular structures within the metal which is not achieved in other metal blends. This metal is known as TiAlCO—B, which has the fortitude of steel without the weight and can sustain high heat without disruptive seaming. We therefore have no concern that the wing structure is only a thickness of 1/8 inch. This blend of metals also has the unique quality of becoming a magnetic field when a magnet is located in it, and is conducive to receiving and distributing magnetic energy or responding to it. A simplified statement could be that this metal welcomes magnetism. Viewing Figure 2 shows eight Rotor Wings, each with a set of five metal Magnets located in them. The metal composition used to construct these Magnets is a strong aircraft type aluminum called Alminal W16, (Alminal W16 — M—1273, M—2174; 3 Cu, 4 Mg, 0.6 Si, 0.6 Fe, 1 Mn, 0.2 It, 4.0—8.5 Zn, Bal Al. WP—temper: 78,000 — 85,000 TS; 67,000 - 74,000 YS; 5-4 El. For structural members; age—hardened, high strength). One important reason for the use of this metal Alminal"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"114 W16 is it is compatible to the blend of metals being used in the wing structure. The Alminal W16 metal needs to be magnetically charged in a particular manner to attain the needed response. This metal is first anodized on one side before the metal is charged with D.C. current which then turns it into a magnet. This new magnet will manifest only a modest amount of flux power because the percentage of the ferrite metal is only 0.6 percent. The flux power strength must be minimal to get the necessary response so as to eliminate magnetic resistance. In this particular application magnetic strength is not a major factor. It is simply a catalytic action at the outset. The anodized side of the Alminal W16 is charged north and the opposite side is charged south. Since the magnets are cut from an anodized sheet the edges of these metal magnets remain unanodized. This is very important because when the magnets are half-lapped as shown in Figure 3 the magnetic flow takes a different path circuit on the north anodized side than on the south unanodized side. Viewing Figure 4 which is an isometric view of the rotor, it can clearly be shown how the north magnets of all eight wings face the south magnets of the eight wings. In other words, an unanodized side faces an anodized side. By having the one surface anodized it causes a magnetic path between rotor blades to build up in a powerful attract force. This same magnetic path would not be manifest if the metal were not anodized. A secondary reason for anodizing is that the structural polarities having to do with the anodized side cannot be depleted because the anodizing process penetrates a portion of the metal. The result is that you have an ongoing closed circuit. WIRE SIZE USED BETWEEN ROTOR ELECTRODES AND THE WING MAGNETS Figure 3 shows a cut-away view of a wing with the magnet mounting procedure. The center of this magnet stack is 6½ inches from the center of the rotor shaft #5. Point A is a lip of a wing .007½ thick, milled inward to .040 to contain the magnets and wires. The window frame construction completely surrounds the anodized magnets. Location B is a milled wing slot at the exit point of the window which secures the window wires leading to the electrodes. These wires are secured on the front as well as the rear of the wing. Looking at the rectangular shape of the window, it is important to note that the surrounding wire before entering slot B should not complete a closed design but should retain an end opening of 1/16 inch. This wire exiting position is important because it puts the proper amount space between the wires that are mounted on of the front and rear of the wing. As stated previously the release timing in magnets vary according to the strength of the set-up magnetic field. When the .015 thick magnet wire is bonded on the front and rear of each rotor wing the amount of power that flows is determined by the receptivity of the particular wire toward magnetism and the thickness of this wire will vary according to each application (such as another type of mechanism). MAGNETIC POWER AND ITS TRAVEL Looking at the subject of magnetic travel we see that it has a neutral charge but the 16 electrodes in the rotor all have a set charge of north and south. As we look at the 8 wires wrapped around the north side which is anodized, we see a charge that travels from the magnets through the wire back to the electrodes. Spaced between these north electrodes are 8 south electrodes, which continue a pattern of magnetic feedback to their respective electrode. The inflowing neutral magnetic current is offered to any of these electrodes by means of the 4 camming power lines. The current is then attracted to the electrodes in their turn and the incoming magnetic current takes on an established polarity. The instant it crosses over to the rotor electrode, it becomes like the electrode it contacts, and then the power flow is reversed. This reversal occurs when the incoming magnetic power travels from the electrodes through the wire manifesting itself as it travels along its"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"115 length and moves on attract into the wing. The finalization of this travel circuit is completed as it circles the Alminal magnets. At the completion of this process the magnetic power manifests briefly as if it were a powerful giant magnet, and responds to the copper ring pulling the rotor for rotation. It is at this point that a critically important magnetic action takes place. After the magnetic material sustains its field, it must dissipate at the proper time, which then allows the magnetic energy to respond in a reverse action as it travels along the same wire back to the electrode where it originally started. When it first started the strength of the electrode charge was only equal to that power which the magnet was sustaining at that time. But now with a build-up of additional power, the beginning charge has been greatly increased. This reversal of magnetism needs a time span to properly attain its function of full power to achieve its full power load which is why the power electrodes are quickly pulled away from the rotor electrodes after the charge transfers. With this quick returning action there also comes a time delay before the next pulse is needed to trigger to this same electrode. The cam-follower-bearings are quickly pulled to the low point of the cam which then limits the dwell time at the high point. Cross Bars 22 and 33 have leaf springs mounted on the ends which cause these two bars to always move toward each other after stroke movement takes place. The charge volume is also controlled by the air gap distance of .015 which actually helps to enhance the magnetic polarities. The arrangement of the metal magnets in the wings is of the greatest importance for proper pulse action and it is for this reason that every mounting detail is next carefully itemized. METAL MAGNET ARRANGEMENT Looking at position D we see the five .030 thick Alminal magnets half-lapped, having four pieces of .010 thick Mylar measuring 3/16 inches wide by 7/8 inches long, sandwiched between the magnets. The magnet polarity is north-face up on the front, and south-face on the rear and the same process of lapping is used both front and rear. Five individual north faces comprise the front attract polarity and the rear has the reverse polarity facing downward. The reason for the separation of the five magnets is that it allows each one to individually pull and discharge the magnetic power which enhances the smoothness of the flow between the magnet and ring. Explanation of slot size: The wing is .125 thick. The needed outer window size on the wing is 7/8\" by 1 inch. Top-to-bottom spacing is as follows: .060 of room is required at the center of the slot to accommodate the thickness of two Alminal magnets, plus .010 for the mylar which is between the magnets. A .015 thick wire fits above the magnets on the top and .015 thick wire fits below the magnets on the bottom. This total distance then is .100. This leaves a remaining .025 wing material equally sharing a ledge of .012 1/2 above and .012 1/2 below equaling .125. The magnets are cut 3/8\" wide by 15/16\" long, therefore the inner width dimension of the window frame needs to be 15/16 inches. The magnets are glued together half-lap, forming a stack 1-1/8\" total length, with the inner window frame size being 1-1/8 inches. Using these dimensions when the magnets are installed in the wings one will see a magnet size of 7/8\" by 1 inch, with the remaining magnet portion hidden under the holding ledge. Notice that the angle of the magnet stack is such that the lead edge in the direction of rotation, (see arrow), is centered on the stationary copper rings 88 and 91. See Figure 2. One reason for the mounting of the magnets at this particular angle is because the five individual metal magnets can be mounted in the curved window frame without the need to bend the individual magnets. The mounting of the magnets at this angle is also important because the built-up charge in the wing can then travel along the wing to the wing tip which generates the needed magnetic flow. THE CIRCUIT FOR THE INCOMING MAGNETIC POWER"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"116 Viewing Figure 2 shows electrode #24 in an alignment with one of the 16 electrodes mounted in the Hub which is Electrode #48. Power is now being attracted into Electrode #48 by jumping across an air gap of .015 from power electrode #24. This electrode is now giving up the magnetic charge that was stored in material #23 because the silver electrode #24 is screwed directly into this material. The power came into this material from coaxial cable #26 which is secured to Brush #25. This brush is spring held in a standard brush holder keeping light contact between #25 and #23. As this charge of magnetic energy goes into Electrode #48 it travels 90 degrees back against the rotation to the rear of wing #83 as shown, because a wire .015 thick is secured to Electrode #48 and is held to the Hub with insulation tubing until it arrives at wing #83. The wire is then stripped of insulation and secured directly to the rear of the wing. A very light scoring of the wing is done to form a holding slot which then prevents the wire from vibrating free during normal running. This wire then goes around the five half-lapped magnets making direct contact with them. The rectangular loop that is formed by the wire is not a completed loop making contact with the original incoming wire. The result then of this circuit is that a magnetic charge is now on the rear side of wing #83. At the same moment electrode #28 is feeding magnetic power into moving electrode #52. This power is coming in on Coaxial Cable #30. Electrode #52 has a wire connected to it that travels 90 degrees back against the direction of rotation and goes to the rear of wing #65. We see therefore that 2 wings, 65 and 83 are now charged. The next wings to be charged will be charged in a very particular wing charging sequence. The wings getting charged will always be 90 degrees apart and the charging happening only in groups of two. A start sequence for example could be as follows. Wire 66 on the front of wing 65 will get charged on its front wire. The mating wire that gets charged will be on wing 71, front wire 72. For ease of seeing the pulsed sequence, the wire charging sequence is marked alphabetically. Therefore these two wires are both called A when viewing Figure 2. The charge will then go to wing 77, rear wire 79 and wing 83, rear wire 85, both marked B. Next the charge goes to wing 62, rear wire 64 and wing 68, rear wire 70, both marked C. The charge next goes to wing 74, front wire 75 and wing 80, front wire 81, both marked D. The charge next goes to wing 65, rear wire 67 and wing 71, rear wire 73, both marked E. The charge next goes to wing 77, front wire 78 and wing 83, front wire 84, both marked F. Charge next goes to wing 62, front wire 63 and wing 68, front wire 69, both marked G. And finally charge goes to wing 74, rear wire 76 and wing 80, rear wire 82, both marked H. This arrangement of back and forth charging in different wing combinations is not always accomplished by having either the top set of electrodes on Bar #22 or the bottom set of electrodes on 33 charging the rotors. These electrodes are used together but are also used in combinations. When a time lapse happens, as for example, after the forward movement of cam #18, the cross bar #33 will use its two electrodes to charge the wings. However, when the next two strokes happen almost simultaneously being caused by both cams moving forward, the four electrodes are pushed together to the rotor electrodes which then discharge their magnetic power at exactly 90 degrees apart. It is at this point that combination charging happens between electrodes located on one bar with electrodes from the opposite bar. For example when the start sequence happens at wire 66 on the top of wing 65 and its mating wire 72 on wing 71, they might not align with two electrodes on one or the other cross bars but rather they might align with an electrode on one bar with an electrode on the other bar. We can accept this because it is not necessary for a completed wire circuit between the two grouped wings. Each wing has its own completed circuit. The timing between the two wings is merely a needed magnetic timing response. Miniscule time shortages should they occur would have no effect as the pulsing would not be affected because it does not work on the principle of wire to wire feeding as in the case of a standard motor."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"117 GROUND WIRE There are five coaxial cables coming to the motor from the mother unit, which are needed to supply the power. Ground Wire #45 is connected to the cleaning brush on the Transmuter and goes directly to a brush that contacts the hub of the rotor. Particles flow from the Transmuter Armature to the rotor hub which maximizes the use of the flowing magnetic energy. This brush is insulated from the motor housing. MOTOR WEIGHT AND BENEFITS This magnetic motor has unmatched horsepower to weight ratio. This light weight feature is possible because of the elimination of iron and/or steel which is the primary weight source of standard electric motors. The objectives of this motor are many and one of them is to provide a magnetic powered motor which prevents the danger of explosion or fire, a common problem when standard electric motors burn out. Magnetism when used does not manifest itself as spark thus eliminating the hazard of fire. Since there are no motor coil windings, there is no need for special training to build the unit. This is a relatively inexpensive motor to produce and maintain once the TiAlCo-B metal is obtained. This unit can also be constructed in various sizes."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"118 MAGNETIC HEATING UNIT • Heats average home • Requires special alloy • Requires Celestial Particle Transmuter to supply power • Requires blower • Produces heat without spark • Can boil water • Demonstrates nuclear fission without harmful radiation This unit is related to the transformation of magnetic energy and certain gases directly into heat energy without the use of ignition, as we know it. This demonstration of nuclear fission without intense hear or harmful radiation will redirect our course in the exploration of nuclear energy. It is a heat-producing device that will greatly reduce atmospheric pollution and conserve energy. This device includes two spherical hollow pressure chambers that are joined together at a mixing junction at which point heat exits the device. SUMMARY OF THE UNIT This heater utilizes the blending of a light gas with a heavy gas activated by flowing magnetic current to create heat. This newly formed heat energy is created through a very particular blending of magnetized magnetic molecular structures, that when combined and mixed with air manifest as heat without ignition or spark. CONSTRUCTION DETAILS TO PRODUCE A MAGNETIC HEATER Viewing Figure 1 shows two eight inch dia. spheres with one located two inches above the other. These spheres are made of 1/8 inch thick TiAlCo-B metal; a metal that welcomes magnetism yet is NON-magnetic (meaning a magnet will not adhere to it). Each sphere is made in two halves which when assembled into an 8 inch ball, become a chamber able to hold an interior pressure. Thus the two halves are joined by compressing an 'O' ring seal. To set a required magnetic polarity to the upper sphere, this sphere is completely covered on the outside surface with one layer of 92 thousandths thick powerful plastic magnet material. This magnet material is all of the same polarity on the side contacting this upper sphere. Just for identification purposes we will say the polarity is all of a NORTH charge. Located in the center of this sphere is a 3 inch dia. copper ball, polished on the outer surface, and held in place by non-metal support rods. Through the use of a coaxial cable, a magnetic current generator sends neutral magnetic current directly to this copper ball. This cable, when passing through the 1/8 inch thick TiAlCo-B sphere, is insulated and sealed to allow the sphere to hold an interior pressure. The proper coaxial cable to use is one that has a copper coated steel wire in the center. Magnetic current will not flow properly into a solid copper wire. We need to think of the copper coating (on the steel wire) as serving the purposes of allowing the magnetic current to flow in both directions simultaneously. This upper sphere is then pressurized with about 15 pounds per square inch of a light gas which fills the sphere from the top location (see Fig. 1). This gas supply is a standard bottled gas unit."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"119 While there are several light gases one might use, one suggestion is to use a pale pink gas to charge this upper sphere. We need not be concerned that this is a gas type heater in that the gas only serves the purpose of a catalyst. The actual amount of gas being used is very minute with the magnetic current being the primary heating source of energy. When the light gas has charged this upper sphere, it is at this point that magnetic current is fed to the center copper ball. The neutral magnetic current's very nature is to seek a polarity. The gas then serves the purpose of allowing the neutral magnetic current to cross the 2-1/2 inch space distance and grab a north polarity from the 92 thousandths (.092) thick plastic magnets. The polished surface of the copper ball and the inside polished surface of the TiAlCo-B sphere cause a back and forth bouncing action for this magnetic energy flow. This activity builds into a pressure which will be released when the pressure control valve is opened (see valve on Figure 1). These newly formed combinations of particles have a NORTH charge and the light gases interior pressure is amplified by the gas susceptibility to the incoming magnetic current. The TiAlCo-B sphere is a material, which has a high magnetic permeability, which also enhances the NEEDED particle interchange process. At the same moment in time, the bottom sphere is also charged with a gaseous and magnetic current. The bottom sphere is charged with a heavy gas formed by combining two different gases. The bottom heavy gas combination needs to balance with the upper light gas, thus ultimately one must use 2/3 less heavy gas then the light gas IN VOLUME. This heavy gas might be a combination of hydrogen and a gas, which will cause the mixture to be LESS combustible. As this heavy gas combination is caused to enter this bottom sphere a bleed-off valve located at the upper part of this lower sphere, allows air to be pushed out until only heavy gas is inside this lower sphere. After gas is inside this lower sphere, the flowing magnetic current is sent into the lower 3\" copper ball. The lower sphere has the same plastic magnet covering; however, the charge facing the sphere is all a SOUTH charge. Because of this opposite polarity charge, the mixture of energy from the upper sphere, becomes a massive ATTRACT charge to the lower sphere's energy charge. To start the heating process, the valve under the upper sphere is opened, as well as the valve at the top of the bottom sphere. These magnetic molecular structures instantly join on attract inside a short mixing chamber. At this moment, NO heating has taken place. Next, an air blower is activated which pulls these blended particles out of the mixing chamber and causes them to be mixed with air. The instant air is added it causes a nuclear chain-reaction, which spreads through these blended magnetic molecular structures causing a release of energy in the form of heat. The amount of air is controlled so as to become a temperature adjustment tool. For example, to send the flow into a home heating duct system a certain air volume is required; however, to send the heat under a container to boil water, a different amount of air is needed. While the heating is adjustable, there is never ignition into spark as is common with BURNING heating systems. Both spheres are fed a continuous but MINIMAL amount of bottled gas because, as stated, the gas serves the purpose of being a catalyst for the incoming neutral magnetic current. One might wonder why one bowl is located directly above the other. The reason is that the upper bowl can maintain a full charge of gas because this light gas will only exit the upper sphere when the sphere is full. Also, the bottom sphere, having a heavy gas combination, fills the sphere up to the top. With this arrangement, the incoming neutral magnetic current always has a conduit of gas to then get attracted to its given polarity. This action of forming heat is the result of a nuclear chain reaction whereby each fission initiates further fission's resulting in the release of energy that is manifest as RADIANT heat. There is NO substantial heating until the mixture is blended with air."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"120 The location for this unit to heat a home would be in the standard position, which takes into account that heat rises, thus requiring the needed heating duct system.

As with the other units, this information is the product of Universal guidance, not trial and error. The incorporation of magnetic principles, including pulse rate generation, magnetic current conversion to various polarities, the manifestation of force fields and fields of magnetic waves, etc. are all utilized in this extraordinary design. The design is a basic space ship blueprint presented in a simplistic format to introduce the necessary concepts for true interstellar flight. Once these core principles are understood, people will no doubt extrapolate from these ideas and produce a whole array of unique vehicles for different uses. The principles can work at a microscopic level or at a city size level to accommodate a multitude of purposes. This information is nothing new. Individuals and governments have been working on these concepts for decades. We are simply presenting a condensed and complete version of the necessary data to achieve space flight. By space flight we mean interstellar flight at a speed far beyond the speed of light in a vehicle that is enclosed in a force field in which the inhabitants do not experience any G-force and are contained in an artificial gravity field. The craft does not produce pollution, and it uses naturally occurring Universal magnetic energy for power. The propulsion of the craft is accomplished through the attract-attract principle; the craft matches the polarity of its destination and becomes attracted to that destination at a velocity that is independent of time and space. Several of the magnetic devices we have presented play an important role on this space ship. They assist in driving the plates that turn the exterior sections of the craft, they help provide the necessary onboard power, they help establish the polarities necessary for flight, they help provide the basics for crew survival (food, water, heat...), and more. A device such as this space ship can impact every area of our lives. International commuting can become easier than current city commuting; vacationing can start to include visits to other planets and solar systems. Our entire view of the Universe can be radically altered by the widespread use of this type of vehicle. The doors of exploration can be opened far more than any current science endeavor is planning. New theories, principles, dimensions can actually be tested and explored, not just talked about. How we see and interact with each other and the Universe around us can be forever changed. Before we discuss the parts list and the functioning of the ship, we will review of few basic principles. Magnetic energy is inexhaustible, is everywhere and is constantly changing at different rates. Even gravity is form of compressed magnetism that is constantly changing. Magnetic energy, including gravity, can be enhanced or alleviated under the proper"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"122 conditions. It is not necessary to use thrust to break away from a gravity field. Light is a form of magnetic energy that is constantly changing. Stars emit light pulses that elongate into waves when they strike something. Contrary to conventional science, light travels at various speeds, much faster than light waves and much slower, depending on the conditions. Everything has a unique magnetic signature that can be analyzed, recorded, and repeated. Each star gives off a unique light polarity that can be recorded, enhanced, and attracted to. There is virtually no limit to how fast magnetic energy can travel. Neutral magnetic energy can be harnessed and transformed into an infinite variety of polarities that can perform a multitude of functions. Because magnetic energy is everywhere, it can be utilized everywhere, including in what we call \"space\". There are magnetic channels, like magnetic rivers, that flow through space and can be tapped into and traveled along. The Universal principle of attract-attract is simply that energies attract to each other according to their similarities. This simple principle forms the basis of this entire design, including all the different materials that are used. With these principles in mind we can review the craft. The description of each part and its use is as follows: Figure 1 is an isometric view of the spacecraft while on a landing pad. Notice the shape of the craft is comprised of a cabin section and two 90-degree metal cone shapes. One top plate rotates as does the second inverted cone shape plate on the bottom. For consideration, when both of these plates are rotated in the same direction, they create a gyroscopic lift which then causes the craft to move upward. It is because of this that the three extension legs are secured from the cabin section. If it should be necessary to turn both plates during lift off or landing, the legs could not be extended through the lower turning plate. The entry door is about ten feet above the landing pad and a portable extension ladder is needed in order to board the craft. As the interior of the craft is disclosed it will be shown why entry into the cabin is best at this location. When preparing for take-off, the entry door is secured and the top plate is rotated until enough of an electro-magnetic field has been generated for takeoff. The atmospheric conditions will have a determination as to the rotations needed for lift. Again for consideration, when the top plate rotates it builds up a neutral magnetic charge. What is needed is an arrangement of permanent magnets to contact this top rotating plate. These magnets are located on the inside surface and build a magnetic charge, which sets a polarity, which gives upward mobility. The initial source of power to turn the top plate could be supplied in several different ways, for example, gas jets supplied by bottled gas on board, or a magnet powered motor such as the Magnogen. Figure 2 is an isometric view of the spacecraft in flight. Notice by the arrow indication that the top and bottom plates are rotating in a clockwise direction looking from the top downward. The rpm must be a minimum speed of 182 to a maximum of 225 rpm. The cabin section does not rotate with the plates. What holds it in position is a set of magnetic pulses between the magnets mounted on the cabin and the rotating plates. The entire craft capitalizes on the gyroscopic lift principle if both plates rotate in the same direction. As for the plates, the metal selected for the construction should be TiAlCo-B which is analogous to steel without the weight and can sustain high heat without disruptive seaming. TiAlCo-B is a metal that welcomes magnetic energy, allowing it to be circuited to the inside of the craft for use as needed. Figure 3 shows the upper half of the craft with a view of the inside of the top cone. Figure 4 shows the wiring system needed to produce the required 21,000 pulses per second, a number required for space travel."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"123 The numbered parts may be on one or more drawings.

The craft has a magnetic gyroscopic effect when in motion and properly synchronized and utilized, the gyroscope effect creates a flying machine. We will now discuss the actual magnetic circuitry that is used to utilize the lift principle for space travel. There are several wire assemblies under the top rotating plate with the 7 lengths of #6 wire rope serving as the primary winding. To explain the circuitry, we note that the rotating plates capture neutral magnetic energy that must be subjected to certain ACTIVITIES in order to put this energy to work. The first activity is to offer this neutral magnetic flow a SET POLARITY, an action that MUST HAPPEN from a given DISTANCE or space-gap. This space-gap then forces an energy BUILD UP in order to jump across the gap to the offered polarity, at which point the energy transmutes into a form of magnetism that will do WORK. The work we are drawing our focus to, is to circuit this captured flowing magnetic current into the cabin. ALL of the energy needs for space flight will then be supplied by this energy. To accomplish this flow, certain problems must be eliminated. For example, the magnetic current motors as well as other devices require a NEUTRAL flow that does not manifest with a set polarity. However, the very act of capturing this energy from the plates, demands it be given a polarity. In order to overcome this problem the winding arrangement, under the rotating plates captures this energy with polarities, then, when properly circuited; this same energy is CHANGED into a NON-POLARITY STATE."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"125 To explain how this is accomplished, we first start by explaining some hardware. There are seven groups of the #6 wire ropes; each group has ten wires. These groups are spaced around for 360° but between each group is a space-gap of 12° distance. Located under the top and bottom rotating plates are 70 machined grooves on each plate, which measure 140\" long, cut to a particular shape. These grooved shapes measure 3/16\" deep by 5/8\" wide. This special width is cut to a shape that matches a cross section of a wire wrapping that is put around all 70 wires. As the wrapping is next explained it will show how these 70-wires are held BASICALLY ABOVE these grooves and not down inside them. The 'holding in place method' is to use many non-metal clips and NOT BONDING AGENTS. Before these wires are held in place they are first wrapped around with insulated wire that prevents them from making metal to metal contact to the plates. WRAPPING METHOD The clean #6 wire rope is wrapped around with 'wrapping wire' with a thickness of .060\". This wire is made of a ratio of 7.8% magnesium to 2.5% nickel. This wire has a thick plastic-coat insulation causing the exterior of the wire to measure 120 thousandths thick. The wrapping starts at 3\" inward of the 19-foot diameter. This wrapping process is to take a pre-cut length of this insulated wire and fold the total length in half. Next, take the LOOP end and place this loop around the #6 wire rope at the start point, that is, 3\" inward of the 19-foot diameter. Next, one length of this insulated wire is curved around the #6 wire going in a clockwise direction. At the same moment, the other length is curved around in a counter-clockwise direction. The wires then are CROSSED and each wire goes backwards. This forms wire, \"LOBEs\" or crossing loops. This form of winding is called a DOUBLE- BACK winding pattern. The finished wrapping will look like a CABLE-STITCH pattern. The COUNT of the cross points are very important because, at these points, magnetic plate pulsing takes place and thus contributes to the required 21,000 pulses per second, an amount needed for space flight. The number of crosses is as follows. Each wire goes around with loops that are spaced every 3/4\" apart for a wrapping of 16 loops on one side of the #6 wire that are 180° across from another 16 loops for a total of 32 loops per foot. One length of wire has 384 loops and we times this by 70 lengths to equal 26,880 loops for the top plate and the same number for the bottom plate. The outside measurement of this wrapped wire becomes cradled into the 5/8\" wide machined grooves. These encapsulated wires are then connected to two slip rings that are formed from ring sections. The circuit flow is such that energy is only removed from these wires when the wires INSIDE arrive at their OFF POSITION. This ON/OFF circuit for the seventy #6 wire ropes will be discussed shortly. The crossing action of the insulated wires results in sending a NEUTRAL magnetic flow to the motors that rotate the plates. These Magnetic Motors are larger fan blade type motors that were disclosed as 10 H.P. units driven by inflowing magnetic current. These motors, when made 40\" in dia., produce several hundred H.P., yet are very light in weight. Thus, rotating the plates is an acceptable load for these motors. To review, we find the THICKNESS of the insulation on the wrapping wire serves as a SPACER that prevents the neutral magnetic charge inside the plates from jumping directly to the #6 wire rope. This inner wire IS the attract but to take a SHORTED travel path, the neutral magnetic charge USES the insulated wire as a JUMP-ACROSS point to then complete its attract polarity. The moment this neutral charge crosses, the charge given"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"126 to the wire by the permanent magnet acts as a CATALYST and the wire rope, greatly expands its MAGNET given polarity causing the total wire length to manifest with a very strong magnetic FLASH or pulse. This results in the building of a magnetic sphere that then manifests a SIGNIFICANT DISTANCE past the outside surface of the total spacecraft depending upon the intensity of the field being generated. At this flash moment, the magnetic energy becomes TRAPPED inside the loop of insulated wire. This trapped energy has a CORRESPONDING charge to the #6 wire inside. This is the charge that needs to be changed to neutral. As the flow of energy goes through the 26,880 loops, of the top plate, a polarity CANCELLATION effect takes place. This is because magnetism travels, about equal amounts, OUTSIDE the insulated wire, not just inside, and the loops serve to cause the flow to become, more or less, neutral. (Note: NO flow is ever EXACTLY neutral.) The motors inside the cabin are then caused to be driven by this neutral flow. The second VERY important job is to power the on-board gravity field, with a neutral flow that is explained as follows. GRAVITY FIELD CIRCUIT To create an onboard gravity field requires that two locations of magnetic fields be arranged to attract between each other, one at the top of the cabin's interior and one at the bottom. These fields are fed neutral magnetism that is setup as opposite polarities through use of the permanent magnets located outside the cabin. The setting up of these fields is accomplished as follows. Located above the cabin's ceiling is a set of thin plates made of TiAlCo-B metal. These 6\" wide plates are spaced 1\" apart. Located below the cabin floor is a matching set of plates. All of the top plates are caused to manifest with one polarity, let us say north. Next the bottom plates are caused to manifest with the opposite polarity, which causes a magnetic attract between these SETUP fields. The atmosphere inside the cabin helps to serve as a magnetic conduit to complete a massive magnetic field from ceiling to floor. This field then manifests as an ONBOARD gravity field. The actual circuit flow that accomplishes this action is the way magnetism is circuited in a Waveform to the plates. Then through the action of the plates REPELLING BETWEEN THEM, the energy is caused to be repelled into a PULSE FORM. It is when magnetism is in this PULSE STATE that it responds with a push/pull action downward. Gravity is nothing more than compressed magnetism that causes things to move downward because of TWO distinct forces, a push and a pull. Thus a push automatically occurs with a pull. You cannot have one without the other. Why will this field allow people to walk around inside? It is the magnetism attracting to the magnetism (inside the craft from ceiling to floor) and anything IN ITS PATH interferes with this magnetic circuit. Thus everything in the cabin is subjected to a downward push/pull action. The upper gravity plates will be given a flow of neutral magnetism that is then CHANGED, acquiring a NORTH polarity. This change will manifest as strong narrow slots of repel pulsed magnetism between the TiAlCo-B plates. The bottom plates react in the same manner with their SOUTH charge, and thus the field is completed throughout the entire cabin. This flowing magnetic circuit of one polarity at the ceiling and one under the floor is arranged as follows. First we review some hardware. There are a total of 14 permanent magnets located on the outside bottom of the cabin. When these magnets are in use they swivel back and forth to the magnet ring. However, the opposite ends of these same magnets are caused to get CLOSER and FARTHER from the outside surface of the cabin."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"127 When any magnet is held the 2\" away from the magnet ring, the same magnet has a certain amount of SPACE between it and the cabin's outer surface. We use this space as follows. A coil of wire is wrapped around a thin TiAlCo-B plate that measures the same size as the magnet face (that is 6-1/4\" long by 1-1/4\" wide.) This special coil has one wire connected to a brush that contacts the slip ring connected to the insulated cable stitch wire coils. Thus neutral magnetism comes TO THE COIL. Next, as a north face magnet moves within .015\" to contacting the coil (wrapped around the TiAlCo-B plate) the neutral magnetism GRABS this north charge and it is circuited (by coaxial cable wire) directly to the plates located above the ceiling. All 14-north faces (this includes the bottom magnets) get circuited to the ceiling grid plates. Next, the same hardwood is arranged to have 14 SOUTH magnet faces feed their energy to the plates under the floor. As the magnets respond with their back and forth movement this action CHARGES the 14 coils thus supplying all the energy needed to CONVERT the flowing NEUTRAL flow to flows having desired polarities. Another need for the onboard gravity field is to allow a Transmuter to function in outer space. Of what value is a Transmuter for space travel? A Transmuter will be instrumental in charting the heavens, but one might ask, 'why not just have an ONBOARD telescope? To explain, as particles of light travel from various stars in the heavens, these pulsed molecular structures will strike an onboard telescope, take on an elongated form, and in so doing SLOW the action which is then viewed (and studied) in a wave form. However, different objects (stars, planets, etc.) have signals that can be magnetically identified by their different magnetic pulse rates. An onboard telescope will intercept light signals from various heavenly bodies; however, magnetic pulses that travel SIDE BY SIDE with the light pulses will NOT be detected. Why? Because magnetic pulses simply pass through the telescope. If a dish were to be lowered out of the bottom turning plate (made as next described) it will capture these magnetic pulses to then be used to chart the heavens by recording the magnetic pulses of space. NOTE: Future space travelers must know that in outer space there are VARIOUS magnetic fields that people have only been MINUTELY VIEWED. The dish should be formed as a backstop of properly arranged TiAlCo-B pins. This device will allow a categorizing of the heavenly bodies according to their magnetic pulse rate, and is far more accurate than current identification. Capturing magnetic energy from a given star (or other location) poses a different kind of problem than simply holding a light beam in a mirror and then viewing it. The light beams stay in the spot where they hit the mirror; however, the pulsed magnetic particles when changing into a wave form create a magnetic field that quickly manifests throughout the metal being offered. It is very important therefore to limit the size of the field into which each pulsed magnetic particle can manifest in order to prevent a blending or flowing together of the captured magnetisms. A dish, only large enough to fit out through the bottom rotation plate, can be made of a non-magnetic bonding agent. NOTE: This dish can be used while the craft is moving because the magnetic sphere that encompasses the vehicle is CONSIDERABLY LARGER than the exterior of the space ship. Thus, what are commonly called 'G' forces have no effect whatever on the exterior or the interior of the spacecraft. This material has secured to it an ASSEMBLY of VERY THIN TiAlCo-B pins 7/16\" long. The pin should have very thin metal sensing wires attached to each one. The pulsed magnetic particles would strike the top of the pins that are facing toward the heavens, turning them into mini-magnets. After causing each pin to manifest as an identifiable magnetic pole, this pole would then remain in place for detection, as this pulsed energy is fed into a receiving computer."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"128 The problem is this. Magnetic particles arriving at the dish from DIFFERENT galaxies will exhibit a wide range of magnetic polarities depending on several factors. For example, the distance they traveled, the composition of the original light source, the magnetic HIGHWAYS they passed through to get to the dish, etc. All of these events have an important impact. Here is the BIG problem. After these magnetic pulses are captured, how does one make SURE of the identity being given each, for recording purposes? There is only one sure way and that is to use the energy from the onboard transmuter to first exactly REPRODUCE the same magnetic pulse rate. The SENT OUT energy from the transmuter is NEUTRAL and it only LEAVES when it is drawn to an offered polarity. A pulse can be sent into the heavens which will match an incoming magnetic TARGET. Then, by controlling the pulse rate of the attract field and also varying the polarity of the attract field, the following synchronization information is attained. The spacecraft operator will know that pulses are synchronized when they MATCH the incoming magnetic energy and it arrives MORE INTENSE at the dish. The magnetic pulse NUMBERS that were used can then be given to identify that particular target in the heavens. As a more advanced use of this system becomes technologically feasible, a very accurately timed ON PULSE can be sent out, then by a reversal of that polarity, the magnetic TRACK will pull back energy from space along with the original magnetic charge. This then MAGNIFIES the viewing of the original heavenly objects. Naturally as the craft travels, this advanced VIEWING will be helpful in observing distances and compositions more accurately. We must understand that the SPEED of light although CONSTANT is not limited to a given speed RATE. To be a constant and to maintain a specific speed rate are two entirely different thoughts. Light goes through an ACCELERATION process as the PULSED particles NOT WAVES leave the sun and are slowed depending on the other structures in their path. If charting of the heavens is to be done accurately, it is important to broaden our understanding and learn that light in the Universe is traveling at DIFFERENT speeds so as to maintain the BALANCE needed for each system. Space travelers must consider that the particles that become light, travel from the Sun in the form of pulses at a rate FOUR TIMES FASTER then recorded light waves. As these particles make contact with other molecular structures they taken on an elongated form and in so doing have slowed the action which is then viewed in a waveform. As this disclosure unfolds it will show how the shape of this vehicle as well as its construction causes a condition whereby magnetic energy in and outside this certain sphere creates a wave length that reflects and defracts light thus allowing this vehicle to travel at speeds not hindered by light energy. When a space ship runs on magnetic energy, the pull of the attraction is stronger than the interference of the light. This strong PULL ATTRACTION happens because of the craft's pulse number of 21,000 pulses per second. To explain, it is difficult to understand the very word, 'pulse-rate' without knowing what pulsing is, what makes the craft pulse, how large is the pulse, where does the energy come from which first forms into the pulse, what happened to the pulsed energy after it manifests as a pulse and finally why we use this 'particular' pulse number. The word 'pulse' itself is misleading in that this word has come to mean any single throb or beat as in a 'signal pulse.' The pulse being identified with this spacecraft is actually the result of intertwining magnetic circuitry all working together to manifest with 'pulse' energy. This particular pulse number, 21,000 pulses per second can be called the 'primary' figure that allows a sphere to tap into 'free magnetic space energy,' and thus be attracted"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"129 from this planet to somewhere in the Universe. Just going 'somewhere' would be foolish, therefore, the pulse rate and pulse attract polarities are adjusted on the craft to cause an attract 'to a given place.' There are magnetisms in the universe that have only been minutely investigated. Every heavenly body emits a given magnetic pulse rate and when this pulse rate is 'tapped into' by utilizing the correct pulsing of the craft, the vehicle is attracted to that target. As travel charts are made of the heavens, it will become common to select the given stars that are 'closest' for attract targets then switch over as the craft gets closer to the desired destination. The exterior of the craft manifests its 'pulse' with a greater strength at a particular 'zone' on the craft's exterior, therefore the vehicle's 'flight advance angle' is such that this strongest 'pulse zone' becomes the point of the craft that always 'faces forward' for fast space travel. To explain, a standard thrust aircraft simply points the front end toward the target but what is the front edge of a craft that is spherical in shape? The obvious thought would be that the center or cabin window area might be the forward edge but this is not the best advance angle for fast space flight. The best craft 'angle' is when the vehicle is tipped whereby the top safety antenna would be tilted forward 45 degrees. This would cause the center of the top rotating plate to be the lead edge being attracted forward. This lead edge area of the top plate is actually the centerline of the figure eight holes that are drilled completely through this plate. See drawing. A closer understanding of the magnetic pulse rate and how it is caused to manifest will help explain the 'forward tilt' of the craft that maximizes the attract force pulling the craft forward. For example, the attract pulse strength is focused at the center line of the figure eight holes; however, it is important to note that by having this zone of the craft be the 'lead edge', it in fact intercepts the neutral magnetism of space that causes the top rotating plate to accumulate this magnetic energy. The wiring systems under the rotating plates not only capture this energy and give it the needed polarity, but this pulse wiring circuitry instantly feeds this captured energy to the bottom rotating plate thus the total craft must be included in the pulse 'counting', that is, top and bottom plate, when adding up the craft's pulsing of 21,000 pulses per second. When this pulse number is reached, then the craft's EXTERIOR PULSE POLARITY determines in which direction the craft will go. We find that pulsed light particles emitting from the center of the Universe travel at variable SPEEDS that cannot be described within our present framework, which locks in time and space. Thus, ALMOST INSTANTLY these pulsed light particles from the center of the Universe are at JUPITER. If a space traveler set the pulse-rate of a craft to ATTRACT to these same pulse like particles, they could arrive at Jupiter in a moment, then change their craft's polarity to follow the magnetic light energy that goes from Jupiter to Earth. All outer SPACE is composed of a NEUTRAL magnetic energy (meaning not having a set polarity). Neutral magnetic energy does not manifest as magnetism, that is, an energy having a polarity capable of doing work, until certain conditions are caused to happen. Therefore, a starting point for correctly addressing this subject is to highlight the 'conditions' needed for this energy conversion process. Condition 1) the exterior of the craft must be made of a metal that will welcome neutral magnetism and 3/8 inch thick TiAlCo-B is ideal for this purpose. Condition 2) This neutral magnetism must be offered a set polarity from the face of a permanent magnet and this 'offer' needs to be at a given distance whereby this neutral magnetic energy 'jumps' a distance gap enroute to the set polarity because it is during this"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"130 jump over space that the energy transmutes from neutral to actual magnetic energy. The strength of the set-up magnetism is dependent on the actual gap 'distance' needing to be jumped. The TiAlCo-B plate then must go through a 'charging' whereby the energy saturation is intense, thus the offered gap becomes the control factor that allows the correct 'build-up' of magnetic intensity. Condition 3) The actual jump-over gap must happen along a set distance or zone because it is during this jump-over that the correct 'pulse length' happens. Condition 4) The time spacing between the jump-over energy is very accurately controlled because it results in producing the needed 21,000 pulses per second and this control is for the most part attained by the revolving speed of the TiAlCo-B top and bottom plates. Condition 5) The actual polarity that is offered the neutral magnetic energy must be controlled to not just a north or south magnet face but an unending variety of magnetic 'mixtures' that are needed to travel to given zones of the heavens. Condition 6) After a given amount of neutral magnetic energy is allowed to 'cross- over', a very definite stopping of the flow is needed to allow the pulse an opportunity to return to what could be called a 'neutral attitude' in readiness for the next pulse that might be a 'different' pulse polarity. This neutral attitude capitalizes on the 'spent' pulse in that the energy does not escape but is reused as the magnetic molecular structures simply go through a 'continuous state of forming and reforming' with their pulse polarity being controlled by the permanent magnet's face selection process. To gain the true picture as to how the two rotating plates interact, we need to think of the plates as responding with the action of an OSILLATOR, that is, pulsing from top to bottom, bottom to top. There are several wire ASSEMBLIES under the top plate. The primary winding consists of 70 lengths of 5/32\" dia. wire. These wires are formed by using 7 clean wires measuring .060\" thick with six wires wrapped around one. These wires are made of a ratio of 7.8% magnesium to 2.5% nickel. All 70 wires are spaced 360 degrees around into seven sections (under the top plate) equaling 10 wires per section. Located at the 19 foot diameter of the top plate are 70 boron carbide contacts, each contact having secured to it one of the 70 wires. These 70 moving contacts pulse to 70 boron carbide contacts, which are located at the outer top part of the cabin. These stationary cabin contacts all get circuited to 70 contacts located at the outer bottom surface of the cabin. There are 70 jumper wires that pass between the seven spaces located between the windows. The bottom rotating plate also has 70 boron carbide contacts that have the same basic winding connected to them. None of the moving contacts need to make actual contact to the cabin contacts. Magnetic energy jumps a space gap, thus, no contact wear happens. The captured neutral magnetic energy is given its polarity by 28 magnets located outside the cabin. This is an INTENSIVE magnetic flow that not only jumps the space gaps, but ATTRACTS to the contacts in such a manner as to keep the cabin in a non-rotating position as both plates rotate in the same direction. ACTION OF THE MAGNETS ON THE EXTERIOR OF THE CRAFT There are a total of 14 magnets located on the outer top of the cabin and 14 magnets located on the outer bottom of the cabin. These are powerful iron/boron/neodymium magnets that measure 6-1/4\" long, 1-1/4\" wide and 3\" high. All the magnets are supported in seven swivel frames spaced 360 degrees around. Each unit holds two magnets with a separation of 3\" between magnets. The seven swivel frames on the top outer surface of the"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"131 cabin are arranged whereby they can swivel either one magnet or the other to come within .015\" of making actual contact to what is called a MAGNET RING. Thus, at any given moment only seven spaced around magnets can transfer magnetic energy to the magnet ring while the magnets, NOT IN USE, are held 2 inches away from the ring. With the same magnet arrangement of 7 sets of magnets on the lower outside of the cabin we gain the following magnetic flow interaction. We have the choice of magnet face polarities by the selection from seven north or seven south faces. For example, they could all be north at the top turning plate and all circuit to south at the bottom turning plate. The polarity selection becomes the guidance that will determine the direction to which the vehicle will be attracted in outer space. There is a vast array of attract polarities, each one wanting to pull the craft according to the SELECTION of the polarity being manifest. This polarity variety is accomplished by: a. the rotational speeds of the plates b. The rotational DIRECTION of EACH plate c. Their speed VARIATION between each, and d. Finally the magnet face placement that is controlled by using the swivel action of the magnet holding frames that change magnet contact from north to south, etc. The 1- 1/4\" wide by 6-1/4\" long magnet face is the point of contact that impacts the magnet ring. MAGNET RING CONSTRUCTION The top rotating plate is 19 feet in diameter with a 12 inch opening at the top. This ring is made of 3 separate sections each having about the same amount of square inches exposed at the outer surface area. These 3 separate sections are 3 different size castings, all made of 3/8\" thick TiAlco-B Metal. There are two magnetic spacer connecting rings that are use to hold these three sections together. These spacer rings are rectangular (dia. to fit the plates) measuring 1-3/4\" facing outside and measuring 7/8\" protruding inward. The rings outside surfaces are flush mounted and smooth. These rings are made of a blend of 81% aluminum to a ratio of 42% magnesium and anodized. Each ring is cut into sections for circuit purposes, then reassembled with mica between the cut sections. These reassembled rings are secured to the plates with non-metal bolts with insulation between the rings and the plates. The magnetic spacer ring located at the larger diameter is the ring, which has the magnets contacting its 1-3/4\" wide inner face. This inner face must be machined to allow the magnets to maintain a .015\" space-gap away from this ring. As the magnets impact the ring sections, each ring section becomes a magnetic distributor that sends a CHARGE of magnetic current into the wires that then cause the exterior of the craft to manifest with massive pulse charging. There are seven ring sections of 12 degrees each spaced around for 360 degrees. All the magnet switching (north to south, etc.) is accomplished as these smaller sections arrive under the magnets. Thus, each of the seven magnet sets is altered in ring contact polarity seven times per 360 degree rotation. This action is PART of the pulse changing needed to attain 21,000 pulses per second. (7 magnet sets times 7 changes per rotation equals 49 changes per rotation.) IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE: The completed circuitry for pulsing to the plates becomes quite involved. We will try to clearly explain it. Subject – Connection pattern for the 70 lengths of 5/32” diameter wire rope. To gain an understanding as to how the magnetic current flows around the top and bottom plates, we note that two different flow PRINCIPLES are utilized. Principle A is that"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"132 for the permanent magnets to complete a circuit, there must be one magnet on each end of the wire which is being pulsed. For the most part, a flow between opposite magnetic polarities creates MOST of the magnetic charge to the 70 wires. This charge is then GRABBED by the captured neutral magnetism of space to then build into MASSIVE magnetic pulses of power. If one could see the pulse rate of the craft AS A WHOLE, this total vehicle would register as having 21,000 pulses per second, a number needed for space flight. This disclosure will show how the pulsing of JUST the top plate, at 200 RPM, builds into pulse numbers of 7,840,000 pulses per minutes or 65,333 pulses per second. These pulses are then GROUPED into pulses from other pulse locations to create LARGE pulses that encompass the total craft. These other pulse locations will be the subject later in this disclosure. The second principle B used to explain the magnetic flow is that when NEUTRAL captured magnetism jumps over to a given polarity, there is no need to be concerned about any PARTICULAR circuit flow. This energy will CLOSE THE GAP to any offered polarity to ALWAYS complete its circuit. This is an important action to keep in mind when the subject is how the top plate pulses to the bottom plate, then bottom to top. As the craft advances through space the top plate becomes the primary zone that captures the neutral magnetism. This energy, when being circuited to the bottom plate, ALREADY HAS acquired a polarity. Thus, when the bottom plate pulses to contacts to RETURN magnetic energy to the top plate, the 70 wires at the top plate are given a CHARGED CIRCUIT FLOW which RESPONDS TO the polarities of the magnets. This interaction between the plates is crucial to the spacecraft’s operation. Thus the top 7 sets of magnets located at the top of the cabin must be in PERFECT alignment to the 7 sets of magnets that are located at the underside of the cabin. To explain the wiring system, we note there are seven sections of 10 wires per section, with a 12-degree amount of plate spaced between each section. Each of these seven sections has its magnet ring cut at the center point to cause a SEPARATION. This cut to the magnet ring results in each section making firm contact to only five of the 70 wires. EXPLAINING THE FLOW First, we number the 70 slots where the wires are to be placed from #1 to 70 counting clockwise looking at the plate from the top down. Our focus is now on just two wire lengths, the wire length for slot #1 and the wire length for slot #11. Let us assume the #1 wire has been wrapped with the double-back winding pattern and the wire assembly is now located at slot #1. We note this wrapped wire started 3” inward of the large diameter. It is at this point that flexible mica tubing is slid over the clean 5/32” diameter wire rope. This tubing, with the wire inside, is then bent 90 degrees going clockwise with enough length to arrive at slot #12. Each slot has a boron carbide contact located INLINE with it, thus this #1 wire is secured to the boron carbide contact at slot #12. All of the 70 wires are connected with the same pattern of SKIPPING OVER a total of 10 wire slots. We now focus on the other end of the wire at slot #1. At the smaller diameter of the plate, near the top location, the #1 wire is NOT CUT but is bent to a 90 degree turn going clockwise to then arrive at slot #11. This bend to the wire is made just past the point where the wrapping of the double-back wires ended. It is at this point that flexible mica tubing is slid over this wire as it gets extended over to slot #11. At slot #11 this SAME WIRE is wrapped with the double back wire and then secured down along the length of slot #11 to arrive at the large diameter. Next, this wire"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"133 gets bent to a 90 degree turn going clockwise to get secured to a contact located in line with slot #22. This is the same THROW pattern, which skips over 10 wires, as was used at the other end of this wire length. Thus, we have a single length of wire that completed the circuit for TWO slots. This same pattern is continued for the total plate that results in 35 lengths of wire to circuit all of the 70 lengths of wires located at the 70 slots. We again focus on the smaller diameter where the curved part of wire #1 and #11 has had the mica tubing added. Next, located at a point centered of this tubing we make a cut to expose the wire inside where a jumper wire is then attached. This jumper wire is also 5/32” diameter wire rope made of a ratio of 7.8% magnesium to 2.5% nickel. The connecting method should be a compression sleeve made of the same material as the wire. The sleeve is then insulated with mica and the jumper wire gets connected, going counterclockwise over to the location where the center part of slots #51 and #61 are located. The jumper is secured to the center part of the bend that goes to these two slots using the same connecting method. When the total top plate has been wired in the same manner, we find that a total of 60 jumper wires are used. The EFFECT of these jumper wires is that it causes a total of four boron carbide contacts to be solidly INTERCONNECTED. Thus, whenever ANY of the 70 top contacts get circuited to a bottom contact, the magnetic energy flow MUST go into 4 lengths of wires. This creates a massive energy flow set in motion at a HIGH frequency. For example, at 200 RPM of the top plate (bottom plate not rotating) the frequency of pulses to EACH wire is 933 pulses per second. If one were to utilize the speed of electrical FLOW to analyze the pulse number of 933 P.P.A., the conclusion would be wrong. It is true electricity CANNOT penetrate along the total lengths of the #70 wires at this tremendous high cycle rate. However, a magnetic flow IS NOT limited to the comparatively SLOW movement of electricity and it SHOULD NOT be viewed from that standpoint. Just for reference purposes the 60 sets of four wires per set are recorded as follows: 1-11-51-61 2-12-62-52 3-13-63-53 4-14-64-54 5-15-65-55 6-16-66-56 7-17-67-57 8-18-68-58 9-19-69-59 10-20-70-60 11-21-1-61 12-22-2-62 13-23-3-63 14-24-4-64 15-25-5-65 16-26-6-66 17-27-7-67 18-28-8-68 19-29-9-69 20-30-10-70 21-31-11-1 22-32-12-2 23-33-13-3 24-34-14-4 25-35-15-5 26-36-16-6 27-37-17-7 28-38-18-8 29-39-109-9 30-40-20-10 31-41-21-11 32-42-22-12 33-43-23-13 34-44-24-14 35-45-25-15 36-46-26-16 37-47-27-17 38-48-28-18 39-49-29-19 40-50-30-20 41-51-31-21 42-52-32-22 43-53-33-23 44-54-34-24 45-55-35-25 46-56-36-26 47-57-37-27 48-58-38-28 49-59-39-29 50-60-40-30 51-61-41-31 52-62-42-32 53-63-43-33 54-64-44-34 55-65-45-35 56-66-46-36 57-67-47-37 58-68-48-38 59-69-49-39 60-70-50-40"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"134 To explain the pulse number of 933 pulses to each wire per second, we take the count when the top plate is turning at 200 RPM (bottom plate not turning). There are 70 top contacts that pulse to 70 bottom contacts. Thus in ONE 360 degree rotation the number of pulses is 70 x 70 to equal 4900 pulses in one rotation. We then take 200 RPM and multiply it times 4900 to equal 980,000 CONTACT PULSES in one minute. As stated, each contact responds to four lengths of the 70 wires, thus we take 980,000 x 4 to equal 3,920,000 wire length pulses to just the top plate in one minute. To find the pulse frequency of one wire per second, we divide 3,920,000 by 60 = 65,333 pulses per second for all 70 wires. Thus, 65,333 divided by 70 equals 933 pulses per wire PER SECOND. Naturally, if the bottom plate were turning backwards at 200 RPM this number would be twice as large JUST for the top plate. The bottom plate always responds as a MIRROR IMAGE to what happens at the top plate. MAGNET-PULSE COUNTING We next identify the 7 sets of magnets that are equally spaced around for 360 degrees as being magnets A-B-C-D-E-F-G. As stated, the principle of the magnet pulsing is that whenever any magnet is caused to flow its energy, it must get circuited to another magnet. Keeping this fact in mind, we next trace the pulsing of TWO magnets. Our focus is on the rotating plate where Wire #1 has just arrived above magnet A having a NORTH charge facing this wire. The spacing of the magnets is arranged to where magnet B has just arrived at the location of wire #11. This magnet has a SOUTH face toward this wire. These magnets then have just completed a magnetic circuit by flowing their attract energy into the loop of wire identified as #1 and #11. We must understand that this magnetic charge is MINISCULE; however, it DOES serve as a catalyst that attracts the captured neutral magnetism located in and around the TiAlCo-B plate, a plate that WELCOMES magnetism. As this neutral magnetism GRABS this ‘magnet given polarity’ it instantly responds as a magnetic flash that then GREATLY INTENSIFIES the magnetic current inside this wire loop. Since this wire loop is jumpered to the loop of wires #51 and #61, this second loop JOINS IN the magnetic charge. This ONE action of magnets A and B caused 4 boron carbide contacts (#1, #11, #51, #61) to respond to the bottom contacts with a massive magnetic jolt, a force of ATTRACT that becomes the tool that keeps the cabin in a non-rotating attitude. The jumper wires that connect the cabin’s top 70 contacts to the cabin’s bottom 70 contacts serve an important secondary purpose. These wires CAPTURE magnetic current and for a very short span of time store this energy. This building up of magnetic energy takes place at an interruption POINT to each of the 70 jumpers, where crystal storage capacitor plates WELCOME any overflow of magnetism. This energy is then captured and stored in special crystal storage banks to be used FOR PLATE PULSING when necessary. The magnetic sphere around the craft, in order to be COMPLETELY FORMED must have the magnetic power be circuited AROUND TO the rear portion of the bottom rotating plate. The circuit that causes this flow distribution is the wiring THROW pattern of both plates. All of this pulsing activity started with magnetic action caused by the permanent magnets. Each of the seven magnets responds in the manner that was explained for magnets A and B. PLATE POLARITY CHANGING FOR SPACE FLIGHT Switching the magnets controls the polarity of the plates. However, this switching can only be effective if the 70 wires TAKE TURNS being OFF to then be in the proper ATTIUDE to"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"135 receive a polarity change. The circuit flow next explained shows how 35 sets of wires get charged as ON while 35 sets of wires are OFF. This charge changing process happens 7 times per rotation. When a set of 35 wires are activated as ON, it is at that point where 7 magnets are all activating seven different ring sets. Magnet A at wire #1, Magnet B at wire #11, Magnet C at wire #21, Magnet D at wire #31, Magnet E at #41, Magnet F at #51, Magnet G at wire #61. These are 14 ring sections that have a total of 5 wires per section, shown as follows: Magnet A pulses to ring 1 which has wires # 1,2,3,4,5 Ring 2 not being pulsed has wires #6,7,8,9,10 Magnet B to ring 3 has wires #11,12,13,14,15 Ring 4 not being pulsed has wires #16,17,18,19,20 Magnet C to ring 5 has wires #21,22,23,24,25 Ring 6 not being pulsed has wires #26,27,28,29,30 Magnet D to ring 7 has wires #31,32,33,34,35 Ring 8 not being pulsed has wires #36,37,38,39,40 Magnet E to ring 9 has wires #41,42,43,44,45 Ring 10 not being pulsed has wires #46,47,48,49,50 Magnet F to ring 11 has wires #51,52,53,54,55 Ring 12 not being pulsed has wires #56,57,58,59,60 Magnet G to ring 13 has wires #61,62,63,64,65 Ring 14 not being pulsed has wires #66,67,68,69,70 The ring sections that have magnets starting to contact them are all odd numbers. The moment all seven magnets cross over these odd numbered rings then these rings are no longer charged and are in their OFF position. Next, the seven magnets ride along the next set of EVEN numbered ring sections. This activates the other 35 wires as ON. The 6-1/4” long magnet face causes ALL of the rings to be ON for a very short time span. This timing increment equates to how much time passes for the top plate to travel 6-1/4” at the magnet ring. Thus, as the magnets start to leave the odd numbered magnet rings; they slide directly across to the even numbered rings. At that exact moment, ALL of the rings are activated as ON. This action causes a massive magnetic flash that contributes to the pulsing of the total craft. The 6-1/4” long magnet face PRODUCES this desired action. All of the magnet switching is accomplished at the 12-degree ring section. The cross wires and the special magnetic circuitry of these 12-degree ring sections becomes a study by itself. These ring sections play a major part in producing the space flight number of 21,000 pulses per second. There are several important reasons for arranging the circuit flow to have 35 wires on and 35 wires off, then reversed. It is only during the OFF time that NEW polarities can be established. Therefore, without off time there would not be the polarity control necessary for space flight. Another important reason for OFF time is because the captured magnetic current from the double- back wires cannot be removed while the wires inside are under magnetic charge. Thus the slip rings that remove this captured magnetic current are arranged to ONLY remove this energy when a set of the 35 wires is in the OFF position."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"136 Finally, when stating the 35 wires are OFF, it does not mean a SHUTDOWN of magnetic power to those wires. The off wires, for the short OFF span of time maintain a magnetic charge that is in a state of readiness to GRAB or receive a new polarity. This action recycles a stabilized magnetic charge. This craft, having TWO turning plates is best called a cargo vehicle that can lift its own weight in cargo. However, the pulse action was counted AS IF the bottom plate was not rotating. This shows that enough pulsing STILL HAPPENS so as to return home with only one rotating plate, likened to a two-engine airplane limping home on just one engine. Subject: Hardware and connection pattern for the 21 sets of cross-wires. We need to have an understanding as to how the magnetic current create pulses for space flight in order to grasp the value of this cross-wire circuit. To explain: as the 70 lengths of 5/32” diameter wire rope are caused to be pulsed, their flow pattern is basically that of straight-line pulses. These pulses of themselves will not cause the rotating plates to be attracted with the FORCE needed for space flight. The subject of cross-wires is addressed by counting the amount of these wires. There are fourteen sets of LARGE cross-wires that form figure 8 patterns and seven sets of smaller cross- wires. These smaller cross-wires create narrow but powerful magnetic pulsing zones. The study of these cross-wires starts by directing our attention to a photo of a ‘scale model’ of a top plate, see Figure 5. The three plate sections are sized according to each section having the same amount of square inches of TiAlCo-B metal. The small diameter portion that has the 12 inch opening called Part A, measures 129 inches outside diameter molded to a 90 degree curvature that measures from the top down (along the outside), 91 inches. Secured to this section is the magnetic spacer connecting ring Part B that is used to secure this small diameter section to the middle section. This spacer is a rectangular ring that is made of a blend of 81% aluminum to a ratio of 42% magnesium and is anodized. The face of this ring that is exposed to the outside of this top plate assembly measures 1-3/4 inches and protrudes inward for 7/8 inch. This total rectangular ring is 129 inches at its inside upper diameter and 130-1/4 inches at its inside lower diameter. The larger diameter portion of this top plate has an inward extension lip that is ¼ inch thick and protrudes inward for ½ inch. (See figure 6.) There are non-metallic bolts that are placed through holes in this protrusion and get firmly secured into drilled and tapped holes that are in the spacer ring B. To explain the circuit flow, we again state that this ring is actually composed of 21 separate sections that are all made of the same metal composition. There are seven 39-degree sections and each has a ½ inch deep by ¼ inch wide cut at their center point. While these seven sections are not actually cut complete through, this cut serves the purpose of CHANGING the magnetic flow. This flow change is a response that reacts AS IF these seven sections are actually fourteen separate sections. Thus, after this cut is made, only 3/8 inch of material is left holding these two pieces together. As we view the photo of the model, one can see that there are seven ring sections of 12 degrees each called Part C, which are spaced between the fourteen sections that measure approximately 19-1/2 degrees each. A total of fourteen mica spacers, each measuring 1-3/4 inches by 7/8 inch by ¼ inch thick are inserted between the 12 degree sections and the rings next to them,"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"137 called Parts D. Next, after cutting the seven grooves to form fourteen separate sections, these slots are filled with mica spacers measuring ½ inch by 1-3/4 inch by ¼ inch thick, then bonded in place. The circuit flow, which will be explained, must be viewed AS IF these cuts went completely through forming 14 sections of approximately 19-1/2 degrees each. There are five 5/32” diameter holes bored through each of the ring sections (spaced s shown on Figure 5) for a total of 70 holes. Each of these 5/32-inch diameter holes has a 1/8-inch non-metal setscrew intercepting it, which will secure the wire TO THE RING, after the wire is inserted. When these 70 wires pass through the ½ inch by ¼ inch thick inward extension lips, these holes are enlarged to a 3/8-inch diameter. This size allows a 5/32 inch I.D. by 3/8 inch O.D. mica tube to be inserted, thus preventing the wires from contacting the inward extension lips (See Figure 6). Next, wrapped around Part B should be a 1/16-inch thick U-shaped piece of Mylar insulation (see Figure 6). Our attention is now on the center section of the top plate Part E. This section is also 3/8 inch thick metal measuring 131-7/8 inches O.D. at the top and 183-3/4 inches O.D. on the bottom (this section measures 37 inches from the top surface to the lower edge). This section is also funnel shaped 90 degrees to match the small top section. Part E also has a ½ inch lip protrusion at the 130-1/4 inches UPPER inside diameter that gets bolted to the magnetic spacer ring. This center section is also insulated from the spacer ring. A good bolting arrangement would be to locate non-metal ¼-20 bolts every 3 inches apart for the full 360 degrees at the 130-1/4 inches upper diameter. Next, we describe the second magnetic spacer ring Part F. This is the ring being contacted by the permanent magnets; thus the insulated wrapping wires need to pass through 140 holes that are drilled to allow their circuit to be completed. These wires are therefore not an obstruction to the magnets sliding close to this ring. The measurements of this ring are 182-3/4 inches at the inside top portion. The lower part of this ring measures 184-7/8 inches at the inside diameter. The lower portion of this ring is bolted at the 182-3/4 inches inside diameter. This ring marked F is cut into sections to match the upper ring, Part B. This ring is bolted to the large diameter bottom section called part G. The outer top portion of Part G measures 131-7/8 inches O.D. and 228 inches at the bottom outside diameter. This plate measures 29-1/2 inches from the top to the bottom, that is, along the outside edge. When these three sections of 3/8-inch thick TiAlCo-B metal are secured to the two magnet rings, the assembly measures 161 inches from the top center point to the 19-foot bottom edge. This hardware background now allows us to study the 21 sets of cross-wires identified as Part H. There are a total of fourteen large cross-wires and seven smaller cross-wires. The circuit next being explained is only for the large cross wires. These fourteen sets of cross-wires are made of 3/8 inch by 1/16-inch thick flat wire being 46-1/2 inches long. This material is made of an alloy that is 7.8% magnesium to a ratio of 2.5% nickel with a plastic coat varnish insulation covering. This insulation is common to the electric motor use. Each cross is composed of two lengths of 46- 1/2 inches long wire, thus 93 inches of material is needed for one complete cross. There are fourteen crosses that then require a total wire length of 1,302 inches. These flat wires are firmly bolted to these ring sections by using brass 3/8 inch-16 bolts, which are, located about 19 degrees apart. At the point of contact, the varnish insulation is removed. Next, and VERY IMPORTANT, at the center point of these 14 cross-wires, the insulation is removed and good contact between the two wires is established. This center point should be 24 inches away from the magnet ring Part F. These fourteen sets of cross-wires are placed into 3/32-inch deep grooves, which are 3/8” wide to firmly hold these flat wires. These wires are secured into the grooves with non-metal clips and NOT a bonding agent. As these grooves are cut, they are not to cut through the machined grooves that hold the 70 straight wires but"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"138 are to stop ¼” away then continue. The flat wires MUST NOT make contact to the straight wires but need to be curved over then above the insulated wrap wires. Next, before the flat wires are put into the 3/32-inch deep grooves, these grooves are drilled completely through at their center point. For the total length of these grooves, there are 1/32-inch diameter holes spaced 3/32 inch between holes. Next, these LINES OF HOLES are connected TOP and BOTTOM with the same hole spacing formed into half round shapes) Part J. NOTE: the half round shapes for the 12-degree ring sections have the rounded holes CONTAINED TO only the center section Part E. This causes the formation of very intense Figure 8 pulsing patterns that form the lead-edge of the craft. The reason for these 1/32-inch diameter holes is that they set the actual pulse SIZE by offering the magnetic energy a place to manifest inside and outside the plate. Thus the holes create a ‘pulse establishing location’. How is this possible? The neutral magnetism set-up UNDER the plate needs to manifest OUTSIDE the plate. The holes then serve as the needed flow PASSAGEWAY to complete this pulse circuit. Another reason for the holes is for SAFETY. These holes are located in such a position as to serve as the LEAD EDGE of the craft. If, by chance, the craft had to pass through a HOT ZONE in the heavens, these holes would help to dissipate unwanted heat. We now address the subject of how the fourteen sets of cross wires create OSCILLATING magnetic currents that flow back and forth across the 70 lengths of straight wires. The moment a permanent magnet contacts the lead-edge of any magnet ring section, the magnetic current RUNS AHEAD into this section to then complete several different circuit flows. First, the lead edge of this ring section sends magnetic current into the flat wire which is secured at that location. This magnetic charge goes to the center of these two cross wires and then continues to the trail edge of the upper magnet ring. From this trail edge, the magnetic charge runs BACKWARD, ‘against the rotation’ to the lead edge of the upper magnet ring. Next, from that point, it travels downward to the trail edge of the ring where it is contacting the magnet. Then, as this magnet advances, this figure 8 pattern of oscillating back-and-forth is maintained until the next magnet starts the circuit flow. The CROSS-POINTS of these flat wires send a shock of magnetic energy into the wire assembly that travels around for 360 degrees to circuit to all of the cross points, (see Part I). This WIRE RING is not a continuous wire connection but is arranged to create a particular magnetic reaction. This unique circuit connection can only be explained when all the influencing factors are understood. Thus, this subject will be explained in Installment #5 along with a final review of all the basic functions of this spacecraft. CIRCUIT FLOW FOR THE 7 SMALLER CROSS-WIRES. The cross wires located at the 12-degree ring sections acquire their pulse somewhat like the pulsing of the larger cross-wires. However, the response they cause TO THE TOTAL PLATE, becomes a magnetic charge which is MASSIVE. To explain this action we review the method by which these wires are arranged. The cross wires at the 12-degree ring sections are marked Part F. These crosses are formed of the same flat wire and get secured into 3/32-inch deep-machined grooves. Centered between these seven cross wires are machined half-round grooves 3/32” deep, which start 3” in from the 19-foot diameter. These grooves then extend upward to arrive near the center hole of the top plate for a total length of 144 inches. Placed into these half-round are 5/32 inch diameter CLEAN wire ropes (see part L). At the center point of each of the 12 degree ‘magnet ring sections’ there is a 5/32” hole bored through to allow a wire to be inserted into the half-round groove then pass through both magnet rings and arrive near the center hole of the top plate. These seven wires get firmly secured to the 12-degree magnet ring sections. VERY IMPORTANT –Note these seven clean wires are contacting all three-"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"139 ring sections causing what might be called in electrical terms a DIRECT SHORT CIRCUIT. The ACTION, which this circuit causes, can be explained as we first study the connection pattern for these seven wires. To mount the wires in these seven half-round grooves, we use three lengths of NON- INSULATED 5/32-inch diameter wire rope that measures 310 inches long. These wires are formed into 5/32 inch diameter wire-rope by the use of seven clean wires each measuring 60 thousandths thick with six wires wrapped around one. This is a special alloyed wire made of a ratio of 7.8 % magnesium to 2.5% nickel. Next, each of the three lengths of wire is fed through both magnet rings and when arriving at the small diameter of part A, the wires are curved around the 12-inch opening. They then get circuited down the opposite side of the cone by skipping two wires and finalizing the circuit again at the large diameter. To expand on this connection pattern, if all seven wires were numbered 1 to 7 then starting with wire #1, this length would also complete wire #4. Wire #2 would complete wire #5 and wire #3 would complete wire #6. Next, the seventh or ODD wire gets circuited in a special way to the seventh wire on the bottom plate. This connection causes a pulsing INTERACTION between the plates that aids in building the TOTAL SPHERE around the craft. Another magnetic action that happens is these wires cause an OSCILLATING energy COVER for the cabin area which is located between the plates. To accomplish this, rings made of the SAME material as parts B and F, being one inch wide, are located on the outer top and outer bottom of the cabin. These rings make firm contact to this OUTER SKIN structure for 360 degrees. Next, the seventh wire of the top plate gets circuited along its length then down to the outer edge of this plate. The wire is then secured to a one-inch wide spring-loaded carbon brush that rotates with the plate. This brush rides directly on the top aluminum/magnesium ring, which then sends magnetic PULSED current along the outer cabin wall down to the lower ring. The bottom plate’s seventh wire has a brush that contacts the bottom ring. Thus the cabin’s exterior, which is insulated from the cabin structure, completes the circuit between these seventh wires (one on the top plate and one on the bottom plate). The result is that it creates a dispensing action of magnetism that manifests as a SPREADING OUT and balancing of the energy, an important CIRCUIT for space flight. We note that the 19-foot diameter of the plate has a lower ring section that protrudes 4 inches inward, forming a one-inch thick shelf to hold the 70 contacts. The spring-loaded carbon brush is placed at a LARGER diameter than the 70 contacts to not interfere with THEIR pulse action. We now review the circuit flow action. Whenever ANY 12-degree ring section has a permanent magnet contact it (by sliding .015 inch above the 12-degree section) ALL of these sections also have magnet contact due to the spacing of the seven sets of magnets. This action causes ALL of the seven wires to complete their circuit TO ANOTHER MAGNET. This action creates narrow but POWERFUL poles that form along the full length of these wires. This happens because each wire is EMBEDDED into the TiAlCo-B plates, having NO insulation. The three rings (A, E, and G) for a given space of time, are all responding AS ONE, likened to a DIRECT SHORT CIRCUIT. This action causes a MOMENTARY build-up of magnetic power to the plates, an energy charge that then JOINS the flow by jumping to the 70 wires (along with their insulated wrapped wires). The full impact of what has just been disclosed is better understood as we focus on WHAT HAPPENS NEXT."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"140 As the seven magnets arrive at the lead edge of the 12-degree magnet rings, their magnet polarity establishes the CHARGE, which is setup on the total plate. Next, as the magnet advances to the center of this magnet ring, it CAUSES another jolt to the wire that is located directly under it. At this point, the magnet is moved AWAY from the ring and the other magnet, having an opposite polarity, moves to within a .015 inch distance from the ring. This action sends a reversed magnetic shock wave, which USES the polarity, left behind to attract AND BUILD still stronger magnetic pulse waves. It is this ATTRACT and BUILD action that causes the magnetic flow to jump across the insulated wrapped wires AND then gets CAPTURED inside these insulated wires to then be circuited to the cabin’s interior. 12 DEGREE CROSS-WIRE CONNECTING PROCESS. The wiring system next explained serves the purpose of creating important but DIFFERENT MAGNETIC PULSES. To explain, as the insulated flat wires are embedded at the 12 degree ring sections they cross just above the clean 5/32 inch diameter wire rope that is embedded at this center point. The cross-wires MUST go above this wire rope and at this cross point, the plastic coat varnish insulation is removed. These cross-wires then make firm contact to each other and also contact the top part of the clean 5/32-inch diameter wire rope. All seven 12 degree cross wires get connected in this manner. Next, at this same ‘cross connection’ another wire arrangement is added that creates yet another pulse action. This wiring addition calls for the use of a total of fourteen pieces of clean 5/32-inch diameter wire rope, each being 10-1/2 inches long. The placement of these wires is as follows. As the cross wires make contact to the straight wire that is centered at the 12 degree ring section, one of these 10-1/2 inch long wires MAKES CONTACT on the right side of the cross and the other on the left (see part M). One would think that simply using a 21-inch long 5/32-inch diameter wire would serve the same purpose, but this is not the case. As each 10-1/2 inches long wire is secured to a PORTION of the flat wires at the cross connection, this wire then becomes an EXTENSION for the flow of magnetic energy from the flat wire. A NEEDED magnetic action happens because these 10-1/2 inches long clean wire ropes are embedded into the TiAlCo-B metal AT RIGHT ANGLES to the straight wire. This simple wiring addition actually causes a NEW magnetic pulsing to manifest which has an important impact to the total pulsing system. We must remember that the 12-degree sections of the top TiAlCo-B plate are not a separate section of metal. Therefore, the captured neutral magnetism from THE TOTAL SURFACE of the TOP plate will MOMENTARILLY rush to the 12 degree sections to find a polarity. When speaking of a POLARITY it is important to note that a magnetic circuit completed between opposite polarity magnet faces is more powerful. However, neutral magnetic energy is not selective and will setup a given magnetic pulse if the magnet faces are LIKE POLARITY. Thus, it is not a problem of always needing to have opposite face magnets for attracting. All of the wiring under the rotating plate is arranged to accomplish the task of SPREADING OUT the pulses in order to include the TOTAL PLATE into one large pulsing structure. This spreading out of polarities becomes possible because the three plates are insulated from each other. To explain this ‘spreading out’ statement: if a person were to view the vehicle from a distance, with a magnetic detector that registers individual pulses, it would show the following: FIRST, that the total space vehicle would look like one giant pulsing sphere. Then closer inspection would show a certain individual pulse action from the total LARGER plate (Part G). Next an"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"141 individual pulsing action will manifest from the middle zone (Part E) and finally a smaller pulse at the small diameter. STILL CLOSER inspection would then show straight line pulsing from the large diameter to the small diameter of the rotating plates (action caused by the seventy wires). And yet still closer inspection would show OSCILLATING flows crossing back and forth across the straight-line flow caused by the cross wires. Then finally the inspection would show a PULSE AROUND FLOW from the wires that go around and get connected to the 21 cross wire center points. A good question to ask would be why does the 3/8-inch by 1/16-inch flat wire need to be insulated with the plastic coat varnish insulation? Answer – This insulation causes a certain DIFFERENT magnetic energy charge to CROSSOVER, one, which has RESTRICTIONS. Also, these wires serve as boosting energy antennas that send out the current polarity signal and attract additional energy in to reinforce the pulse sequence. This is necessary because the PRIMARY flow for these cross wires is picked up at the cross connections. This is the point where the clean 5/32-inch diameter wire rope is contacting the cross wires and is in SOLID CONTACT to the TiAlCo-B plate. This flow then FEEDS BACK to the magnet rings and causes the magnetic charge from the magnets, to become greatly REINFORCED. This action then BUILDS UP a set polarity inside the 70 wires that are secured to the magnet rings. This setup polarity then becomes the ATTRACT FORCE that is strong enough to cause neutral magnetic energy to jump across the insulated loops of the wrapping wire. Thus, the actual SIZE of the flat wires limits this SHORT-CIRCUIT activity to the point where it is a SECONDARY magnetic circuit acting as a MAGNETIC REINFORCEMENT CHARGE. All of this magnetic pulsing builds into the attract force that causes the craft to TAP INTO the gyroscopic principle of movement that is NATURAL in our Universe. However, the SPACE ENERGY that attracts this vehicle actually attracts to the total unit. Thus a pulse is not one total magnetic flash of energy which goes around AS IF the craft were a ball, but the pulsing action is supplied from TWO ZONES, the top plate and the bottom plate. Each plate contributes 10,500 pulses per second. The TIME DIFFERENTIAL between the pulsing from the top plate and the INTERTWINING of pulses from the bottom plate happens at zones on the craft’s exterior that are actually POSITIONED by the connection span of the 70 wires. Thus this NEEDED time differential is caused to happen by the 114-degree WIRE SPAN connections. A statement that might seem to be confusing is that a pulse is not to be thought of as having a GOING DIRECTION, as for example, top to bottom. Instead a pulse should be considered as an energy that goes both directions SIMULTANEOUSLY. Therefore, DO NOT completely lock into the top to bottom analogy. Subject: The pulsing sequence for the PULSE AROUND magnetic circuit flow As stated previously, the wire ring that connects the cross-points is not a continuous wire connection. The explanation then begins with a focus on the method for holding this wire. There are seven 24 inches lengths of clean 5/32-inch diameter wire rope and each length connects TWO crossing points that are 24-1/8 inches apart. As each wire is secured to the 3/8 inch flat wires at the TOP of the cross it does not extend to the actual CENTER, but is 1/16 inch short of going to the actual center point. These seven wires are held into machined grooves, which are located 24 inches away from the magnet ring, part F. These grooves are 24 inches long and 3/32 inches deep. These grooves have a radius to hold a 5/32-inch diameter clean wire rope. Next, to complete this wire ring there are 14 separate lengths of 5/32 inch diameter clean wire rope which are only 12 inches long. These wires are held in a 3/32-inch deep by 5/32-inch diameter half round machined grooves, which are 12 inches long."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"142 When the seven 24 inches long wires are all secured to ONE-SIDE of the crosses, these 12 inches long wires get located on the opposite side of these same cross-points. There should be a 1/8-inch space distance between the 24 inches long wires and these 14 lengths of 12 inches long wire. NOTE: The opposite ends of these fourteen 12 inches long wires are IN-LINE with the wires that are located at the 12-degree ring sections. It is important to state again that when the 5/32-inch diameter grooves are cut for these wires they DO NOT cut into the straight-line grooves, but stop 1/4 inch away on both sides. These wires are then CURVED over THE STRAIGHT WIRES AND DO NOT MAKE CONTACT TO THEM. We will now trace the magnetic circuit flow. When a magnet arrives just past the 12-degree ring section it sends its polarity charge into the ring section that has five straight wires. However, at this same contact point, this magnet is also CHARGING a flat wire. This flat wire, at its cross- points sends an energy charge ACROSS TO the cross-wires which are located AHEAD of this magnet. This flow pattern causes a magnetic flash to travel ahead ABOVE the straight wires. Next, as this same magnet arrives at the end point of this SAME magnet ring section, the magnetic current travels BACKWARDS. This ahead and backward movement manifests as a Figure 8 pattern of flow. The cross-wires and their method of circuitry CAUSE all of this pulsing action. These figure 8 patterns of magnetic charge become VERY POWERFUL. Thus when the plate is charged ready for space flight, the Figure 8 pattern is enlarged to the size established by the holes (holes which go through the plate). Other spacecraft Construction details: 1) When the lower ring section protrudes inward for 4 inches, this lower shelf is machined flat on the bottom surface. This shelf not only adds rigidity to the rotating plate but it serves as a wiring shelf to hold the jumper wire connections. The primary purpose for the shelf is to serve as the contact holding support frame. The 70 contacts protrude down past this shelf a distance of ¾ inch with a rounded curvature to match a 3/4 inch half round shape. The contacts also extend upward past this shelf one inch which allows a securing bolt to hold one of the 70 wires in each contact. IMPORTANT: The shape of the contacts is necessary to assist in the acceleration of the rotating top plate by ‘ATTRACTING’ the moving contact to it. This action then allows the cabin area to remain in a non-spinning attitude as both plates (top and bottom) rotate in the same direction. This NON-spinning of the cabin is caused to happen by the ‘TIMING’ of the contacts PULSING which then serves as a CABIN STABILIZER. Thus the shape of these ‘boron carbide’ contacts is an important design feature. It should be noted that the rotating accuracy of the plates needs to be such that the spacing distance between the contacts does not change more than a few thousandths from the needed .015 inch spacing. These contacts are to be placed into mica tubing which has a 1/8-inch thick wall for insulation purposes. When the 70 contacts located on the top of the cabin get circuited downward to the 70 contacts below, the jumper wires pass on the sides of the windows. Thus depending on the USE of this spacecraft, the number of windows required can be determined. For example, if the craft were to be used for passenger purposes, then seven windows would be ideal. The method of placing the weight around in the craft is a primary concern. For example, the centerline of the cabin should be the center of the windows. However, the weight distribution"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"143 should be the same on each half of this centerline. Thus, seating would need to be at TWO levels, that is, above and below the centerline’s divide location. The motors that drive the plates need to be spaced on both sides of this centerline. Also, the ballast weights are not to be used to correct the misplacement of weight. These sliding weights are for controlling the flight path and proper weight placement is a requirement for space travel. POURING the TiAlCo-B Metal Each of the top three plates should be poured using about six individually curved plate sections. These sections are made with sides that are grooved to snap into the part next to it. Care must be taken to NOT allow the molten TiAlCo-B to flow over TOO MUCH mold distance. A thought is to use four separate furnace systems to then fill the mold simultaneously from four pouring in areas. IMPORTANT – When the mixture in the silicon nitrite mold is CHERRY RED it should be removed and placed between upper and lower non-metal pin holding assemblies which will maintain the shape. Next, the red hot metal is given a FAST chilling JOLT of ice-cold water from many spray jets. These jets are to hit EVERY SPOT of the metal shape, both inside and outside. The pin holding shell units serve to stop a WARPING out of shape during the chill cooling cycle. Next, the finished shape is to be completely cooled in a room having liquid coolant blowing cool air on the metal with a temperature of 22 degrees F. SAFETY ITEMS 1) A spare set of contacts should always be onboard the craft. If an accident happened whereby contacts hit to contacts they could be damaged. Repairs can be made if these parts are part of the repair package. 2) There are UNWANTED jolts of magnetic energy in space that could cause magnetic control problems. The top of the craft should have an antenna, which is circuited to an assembly of CHARGE CONTAINMENT materials. This charge CAPTURING package is located at the storage compartment of the top cabin area. The unwanted charge is then captured and dispersed. 3) The magnet switching units will be activated by computer control. However, should a computer become inoperative, these magnets can be changed in polarity by HAND operational cables, a system that could prove VERY useful. 4) A start motor and a run motor are used to rotate each plate. However, shafts with special couplings can be placed between these motors. If a motor were to need repair, then the coupling between the upper and lower shaft could be activated. Thus either motor can be used to rotate BOTH plates until needed repairs are made. 5) The legs for landing extend out of the cabin area to allow BOTH plates to rotate during take-off. However, for landing, it is best to be able to have the plates rotating backwards of each other. This action can be likened to backing a car into a driveway. Also, for landing, a single pod can be lowered from the center hole of the bottom plate. This device can be used to TEST the surface to see if it can support the craft. 6) A more advanced design of this craft would be to have the doorway be an opening into the bottom plate. This design would call for very exact plate manufacture to prevent the unit from rotating OUT OF ROUND. A suggested method for locating the door on this first vehicle would be through the cabin area whereby one of the seven windows is replaced with an entry door. Additional information pertaining to this space ship will be distributed in the future."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"144"}]
