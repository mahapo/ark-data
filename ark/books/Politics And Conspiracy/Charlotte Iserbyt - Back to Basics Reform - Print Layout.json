(Note: Bush’s No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) holds public schools account- able for a child’s acquisition of attitude, value, and behavior outcomes that are nestled in state standards and integrated with academic curriculum! NCLB also demands accountability for having highly qualified educators—of which national certification is based in part on an educator ’s ability to collect and assess a child’s personal information, use behavior psychol- ogy-based practices on kids, and more.) Iserbyt’s Back to Basics Reform also cites the U.S. De- partment of Education’s distribution of public money for research that uses school children as lab rats. Does the public know that experimentation—especially in low income, high minority areas—is tak- ing place?

And, most shocking of all, is an admission made by Brian Rowan who was involved with William Spady in the infamous 1984 Utah Outcomes-based Educa- tion grant which called for \"putting Outcomes-based Education (OBE) in all school of the nation.\" Rowan, in a federally-funded paper titled \"Shamanistic Ritu- als in Effective Schools\", 1984, said in regard to Effec- tive Schools (which calls for ML/DI): \"The ritual is particularly suited to application in ur- ban or low performing school systems where success- ful instructional outcomes among disadvantaged stu- dents are highly uncertain but where mobilized publics demand immedi- ate demonstrations of success. The uncertainties faced by practitioners in this situation can easily be allevi- ated by what scholars have begun to call 'curriculum alignment.'

This book deals with the social engi- neers’ continuing efforts, paid for with international, federal, state, and tax-ex- empt foundation funding, to manipulate and control Americans from birth to death using the educational system as the primary vehicle for bringing about planned social, political, and economic change. (The major change in our eco- nomic system will be the determination by industry and government of who will be selected to perform the necessary tasks in our society—quotas for engi- neers, doctors, service workers, etc., to bring about the socialist concept of full employment.) As you read on, you will recognize the key roles played by the behavioral psy- chologists, sociologists, educationists, and others in bring about this planned change—through the radical transfor- mation of America’s classrooms from places of traditional cognitive/academic learning, where intellectual and aca- demic freedom flourish, into experimen- tal laboratories for psychological (atti- tude and value) change, using modern technology (the computer for individu- alized instruction and for administrative management systems) in conjunction with the totalitarian theories of Profes- sor B.F.

In SCIENCE AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR , Skinner says, “Operant conditioning shapes behavior as a sculptor shapes a lump of clay.” 1 In the book, B.F. SKINNER, THE MAN AND HIS IDEAS , the author, Richard Evans, quotes Skinner as saying “I could make a pigeon a high achiever by rein- forcing it on a proper schedule.” 2 Evans adds, “His (Skinner’s) concern for what he believes to be the inadequacy of our formal education system led to applying the principles of operant conditioning to a learning system which he called the teaching machine, but Skinner ’s approach is concerned with more than merely methods and techniques. He challenges the very foundation by which man in our society is shaped and controlled.” 3 Dean Corrigan, in a 1969 speech to teach- ers, predicted that Skinner’s ‘teaching machines will pace a student’s progress, diagnose his weakness and make certain that he understand a fundamental con- cept before allowing him to advance to the next lesson.” 4 1 Back To Basics Reform, Or...OBE *Skinnerian International Curriculum? | by Charlotte T.

The Exemplary Center for Reading In- struction (ECRI), a federally-funded and disseminated, $848,536 Mastery Learning Outcome-based Skinnerian learning sys- tem developed by Dr. Ethna Reid of Utah in 1966, still receives federal financial support and is in use in at least 3,000 schools across the nation, although ac- cording to doctors, teachers and parents, it causes sickness and stress for students and turns teachers into robots. Dr. Jeanette Veatch, internationally known in the field of reading, called the ECRI program “a more modern version of breaking children to the heel of thought control.” She added, “it is so fla- grantly dangerous, damaging and de- structive I am appalled at its existence.” 5 ————— \u0001 ————— A RIZONA EDUCATORS DENOUNCE FEDERALLY - FUNDED OPERANT CONDITIONING PROGRAMS On May 5, 1984, the officers of the Ari- zona Federation of Teachers unani- mously passed a resolution, excerpts of which state they “oppose such programs as ECRI, Project INSTRUCT and/or any other programs that use operant condi- tioning under the guise of Mastery Learning, Classroom Management, Pre- cision Teaching, Structured Learning and Discipline, and petition the U.S. Congress for protection against the use of such methods on teachers and stu- dents without their prior consent.” 6 Unfortunately, the national American Federation of Teachers (AFT) declined to adopt its Arizona affiliate’s resolution (above) at its August 1984 national con- vention in Washington, D.C. ————— \u0001 ————— NEA PROMOTES M ASTERY L EARNING Not unexpected is the fact that the AFT’s competitor, the National Education As- sociation (NEA), is actively promoting Mastery Learning and its use of critical thinking skills. Mary Futrell, President of the NEA, is presently using paid ad- vertisements proclaiming that “the schools must move away from the stuffed ‘sausage’ approach—that is, learning facts—to the mastery learning project.” 7 The real “meat and potatoes” of the NEA’s substitute for “learning facts” was unveiled at the 123rd Annual Meet- ing of the NEA held in Washington, D.C., June 28-July 3, 1985. A press release dis- tributed at the meeting explained that the NEA’s “Mastery in Learning Project” is to be piloted in six schools in the fall of 1985 at five initial sites: Conejo El- ementary School in Thousand Oaks, CA; Hillside Jr. High in Simi Valley, CA; Mt. Vernon Elementary School in Alexan- dria, VA; Westwood Primary School in Dalton, GA; Greasewood School (K-12) on the Navajo Reservation in Arizona. Also revealed is the fact that nine re- gional laboratories, funded by the U.S. Department of Education, are support- ing the NEA project. “...this is the first time all these labs have come together to support a comprehensive national ef- fort. ...” said project director Robert McClure. [ Emphasis added ] Furthermore, four research centers, funded by the U.S. Department of Edu- cation, will be “backing” the Mastery in Learning Project, including centers at UCLA, Johns Hopkins, and U. of Texas at Austin—all very active in change agent activities. The project will also re- ceive funding assistance from the Ten- nessee Valley Authority and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. As startling as this information is, it is nothing compared to the information found in a booklet distributed at the NEA meeting which describes in consid- erable detail what the Mastery in Learn- ing Project encompasses. For example, it is explained that Mas- tery Learning is a “concept first pro- posed a generation ago by Harvard psy- chologist Jerome Bruner...A growing body of research and educational reform proposals from such respected educa- tional analysts as Mortimer Adler ( devel- oper of the Paideia Proposal and long-time advocate of a One World Government—Ed .], John Goodlad, Theodore Sizer, and Ernest Boyer have all sought to translate Bruner’s work into classroom reality.” How shocking! This certainly validates what parents and concerned educators have been saying for years! Every one of the above-mentioned people are key change agents: major architects of the horrendous education mess and declin- ing test scores we are now experiencing. That the above named change agents (and others) have been “translating” the work of Jerome Bruner into classroom practice speaks volumes. That those re- sponsible for the destruction of Ameri- can education are being called on to par- ticipate in its “reconstruction” boggles the mind! Many who are reading this book will recall several years ago the battle raging in school districts around the country, and even around the world (in Austra- lia, for example) over an elementary So- cial Studies program called Man: A Course of Study (MACOS). In the Con- gressional Record, April 9, 1975, page H2585, Arizona Congressman John Conlan said this about MACOS: 2 Back To Basics Reform, Or...OBE *Skinnerian International Curriculum? | by Charlotte T. Iserbyt"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" “ The course was designed by a team of experimental psychologists under Jerome S. Bruner and B.F. Skinner to mold children’s social attitudes and beliefs along lines that set them apart and alienate them from the beliefs and moral values of their parents and local community.” For those who may not know, MACOS was suppose to help children under- stand what made them human by ex- ploring in depth the lifestyle of an ob- scure Eskimo tribe. In reality, the pur- pose of MACOS (which is still being used) is, as Congressman Conlan indi- cated, to “mold the children’s social at- titudes and beliefs...” For example, parents were outraged that their fifth grade children were required to read ugly stories which promoted in- fanticide, cannibalism, incest and senilicide—the deliberate shoving of aged relatives out on the ice to die alone. And here we are, many years later, and nothing has changed for the better. The latest “innovation” i.e., Mastery Learn- ing, will be used as a vehicle to “trans- late” anti-life, sub-human, values-chang- ing, behavior modification techniques that characterized the MACOS program. But with an important difference: before, parents could examine their children’s textbooks; now, thanks to technology, nothing or nobody will be able to get be- tween the child and his computer. Ex- cept, of course, the internationalist change agents. Also revealed in the NEA booklet, is the fact that “Mastery Learning is one of many instructional models. Others in- clude Active Teaching, Direct Instruc- tion, Student Team Learning, Socratic questioning, coaching, creative problem solving, Bruner ’s Concept Attainment Strategy, and Madeline Hunter’s Target Teaching Approach. These models incor- porate research on effective teaching, and all may be explored by the schools asso- ciated with the project.” For more information on this project, write to Mastery in Learning Project, NEA, 1201 16th Street N.W., Washing- ton, D.C. 20036. ————— \u0001 ————— N AT I ONAL D IFFUSION N ETWORK PUSHES S KINNERIAN PROGRAMS FOR DISADVANTAGED The activities of the NEA and the U.S. Department of Education and its labo- ratories and centers in 1985 shed light on why the U.S. Department of Educa- tion refused in 1981 to conduct an inde- pendent reevaluation of the model Mas- tery Learning program, the Exemplary Center for Reading Instruction (ECRI). The following deception by the U.S. De- partment of Education, in order to keep ECRI alive as a model for development of future Mastery Learning programs, should serve as an important warning for Americans who still trust the major- ity of educators who have been trained in “end justifies the means” moral rela- tivism instead of the traditional code of ethics in existence since the founding of this nation. A letter from Assistant Sec- retary James Rutherford to Congress- man Eldon Rudd dated January 19, 1981, says “The ECRI program...is not an ‘op- erant conditioning” program.” 8 The Department of Education has ada- mantly refused to conduct an indepen- dent re-evaluation of ECRI, denying that the program uses stopwatches to time children or that it uses Skinnerian tech- niques, even though the entire 100-page teacher pre-service training manual is devoted to the training of teachers in stimulus-response-stimulus operant conditioning techniques, and materials on the ADAPTATION OF BIRDS, MONITORING FORMS BEFORE AND AFTER INSTRUCTION (observation data sheet records), HOW TO TEACH ANIMALS by Skinner, HOW TO TEACH ANIMALS: A RAT, A PIGEON, A DOG , by Kathleen and Shauna Reid, etc., are listed as teacher and source ma- terials by ECRI. In addition to the above documentation, the July 1984 issue of The Effective School Report says in very small print, “The fol- lowing professionals and groups have initiated successful educational pro- grams which can work together as a common system to deliver PREDICT- ABLE SUCCESS (emphasis in original) for each learner—the ultimate criterion of an effective school program: B.F. Skin- ner, Norman Crowder, Robert E. and Betty O. Corrigan; 1950-1984; Mastery Learning Practices .” 9 [ Emphasis added ] Utah’s Terrel Bell, former Secretary of Education in the Reagan Administra- tion, has recently joined the Board of Di- rectors of Kelwynn, Inc., the effective schools training company which pub- lishes The Effective School Report . The presence of a former Cabinet member and Secretary of Education on its Board of Directors elevates Kelwynn, Inc. and its Effective School Report to a new level of importance in national education policy. The Department of Education cannot afford to permit an independent re-evaluation of ECRI, according to a March 30, 1980 memorandum to Secretary of Education Shirley Hufstedler from Acting Assistant Secretary Dick W. Hays, which says, “conducting the review has the advantages of terminating the controversy concerning ECRI and of limiting the controversy to ECRI. This response could be precedent setting, however, and open up the possibility of having to respond to similar requests in the future in the same manner. Not conducting the review removes the precedent- setting possibility but it is likely to prolong the controversy about ECRI and could result in an enlargement of the controversy to include other or all programs developed or oper- ated with federal education funds.” 10 The Department was rightfully con- cerned that a re-evaluation would open a Pandora’s Box, thwarting its ultimate goal of implementing Mastery Learning nationwide (1984 Far West Laboratory grant discussed later and 1985 NEA 3 Back To Basics Reform, Or...OBE *Skinnerian International Curriculum? | by Charlotte T.

(The social engineers always experiment on the helpless and disad- vantaged, using them as guinea pigs with pre and post testing, before they target “all” our children for “treatment.”) The Summary of the National Evalua- tion Follow Through Findings, 1970- 1976 says, “Gary McDaniels who designed the final Follow Through evaluation plan for the U.S. Office of Education, characterized Follow Through , which involves 180 cooperating communities, as ‘ the largest and most expensive social experiment ever launched ’.” ————— \u0001 ————— W ELL - KNOWN EDUCATOR DENOUNCES S KINNERIAN PROGRAMS IN LETTER TO P RESIDENT C ARTER Professor Kenneth Goodman, former President of the International Reading Association, in a letter to President Carter dated March 10, 1978, refers to the $100,000,000 evaluation of the Follow through program as a “fiasco” and says, “There is a know-nothing view that combines the outward vestiges of technology-machines, management systems, arbitrary controlled atomistic skills sequences, and constant testing—with a philosophy of behavior management. In behavior management, outcomes are assumed or arbitrarily determined and the behavior of human learners is shaped, conditioned, reinforced, extinguished, rewarded or punished until the learners achieve the target behavior.” 12 One would have expected the outrage Happen,” must be ordered through your Congressman or directly from the American Association of School Admin- istrators at 1801 N. Moore St., Arlington, VA 22209. ALL Americans must read this for an understanding of ongoing efforts, paid for by the taxpayers without their knowledge, to implement Outcome- based Mastery Learning nationwide and to psychologically manipulate local teachers and citizens in order to get the educators’ core world government cur- riculum adopted in each and every school district in America. In a letter to former Secretary of Educa- tion Terrel Bell, dated July 27, 1984, the Utah State Superintendent of Public In- struction, G. Leland Burningham says, “I am forwarding this letter to accompany the proposal which you (Bell) recommend Bill Spady [ the Director of the Far West Laboratory which received the grant—Ed .] and I prepare in connection with Out- come-based Education. This pro- posal centers around the detailed process by which we will work together to implement Outcome- based Education using research verified programs. This will make it possible to put Outcome-based Education in place, not only in Utah, but in all schools of the nation .” 14 [ Emphasis added ] (The Far West Laboratory is also one of the nine labs working with the NEA on its Mastery In Learning Project.) ————— \u0001 ————— S PA D Y ADMITS M ASTERY L EARNING IS “ AFFECTIVE ” EDUCATION AND BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION Dr. Spady, who has held, among other important positions, that of Senior Re- search Sociologist with the National In- stitute of Education between 1973 and 1978, is dedicated to implementing Mas- tery Learning across the nation. Spady said at a conference I attended on April 21, 1982, that two of the four functions of Mastery Learning are: over ECRI (in the form of letters to Con- gressmen, the former U.S. Office of Edu- cation and the present U.S. Department of Education, and to high officials in the White House) to have resulted in a re- evaluation of ECRI, Project INSTRUCT and other similar totalitarian Mastery Learning programs, especially since BOTH parents and respected educators have protested their continued develop- ment and use. Not so. In fact, a U.S. De- partment of Education, memorandum to Secretary Bell dated October 5, 1982, states, “President Reagan is scheduled to visit P.S. 48, an elementary school in the Bronx, New York City. During his visit the President will meet Dr. Ethna Reid, Director of the Exemplary Center for Reading Instruction, a program in the National Diffusion Network. Dr. Reid will be at P.S. 48 to train staff members in the use of ECRI.” Whether the president, a very busy man, met with Dr. Reid or not, is insignificant. What IS highly significant, however, is WHY this extraordinary effort was made to introduce the President of the United States to Dr. Ethna Reid of Utah. ————— \u0001 ————— G OAL IS TO PUT S KINNERIAN M ASTERY L EARNING IN “ ALL SCHOOLS OF THE NATION ” Although fifteen years of research on American miseducation has left me vir- tually shockproof, a copy of a $152,530 Grant Application No. 84:122B, submit- ted by the Far West Laboratory for Edu- cational Research and Development to the U.S. Department of Education, which was subsequently approved for funding, pulled the rug out from under any slim hopes I held for intellectual freedom in America.

Of course, to the educationists, social engineers, and behavioral scientists, this is perfectly ethical since your children are nothing but human animals with no free will, souls, intellects or consciences. To the social engineers, they are the property of society, not the responsibility of the family. They are to be conditioned and trained like Pavlov’s dogs, as was pointed out by Professor Allen Cohen, at a Mastery Learning conference he led in Maine, when he referred to our children at least four times as “human animals.” 16 When is the U.S. Department of Educa- tion going to stop wasting our money on research, development, and dissemi- nation of projects which collectively hammer the last nails into the coffins of local control and intellectual and aca- demic freedom, and which promote a national/international Outcome-based Mastery Learning education system re- flecting the so-called “New Basics”? ————— \u0001 ————— A RE THE “N EW B ASICS ” WHAT YOU THINK THEY ARE ? Harold G. Shane, writing in the Septem- ber, 1976 Phi Delta Kappan , describes his version of the “new and additional basic skills,” which is accepted by leaders in the education/reform/effective school move- ment, when he says, “Certainly, cross-cultural under- standing and empathy have become fundamental skills, as have the skills of human relations and intercultural rapport...the arts of compromise and reconciliation, of consensus building, and of planning for interdependence become basic...” [ Emphasis added] Shane also said, “As young people mature we must help them develop...a service ethic which is geared toward the real world...the global servant concept in which we will educate our young for planetary service and eventually for some form of world citizenship ... implicit within the ‘global servant’ concept are the moral insights” [ through values clarification, i.e., higher order critical thinking skills, discussed later—Ed .] “that will help us live with the regulated freedom we must eventually impose upon ourselves.” 17 ————— \u0001 ————— M ARYLAND CALLS FOR MANDATORY COMMUNITY SERVICE Perhaps this is what Ernest Boyer, Presi- dent of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and former U.S. Commissioner of Education, means when he recommends in his highly ac- claimed book HIGH SCHOOL , “volun- tary community service as a graduation requirement.” Fellow member of the Carnegie Foun- dation Board, David Hornbeck, the State Superintendent of Maryland’s Public Schools, in testimony before the Mary- land State Board of Education attempt- ing to “ mandate community service at state-approved places ,” quoted Mr. Boyer as saying “in the end the goal of service in the schools is to teach values—to help all students understand that to be fully human, one must serve.” 18 [ Emphasis added ] ————— \u0001 ————— E DUCATOR ADMITS HIGHER ORDER SKILLS ARE VA L U E S CLARIFICATION Robert G. Scanlon, former Pennsylvania Secretary of Education, in A CURRICU- LUM FOR PERSONALIZED EDUCA- TION , said in 1974, “The emphasis in schools in 1985 will be to free the indi- vidual from subject matter as bodies of knowledge and provide him or her with higher order skills... One type (is) values clarification .” 19 [ Emphasis added ] Education in 1985, although orches- trated by the education social change agents for the President, congress, state legislators, governors, school board members and grassroots’ consumption as “back to basics, excellence, account- ability, equity, and effective schools,” consists of exactly what Scanlon pre- dicted: more values clarification, but this time around cloaked in the innocent- sounding “reasoning and higher order criti- cal thinking skills” robe. Who could possibly object to something which sounds so sensible, so necessary, so long overdue? The education change agents are such masters at semantic de- ception (using familiar words and phrases, which mean something accept- able or desirable to you, but which to them have an entirely different meaning or purpose) that even I, as a School Board member, was on occasion led down the garden path. The Far West Laboratory grant proposal takes the words right out of Mr. Scanlon’s mouth when it states that “The ‘basics’ in our educational system must include higher-order reasoning skills and all aspects of the curriculum should deliberately enhance these capacities .” 20 [ Emphasis added ] ————— \u0001 ————— C RITICAL THINKING ON EDUCATORS ’ AGENDA SINCE 1941 Higher order reasoning skills is just an- other deceptive term for higher order critical thinking skills, a values-chang- 5 Back To Basics Reform, Or...OBE *Skinnerian International Curriculum? | by Charlotte T.

TEACHING PUBLIC ISSUES IN THE HIGH SCHOOL , 1966, says, “Glaser administered a question- naire to assess the ‘happiness’ or emotional satisfaction of students who participated in a critical thinking experiment, and related their responses to gain in critical thinking. The questionnaire con- tained such items as these: Do you regard yourself as religious? Do you feel appreciated by your family? Do you feel satisfactory adjustment to the opposite sex? He found that students who made the greater gains in critical thinking more consistently answered ‘no’ to such questions than those who made smaller gains. Glaser comments: ‘This finding may perhaps be explained on the ground that the pupils, who gained the most in critical thinking scores were, as a group, also found to be intellectually superior to those who gained least’.” 21 Glaser’s comment provides much food for thought, especially for parents with children in gifted and talented pro- grams! ————— \u0001 ————— I NTERNATIONALISTS WA N T “ NEW VA L U E S MODIFYING EXISTING BELIEFS ” According to the March/April 1981 is- sue of Human Intelligence International Newsletter , critical thinking skills re- search is taking place within the United Nations Educational Scientific Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Office of Economic Cooperation and Develop- ment (OECD), and the World Bank which plans on “increasing the Bank’s international lending for education and training to about $900 million a year.” 22 The Department of Education’s National Institute of Education, possibly in re- sponse to a meeting Luis Alberto Machado, the Venezuelan Minister for Human Intelligence, had with former Secretary of Education Terrel Bell and various senators to update them on the progress of his nation’s work in human intelligence, “has awarded a three-year contract totaling approximately $780,000 [ of your tax money—Ed .] to Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Inc. of Cambridge, Mas- sachusetts to analyze current programs of instruction on cognitive skills.” 23 For an understanding of what research on human intelligence encompasses let me quote from the July/October 1981 issue of the Human Intelligence International Newsletter: “The search for new referential systems and new values modifying existing beliefs should be based on modern microbiology. A scientific approach should be free from doctrinal bias, and its findings applicable to all mankind. Ideologi- cal confrontations between East and West, Marxism and Liberalism, Arabs and Jews do have economic, historical and political bases, but no biological basis.

(Hence the big push in all states to get their K-12 Goals and Objectives in place.) The federally-funded Council of Chief State School Officers, which restricts its membership to the 50 state Superinten- dents of Instruction, supports all of the above components of the “New Basics” and has recently come out in support of a national achievement test, which makes sense if national and international education policy is for ALL students to master international, federal, and foun- dation-funded pre-determined goals and objectives in the “New Basics” be- ing promoted by the Chief State School Officers at state legislative hearings across the nation. ————— \u0001 ————— N ORTH C AROLINA SUPERINTENDENT DENIES OFFICIALS ACCESS TO COMPETENCIES Unreported by the major media is the fact that the North Carolina Superinten- dent of Public Instruction, Craig Phillips, exhibiting understandable paranoia over the possibility of parents, members of the North Carolina State Board of Education, and legislators finding out which competencies (behavioral objec- tives) North Carolina’s children would have to master, initially refused to give copies of the 6,000 K-12 Basic Education Competencies to the above-mentioned individuals. It should not go unnoticed that this monstrosity would cost, at a minimum, three billion dollars over an eight year period. Only the threat of a lawsuit by Bob Windsor, the gutsy editor of the North Carolina Landmark , and pressure from elected officials and parents, forced Phillips to cave in and provide copies to the public. The educators’ “end justifies the means” code of ethics prevails in North Carolina: Get the bill passed come hell or high water by denying the citi- zens and legislators access to the contro- versial competencies (objectives), some of which are: Fifth grade: “Develop a flag, seal, symbol, pledge and/or national anthem for a new country; Design a postage stamp to be used world- wide. The stamp should denote what the world would need to make it a better place;” Sixth grade: “Draw national symbol for an imaginary nation;” Seventh grade: “Understand the need for interdependence;” Ninth grade: “Write a constitution for a perfect society.” 30 The shocking tactics used in North Caro- lina should alert citizens in other states to the ends the educational establish- ment will go to get its one world gov- ernment competencies (objectives) ap- proved by all 50 state legislatures under the guise of “effective schools, basic skills, accountability and excellence” re- form.

SCHOOLING FOR A GLOBAL AGE received funding from the National In- stitute of Education and tax-exempt foundations, so you helped pay for this book which is a most important resource on global education for administrators, curriculum coordinators, and classroom teachers. The Department of Education’s Office of Educational Research and Improvement is deeply involved in the activities of the Center for Educational Research and In- novation (CERI) attached to the OECD in Paris, France. CERI’s International School Improvement Project (ISIP) held a conference in Palm Beach, Florida in 1982, at which many of the key compo- nents of the United States’ education re- form movement (effective schools move- ment) were discussed by delegates from member countries. 34 ————— \u0001 ————— OECD STATES NEED TO TRANSPORT SOFTWARE ACROSS NATIONAL BOUNDARIES At an OECD Conference in Paris in July 1984, two hundred delegates, observers, and experts from 24 member countries, including the United States, “focused on the use of new information technology, especially the computer.” One of the working groups’ principal recommenda- tions was that the “OECD act to assist in the development and establishment of international standards for the ex- change of courseware authoring sys- tems ... There was wide spread interest among country delegates about the means...to reduce the legal and tech- nical barriers that inhibit the transport- ability of software products across na- tional boundaries .” 35 [ Emphasis added ] ————— \u0001 ————— M ASTERY L EARNING TO BE USED WORLD - WIDE That Mastery Learning and Teaching, the system to facilitate indoctrination in the “New Basics,” is being implemented on an international scale, vital for the future international curriculum, is made crystal clear by Benjamin Bloom when he says in ALL OUR CHILDREN LEARNING , “In an attempt to maximize curriculum effectiveness...curriculum centers throughout the world have be- gun to incorporate learning-for-mastery instructional strategies into the redesign of curriculum.” 36 Bloom’s close associate, Canadian-born Professor John Goodlad, enlarges on the subject of international curriculum in his book CURRICULUM INQUIRY . Goodlad, probably the most important change agent in the nation, served on the governing board of UNESCO’s Institute for Education, 1971—, and is best known for his complaint in 1970 that “most youth still hold the same values as their parents and if we don’t resocialize, our system will decay,” 37 and more recently in the Preface to SCHOOLING FOR A GLOBAL AGE , 1980, for his recommen- dation that “Parents and the general public must be reached also [ taught a glo- bal perspective—Ed .]. Otherwise, children and youth enrolled in globally oriented programs may find themselves in con- flict with values assumed in the home. And then the educational institution fre- quently comes under scrutiny and must pull back.” 38 This recommendation explains the cur- rent priority of the U.S. Department of Education and the community in part- nerships with government schools, ig- noring the fact that parents have prime responsibility for their children’s educa- tion. Goodlad was a keynote speaker at former Secretary Terrel Bell’s first meet- ing of the highly publicized National Commission on Excellence which pro- duced the publication “ A Nation at Risk ”—which ignored issues of most concern to parents—but nevertheless lulled the nation into a phony and ex- pensive “back to basics/local control” coma. SCHOOLING FOR A GLOBAL AGE is one of three controversial books pub- lished as a result of Goodlad’s federally and foundation-funded A Study of Schooling . The Danforth Foundation, which helped fund SCHOOLING FOR A GLOBAL AGE , has just had its Vice President, John Ervin, elected Chairman of the National Council for Effective Schools (connected with Kelwynn, Inc. and The Effective School Report men- tioned earlier) which are pushing Out- come-based Mastery Learning and Teaching nationwide. In CURRICULUM INQUIRY Goodlad implicates Bloom, Ralph Tyler (the father of educational evaluation) and himself in the promotion of Mastery Learning and Teaching on an international scale when he says that “Bloom was invited by UNESCO in 1968 to submit a proposal for a six to nine week training program which would partially fulfill recommen- dations made at UNESCO’s Moscow meeting dealing with the formation of 8 Back To Basics Reform, Or...OBE *Skinnerian International Curriculum? | by Charlotte T.

This group has been con- cerned with the use of international tests, questionnaires, and other methods to relate student achievement and attitudes to instructional, social and economic fac- tors in each nation. The evaluation in- struments also represent an interna- tional consensus on the knowledge and objectives most worth learning .” 40 [ Em- phasis added ] The U.S. Department of Education, through its National institute of Educa- tion, contributes to the funding of these cross-national studies, so you, the tax- payer, are paying for an “international consensus on the knowledge and objec- tives most worth learning.” Goodlad’s CURRICULUM INQUIRY , says “Several Americans, including Bloom, Goodlad, and Ralph Tyler served on the faculty ... We planned to identify the extent to which each nation’s curricu- lum center was involved in the kinds of curricular activities identified by Tyler,” and then it defines some of the impor- tant components of Mastery Learning: “formulating goals and objectives, plan- ning and selecting learning opportuni- ties, organizing learning activities, and evaluating students’ progress,” 41 all of which sound innocent and desirable unless one is familiar with the curricu- lar activities related to the “New Basics” described in this book, and the use of Skinner’s teaching machine (Mastery Learning and Mastery Teaching assisted by the computer) to indoctrinate stu- dents in international, federal, state and foundation funded predetermined be- havioral objectives (correct answers). ————— \u0001 ————— N O ONE WILL GET BETWEEN YOUR CHILD AND THAT CURRICULUM Mastery Learning is based on the premise that virtually all students can learn if they are given the time and help they need. In other words, if your child doesn’t agree that the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe after World War II was “primarily a result of the Soviet Union’s desire for security along its borders” (the “correct” multiple choice answer to a question in Maine’s Assessment of Progress test item bank – most states now have similar partially federally- funded assessment programs and com- puterized test item banks), he will be recycled and remediated, using all the time, help, and resources necessary, un- til like a little robot, he spits out the “cor- rect” answer. Even more shocking is a performance in- dicator taken from Missouri’s Educa- tional Objectives, Grade Twelve: “Given a description of an individual with a debased character, such as a child murderer or a person who has set fire to an inhabited building, students should reject suggestions for punishment which would detract from the dignity of the prisoner ...” Aside from the above totalitarian impli- cations of Mastery Learning, consider how your taxes will skyrocket in order to pay for an education system which, according to Bloom, is determined, no matter how long it takes, to successfully “challenge student’s fixed beliefs.” Such belief manipulation will be assisted by computer courseware as forecast by Dustin Heuston of Utah’s World Insti- tute for Computer-Assisted Teaching (WICAT) when he said, “We’ve been absolutely staggered by realizing that the computer has the capability to act as if it were ten of the top psychologists working with one student ... You’ve seen the tip of the iceberg. Won’t it be wonderful when the child in the smallest country in the most distant area or in the most confused urban setting can have the equivalent of the finest school in the world on that terminal and no one can get between that child and that curriculum ? We have great moments coming in the history of education.” 42 [ Emphasis added ] WICAT has joined with the multina- tional corporation Control Data to form PLATO/WICAT Systems Company. Ac- cording to its brochure, “The merger brings together the most advanced, far-r eaching educa- tional delivery system for the K-12 public and private markets.

It says, “Concepts of mastery learning and management by objectives are likely to be very attractive to educators in developing countries. Once these educators have made the mental transition to learner centered educational planning, then they can be more receptive to procedures for specifying and analyzing objectives and then for organizing a teaching/ 9 Back To Basics Reform, Or...OBE *Skinnerian International Curriculum? | by Charlotte T.

Under a subtitle “Expert and Novice Thinking” the authors say, “Recent studies in science education have revealed that students approach learning with many prior conceptions based on their life experiences, which can be obstacles to learning. These conceptions are very resistant to change. We need to understand why students’ conceptions persevere so strongly and how they can best be modified .” 44 [ Emphasis added ] They probably mean conceptions (fixed beliefs such as not believing they are de- scended from apes upon which the be- haviorists’ education system is based). Wouldn’t it be more efficient and less costly for the taxpayers if we just turned our children over to the educators at birth so that their “conceptions” will not reflect our old-fashioned values, atti- tudes and beliefs? ————— \u0001 ————— T EACHERS NEED TO BE RETRAINED TO FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL NEEDS The retraining of teachers to be learner- centered (training in how to arrange the environment and to manipulate indi- vidual students, using positive and negative reinforcement, etc., in order to elicit “correct” behaviors/responses, and “socially responsible and compliant behavior as promoted by Skinner, Spady, Corrigan, et al), is evidently a criteria of would be required to have individual education plans; and his logical fear that the parental consent provision for spe- cial education students might be re- quired for ALL students, thereby open- ing up a can of worms far more threat- ening to the education establishment than the present Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment: ALL parents hav- ing the right to review ALL educational materials and methods and to withhold consent for subjection of their children to computerized individual education plans and objectionable methods and programs? ————— \u0001 ————— T EACHERS WHO RESIST RETRAINING WON ’ T RECEIVE MERIT PAY Scanlon’s prediction in 1974 about “free- ing the individual from subject matter” has come true in Kennebunk where “teachers need to be retrained to focus on individual needs rather than on con- tent areas.” I hope my reader will study the Kennebunk quote since it reflects ac- curately what the schools are doing not only to our children , but also to our good teachers , in order for the schools to be “recognized” (rewarded) by the U.S. De- partment of Education. You can be sure that teachers who resist such re-training will not receive merit pay, nor will they rise on the much-touted career ladders, implementation of which are being funded by the U.S. Secretary of Education’s Discretionary Fund (multi-million dol- lar slush fund that focuses on implemen- tation of priority federal policies and programs affecting our local schools.) ————— \u0001 ————— T EACHERS ARE WAK ING UP ! Subject matter teachers do not want to become personal guidance counselors (unlicensed psychologists) or facilitators of political and social indoctrination. (Researchers at a recent conference of the American Education Research Associa- tion who said “Writing can be used to clarify students’ values and even alter the U.S. Department of Education’s Sec- ondary School Recognition Program. A government publication, Profiles in Ex- cellence, 1982-1983, Secondary School Rec- ognition Program, a Resource Guide , lists the Kennebunk, Maine High School as one which schools across the nation may wish to emulate. (The school itself states in another publication that the school’s program may become a national model.) The Guide states “The major goal of the school’s curriculum is to individualize the learning process for the student. The district is in the process of developing a data bank for students and a testing pro- gram for determining expectancy in- structional levels for each student. Once this is in place, staff will develop an In- dividual Education Plan (IEP) for each student to meet individual needs. The major difficulty the school is encounter- ing in implementing this new process is the secondary staff who are trained as subject matter teachers .” (Meaning: those good teachers your children have who teach them grammar, math, and history!) “ Teachers need to be retrained to focus on individual needs rather than on content areas .” 45 [ Emphasis added ] ————— \u0001 ————— S ECRETARY B ELL KNEW ALL STUDENTS WOULD HAVE IEP’ S In Kennebunk, the special education staff (teachers of the handicapped) are training the regular classroom teachers (teachers of the non-handicapped) in how to develop individual education plans for regular classroom students. Since federal special education law re- quires parental consent in the develop- ment of IEPs and future plans seem to call for computerized IEPs and manage- ment systems for ALL students across the nation, it would be discriminatory not to include ALL students under the parental consent requirement. Could former Secretary Bell’s efforts in 1981 to eliminate the parental consent re- quirement for special education students have had anything to do with his knowl- edge that in the future ALL students 10 Back To Basics Reform, Or...OBE *Skinnerian International Curriculum? | by Charlotte T.

Better late than never! ————— \u0001 ————— T OTAL ACCOUNTABILITY ( CONTROL ) NOT YET INSTITUTIONALIZED The present absence of an Outcome- based Mastery Learning and Teaching system, “institutionalized in all schools of the nation” allows the “reform” com- ponents in the K-12 experience described in this book to remain disorganized and subject to teacher censorship and inde- pendence (not conforming to the school’s new objectives or methods) and students escape from mastery (indoctri- nation) in the “New Basics.” Currently, the educationists’ goals are implemented on a “hit or miss” basis since the “total” accountability system, so necessary for international and na- tional planning, has not yet been insti- tutionalized. This hit or miss aspect, plus school boards who refuse to install com- puter terminals in individual school buildings and good subject matter-ori- ented teachers who resist implementing the reforms, are the only reasons why one still finds students who are essen- tially literate, who still believe in abso- lute values of right and wrong, and who still love the United States of America and will defend its sovereignty from the assaults of the globalist social engineers. Good teachers will be the victims of op- erant conditioning, as is blatantly spelled out in an article in the May 1985 issue of The Effective School Report entitled “Principals’ Expectations as a Motivat- ing Factor in Effective Schools.” This ar- ticle states in part: “The principal expects specific behaviors from particular teachers which should then translate into achievement by the students of these teachers; because of these varied expectations, the principal behaves differently toward different teachers, i.e., body language, verbal interac- tions and resource allocations . This treatment also influences the attitudes of the teacher toward the principal and their perception of the future utility of any increased effort toward student achievement. If this treatment is consistent over time, and if the teachers do not resist change, it will shape their behavior and through it the achievement of their students... With time teachers’ behavior, self-concepts of ability, perceptions of future utility, attitude toward the principal, and students’ achievement will conform more and more closely to the behavior originally expected of them .” [ Emphasis added ] 47 Note the repeated use of the word “treatment” which is classic Skinnerian behavior modifi- cation/operant conditioning. The Effective School Movement, with its emphasis on so-called “accountability, equity, excellence, and outcomes,” re- quires “new” criteria for teacher certifi- cation: new Skinnerian performance- based teacher evaluation instruments based to a large extent on teacher val- ues, attitudes, and beliefs (affective) cri- teria; constant retraining, i.e., Kennebunk, to focus on students’ indi- vidual (academic/personal/psychologi- cal) needs, and computer terminals in each school building to collect and store information on students and teachers for easy retrieval and constant monitoring and recycling until they exhibit the cor- rect behavior. Elam Hertzler, Secretary Bell’s top assis- tant in the U.S. Department of Educa- tion, told State Superintendents of In- struction at the annual Washington, D.C. meeting of the Council of Chief State School Officers in 1982: “One of the elements of an effective school was to monitor, assess, and feedback ... As little as 5 percent of a school budget K-12 would be needed over a period of 12 years to enable each student to have his own computer, and this is within our cost range.” ————— \u0001 ————— N O ONE WILL ESCAPE SYSTEM ’ S CONTROL The movement lacks only the Skinnerian “national learning system” (the purpose of the Far West Laboratory grant and other Mastery Learning grants, includ- ing the NEA Mastery in Learning Project supported by the U.S. Department of Education’s labs and centers) to lock in the Mastery Learning and Teaching com- ponents for “New Basics” indoctrination which, in turn will “match” the feder- ally-funded questions on the current state and forthcoming national and in- ternational achievement tests. Once the system is in place, no one will escape its control , not even private schools, and Skinnerian rewards and awards (posi- tive reinforcement which former Secre- tary Bell prefers to call “incentives”) will be given to administrators, teachers, stu- dents, businessmen, school board and community members who go along with the objectives of the national/interna- tional curriculum. Those who resist such control (retain their individualism) will be isolated in their schools and commu- nities (negative reinforcement). Watch your local newspapers for news of school boards reducing staff (weeding out those administrators and teachers who don’t go along). Indications are that this is going on right now. Parents and school board members who don’t go along will continue to be labeled anti- education and negative. ————— \u0001 ————— “V ERY FEW OF THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ’ RE BUILDING ...” The educational accountability/man- agement systems such as Planning, Pro- gramming, Budgeting Systems (PPBS) 11 Back To Basics Reform, Or...OBE *Skinnerian International Curriculum? | by Charlotte T.

These systems, all of which serve the same purpose, have been devised to “force schools to discover what they are doing with their money.” In essence, they call for a school district to come to a conclusion about what educational goals it seeks, develop programs to reach those goals (including teacher training and evaluation programs), approve the spending needed, measure the results, readjust programs according to results obtained, and recycle students and teachers when necessary in order for them to exhibit “correct” behaviors. If any other system (family, political, eco- nomic, religious, etc.) is in conflict with Bloom’s purpose of education and the schools—“to change the thoughts, feel- ings and actions of students” or his defi- nition of good teaching—“challenging the students’ fixed beliefs,” that system becomes a problem which stands in the way of the education system’s goals and objectives. The systems are problem- solving tools which are used not only for measuring and evaluating the academic standards of students, but also for mea- suring and evaluating students’ and teachers’ behavior and attitudes. Utilizing the system’s tools of MBO or PPBS and Bloom’s TAXONOMY , the planners are able to determine the attitudes of individual students and teachers on specific issues, as well as their broad outlook toward life. If their attitudes do not measure up to the pre-determined international, national and state goals and behavioral objectives, they will be recycled or reprogrammed, using Mas- tery Learning and Mastery Teaching operant conditioning, until their atti- tudes, feelings and behavior match the government’s goals and objectives. Dr. Robert Corrigan, a close associate of Professor B.F. Skinner, has over the past twenty-five years developed such a sys- tem-wide educational engineering or in- dustrial model called S.A.F.E. (System- atic Approach for Effectiveness). It has been endorsed by (among others) Pro- fessor William Spady, the Director of the Far West Laboratory Outcome-based Education Project, and Professor Homer Coker of the University of Georgia, who developed, with National Institute of Education funds, a controversial stan- dardized teacher evaluation instrument with 420 teacher characteristics (compe- tencies)! A 400 page how-to manual entitled EDU- CATION FOR RESULTS: IN RESPONSE TO A NATION AT RISK , describes Corrigan’s federally-funded S.A.F.E. model. On page 155, Corrigan states, “The following successive phases were performed to test out the theoretical concepts of increased mastery learning effectiveness: Phase 1. To design and to extensively field-test a group instructional learning-centered program applying those programmed instructional principles postulated by Skinner and Crowder to be combined with the techniques of System Analysis for installing required system-wide managing-for-results processes including the accountable perfor- mance by teachers, principals and support personnel. This program would be ‘packaged’ for use by teachers to deliver predictable achievement of defined mastery- learning objectives...” 48 Florida’s Associate Commissioner of Education, Cecil Golden, said in regard to these systems and those implement- ing them, “...and, like those assembling an atom bomb, very few of them understand exactly what they’re building, and won’t until we put all the parts together.” 49 ————— \u0001 ————— M ASTERY L EARNING PLUGS INTO MBO LIKE A HAND SLIPS INTO A GLOVE The Far West Laboratory grant to put Outcome-based (Results Based) Mastery Learning, which plugs into PPBS, MBO or SAFE like a hand slips into a glove, into “all schools of the nation,” was wait- ing in the wings until almost all states had implemented PPBS, MBO, SAFE or whatever else the educators call their management/accountability system, had their computer terminals on line, and had mandated their goals for edu- cation, specifying certain behavioral ob- jectives, skills, and attitudes necessary for promotion from level to level and for graduation. ————— \u0001 ————— F EDERALLY - FUNDED GOALS COLLECTION BLATANTLY DECLARES WHAT WILL TA K E PLACE IN THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS Although local citizens are assured THEIR goals and objectives were deter- mined LOCALLY, evidence proves oth- erwise.

The present reforms very simply deal with how to systematize the controver- sial non-academic “therapy” compo- nents of education which caused our nation to be “at risk” and which, inter- estingly enough, were not even men- tioned in “A Nation at Risk.” Proof of this is found in a recent grant applica- tion which was subsequently approved by the U.S. Department of Education, from the Indian Springs School district in Justice, Illinois to the U.S. Department of Education for $80,000 to conduct a project entitled Computer-Assisted Net- work Systems (C.A.N.S.). The application says, “With the implementation of this proposal C.A.N.S. teachers and admin- istrators will be afforded the opportunities to expend much more time with students in the affective domain of learning... ” i.e., attitudes, values, and beliefs education. ————— \u0001 ————— E NFORCEMENT OF P UPIL R IGHTS A MENDMENT THREATENS WORLD GOVERNMENT CURRICULUM Since the use of many of the controver- sial “therapy” components requires in- formed parental consent under the 1978 Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment, it is understandable that the mammoth education establishment is having hysterics over the recently approved regulations to enforce the amendment, and is lob- bying the Congress to overturn the law. If the regulations are strictly enforced, the schools will have to do the unthink- able: let parents and taxpayers in on their well-kept federally-funded curriculum research, development, and dissemina- tion-across-the nation secrets. Such en- forcement would spell disaster for their plans to convert our children into advo- cates of the coming socialist one world government. ————— \u0001 ————— G OVERNMENT TO OPERATE THROUGH S KINNERIAN TECHNIQUES ? Skinner says in TECHNOLOGY OF TEACHING , 1968: “Absolute power in education is not a serious issue today because it seems out of reach. However, a technology of teaching will need to be much more powerful if the race with catastrophe is to be won, and it may then, like any powerful technol- ogy, need to be contained. An appropriate counter control will not be generated as a revolt against aversive measures but by a policy designed to maximize the contribu- tion which education will make to the strength of the culture. The issue is important because the govern- ment of the future will probably operate mainly through educational techniques .” 51 [ Emphasis added ] The views of Skinner, and others who authorize funding of curricula, must be challenged on all counts. Not only our children, but all the world’s children, for generations to come, must be allowed to live WITH freedom and dignity, not BEYOND FREEDOM AND DIGNITY , as spelled out by Skinner in his book of the same title. ————— \u0001 ————— C ONGRESS WILL ACT IF ENOUGH A MERICANS DEMAND AN INVESTIGATION Our government is still “the people’s government, made for the people, by the people and answerable to the people.” 52 Only the people—each one individually —can turn education around through pressure on their elected representatives to conduct a congressional investigation of the subversive activities of the U.S. Department of Education AND certain corporations and tax-exempt foundations. A 1981 report on the very important fed- erally-funded National Assessment of Educational Progress by Willard Wirtz (a promoter of MACOS) and Archie LaPointe, describes the influence wielded by three important foundations when it says: “In a different sense, this report is designed to meet the responsibilities imposed at least implicitly by the three foundations which have initiated and have supported the project: The Carnegie Corporation, the Ford Foundation, and the Spencer Foundation.” 53 ————— \u0001 ————— S TAT E D EPARTMENTS OF E DUCATION MUST ALSO BE ABOLISHED Such an investigation is essential to jus-"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"14 Back To Basics Reform, Or...OBE *Skinnerian International Curriculum? | by Charlotte T. Iserbyt tify the abolition of the U.S. Department of Education, its experimental laborato- ries and centers, and eventually, through state legislative action, ALL fifty state departments of education which are nothing but powerful, federally-funded clones of the U.S. Department of Educa- tion, clicking their heels in unison at ev- ery federal policy initiative in order to keep the bucks rolling into their state education coffers. (The former U.S. Office of Education and present U.S. Department of Education have over the years provided hundreds of millions of dollars to the state depart- ments of education through their State Capacity Building grants, the purpose of which is to increase federal control over the local schools. Even top educators now admit in their learned journals that the state departments of education have total control over the local schools.) ————— \u0001 ————— O NLY YOU CAN SINK THE TREACHEROUS ICEBERG CALLED E DUCATION FOR W ORLD C ITIZENSHIP For those few who, after reading this book, may question the need for such drastic action, let me remind them that the goings-on described herein consti- tute just the tip of a gigantic and treach- erous international, federal, and founda- tion-funded iceberg labeled Education for World Citizenship, as outlined in the National Education Association’s 1976 Bicentennial Program, “Declaration of Interdependence: Education for a Global Community” with community defined as “the equitable sharing of like values.” Whether or not the United States of America, through citizen preoccupation with fashion, TV, sports, gourmet cook- ing, jogging, making a living, etc., all of which are perfectly legitimate and worthwhile activities in a “free” society, and lack of understanding of the inter- nationalists’ use of Gradualism and Hegelian Philosophy to attain their goals, slides into the totalitarian Black Hole of a socialist one world government, with the resulting loss of freedoms our ances- tors fought and died for, depends on whether YOU, the reader, are convinced the problems described in this book are serious enough for you to spend a few minutes writing to your elected officials. You should send them a copy of this book and request from them (1) the materials related to the grants and programs described herein; (2) a Congressional investigation (with balance in the selection of witnesses) of the U.S. Department of Education and its labs and centers, and of cer- tain corporations and tax-exempt foundations which control American education; and (3) abolition of the U.S. Department of Education and its labs and centers. Should such an effort prove successful, the next step is to convince your state legislators to abolish the powerful state departments of education since they are nothing but surrogates of the federal Department of Education and through heavy federal funding in the past could very likely stand on their own, even if the U.S. Department of Education were abolished. Also, persuade at least ten friends to take the same action. Copies of correspon- dence with your elected officials and of this book should be sent to President Ronald Reagan under cover of a letter requesting that he honor his 1980 pledge to the American people to abolish the U.S. Department of Education and that HE reply to your letter and not send it to the Department of Education for reply. If the present situation continues un- checked, by the year 1998 children now in kindergarten will have been through thirteen years of Skinnerian world gov- ernment brainwash, under the deceptive guise of the “New Basics,” you and I may well no longer be around to vote, and the 18-year-olds may well be on their way to vote what historians refer to as the greatest experiment in human freedom – straight down the tubes.

The majority of outcomes on state tests (assessments) now deal with politi- cally-correct attitudes.

When you are told by educators that Outcome-based Education (OBE) and Direct Instruction is not Skinnerian Mastery Learning/Direct Instruction (ML/DI), show them the following statement by William Spady, sociolo- gist and international leader in the OBE/ML movement, which appeared in an article entitled “On Outcome- based Education: A Conversation with Bill Spady,” Educational Leadership , De- cember 1992/January 1993. “In January of 1980 we convened a meeting of 42 people to form the Network for Outcome-Based Schools. Most of the people who were there—Jim Block, John Champlin—had a strong back- ground in mastery learning, since it was what OBE was called at that time. But I pleaded with the group not to use the name “Mastery Learning” in the Network’s new name because the word “mastery” had already been destroyed through poor implementation...” (Classic case of semantic deception at work which rears its ugly head again in 1993 with denials that OBE is ML.) When you are told by educators that OBE/ML is not a Skinnerian Dumb- down System of Education, focusing on behavioral change (collectivism vs. individualism), show them the fol- lowing statement by Jim Block, Spady’s co-worker, which appeared in an article by him entitled: “Mas- tery Learning: The Current State of the Craft,” Educational Leadership , November 1979. “One of the striking personal features of mastery learning, for example, is the degree to which it encourages cooperative individu- alism in student learning as opposed to selfish competition. Just how much room is there left in the world for individualists who are more concerned with their own performance than the performance of others. One of the striking societal features of mastery learning is the degree to which it presses for a society based on the excellence of all participants rather than one based on the excellence of a few. Can any society afford universal excellence, or must all societies make most people incompe- tent so that a few can be competent?” F IND OUT MORE ABOUT THE DUMBING DOWN OF EDUCATION the deliberate dumbing down of america ...A Chronological Paper Trail (1999; First printing 1999, Second printing 2000, third printing 2001) by Charlotte T.
