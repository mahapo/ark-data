That she is like a fox when she gains equality, and she is like a tiger when in the majority. Some may question the validity of such similes. In this brief study I look at how the System of Rome has worked in the United States where she has always been in the minority and then I look at El Salvador where she was decidedly in the majority. The reader can then weigh the validity of Macaulay's discernment. When I speak of Rome, I am speaking of the System of Roman Catholicism as it operates out of the Vatican State. There are obviously many different types of Roman Catholic clergy. In this study the readers will see Roman Catholic priests who fought alongside the Marxist Revolutionaries, some others who opposed them, some who participated in the armed struggles to help defenseless women and children, others who remained aloof. The readers will see Roman Catholics being killed and they will see Roman Catholics doing the killing. It is this seemingly confused picture which mystifies many people today. In this study I try to cast some light on the confusion. The System of Rome is out to control the world. How this System works in different countries to achieve this goal, is the theme of this study.

Ecumenical religion has sought to unite all religions into one harmonious whole. At first the ecumenists sought only to unite all \"Christians,\" liberal Protestants, Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Pentecostals, Evangelicals, and Reformed. As the \"Christian\" ecumenical movement gained momentum it began to look beyond \"Christianity\" in its universalism. Overtures to various other world religions began to be made until the great meeting at Assisi in 1986. At this meeting, presided over by the Pope of Rome, close to two hundred different religions met for prayer and mutual fellowship. The upshot of the various triumphs of ecumenicity has been the confusion generated among those who are dragging their feet in this glorious pilgrimage to Nirvana. Millions of \"conservatives\" in their various religions are not impressed with the trade-offs made to achieve unity. So that while liberal Jews may join with \"Christians,\" Orthodox Jews are more intense than ever in keeping Judaism free from outside Gentile contamination. Liberal Muslims may meet and talk of unity but millions of militant Muslims are more determined than ever to make their states totally Islamic. Liberal Roman Catholics may have various ecumenical services with Protestants and Jews, but conservative Roman Catholics recoil in horror from updated-masses, ecumenical services, and what they see as the destruction of historic Roman Catholicism. Liberal Protestants may meet with Jews and Roman Catholics and Muslims, but fundamental Protestants repudiate such compromise as unscriptural and decidedly anti-scriptural. So that although much attention is given by the modern news media to all the great unity meetings and the wonderful ecumenical spirit, there are millions in all religions who are not impressed. The amazing anomaly in all of this is that the Protestant militant opposers of ecumenicity seem to come in for the harshest criticism by the news media and by television. Modern humor is directed more against fundamental Protestantism than any other religion. All in the Family depicted Archie Bunker as a white ignorant Protestant who was bigoted toward all other religions and races. He was supposedly a Christian who was away behind in every aspect of life. -1 -"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The same animus is NOT directed toward other religions. When bearded, hatted, Orthodox Jews are embroiled in controversy, as they often have been in recent years, there is scarcely a word of negative criticism directed toward them, and they are NEVER made the butt of humor. They are praised for their strict allegiance to the Jewish laws and the general public is told that they are interested in returning Israel to a Jewish state where Old Testament laws would once again govern the people. In other words, excuses are made for their sometimes violent behavior, and explanations are given as to why they act in such a manner. When militant Muslims kill hundreds of people in places like the Sudan, the news media quickly inform the American public that Muslims in the United States believe in living peaceably with their neighbors, and they all repudiate such violence. In the United States news media very little is ever reported about TOTALLY Islamic states or the intention of Islamic militants to create Totally Islamic nations, or in other words Islamic theonomies! So a confused picture comes across in the news media when modern religion is the subject. Few people today know that Mystery Babylon the Great means Mystery Confusion the Great The System of Rome is at the core of Mystery Babylon the Great. This religious conglomerate has grown throughout church history, and is the avowed enemy of God's elect people. In every era since Paul first wrote about the Mystery of Iniquity the great system of the Man of Sin has been growing and expanding. It expands because the majority of people do not \"RECEIVE THE LOVE OF THE TRUTH THAT THEY MIGHT BE SAVED.\" For this very rejection of the truth they are sent a strong delusion so that all might be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. (II Thess. 2.10-11) Calvin's comment on this passage is illuminating: He (Paul) speaks of the WORKING or EFFICACY of Satan, and alludes particularly to this when he adds WITH SIGNS AND LYING WONDERS, AND WITH ALL DECEIT. And certainly, if this is to be contrasted with the kingdom of Christ, it must consist partly of false doctrine and deceptions and partly of false miracles. The kingdom of Christ consists of the doctrine of truth and the power of the Spirit.

Christ by the doctrine of His Gospel enlightens our minds to eternal life; Antichrist, trained under the direction of Satan, deals destruction to the ungodly by his godless doctrine... and confirms poor worthless creatures in their error by his delusions... Without any doubt we have a notable demonstration of this in the Papacy. No words can express how foul is the abomination of the papists, how massive and shameful are their superstitions, and how far removed their ravings are from common sense. None who have even a moderate acquaintance with sound doctrine can think of such depravity without the utmost horror. How then, does the world gape in astonishment at them, unless it is because men have been blinded and turned into dunderheads. 1 * Dunderheads surely then must abound today. For millions of those who are supposedly saved and know the truth, apparently believe the lie at the same time. CONFUSION is the hallmark of this generation when it comes to an understanding of the gross errors, superstitions, blasphemies, and goals of the Vatican and the pope today. This confusion is generated in many ways in many countries. In the North of Ireland the Confusion is generated by violence and terror; in the United States it is produced by the propaganda of Rome and the Ecumenical Movement. One of the main areas of confusion in the United States is the propaganda promoting the \"Christian Social Order.\" In the following chapter the involvement of the Roman Catholic System in general, and the Jesuits in particular, in setting up this social order, are examined. * It is surely interesting to note how many men call themselves Calvinists today who completely repudiate John Calvin's position on the papacy.

As the popes gained more power in the dark ages they would play off one prince against another. Wars resulted from such antagonisms. The general public many times was left in a state of disarray and confusion after the bloodshed and massacres ended. After the Reformation the Jesuits worked all kinds of mischief to destabilize Protestant governments. In England, in the Elizabethan era, all kinds of Romish plots and Jesuit conspiracies were the order of the day. England, at that time was rightly perceived to be the most powerful opponent of Rome, and therefore every effort was made to undermine and overthrow that Protestant kingdom. The effort continues today unabated. Some Roman Catholic writers claim that such plots were exaggerated and an unnecessary anti-papal hysteria created. Yet when one studies that time it is obvious that the historical records substantiate the charge. One can only imagine the thrill of horror which must have gone through England when the plot by Guy Fawkes, to blow up the Houses of Parliament, was discovered before it could be executed. Guy Fawkes, and his well-known Gunpowder Plot, certainly substantiates beyond dispute that such plots were indeed taking place in England at that time. * The System of Rome has always worked in many ways to gain control of a nation. At times violence is used, as in El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Northern Ireland in recent times, at other times and in other nations, a different approach is used. * An English singing star was recently interviewed on television and asked about Halloween. She said she did not know much about Halloween for she had always kept Nov. 5, when Guy Fawkes would be burned in effigy to commemorate the Gunpowder Plot. She then went on to link the Roman Catholic IRA and their bombs with Guy Fawkes and the attempt to destroy Protestant liberty even today. Needless to say the interviewer was taken aback by such truth! Not knowing much about modern singers I do not know her name. -4-"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"In the United States, which has the largest Protestant population of any country in the world, Rome has been using the method of political propaganda to try to convert the United States to Roman Catholicism. The Jesuits began their propaganda barrage in the 1930's. They used the euphemism \"Christian Social Order\" to advance their cause. It is surely nothing short of incredible that the \"Reformed\" theonomist took up the Jesuit idea a generation later. As true Reformation Protestantism has declined in the United States, a PATHETIC pretender has arisen to take its place called, Reformed Theonomy. The lovely term \"Christian Social Order\" has now been taken up by Evangelicals, Charismatics, Reformed, and the so-called Christian Right, as the goal to be achieved by all these Protestants working together with Roman Catholics in the political arena. Some of the stronger evangelicals repudiate certain dogmas of Rome, but have agreed, that in order to \"save\" America, the help of Roman Catholics is needed in the social and political areas. So theological differences have been shelved in order to focus attention on crucial social and moral problems. The Reformed Theonomist is in the forefront of this \"cultural struggle.\" The Reformed Theonomists have written large tomes on the need for \"Christian Reconstruction\" to begin in the United States. They have proclaimed loud and often that biblical LAW is to be the basis of such a Christian Reconstruction. The more I have studied Reformed Theonomy the more I have come to realize that although many naive people now call it \"Reformed\" Theonomy, it is more correctly a Roman Catholic Theonomy and, if one wanted to get technical, really a JESUIT VATICANOMY! In fact, I have found almost every major emphasis of the purported \"Reformed\" Theonomy to be present in the writings of the Jesuits earlier in this century. Every important TERM and CONCEPT used by the \"Reformed\" Theonomist, is taken whole from the Jesuits. Terms such as, RECONSTRUCTION, the CULTURAL STRUGGLE, or KULTURKAMPF, the LAW as the basis of this reconstruction, the praising of the MEDIEVAL PRE- REFORMATION SYSTEM, the attacks on the REFORMATION, as still-born, the idea of reconstruction coming through an HIERARCHICAL SYSTEM, and the idea of using all segments of society such as doctors, lawyers, politicians, even entertainment, -5-"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"as a help to this reconstruction of society, are all taken whole from the Jesuits. Even the term \"Christian Social Order\" was first coined by the Jesuits. The whole idea of creating a Christian Social Order goes back to a postmillennial eschatology. Postmillennialism taught that the church would preach its message and the greater part of the earth would be converted and then Christ would return to a primarily converted world.** However, historic postmillennialism was quite different from Jesuit postmillennialism. Protestant postmillennialists, such as George Whitefield, believed that the papacy was the ANTICHRIST! Jesuit-Reformed-Theonomists hold no such view of the papacy. The Jesuits have worked to bring the papacy into a place of dominance and control so that in essence a papal Vaticanomy, the rule of the pope, can be achieved. The Reformed Theonomist is apparently willing to work with the papacy to achieve whatever goal he has in mind. The Jesuit idea of a \"Christian\" Social Order, was a social order governed by the pope of Rome. They have not been slack in teaching the necessity of submission to the pope, the man they call the Vicar of Christ, but the man, the historic Protestant postmillennialists called the Antichrist! To find the roots of Reformed Reconstructionism one must go back about eighty years to the writing of the German Jesuits. The Jesuit writer 'lather\" Hugger wrote just after the close of World War I about the need for social reconstruction. We are facing a ruinous state of affairs. Once again the work of restoration will have to be accomplished by the youth. Will the congregation of Mary not go forth for the third time as the instrument of RECONSTRUCTION chosen by Divine Providence? 1 Jesuit \"father\" Overmanns wrote almost at the same time that \"the rock of positive moral Christian law is the foundation of this reconstruction.\" 2 The Jesuit magazine \"America\" wrote, long before the Reformed Theonomist James B. Jordan extolled a government by hierarchy, that leadership in the reconstruction ** For further reading see our studies on Reconstructionism, Antichrist, and Premillennialism. -6-"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"of America would not come from the laity, but from the top down, through the Hierarchy. The German Jesuits also wrote about the KULTURKAMPF -- the cultural struggle - which the Reformed Theonomists also envision. This cultural struggle was then imported into the United States in the early 1930's by the Jesuits. The Reformed Theonomist apparently thinks the cultural struggle is more important than the spiritual struggle in which God's people have always been involved throughout history. The believing remnant throughout church history has always fought with the Whore of Babylon and indeed like the dissenters before the Reformation, and the Protestant Reformers and those who followed them, have always seen this struggle as the main war that is to be fought as far as this world is concerned. The Jesuits had to be careful what they said and how they said it, earlier in this century, for the United States was much more biblically Protestant then than she is now. So, true to her lamb-like nature when in the minority, the Jesuits carefully introduced their social philosophy and their subtle attacks on the American way of life. The Jesuits started their work in the Roman Catholic ethnic enclaves in the big cities for the most part. At that time, their message never got beyond the Roman Catholic audience. McDonough, in writing about the Jesuit Husslein, wrote that his message was so interlarded with special pleading for Catholic causes -- against secular education (does that not sound familiar) and the evils imputed to the Reformation generally -- that his message could not have reached far beyond the Catholic ghetto. 3 Husslein, and his fellow Jesuits, longed for a return to the Medieval Construct. They viewed big business and American ingenuity as \"the monstrous product of Protestant individualism.\" 4 They used their attacks against secular education and Protestant individualism to set the table for their attempt to \"return\" the United States to a pre-Reformat ion social order. This Romanized Medieval Construct they called the Christian Social Order.

They used euphemisms such as the Christian Social Order helped to enhance the message. What Christian, for instance, could be against a Christian social order? It sounds inviting. It sounds like heaven on earth. It in fact sounded so good that so-called \"Reformed\" theonomists, and Charismatics such as Pat Robertson, have made it their own. Apparently someone forgot to tell these men that the word \"Christian\" did not mean Protestant Bible believing Christian, but in fact, really meant Roman Catholic. It was a ROMAN CATHOLIC SOCIAL ORDER, such as prevailed then in Spain and Portugal and later in Brazil, that the Jesuits were espousing. Just before World War II, the Jesuit, Edward Dowling, added his voice to the criticisms being raised against American Protestantism. Addressing the question, \"Is Democracy Doomed?\" he said that the Protestant Reformation from which Anglo-American democracy developed was the only revolution in history that went backward, the rise of the rich against the poor. The rebellion of Luther had brought in its train not only political upheaval but also capitalist individualism and social injustice. 6 It is almost incredible that any thinking individual could make such a statement.

Malachi Martin, the Roman Catholic ex-Jesuit, wrote concerning the Papal States just before they were taken from the papacy: Between 1823 (death of Pius VII) and 1846 (when Pius IX was elected), almost 200,000 citizens of the papal states were severely punished (death, life imprisonment, exile, galleys) for political offences; another 1.5 million were subject to constant police surveillance and harassment. There was a gallows permanently in the square of every town and city and village... A special tribunal sat permanently in each place to try, condemn, and execute the accused... Every pope tore up the stream of petitions that constantly came asking for justice, for the franchise, for reform of the police and prison system. When revolts occurred in Bologna, in the Romagna, and elsewhere they were put down with wholesale executions, sentences to lifelong hard labor... to exile, to torture. Secret societies abounded. Assassinations, robberies crime in general increased. 7 Millions of Roman Catholics fled Europe in the nineteenth century, and found political justice for the first time in their lives, in a state which arose from the GLORIOUS Protestant Reformation. An additional fact, which shows the utter fallacy in Dowling's words, is that MILLIONS CONTINUE TO FLEE FROM ALL OVER LATIN AMERICA TO THIS VERY HOUR, to come to a land totally different from their own. A land arising from the blessings of Protestantism, to escape from lands STILL CURSED by that very social order that Dowling espoused! One would think from reading the \"politically conservative\" literature of today that Protestantism was a great evil and Romanism a wonderful blessing to any state. Yet history does not show this to be true. Von Kuehnelt-Leddihn in his large tome on \"Leftism\" manages, like the Jesuits, to throw a few barbs at Protestantism. He manages with a supercilious backhand to equate all dissenting movements from Rome before the Reformation with what he calls \"Leftism.\" Leftism, of course, to most conservative Americans is a bad word. So by equating all dissenting and protestant movements with leftism, he manages to leave his -9-"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"readers with the idea that only Roman Catholicism can generate any real stand against all forms of Leftism, such as national socialism, and international communism. He does not stop there. He proceeds to claim that the England of the Puritans was also a \"breeding ground for leftist heresies which found their way to the United States.\" 8 So again he manages to cast suspicion upon Protestantism as a fertile field where all kinds of leftist evils flourish, without so much as a word of documentation. Three hundred pages later he again manages quite a broad- side against Protestantism by saying that \"leftism is always motivated by hatred.\" 9 So if Puritans and Protestants are leftist then one can only assume according to Von Kuehnelt-Leddihn's ++ great logic, that Protestants and Puritans are motivated by hatred while the Holy Roman Catholic Church must be always motivated by love and kindness! He never explains why Protestant nations on the whole tend to produce a better life style than Roman Catholic nations. Nor does he explain why so many countries in Latin America are still so riddled with poverty, disease, and crime, after more than 400 years of papal domination? Dowling, Husslein, and their fellow Jesuits espoused the same system that Morales Erhlich later desired for El Salvador, CORPORATISM. & This is a favorite political system of Rome supposedly halfway between Capitalism and Communism. It is a favorite of Roman Catholic authoritarian systems. It was popular at that time in Spain and Portugal, under Franco and Salazar, and some elements of it could also be seen in Argentina and Brazil.

They had very little freedom and were not allowed in Franco's Spain to publicly advertise the names of their churches or their church services. They were not allowed to publicly proselytize for new converts. The Corporatism of Spain was a completely closed system as far as Protestantism was concerned. What was even worse, in Spain persecution was unleashed against dissenters and forced conversions were common. Dissenters were jailed and murderous games were played upon them by their Roman Catholic guards. Patricio P. Escobali in his book Death flow tells of the firing squads that dissenters would be taken to and then after thinking they were going to be executed would be returned to their cells by laughing guardsmen. Some men would almost faint. For on occasion they would be shot so one never knew whether his time had come or not. This trick was also used by the North Vietnamese, but it preceded them by many years. As McDonough entitled his book about the Jesuits, Men Astutely Trained, the Jesuits are nothing, if not astute. They work hard at their task. They use all means to achieve their ends, that is why they were always viewed with suspicion by knowledgeable Protestants. So the Jesuits went to work to broaden the appeal for their Roman Catholic Social Order. First, by continually referring to it as a CHRISTIAN social order, they impressed many unwary Protestants who were disillusioned at the way America was going, morally and spiritually. In fact, this is why the Reformed theonomist has jumped on the Jesuit bandwagon. He was tired of what he perceived as an escapist pietistic Protestantism, which ignored governments, and looked for apocalyptic deliverance to save the day. So he is willing to work with Roman Catholics in the \"social arena\" to defeat secular humanism. Secondly, the Jesuits established the Institute of Social Order at West Baden, Indiana, in 1943. Two hundred Jesuits from across the United States met on Labor Day weekend to chart their course for the future of Romanism in the United States. Their plan of action was summed up in this way: \"to combine social philosophy, propaganda, and action.\" 10 McDonough in speaking of the propaganda of the Jesuits maintains that \"the writing of this handful of Jesuits struck a chord among Protestants as well.\" 11 They tried with their -11 -"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"propaganda to picture a return \"to rustic simplicities and dreamed of the restoration of a manorial way of life, self sufficient like a feudal demesne.\" 12 No doubt this did appeal to some Protestants. && At this juncture in American history there was a giant social upheaval taking place. Millions were leaving the family farm and either going into factories or to the battle front in World War II, either way, the breakup of the relatively peaceful rustic lifestyle was a reality, and heart wrenching, to those involved. Whether Protestants wanted to go back to a medieval manorial lifestyle governed by the papal hierarchy is another thing entirely. The Jesuits knew that they were operating in a predominantly Protestant country. So they had to be careful how they used their propaganda. They used, what they perceived as unfair labor practices against minorities, as a platform to help spread their message of a more \"Christian\" social order. So they attacked some of the harsher aspects of industrialization. They always managed to link Reformation Protestantism to them. The Jesuit, Joseph Husslein, excoriated what he called, \"the selfish spirit of rationalistic capitalism that sprang into being after the Reformation.\" 13 He viewed the precapitalist world of Europe as MORE egalitarian --- spiritually and materially MORE democratic — than the systems which followed.\" 14 (emphasis added) Only a person steeped in the System of Rome could ever make such a statement and actually believe it. For obviously, pre- Reformation Europe was a terrible place to live if one refused to knuckle under to the System of Rome. In fact, dissenters who refused to accept the System of Rome KNEW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OF EGALITARIANISM. They were hunted down, imprisoned, tortured, and massacred in practically every century of the Middle Ages, and their goods and property taken from them by the Inquisition. So the System which preceded the Reformation not only was not more egalitarian, nor even less egalitarian, than the system which followed the Reformation, EGALITARIANISM DID It is true that America is now going down spiritually. But this is because she is forsaking her glorious Reformation heritage. She is now listening in many ways to Rome and turning toward a system of idolatry which sits under the judgment of God. -12-"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"NOT EXIST BEFORE THE REFORMATION IN ANY PLACE WHERE THE SYSTEM OF ROME DOMINATED! Egalitarianism applied only to those who submitted to the Papacy. # Even worse, the religion of the times before the Reformation consisted primarily of masses for the dead, mariolatry and idolatry, and endless pilgrimages to useless shrines. The spiritual darkness could almost be felt in the papal theonomy achieved by Innocent III. It is important to note that what the Jesuits envisioned for the United States seventy years ago -- a Medieval Construct --is the very same idea the papacy has for Europe today. Arthur Noble writes about the re-medievalised Europe the papacy is working to achieve today: Historically, the concept of the nation-state has been anathema to the Vatican, whose tactics have been to rob sovereign nations of their nationhood and to (reduce them) to mere states or provinces of a single European nation-state controlled by her, even sub-dividing them internally where it suited her purposes. Her present goal is unchanged -- to RECREATE a RE- MEDIEVALISED Europe of small, ineffectual state which she can easily dominate. Already the map of Europe is becoming strikingly reminiscent of the period before World War I. The dissolution of the Habsburg Monarchy after the War (produced) nation-states on its former territory, such as Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Hungary. As Czechoslovakia recently split into its two constituent states, as Yugoslavia violently disintegrates into a jigsaw puzzle of its provinces and Hungary may still fall apart into ethnic regions, the familiar and unmistakable tactics of Rome become increasingly discernible (emphasis added). It is important to note that even secular writers notice that the same tactics are being applied to the United States today # The Vaudois, Waldenses, Bogomiles, Lollards, and Hussites were all harried and persecuted by this glorious egalitarian system lauded by Husslein and his Jesuit colleagues. These dissenters were driven almost to extinction under the NON- egalitarian system of the Roman Antichrist! -13-"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"only they do not see Rome behind them. B. A Nelson, in his work The Coming Triumph of Mexican Irredentism states the following: (Latino) separatism, considered from a perspective south of the Rio Grande, is Mexican Irredentism. ## Given a continuation of present demographic trends, it is certain as any projection of the future can be, that by the year 2080 the United States will have begun a process of geopolitical dissolution initiated by the proximate triumph of Mexican irredentism. 16 If one substitutes Roman Catholicism for the word Mexican, for in this case they are synonymous, then he sees the same thing in the future for the United States as is happening in Europe today. Rome works slowly but surely to achieve her ends. She takes the long view. For she knows that her prohibition against any form of family planning will produce big families, who by the sheer weight of numbers begin to take over a society and mold it for the Vatican. For example, the population of Mexico is now doubling every twenty years. Millions of illegal Mexican immigrants stream into the United States in such overwhelming numbers that all kinds of border controls with armed guards are being put in place to try to stop them. The Reformation certainly had its limitations, but it can safely be said that it was the root cause of more freedom and economic opportunity than any other movement in history since Irredentism is derived from the policy of certain Italians in 1878, who sought to join Italy to adjacent regions which were populated largely by Italians, but ruled by other governments. It is now used to describe any country which takes over another country by spreading into that country and thus assimilating the foreign state into itself. Modern examples are to be seen in the North of Ireland where Roman Catholics have been filtering in from Eire for the past seventy-five years, and in Kosovo where the Albanians have been doing likewise. Rome has used this strategy for centuries, and is still using it today, to try to gain power in countries where she lacks it and ultimately make them subservient to the Papacy. -14-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"the advent of the Christian Church. In Civilization and the Protestant Reformation, John W. Robbins summarizes Max Weber as follows: Max Weber, the German sociologist in his book The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, argued that capitalism historically emerged in Protestant countries because they inculcated those virtues that led to the development of capitalism: hard work, honesty, frugality, thrift, punctuality. These virtues, coupled with the idea of a calling, provided the impetus ending serfdom and establishing a free political and economic order. The Vatican, however, has detested the Reformation and has waged unceasing warfare against it educationally, theologically, sociologically, politically, and even militarily. Rome has been unrelenting in its attempts to picture Luther, Calvin, and their Reformation, as an evil that needs drastic correction. Husslein certainly never gave up in his attack upon capitalism and Protestantism. He described Protestant capitalism as an \"economic monstrosity of pagan selfishness.\" Over against this \"pagan\" selfishness Husslein set, what he called, \"idealized medievalism.\" 19 Husslein shrewdly spelled out his message in the United States, but he wanted everyone who read his writings to understand clearly what he was saying: Suppressed Catholicism is at the center of the social unrest. Suppressed Catholicism is the spirit struggling for liberation beneath the cracking, breaking, bursting shell of an UNNATURAL and UNCHRISTIAN social order. It is the PRE- REFORMATION spirit of social freedom, which the CHURCH ALONE can prevent from degenerating into lawlessness or injustice once it has achieved its liberation (emphasis added). 20 So while many writers blame the Protestants in the North of Ireland for the unrest there, this Jesuit priest acknowledges that it is Roman Catholicism which is at the CENTER of social unrest in Protestant countries. That it is Roman Catholicism which is struggling to break down the \"unnatural\" and \"unchristian\" social order created by the Protestant Reformation.

So his ideal social order is one ruled by the Pope of Rome where all the unnatural and unchristian elements of Protestantism have been destroyed, in other words a true Vaticanomy! It is interesting to note that while Reformed theonomists see the great KULTURKAMPF as a battle with the forces of secular humanism, Rome sees the cultural struggle mainly as against the \"unnatural\" and \"unchristian\" social order created by Protestantism. This same note is sounded in Ireland where there are few atheists. The battle there is plain for all to see: it is a battle which RAGES between antichristian Rome and the Bible-Protestantism of Ulster. At least in the island of Ireland there are no doubts as to who is fighting who: the great kulturkampf of the Jesuits is to overthrow Protestantism and unite the island under the domination of the same foreign state which curses El Salvador, the Vatican! One writer in the Daily Telegraph likened the Protestants of Eire (the Roman Catholic part of Ireland) to \"enfeebled Red Indians on remote reservations\" which is a true picture of Protestants in Eire. The same writer also wrote of the \"KULTURKAMPF (of the Roman Catholics) going so well\" 21 in the North of Ireland, that the Protestants there were hard pressed to retain their liberties. The Bible Protestants of Northern Ireland certainly understand the KULTURKAMPF of the Jesuits against Protestantism, even if the Reformed Theonomists of the United States do not! It is amazing how plain spoken some of the Jesuits were in the United States and yet many Protestant Americans even to this day, do not seem to grasp what the Jesuits were saying. The Jesuit priest, Francis Talbot in 1930, certainly spoke plain enough to those who understand English: The old Protestant culture is about at the end of its rope. The first settlers of our country established this distinctly Protestant culture, being chiefly from Protestant countries, so that our history from the beginning of the Republic has been predominantly non-Catholic.

This Christian culture is a wave receding, and we Catholics are living in a most important day, with one culture vanishing, and another gaining strength. Why can't we make the United Sates Catholic in legislation, Catholic in justice, aims, and ideals? We are the greatest numerically in the country, strong and growing in the arts and education. We are now ready to expand. Now is the time to organize and strike hard to put the Catholic ideal before all. 22 In 1937 the Apostolic Delegate to the United States added his voice to the Roman Catholic chorus: What we do want and what we shall work for to attain by all our means is a state completely Catholic, because such a country only can represent the ideal of human progress and because a Catholic people has the right to organize itself socially and politically according to the tenets of its faith. 23 This is the \"Christian Social Order\" the \"Reformed\" Theonomists are fighting to achieve in the United States today. They imagine that Rome is working with them to produce a \"Reformed\" theonomy; they do not understand that Rome has a Vaticanomy in mind which is a complete DESTRUCTION of anything Reformed, or anything to do with the Reformation! Since the 1930's the amount of papal propaganda in the United States has increased dramatically. From lecturing to the Roman Catholic ethnic enclaves Rome graduated to much larger audiences. Cardinal Spellman became the confidante to six different American Presidents, and was probably the key player in getting President Kennedy to intervene in Vietnam to try to uphold the Roman Catholic System in South Vietnam. Bishop Sheen made the Roman System more popular to millions of deluded Americans via his nationwide television ministry. The voices of Rome which had been somewhat muted in the previous years now took on a much more strident tone. \"Father\" Patrick O'Brien writing in L'Aurora in December, 1950 announced: We, the Hierarchy of the Holy Catholic Church, ... if -17-"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"necessary, shall change, amend, or blot out the present Constitution so that the President may enforce his, or rather our, humanitarian program and all phases of human rights as laid down by our saintly Popes and the Holy Mother Church ...

Our educational laws must be constructed to end that atheism, the Red Peril of totalitarianism, Protestantism, Communism, Socialism, and all other of like ilk and stamp, be driven from this fair land ... We control America and we do not propose to stop until America or Americans are genuinely Roman Catholic and remain so. 24 At almost the same time the official diocesan organ of the Roman Catholic System in Buffalo, New York, declared its intention of more quickly setting up a Vaticanomy in the United States. The Union and the Echo, stated that at the rate of 126,000 converts a year to Romanism, it would take too long to \"convert\" the United States, so the writer of this article advocated THEN, the same things the \"Reformed\" theonomists advocated a generation later: We must convert... Politics, Economics, Sociology, Business, Entertainment, Labor and Management, the Department of the State, and the Executive Branch of our government to Christian and hence Catholic principles. 25 Here the Hierarchy of Rome spells out clearly its goals for the United States. It is amazing when one takes into consideration the goals of the Christian Coalition, just how close they are to the goals of the Roman Catholic System. The Christian Coalition is bent on \"saving\" America with a UNION of Evangelicals, Reformed, and Roman Catholics all working together in these various areas to establish what must be a Vaticanomy -- the rule of the Pope. The Jesuits claim they are going to produce a \"Christian\" Social Order. The Hierarchy claims they are going to \"convert\" the United States to a country run by Roman Catholic principles. So if such goals were to be attained, the society produced by them can only be a Vaticanomy. So let us look then at the Vaticanomy of El Salvador. In this country the Roman Catholic -18-"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Hierarchy surely must have attained their \"Christian\" Social Order, for they have been ruling that region for around 400 years. Surely their goals have been achieved after 400 years of pursuing them. The Roman Catholic System has been in Central America since Pedro Arias de Avila beheaded Balboa and Hernandez in 1517. The Spaniards were to reign uncontested for three hundred years. In 1821 various rebellions broke out in Central America and the Spanish yoke was thrown off in the \"entire territory now known as Central America, and since split up into five republics,\" 26 Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, El-Salvador, and Nicaragua. While the Spaniards were sent packing, the Roman Catholic System actually increased its hold over the people. Justo Rufino Barrios led a revolt and became president of Guatemala in 1867 he proclaimed \"freedom of the press\" and the suppression of all Roman Catholic religious orders.\" 27 He tried to unify all of Central America under one central government but various cabals in Honduras and El Salvador kept the project from succeeding. Barrios was killed in a war with El Salvador and his reforms perished with him, leaving Rome in the driver's seat throughout Central America. So the Roman Catholic System has been in Central America for about 90 years longer than the Puritan-Protestant system has been in the United States. The Puritan pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock in 1620. Puritan Protestantism developed its social order in the United States. The Roman Catholic System developed its Vatican social order in Central America and El Salvador. So we can evaluate El Salvador in light of its heritage. We can see what was produced by the Roman System where there was no power to block the growth of a Roman Catholic Social Order. The study of history is important. For by looking back one can from his present vantage point examine statements made in the past and see if what was predicted has come to pass or not. For example, C. E. Wilcox made certain statements about the power of Rome in both the United States and Canada in his study in the early part of this century, entitled Must Canada Split. Wilcox believed back then that \"the Roman Catholic church has made impossible the assimilation of French Quebec into the rest of Canada, and has made a split in the Dominion INEVITABLE.\" (emphasis added) 28 -19-"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Wilcox, although generating very little support for his view sixty some years ago, can now be considered something of a prophet. For Quebec has been tottering on the brink of separation from the rest of Canada for the past ten years, and the agitation continues to this present hour. At about the same time that Wilcox was writing, Roman Catholic Bishop John F. Noll referred to the public school system of the United States as \"Public Enemy Number One.\" 29 Noll and his friends were advocating state support for the Roman Catholic parochial school system. Today they have achieved that goal in Wisconsin and are about to achieve it in several other states. I do not defend the present public school system but I certainly do not want my tax dollars going to support the parochial school system of Rome. Schools should pay for themselves, those who oppose them should not have to support systems which are diametrically opposite to what they believe. Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Jesuits, said more than four hundred years ago: \"let the beginning be as it may, as long as the outcome is ours.\" Certainly as one looks at Europe, Latin America, and North America, he would have to say that the outcome at present favors the Jesuits rather than the Reformers. -20-"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"References 1.

Simply put: it was a Jesuit perspective. Word games have ALWAYS been the specialty of the Jesuits. Jesuit Casuistry was something that every Protestant used to recognize in their struggles with Rome; nowadays scarcely one in ten thousand have any idea what the term means. A casuist is one who studies and resolves questions of morality, whether certain thoughts, actions, or conduct are right or wrong. However, it came to be used in a derogatory way because of the convoluted reasoning of the Jesuits who would use right premises to arrive at a questionable conclusion. Jean Kirkpatrick, was promoted by Ronald Reagan, to the post of Ambassador to the United Nations after she published a highly acclaimed paper on Latin America at the time the troubles were brewing in Nicaragua and El Salvador. In this paper she merely gave out a ragged repristination of the old Vatican line about the difference between Totalitarian (usually Marxist or Communist, although some Islamic countries would now qualify) dictatorships, and Authoritarian (usually Roman Catholic) dictatorships. A semantic difference worthy of the finest Jesuit casuistry. Try telling some poor half-starved peon in El Salvador or Haiti that there is a DIFFERENCE between those who are subjugating him, and some other totalitarian evil. I am sure he would be deeply impressed and glad to know that he is the victim of only an authoritarian dictatorship, and not a totalitarian one. Rome has sponsored many dictatorships in the twentieth century. In most cases the United States either turned a blind eye to them, or supported them in various ways. But when Communist dictatorships arose, Rome wanted to condemn them immediately and have them overthrown by any means possible, as in the case of Allende in Chile. But how could Rome attack dictatorships without indicting Roman Catholic dictatorships at the same time. This is when the semantics came into play and the alleged difference in dictatorships was put forward. Dictatorships were divided into two classes: authoritarian dictatorships and totalitarian -22-"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"dictatorships. Kirkpatrick in her paper followed this distinction to the letter. She used Rome's argument, that in time a nation can always throw off an authoritarian dictatorship, but it can never get rid of a totalitarian one when it seizes control of a country. Kirkpatrick, of course, wrote her study before the fall of Poland and the whole of eastern Europe. The very thing she claimed would never happen, has indeed occurred. Communism has been defeated in East Germany where one of the worst totalitarian regimes once ruled. It has also been defeated in Poland, Czechoslovakia, (now divided at the behest of Rome into Slovenia and the Czech Republic) Hungary, Bulgaria, and in parts of Yugoslavia, as well as the former Soviet puppet states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. But in many states such as Poland, El Salvador, Chile, and Croatia, the authoritarian Roman Catholic state still exists! The very opposite of Kirkpatrick's highly acclaimed paper! With such unforeseen developments still hidden, which would completely shatter Kirkpatrick's thesis in a few years, Reagan followed her lead and continued to make a difference between the two forms of dictatorships. At the height of the Nicaraguan crisis, Assistant Secretary of State, Viron Vaky said, \"Nicaraguans and our democratic friends in Latin America have no intention of seeing Nicaragua turned into a second Cuba.\" 1 What did such a statement mean. It meant that the authoritarian Roman Catholic dictatorship of Somoza in Nicaragua was not going to be turned into a totalitarian Communist dictatorship by the Sandinistas. It also meant that the word \"democratic\" was used to describe some of the worst Roman Catholic authoritarian dictatorships in the world at that time. One could be forgiven for asking who some of our \"democratic friends\" were in Latin America at that time. The United States, at that point in time detested Castro's communist dictatorship in Cuba. Conveniently forgetting that the reason why Castro was able to come to power was the worse Roman Catholic dictatorship under Batista which preceded him. One might well ask was Pinochet one of our democratic friends at that time? Under his regime thousands disappeared after being herded into a football stadium. They were all massacred. Was Papa Duvalier in Haiti another one of our democratic friends at that time? His feared Tonton Macoutes -- the bogey -23-"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"men -- held the people of Haiti in worse bondage by far, than those in Castro's Cuba. And the lifestyle in Haiti was one of the worst in the world. Was Stroessner in Paraguay,* Trujillo in the Dominican Republic, or Romero in El Salvador some of our other democratic friends Vaky referred to in his speech. Romero's** Los Escuadrones de la Muerte - the Squadrons of Death -made Cuba a Sunday School picnic by comparison. These were all Roman Catholic dictators. Yet Americans read such statements without seemingly analyzing Vaky's semantic use of the word \"democratic.\" Vaky also forgot to mention that the Sandinistas not only had close ties to Cuba; they had very close ties to the Vatican as well. It is interesting to note that after the Sandinistas had gained control and ousted Somoza, supposedly supplanting an Authoritarian Roman Catholic dictatorship with a totalitarian Communist dictatorship that those in El Salvador did not see much difference between the two. Morales Erhlich, second in command at that time in El Salvador, speaking to the House of Representatives in the United States, said that \"Nicaragua has simply substituted Sandinista control for that of Somoza.\" 2 It should be noted that most of the Sandinista leaders were Roman Catholic priests! Fernando Cardenal, his poet-brother Ernesto, and Alvaro Arguello, were all leaders in the Sandinista government, and they were all Roman Catholic priests. \"Father\" E'Escoto the Sandinista Foreign Minister was also a Roman Catholic priest. The United States and the Vatican were very worried about the fall of the dictator Somoza and the rise to power of the Sandinistas. The Reagan administration believed, at that point in time, that what ever way Nicaragua went so would go all Central American countries and eventually all of South America. This scenario was particularly disturbing to the Vatican and the Pope. Malachi Martin wrote, * Rafael Leonidas Trujillo was the man who ordered 20,000 Haitians to be massacred who were working in the western part of the Dominican Republic. ** This was another Romero not to be confused with the Archbishop who was later assassinated. -24-"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Geopolitically, Pope John Paul II agreed with that assessment. But for him, the fight was for the very survival of Roman Catholicism in the southern hemisphere, where almost ONE-HALF of all Roman Catholics live. And in his eyes, the true opposition in that fight was filled with the most dangerous rebels in the Church since Martin Luther's revolt in the sixteenth century. 3 Ernesto Cardenal one of the leaders of the Sandinistas was a Jesuit priest. There was no danger that Nicaragua was going to become a Communist state. Cardenal knelt to kiss the ring of the Pope when he came to Nicaragua. The pope refused to let him kiss his ring because he was displeased at the way the Roman Catholic priests were acting. But Cardenal, in spite of all the rhetoric sounding forth in the United States, was a loyal Jesuit priest submissive to the Pope of Rome. The pope was concerned, at least publicly, that the Jesuits were getting too involved in politics and revolutionary activities. Although Malachi Martin sees the Jesuits opposing the papacy now, others reported that the Jesuits were one of \"the primary groups controlling BOTH extremes in Central America\" 4 (emphasis added). That is, the Jesuits worked in both the authoritarian and the totalitarian sides to make sure that the Roman System was represented in both and would be there at the finish. It was obvious to all, except those with papal blinders on, that the priests and Jesuits of Rome were engaged on all sides in the Nicaraguan struggle. Such engagement did not affect the Roman Catholic System at all, although many Roman Catholic and conservative people in the United States cried out hysterically against the Sandinistas. Sister Ann Gormly, Associate Director of the U.S. Catholic Mission Association, in commenting on some of the allegations made against the Sandinistan government, put the whole situation in perspective when she said, \"I hear of no limitations to the work of the church in Nicaragua.\" 5 So it was par for the course. Generated hysteria and confusion prevailed to cloud an otherwise straightforward and clear victory for the Roman System in Central America. It can safely be said that the foreign policy of the United States toward Latin America has been to support the Roman Catholic System there and in many cases to uphold Roman Catholic dictatorships.

Of greater importance to US officials, Spellman was an avowed supporter of the controversial dictatorships that the American government backed.

Spellman saw nothing wrong with his behavior. Generally, the dictators were SUPPORTED BY THE HIERARCHY of their countries. (emphasis added) 6 The United States has backed the repressive Roman Catholic regimes for years in Latin America regarding them as a bulwark against Communism, but failing to see that in many cases they are as bad or worse than Communism. False Religion is a terrible curse to any nation both temporally and eternally. Those ground under the heel of false religion in many cases are driven to communism as the only way they can gain release from their bondage. The United States should be seeking to free Latin Americans from the curse of Rome as well as the curse of Communism. Certainly one can now view from a perspective of almost twenty years and see that what the United States and the Vatican feared, NEVER HAPPENED! Nicaragua is still solidly in the fold of Rome after all the hullabaloo and dire predictions of what was going to happen there if the Sandinistas ousted Somoza. Latin America is still solidly Roman Catholic and very little has really changed at all. The main war going on now is in Colombia where the rebels control about half the nation but you would never know it by reading the Vatican press in the United States. The State Department which has been thoroughly Romanized, conjured up all kinds of stories about the Sandinistas exporting revolution and arms to El Salvador. This erroneous Vatican-inspired propaganda worked in favor of the military dictatorship in El Salvador.

At the very time that the Jesuits were unleashing their criticisms of the United States, their church had attained control of El Salvador. So El Salvador then can serve as an example of a country where a papal Vaticanomy had been achieved. In El Salvador there was no unnatural, capitalistic Protestantism to block the growth of a real papal state where the Pope ruled the majority of the people. In Central America, for about four centuries, the Roman System ruled like a medieval pre-Reformation feudal lord. Even before El Salvador became a separate country Rome was present as a dominant force. So in El Salvador there was a Roman Catholic System in place; there was a population which was Roman Catholic, there had been ample time to produce a Vaticanomy. So what was El Salvador like as a place to live in, after more than a century of control by the Roman Catholic System? When one studies the recent history of El Salvador, during the time the Jesuits were castigating the United States for its pagan Protestantism, he is immediately struck by the desperate plight of almost every one in the entire country except the ruling Roman Catholic oligarchy. The majority of the population knew ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT AN EGALITARIAN SOCIETY superior spiritually and materially to Reformation Protestantism. In the mid 1800's much of the arable land in El Salvador which had been used by peasants to grow food for their own consumption was expropriated by government decree and consolidated into large farms to grow coffee. 1 To show the extent of this land expropriation fourteen families now controlled most of El Salvador's land. One can be reasonably assured that NONE of these landowners were Orangemen from Ulster. The almost complete control of all the arable land in the hands of fourteen families was bound to trigger political unrest and upheaval in spite of the Jesuits' assurance of a nice Christian Social Order.

Between 1880 and 1912, the common lands of the villages in the hilly volcanic regions were for the most part sold to urban middle and upper-class families at giveaway prices, a small portion alone being distributed among the villagers. Since the coffee tree needs five years growth before its first harvest, its cultivation is only possible for persons with a certain amount of capital, and hardly at all for small farmers, for whom the land has to provide their basic foodstuffs... At first, these big coffee planters maintained the traditional relations of production that existed on the haciendas. The workers received a plot of land on which to cultivate food crops in return for their work for the landowner. (a true microcosm of the medieval feudal system) Since in the coffee growing regions, however, the land left to the workers could be more profitably used for coffee cultivation the colono (worker) system was already replaced by wage labor in the 1920's. The workers no longer received any land for their own use, but only a primitive hut on the estate. 2 Jung proceeds to recount the spiraling downward of the conditions of the workers. As modern technology came to El Salvador it reduced even further the need for the workers. Soon many of them only had seasonal employment on the coffee estates between November and March. Since the Roman System effectively precluded any kind of family planning, it was not uncommon for a working-class family to have ten or more children. (Even to this day, the average family in El Salvador has seven children.) These children grew up in this supposedly wonderful Pre-Reformation egalitarian Vatican Social Order, without the remotest hope for any kind of employment. This hopelessness has translated at the present time into the flight of hundreds of thousands from El Salvador to the United States. According to some population statistics there are now more El Salvadorans living legally, and illegally, in Southern California than there are in San Salvador. I cannot explain for my readers why these hundreds of thousands flee from a Jesuit Social Order which is supposed to reflect rustic simplicities and -29-"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"a beautiful way of life, to go to a land which is filled with unnatural hateful and pagan capitalistic monstrosities which have arisen from the Protestant Reformation! Could it be because there is no real freedom at all in a lovely Jesuit Vaticanomy? To make matters even worse the Cotton Industry also began to be affected by industrialization. Unemployment, in this industry too, and seasonal-only employment at harvest time in this industry too, reduced the opportunities for work even more. As the country moved toward the middle of the twentieth century the numbers of unemployed workers continued to rise. This resulted in a complete loss of any real bargaining power on the part of the laborers. The land owners could play off one hired laborer against ten unemployed laborers making any sort of negotiations for better conditions or higher wages impossible. If any worker even hinted at agitation for better conditions, or higher wages, he could be fired immediately and there would be ten others waiting to take his place. Because of the society in which they lived they were without any real bargaining power at all. It is apparent to anyone who studies history that the Roman System is incapable of producing an equitable society where the \"church\" controls the people. For even where Roman Catholic countries have achieved a fairly good standard of living, it is because most of the Roman Catholics DO NOT follow the teachings of their church, and do follow the capitalistic system which the present pope so loudly decries. Wherever any poor peasants follow the Roman System's position on family planning they reach a dead end sooner or later. Stephen Webre writes of the family crisis in El Salvador: A major obstacle to the achievement of family strength and stability in El Salvador has been the large number (about 50 per cent) of households formed from \"free unions\" instead of legal marriages. This has particular implications for the position of women in society. In the lower classes where the entire family must function as a productive unit to stay ahead of STARVATION, the needs of the family have forced Salvadoran women to serve as breadwinner as well as mother. Working-class men, repeatedly bested in the uphill struggle to maintain a hovel full of children, often leave home in search of work, or simply out of frustration. -30-"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Many never return abandoning the families entirely. 3 (emphasis added) Here is a typical writer, on the problems in Roman Catholic countries, speaking of the need to stay ahead of starvation, the abandoning of families by fathers out of frustration, but NEVER MENTIONING the one thing that could help the situation dramatically: FAMILY PLANNING. Apparently it is better to produce children who starve to death, or are cannon fodder for revolutionary movements, than it is to reduce the size of families so that they can be supported in a tottering economy. There are various ways to deal with surplus populations and Rome has tried them all in El Salvador. 1. When a population gets too big that country can go to war with its neighbor and take over some more land. El Salvador fought with Honduras and tried to over run some of the country that bordered El Salvador. 2. Guerrilla warfare: where excess population can be killed off fighting the government. 3. Massacre. Excess population can be massacred by the dictatorship. Even in economies which are better than El Salvador's, such as Brazil's, the street children there are machine-gunned from time to time to clear the streets when dignitaries are coming to town. There are an estimated 40 million street children in Latin America today. 4. The excess population can flee to a Protestant country and get that good economy to support them. Hundreds of thousands of El Salvadorans, and indeed just about every Latin American country has joined in the dumping of excess population into the United States. They all flee from a \"Christian Social Order\" to come to a pagan Protestant one, if the Jesuits' estimation of social orders is a correct one. Islam and Rome are two of the greatest contributors to excess population in the world today.

In such conditions the lot of millions is to live and die in filth, disease, and malnutrition from the cradle to the grave without any hope of anything better.

Civil war rages in several African countries as of this writing. In other African countries civil wars have Just ended but the peace is very very fragile. While in Mozambique we were warned that although the civil war had officially ended, there were still armed bands roving the rural areas where we were preaching, and that the authorities had to know exactly where we would be in case they would have to evacuate us on short notice. The country of Rwanda was bursting at the seams with far too many people to support when the Roman Catholic Hutus began massacring the Tutsis. An estimated 500,000 Tutsis were massacred before the carnage could be stopped. Roman Catholic priests, and at least one high-ranking prelate, have now been implicated in the massacre. One priest fled to France. * There was no intervention by NATO or the United States where Rome was doing the massacring. But in Bosnia and Kosovo, where the Vatican wants revenge on Yugoslavia, both NATO and the United States are now up to their ears in intervention making former president Jimmy Carter cry out against such bias and hypocrisy. In many cases in Africa the only choice that people have is slow death by malnutrition, or quick death by massacre. Not much of a choice, but all that is left to millions in the world today, where the freedom and social order of the Reformation are outlawed or unknown. Even worse than all the horrible social conditions in Vaticanomies is the spiritual darkness of such countries.

So in places like Haiti, Rwanda, and El Salvador, it is a case of double horror: unmitigated poverty in this world, and no hope in the next apart from a mythical purgatory.

On May Day, 1930, 80,000 workers and peasants march into San Salvador, the capital city of El Salvador, demanding minimum wage for farm workers and relief centers for the unemployed. In 1931 Arturo Araujo is elected President but almost immediately is deposed by the military. The powerful oligarchy supports the move by the military and gives them a mandate to govern the country. Almost everyone, the marching workers, the military, and the oligarchy, are Roman Catholics. It is safe to say that scarcely any other religion is represented, or even present, in the entire country at this time in its history. With the rejection of the President, and the take over of the reins of government by the military, things worsen. The peasants and the workers have reached the desperation point. Economic conditions have deteriorated now to explosive levels. Salvadoran workers and peasants march into the capital again. Some carried arms but were hopelessly out numbered by the military, and 4,000 are killed, and the protest crushed ruthlessly. To teach them all a lesson the army now began what was known in Spanish as the MATANZA, the MASSACRE. Within a few weeks the army, and the paramilitary forces in the country side which supported the army, massacred 30,000 (a recent television documentary on El Salvador put the number at 40,000) people in a few weeks. The work of killing continued. By the time the Matanza is over, 4% of the population is killed, the PCS (the Salvadoran Communist Party) liquidated, the FRTS (Regional Federation of Salvadoran Workers) annihilated, and the Indian population forced to abandon their native dress, language, and cultural activities. 2 In medieval egalitarian Roman Catholic Social Orders one quickly learns that there is no room for dissent. In the United States, Jesuit priests may dissent loudly, and protest against the pagan Protestant society in which they operate, in total freedom. But in the model Christian (read Roman Catholic) Social Order NO DISSENT is tolerated. And if it should marshal some support it is ruthlessly annihilated without so much as a thought for egalitarianism. -35-"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"In 1969 war broke out between Honduras and El Salvador. Peasants had migrated from El Salvador to the country side of Honduras contiguous with El Salvador. Honduras was larger in area and much less densely populated. Honduras fought to drive back the El Salvadoran migration. In the years 1975-1980 thousands of people unite, peasants, teachers, students, and churchmen unite in mass protests against the government. Some of the groups uniting have connections to the armed movements in the countryside. Early in 1980 Archbishop Romero calls on the people to back the popular organizations and preserve what was called\" the liberation process.\" 3 Romero denounces the military and calls upon the military to disobey their leaders. Later that year, March 24,1980, Romero is assassinated by what was called \"right-wing forces.\" 4 No one was apprehended for the crime. The liberation process is linked to Marxists by the United States, but in El Salvador it is backed by the Archbishop and many of his priests! Conditions had now deteriorated into open armed conflict. The military dictatorship now began to clamp down cruelly on all dissidents. The dissidents were all viewed as Communists by the Right Wing Roman Catholic dictatorship and by the Reagan Administration in the United States. Even though years later a woman spokesman said we were not communists we were fighting for some measure of freedom from a totally repressive government. She couldn't understand why the US sided with the Death Squads and the massacres perpetrated by the Roman Catholic Right Wing military dictatorship. She apparently did not know that Ronald Reagan never made a foreign policy decision without first consulting the Vatican and his astrologer. The massacres and the killings of the 1930's started up again in the 1980's. On May 14,1981 the Sumpul River massacre occurred. The massacre was described in this way. On the opposite side, (of the river Sumpul from Honduras) at around 7 a.m., in the Salvadoran village La Arada and its surrounding area, the massacre began. A minimum of two helicopters, the Salvadoran National Guard, soldiers and the paramilitary organization ORDEN opened fire on the defenseless people. Women tortured before the finishing shot, infants thrown into the air for target practice, were some scenes of the criminal slaughter. * The Salvadorans who crossed the river were returned by the Honduran -36-"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"soldiers to the area of the massacre. In mid-afternoon the genocide ended, leaving a minimum of 600 corpses. 5 This massacre seems to have been a planned event. For the Honduran press reported that in the city of Ocotepeque, bordering Guatemala and El Salvador, there was a meeting of high military commanders of the three countries, 6 a short time before the massacre took place. All were loyal to the Roman System! Later the same year the Salvadoran military dictatorship killed 50 people and occupied the National University. 6hortly after this they killed 200 by bombing certain sections of San Salvador. In the fall of the same year the Army marched into the Morazan region of El Salvador killing 3,000 people and creating 24,000 refugees. 7 Then 6 leaders of a party opposed to the military dictatorship were murdered while attending a conference at a Roman Catholic seminary. Following this 3 United States nuns and another woman church worker were brutally murdered after leaving the airport of San Salvador. At the same time these horrific events were taking place the United States government sent 150 million dollars in \"economic\" aid to the Roman Catholic military dictatorship which dominated El Salvador at this juncture. The authoritarian Roman Catholic dictatorship was aided by American dollars to stay in power and decimate all those who opposed it. ** The military dictatorship sided with the oligarchy to control the country. This evil union denied any complicity in the terror * Eyewitnesses of another slaughter included \"Father\" Earl Gallagher, a Brooklyn born priest working in Honduras. With low flying Salvadoran pilots firing down on refugees at the Lempa River, and with Salvadoran soldiers raining down rockets, grenades, and automatic fire, Gallagher had children clinging to his beard as he swam some of them to safety. Over 200 were killed in this massacre. Many of them helpless women and children. Who did the firing? The Roman Catholic El Salvadoran Army supported by helicopters. So again one can see the confusion as Roman Catholics fired upon Roman Catholics even as a Roman Catholic priest tried to help those fired upon. -37-"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"and killings that filled El Salvador at this time. They claimed that the death squads worked independently and were not part of the security forces. But Captain Ricardo A.

The simple truth of the matter is that the \"Los Escuadrones de la Muerte\" are made up of members of the security forces and acts of terrorism credited to these squads such as political assassinations, kidnappings, and indiscriminate murder are, in fact, planned by high-ranking military officers and carried out by members of the security forces. I do not make this statement lightly, but with full knowledge of the role which the high military command and the directors of the security forces have played in the murder of countless numbers of innocent people in my country. 8 At the same time the mayors of several towns, who were \"Christian\" Democrats, were murdered by the Death Squads. So that again one sees the confusion which is part of Rome's legacy down through the years. For some Christian Democrats supported the various juntas which ruled El Salvador from time to time. At other times the Christian Democrats were the targets of the security forces. It is interesting to note that the - Catholic Right disowned the progressivism of the Christian Democrats, but that they both found agreement in their opposition to any form of birth control. Here again we see the strength of Romanism. Various groups ** To add to the general confusion at that time The New Solidarity Paper carried as its headline: \"Why the USA must open its borders again.\" The editorial below then blasted the US policy in El Salvador and asked the question: \"Why doesn't it (the US) give residence visas to 200,000 families instead of paying to have them assassinated?

The Reagan Administration, which was one of the most Roman Catholic dominated administrations which the United States has ever had, released a White Paper claiming that what was happening in El Salvador was direct armed aggression by the Soviet Union, Cuba, North Vietnam, and other communist governments. Truly a dispassionate paper! One can see here the almost total hysteria which the Vatican had communicated to the US concerning the situation in El Salvador. Tip O'Neill, the Irish-American Roman Catholic congressman, was not nearly so hysterical. He wanted an investigation into the murder of the three Maryknoll nuns from his district? For it was apparent to O'Neill, and to everyone else who was not hysterical, that the three nuns and the other lay churchwoman) HAD NOT BEEN MURDERED BY THE NORTH VIETNAMESE, THE CUBANS, THE RUSSIANS, OR ANY OTHER COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT! They had been murdered by the Right-Wing Roman Catholic Death Squads who controlled with terror all of El Salvador at this time! The tangled web of deceit which constituted El Salvadoran politics at this time was certainly difficult to untangle. Tip O'Neill, a loyal Roman Catholic, wanted an immediate investigation into the four Roman Catholic church workers who had been so brutally slain. O'Neill wanted to know what was going on in El Salvador because the United States was tunneling millions of dollars in aid into the country. Alexander Haig, the Roman Catholic Secretary of State appointed by Reagan, echoed Reagan's anguished cry about Communist intervention in El Salvador: Our problem with El Salvador, is EXTERNAL intervention in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation in this hemisphere -- nothing more, nothing less, -- That is the essential problem we are dealing with. 9 Just about every Communist country, Russia, Cuba, and even North Vietnam, were supposedly in El Salvador then trying to overthrow the government.

In El Salvador, there were Belgian priests, Irish priests, Canadian priests, United States Roman Catholic religious workers, Spanish clergy, and other aliens, and yet I have NEVER READ ONE WORD about getting these foreign interventionists out of El Salvador or anywhere else. For apparently it is ASSUMED, that as long as the foreign contingent represents the Vatican State, they all have a perfect right to be there, and to intervene in whatever way they can to further the interests of the papacy. They can be from scores of different countries but as long as they represent and protect Vatican interests they are viewed as helpful and not harmful, by those who think they know what is best for El Salvador in the United States government. No one ever even remotely considers the fact that Rome could be, and probably is, the main contributor to instability in El Salvador and anywhere else she feels threatened. Rome arrogates to herself the RIGHT and the AUTHORITY to bring countries under the domination of the papacy, for the papacy is assumed to be set up by Christ Himself. Rome then assumes that she has the power and authority of God Himself to take over the world. It is almost incredible to read the letter the Roman Catholic bishops wrote to the United States just prior to this time. Here is what the spokesmen for the Vatican State had to say in a letter to then President Jimmy Carter: It would be unjust and deplorable if, because of the interference of foreign powers, + the Salvadoran people were to be frustrated, were to be repressed and prevented from deciding autonomously the economic and political course which our nation must follow.

Why do they arrogate to themselves such power in order to rebuke the President of the United States. Because they falsely assume that ROME has a universal power over every country on earth, and that they have the RIGHT to help determine any country's allegiance to Rome. Yet in all the reading that I have done on El Salvador, I have never seen one writer even allude to this gross assumption of Rome. Writers cover what they think are all aspects of the various elements in the struggle, but the fact that the Vatican State is up to its armpits in many of the elements never seems to be noticed, much less, dealt with in depth. The evil system of Rome is considered a normal player in the country and not an alien power intervening. No matter that the Vatican State is 6,000 or 7,000 miles away it is assumed that it has the right to be there. It is assumed that the Pope has a right to determine the future of all El Salvadorans whether they knuckle under to him or not. It is amazing that writers will ATTACK the Filibusteros ++ for trying to carve out little empires in the mountains of Central America, but never say a word about Rome's prelates who did the very same thing, only with far more success, and far more evil resulting from their religious empire. One writer pointed out that William B. Scroggs wrote an account of the adventures of the Filibusteros in 1916, but that his account was marred because of the author's own uncritical identification with the aims of Walker and his fellow Filibusteros.

Why can the filibustering priests of the Vatican not be excoriated for subjugating the helpless peons under the heel of Rome? Why is Rome exempt from the same criticism which is directed at others? For Rome certainly has created more evil, and caused more repression, in Central America, than the few filibusteros ever thought of doing. For instance, the INQUISITION had its mailed foot upon the necks of the Indians, strangling the life out of them both figuratively and actually, for years. Can we find any details about the Inquisition in Central America. No, details are hard to come by, but the silence and the gaps speak all too eloquently of its horrible presence in Latin America. Occasionally a writer will allude to the Inquisition ironically. Alan Riding, Mexico City bureau chief for the New York Times, wrote about the background to the problems in El Salvador: Throughout the colonial era, in fact, the church stood close to political power. And, as a wealthy land owner in its own right, it also exercised enormous economic influence. There were some notable defenders of the Indians among the clergy, not least Bartolome de las Casas in Mexico, but on the whole the Church identified with a colonial system - and with such niceties as the Inquisition -- that kept the Indians in a state of serfdom. 11 Here is a modern writer who merely alludes ironically to the NICETIES of an instrument of torture, terror, and execution! Again, it is ASSUMED that Rome has a right to be there and to keep the nationals ground to powder under the feet of its foreign prelates! And the RIGHT to use the hellish and hideous terrors of the Inquisition to enforce its dogmas upon those who resist them. Here it is apparent that Rome had the economic power and influence in this whole region. Yet look at what has been produced after centuries of such a wonderful Vatican Social Order! Here again there is an allusion to medieval serfdom in the context of a church ruled society, even when such serfdom had to be maintained by the Inquisition.

The plotting and the political intrigue which the Vatican State brought to El Salvador produced the problems which came to a head in the armed struggles of the Twentieth century.

Apparently it is all right to kill hundreds of thousands to uphold the Roman Catholic System. & It is amazing to listen to the rhetoric of Rome. On the one hand Marxist dictatorships are blasted; on the other hand the talk of killing thousands to uphold Rome is carried on as if a Sunday school outing was being discussed. Morales Ehrlich when speaking of the violence in El Salvador said that he hoped it would die down and conditions would improve. He said \"the birth pains of the new El Salvadoran democracy were almost at an end.\" Jose Antonio Morales Ehrlich was second in command to President Jose Napoleon Duarte in the military junta that ruled the country in 1981. Warren Hoge described the birth pains referred to by Ehrlich. What these pains might be were suggested by Robert A. & Cardinal Stepinac with Anton Pavelic had hundreds of thousands of Serbian Orthodox massacred in Croatia during World War II. He was later tried and convicted and sentenced to 16 years in jail. The hue and cry that went up around the world to defend this murderous rascal was unbelievable. Yugoslavia was called godless and inhumane and charged by the Vatican for putting the Roman Catholic church on trial. It was all right for Stepinac to have countless thousands massacred to uphold a Vaticanomy, he was called a noble and humane priest for doing so. But when he was put on trial for his murderous spree, it was Yugoslavia that was condemned not the Archbishop who was involved in genocide. I believe this is the main reason Yugoslavia is now being bombed by NATO at the behest of the Vatican. The Vatican HAS NEVER FORGIVEN YUGOSLAVIA FOR PUTTING ARCHBISHOP STEPINAC ON TRIAL.

They were known as Right-Wing Death Squads, which being interpreted means the Roman Catholic Death Squads. They were linked to both the Roman Catholic oligarchy and to the \"Christian\" meaning Roman Catholic Democrats. The three main parties in the struggle in El Salvador were the Christian Democrats, the Christian Revolutionaries, and the Christian landed Oligarchy. So it was a wonderful bunch of Christians all fighting together in a beautiful Rome-sponsored egalitarian society, a Jesuit - \"Christian\" Social Order. If one substitutes the words Roman Catholic for Christian, he will come closer to reality. But we will for the sake of quotations from other writers continue to use the words which have been used to describe El Salvadoran politics. The Christian Democrats in El Salvador were fairly progressive. They consisted of lawyers, teachers and business men. The Party probably could be considered as a middle ground between the Christian Revolutionaries and the old landed oligarchy and its military dictatorship. The Marxist-Christian Revolutionaries consisted primarily of the working classes and the peasants aided and abetted by Marxist priests and Marxist Jesuits. They wanted a redistribution of the land, better wages, and some kind of safety net for unemployment. The Oligarchy consisted of fourteen, some now say about 26, families who owned about 80 per cent of the arable land among them, and who backed the military juntas who really controlled the country in the sectors that mattered.

Some were shot while engaged in actual combat but none was ever disciplined by the \"church.\" Which is surely strange if the Vatican is really the strong anti-communist force it is supposed to be. It is safe to say that the Death Squads targeted anyone who was perceived as a threat to the military junta which ruled the country. So the Marxist clergy were considered legitimate targets in El Salvador by the ruling conservative Roman Catholics. The \"official\" position of the \"church\" continually shifted. The Hierarchy waffled back and forth depending upon which way things were going. They sided with Archbishop Romero because he was popular with the peasants and the poor but when he was assassinated they did an about face. The man they appointed to fill his office aligned himself with the ruling military who had just eliminated Romero. 2 The murder of the four United States churchwomen briefly shocked the country. At first, one could be forgiven for thinking that the nasty Communist Cubans, or the dirty North Vietnamese, had done the dastardly deed.

Investigations into such crimes were superficial, if there were any at all.

In spite of the confessions of the four unimportant men, who were sacrificed to cover up the orders from the government, the United States State Department issued a statement that it does NOT accept that the Defense Minister, and Commander of the National Guard of El Salvador at that time, were guilty.

He also said that the United States government was NOT looking for Defense Minister General Jose Guillermo Garcia, and the former National Guard Commander, Colonel Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova, both of whom now live in Florida. 5 It is remarkable how those engaged in documented Death Squad activities, can now reside peaceably in Florida, while the United States and Britain put their weight behind the efforts to arrest Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb Leader.

Well four of the main leaders of the Sandinistas were Roman Catholic priests. This was not brought out in this documentary. So again the fact that Roman Catholic priests headed up the movement that killed thousands of Nicaraguans is not reported. In Chile, Pinochet rounds up thousands and they are never seen again. All are killed including some famous singer. They were all bad people, we are told via Pinochet's spokesman. So who did the killing here? Was it the Communists who were supposedly all over Latin America at that time? No, it was the Roman Catholic military dictatorship of Pinochet who was doing the massacring again. But no such identification is ever made in this \"documentary.\" Here we see the difference between Protestant countries and Roman Catholic ones. There are bad people in Protestant countries like America, but they are not all massacred. They are tried and convicted and sentenced in accordance with the degree of their badness. They are not all lumped together as enemies of Rome and shot without so much as a prayer, as happened in El Salvador and Chile at this time. Romanism is without doubt one of the main causes of instability all over Latin America. The insane phobia which the Vatican System displays towards any kind of family planning contributes mightily to the big families who have no hope of being supported in many of these economies, such as El Salvador's. The young people grow up without education or employment and become the grist for the revolutionary movements which have become legendary in the history of Latin American politics. The Right Wing Death Squads then come into being to keep down the Left-wing guerrilla movements. And the Holy Mother Church is involved on both sides. Between the two sides, Right-Wing and Left-Wing, Latin America has produced what is called the Christian Democrats. This party, which exists in every Latin American country except Honduras, Paraguay, Haiti (which is French speaking) and Cuba, is supposed to be a movement of Reform. Again, the word Christian here means Roman Catholic. So it is another Roman Catholic party. One North American scholar wrote that in social theory, the Christian Democrats represent \"essentially traditional, Catholic Corporatism.\" 3 Another writer described the Christian Democrats this way. -52-"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Christian democracy is not forward looking; it is backward looking; back past the dehumanizing rise of liberalism; past the centralizing age of political absolutism, past the secularizing world of the Renaissance, (read Reformation Protestantism) to the Medieval IDEAL (same old Jesuit theonomist goal) of unity and order, to a world where all Christendom (read Popedom) was theoretically a community where moral laws guided man's spiritual and personal life supposedly guided his political and economic activities as well. 4 (emphasis added) Such is the DREAM of the Roman Catholic Democrats. It is too bad for the people in the REAL WORLD that such a dream never seems to come true in any land south of the Rio Grande. The ideal gives way to the repression of Romanism which always seems to come to the fore in Latin America. At least, in El Salvador, those on the bottom rungs of the social ladder did not think too highly of the Christian Democrats. In January in 1981, a unified coalition of five different organizations called for a general strike to bring down what it called \"the Christian Democrat-Military Dictatorship.\" 5 So while the social Democrats in El Salvador give themselves the lovely name \"Christian\" those fighting for even the most meager of living standards look upon them as a Military Dictatorship which sponsored the Death Squads. Demonstrating once again the confusion that reigns wherever Rome rules. The Jesuit social philosophers, the Roman Catholic scholars, the Christian Democrat politicians, all speak about the wonderful Christian Social Order, and the contributions of the Roman System to such an ideal, but all they ever seem to produce IN REAL LIFE is repression and social unrest in a setting of poverty, crime, and revolution. The Roman Catholic System in El Salvador furnished the people for the reactionary repressive oligarchy; the rebellious Revolutionary uprising; and the military-dictatorship with its Squadrons of Death. These all came out of the Roman System and battled and fought each other to the death. This same scenario has been repeated at various times during this century. The Roman System has produced the same chaos in Ireland. In other words, Rome PRODUCES by its very dogmas the elements from which political chaos erupts, and from which anarchy must flow or be kept down by armed force. A wonderful -53-"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"prospect indeed for a \"Christian Social Order.\" Some may disagree with such an assessment of the Roman System, but they surely cannot disagree with the fact that the Roman System is still very much in place in El Salvador at this very hour. After all the shouting about the Marxist Revolutionaries, the North Vietnamese, the Cubans, the Russians, and the Nicaraguans, the VATICAN FOREIGN STATE IS STILL THERE IN EL SALVADOR but all the other foreigners have gone home.* In other words, the foreign state which caused all the trouble in the first place is still there today. After some of the worst massacres, Death Squad Assassinations, and bombings, and after all the fighting and striking done by the Marxist Revolutionaries, the Roman System still rules in El Salvador. Roman Catholic Death Squads can kill Roman Catholic Maryknoll nuns, Roman Catholic priests and Jesuits, and even the Roman Catholic Archbishop, and the Vatican State never so much as bats an eye, but continues its domination to this very hour. So in the little country of El Salvador, as in Ireland, the Roman System never worried about the beginnings, the murders, the assassinations, the bombings, the terror, the massacres, the unrest, the half-starved children, the filth, the poverty, the crime, the squalor, and the general confusion such evils help to produce, as long as the outcome benefits the Vatican, for her name is Mystery Babylon -- Mystery CONFUSION! She always takes the long view, and whatever horrors may be generated to achieve her ends are all JUSTIFIED. For that is always the bottom line: the end justifies the means. All the faithful religious who are killed, such as the three nuns and the archbishop, are regarded as martyrs for the Vatican cause. The multitudes who are killed and massacred on the other side are \"bad\" people who deserve to be massacred and never seen again. So this is the century-long example of what is produced in a Jesuit-\"Christian\" Social Order. This is what the Jesuits' social philosophy produces, and this is what, believe it or not, the Jesuits and their Reformed Theonomist friends want to introduce to the United States today!

So while Roman Catholics fought Roman Catholics in El Salvador, Roman Catholics fight Protestants in Ulster. In both cases the Holy Mother church is up to her armpits in the holy wars. It is this seemingly CONFUSED situation which many just cannot understand. They do not recognize that Rome is Mystery Confusion, that is her name. The word Mystery here is a very important word as Fairbairn pointed out more than a hundred years ago. It is not what Rome and the Papacy PRETEND to be, but what they REALLY ARE that is to guide the investigator. As Fairbairn wrote, And hence, so far from expecting that Popes, or any other embodiments of the antichrist, should formally assume what is predicted of this power, we should rather EXPECT THE REVERSE. WE SHOULD EXPECT A STUDIOUS EFFORT TO DISGUISE THE TRUTH OF THE CASE... In a word, the question is not what Popery pretends to be, but what she really is... and when the subject is viewed in this light, he must be strangely blinded or unhappily biased, who fails to see the striking correspondence between the one (Mystery Babylon the Great) and the other (the Papacy).

The Bible deals primarily with only two categories: the saved and the lost; the elect and the non-elect. So that this world is then divided primarily into only two camps as far as God's people are concerned: the elect and the rest of the world. The rest of the world is comprised of several main groups: Islam, Rome, other world religions, and secularism. Secularism finds expression both in democracies and Communist states. While many of these groups are opposed to one another, and indeed fight one another, they are ALL opposed to God's elect people. -56-"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"So while confusion is the hallmark of Mystery Babylon the Great, the unclean spirits, the hateful birds and the demonic characters which fill the cage of Mystery Babylon are all opposed to God's elect people.

There are only two classes of people here: God's people designated here as \"my people\" and all the nations which have committed spiritual fornication with Mystery Babylon. The advocates of Rome, and they are legion in the United States today, see the social battle raging between an \"unnatural and unchristian social order\" and the \"Christian\" Social Order of the Jesuits. Rome is thus given the name \"Christian\" and the opposition is anything unchristian such as secularism, communism, atheism, and Protestantism. Whereas the Protestant Reformers saw the battle in terms of the truth against the Papacy, which to them was Mystery Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots and Abominations on the earth. This they believed, I believe, RIGHTLY; they saw the battle as it is described in the Bible, a great monstrous RELIGIOUS SYSTEM, not an atheistic, secular system, but a religious one which seeks to dominate the world, and out of which God's elect people are told to separate. When one looks at the world today he sees religions ruling many countries. At Assisi in 1986 about 200 of the world's religions met under the leadership of the Pope of Rome. In this type of meeting we can see inchoately what Mystery Babylon the Great will ultimately be: a great false religious System with the Pope at its head. In Ulster the stubborn Bible Protestants have so far resisted incorporation into the fold of the Jesuit Social Order. But with the United States and Europe forcing such a monstrous evil upon her, the future looks grim. Avro Manhattan summarized the objectives that the papacy has for Ulster: The objectives of the Catholic church in whole heartedly supporting Irish nationalists are: (a) Total geographical and political unification of the island, as a necessary step to (b) Total Catholicization of the united Ireland.

One of the main teachings of the Preterist viewpoint is that the Antichrist rose and fell before AD 70. According to the theonomist there is no Antichrist now and there will be none in the future. This view was first espoused by the Spanish Jesuit Alcasar in 1614. Both the historical and futurist views believe that Mystery Babylon the Great will come to the fore at the end times. This debate over Antichrist is a watershed in eschatology. Obviously if Antichrist rose and fell already there is now nothing to worry about from him and his Mystery Babylon religious conglomerate. On the other hand if Antichrist is connected to Mystery Babylon the Great and that apostate conglomerate is now already functioning in the Papacy as many Bible-believers have taught, then the view of the future is totally different from that of the Jesuit-Reformed theonomists. The Reformed Theonomist is trying to \"save\" America by joining with the Jesuit-Vaticanomist because he does not view Mystery Babylon the Great as now present for it all disappeared before AD 70. Yet when one looks at the present world there are far more evidences of Mystery Babylon religion than there are of Christian Social Orders. When one looks at the world today he sees four major \"religions,\" Islam, Rome, Hinduism, Apostate non-Romanism, -- Eastern Orthodoxy and liberal Protestantism -- which claim around three billion adherents. So at least half the world is connected to the so-called major religions. When other parts of the world are examined one can see Shintoism, Animism, Buddhism, and Confucianism which account for at least another billion. So that with the exception of Red China, the world is far more religious than it is secular. Islam believes in theonomy -- the rule of Allah. Rome believes in what it calls a theonomy but which is closer to a Vaticanomy and it, by far, controls greater fire power than Islam, since NATO and the United States support the Vatican. In Europe, Rome has come to a place of prominence in the great European Community. Certainly a good question to ask: has Bible Protestantism in Europe more to fear from secularism than from Romanism?

Europe has now come together in the European Economic Community. After centuries of warring, the various countries of Europe have now united around the Treaty of Rome. The very name of this Treaty should awaken Protestants but apparently, except for a very small minority, it does not even seem to register on Protestants today. The Single European Act passed in 1986 further consolidated this political union. Then the Maastricht Treaty was drawn up in 1992 to bring about a single European Currency. Now, within the past few months, as of this writing, the long awaited Euro-Dollar has finally made its appearance. Professor Arthur Noble shows where all these glorious treaties and unions are headed: Developments in Europe are however, not planned to end with merely economic and political union. The envisaged superstate plans to go even further... it is clear that the stage has been set, and is already well-constructed for the greatest politico-religious revolution ever witnessed in the history of mankind. Tragically, widespread indifference on the part of our national leaders, and especially of the leaders of the established Churches, indicates that they are either totally ignorant of these developments or else willing accomplices in this evil design. The emerging Europe is the undemocratic, Roman Catholic superstate ~ envisioned by De Gaulle and the Church - a Europe in which it will be a \"public crime\" to resist the power wielded by the Church in the name of God. Let it be remembered that such resistance in the Middle Ages was a crime punishable by death unless abjured. 1 So how Reformed Theonomists can ignore what is clearly happening in Europe is a complete mystery. What is emerging now in all of Europe? Is it a Christian Social Order which the Jesuits and the Reformed Theonomists like to write about, or is not the very image of Mystery Babylon the Great described in Revelation chapters 17 and 18. When one looks at reality, and not dreams, he is hard pressed to describe modern Europe as a beautiful Christian Social Order.

When the Popes speak of worldwide unity they use the word \"Christian\" but when they see themselves in the driver's seat, they use the correct word Catholic, only they should preface it with the adjective ROMAN to make it what they really envisage; a Roman Catholic Superstate, the true Vaticanomy, with the pope as the supreme ruler. Henry H. Halley wrote some seventy years ago, long before a united Europe even appeared, and before World War II, that The description of Babylon the Great Harlot, seated on the Seven-headed Ten Horned Beast, while it may have ultimate reference to a situation yet to appear, yet it exactly fits Papal Rome. And THERE IS, so far, NOTHING ELSE IN WORLD HISTORY THAT IT DOES FIT. 4 As far as this generation is concerned Papal Rome and its Papal European Superstate is the only Mystery Babylon Religion that we know anything about that fits the description given in the book of Revelation. Other developments may occur; but we are to come out of this apostate religious conglomerate NOW, so that we do not partake of her sins and plagues. We are certainly not to work with it to help it achieve its hideous Vaticanomy. This great Economic and Political Union is being constructed before the very eyes of this generation. It is being constructed within the ancient boundaries of the Roman Empire. It is dominated by the papacy, and as it grows and consolidates itself into a unified bloc, it will be what Arthur Noble said Pope John XXIII envisaged: \"THE GREATEST SINGLE HUMAN FORCE EVER SEEN BY MAN.\" 5 How so-called theonomists can ignore all of this; and how so-called prophetic scholars can look at Saddam Hussein and his efforts to revive Babylon in the Middle East, and ignore what is clearly emerging before their very eyes in Europe, is to say the least, a great mystery.

Surely there are some great similarities to the Europe we see today and the one depicted in Revelation. Noble gives further insight into this growing European Economic Community: It has taken years of undercover plotting to advance the goal of unifying Europe under the Romish doctrine... Inter-church dialogue -- especially the activities of the World Council of Churches and the Ecumenical Movement - has been the major method of deceit employed by Rome to shepherd her enemies into her fold... The Treaty of Rome (1973) which established the European Common Market, has already been mentioned. The public, in accordance with the Vatican's policy of releasing facts in small doses, was kept in the dark about the ULTIMATE goal of this Treaty...

We hear of ethnic cleansing in former Yugoslavia as she is being carved up by the Vatican firepower of NATO and the United States. Yet the real ethnic cleansing which went on in El Salvador is called a cancer operation. And the real ethnic cleansing which Sinn Fein stands for in Ireland is viewed as a \"political\" struggle. Sinn Fein means ethnic cleansing. This is what the term means: we ourselves, and nobody else.

It would be humorous, if not so serious, to see Secretary of State Albright and NATO talking about a homeland for those who now live in Yugoslavia. The Albanians must be given a homeland so that Yugoslavia can be fragmented some more. But where Protestants in the North of Ireland already have a homeland, they must be incorporated into the Vatican state of Eire. Why the total contradiction?

It lulls to sleep the theonomists with whom it is glad to work to create a Vaticanomy by political coalitions to win the cultural struggle in the United States. It openly defies the opposition in places like El Salvador and the North of Ireland, where armed force is the persuasive means used to uphold the culture of Rome.

All these questions, and more, show the utter IMPOSSIBILITY of true biblical Protestantism working with Romanism to save anything! Luther rightly proclaimed Christ is the way to the church and NOT the church the way to Christ. The Word is before the Church. The Church arises out of the Word, that is the living and written Word. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. To as many as received Him, to them gave he the power to become the sons of God. The church arose out of Christ and His giving of power through the ministry of the Holy Spirit to worship the Father. Wherever these great truths about personal salvation have been preached with power and authority they have produced the best cultures by far. Wherever they have not been preached, the culture languishes no matter what else may be conjured up by man. There is much talk today about the decline of religion and religious values in the United States. While such an observation is true it is far from the whole truth. It is the decline of historic Bible Protestantism that is causing the decay in America today. If Romanism were to decline, or Mormonism to decline, it would not really matter if true biblical Christianity came in their place. In fact, it is a good thing for a nation when false religions decline, for they are only the opiate of any people. They do not change character, nor do they produce the truth which Christ said was the only thing that made men truly free. We need a revival of true historic biblical Christianity and that in turn will cause false religions to decline and fade out entirely. They need to be challenged and repudiated and the truth proclaimed in their place. This is the only thing that will stop the decay in the United States today. The question is, are there any men out there today willing to challenge the errors of Rome and other false religions, and repudiate them openly and declare the whole truth of the gospel in their place. Are there any out there really willing to pay the price of such preaching? For there is a price to pay and it is a costly one. It costs soft -68-"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"jobs and high paying positions. It costs friends and comforts. It costs as much to uphold the truths that men brought to the new world as it cost them to bring them in the first place. It cost them everything they had on earth. They left all behind for the sake of the gospel. Our Lord said whosoever will lose his life for my sake and the gospels will find it; but whosoever will save his life shall lose it. Many are saving their lives today but losing the true gospel in the process. Many ministers are bartering eternal truth and eternal reward for a few creaturely comforts. They are willing to forfeit God's approval for the approval of men and for the ease and comfort of present day living. We will have to learn, in fact we must learn, that God's man must make hard choices. He must like Moses deliberately choose to suffer affliction with the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. By FAITH Moses when he was come to years REFUSED to be called the son of Pharoah's daughter. My what a GLORIOUS REFUSAL! That refusal came about because Moses ESTEEMED the REPROACH OF CHRIST GREATER RICHES than all the treasures of Egypt. And they were indeed substantial those treasures, but they held ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for Moses, for his reward was as yet invisible. He rejected the tangible for the invisible and triumphed in Christ. He endured as seeing Him who is invisible. He left the creaturely comforts for the wilderness and all its trials. There is a great spiritual truth here: creaturely comforts have softened and warped the message of more men than the opposition of secular humanism. It is easy to be against secular humanists for then all \"religions\" can join with you in your opposition. But to oppose false religion is much more costly, for most people are religious, and the majority are in false religions. This is the REAL battle in the United States today and very few are fighting it. They are shadow boxing with atheists, while the false religionists are taking over the country, and in a very real sense, HAVE ALREADY TAKEN IT OVER! The State Department is thoroughly Romanized and foreign policy decisions are made in conjunction with the Vatican. Yet those who are supposed to know the truth seemingly languish in their comforts, rather than choosing to suffer affliction with the people of God, and making hard choices which bring the reproach of Christ upon them, and put them outside the gate of religious men's approval. -69-"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"It is time to wake up! Awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give you light! And knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. The night is far spent: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light. Let us put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision for the flesh! May we obey the exhortation of the Scriptures! References 1. Montano, Walter, Behind the Purple Curtain, Cowman Publications, Los Angeles, CA, 1950. p. 301-309. -70-"}]
