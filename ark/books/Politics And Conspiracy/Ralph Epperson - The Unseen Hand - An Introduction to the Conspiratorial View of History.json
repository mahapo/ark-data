IV"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"About the Author The most difficult thing I know to do is to write a bout myself, but I think that the reader of this book has the right to know something about me, the author, and what motivated me to write it. I am a graduate of the University of Arizona, and l ike the typical graduate of an institution of higher education, I f elt that what I had been taught was the truth. I thought that the only thing I needed to complete my education in the future was additional information to confirm the knowl- edge to which I had already been exposed. So I faced the future with great anticipation. But a close friend of mine, sensing that my knowled ge was both incomplete and one-sided, suggested that I start re ading material dealing with what was called \"Revisionist History.\" This wa s the alternative explanation of history to what I had been taught wa s the truth. There are over 300 books on both sides of this issu e that I've read that are part of the research for this book. That figure, I am certain, is not an impressive number to those who are true \"book addic ts,\" but I mention it only to illustrate that the ideas in this book are not mine, but those of the individuals who have taken the time to record their perspective on the events in which they were personally involved or which the y researched in depth. But as I read, I noticed that there was no one volu me that covered a complete history of the Conspiracy, and it is this void that I hope to fill. It is my intent to catalog as much of the history of this Conspiracy as is possible in a single volume. I have made extensive use of quotations from the wo rks of others as a means of convincing the skeptic that the evidence o f the Conspiracy's existence comes from others than this author. What the reader will see as he progresses through t his book, I am convinced, is a picture of a giant conspiracy so im mense that it poses the greatest threat to the freedoms and rights of all h uman beings, not only in the United States, but all over the world. It is likely that, as the reader completes this boo k, despair will replace curiosity, especially if this explanation of the ev ents being reviewed has never been explored before. That is an unfortunate conseq uence of my research, and the author is sorry that he must be the bearer of such bad tidings. Despair, however, can reasonably be replaced with c autious optimism. The battle is not yet over, and there is reason to be encouraged. But you are the final participant. What happens will largely be dependent on your acti on once you've read this book. V"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Introduction Wars start when one nation moves into the territory of another; depressions occur when markets take unexpected down turns; inflations occur when prices are driven up by shortages; revol utions start when the people, always spontaneously, rise up to overthrow the existing government. These are the traditional explanations of historica l events. Events happen by accident. There do not seem to be any cau ses. But this explanation of history leaves gnawing ques tions in the minds of serious students. Is it possible that government leaders and others planned these events and then orchestrated them to their de sired conclusions? Is it possible that even the great catastrophes of histor y were part of this plan? There is an explanation of historical events that a nswers these questions in the affirmative. It is called the Conspiratorial View of History and it is the alternative to the Accidental View, the view that i s commonly held today. It is possible, therefore, to summarize the major even ts of history into two alternative schools of thought: The Accidental View of History: historical events o ccur by accident, for no apparent reason. Rulers are powerless to intervene. The Conspiratorial View of History: historical even ts occur by design for reasons that are not generally made known to the pe ople. James Warburg in his book, The West In Crisis, expl ains the Accidental 6"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION View thus: \"History is written more by accident tha n design, often by the wholly irrational acts of madmen.\" 1 Another who has offered the Accidental View as the explanation of the major events of the world is Zbigniew Brzezinski, P resident Jimmy Carter's National Security Advisor. He has written: \"History is much more the product of chaos than of conspiracy. ... increasing ly, policy makers are overwhelmed by events and information.\" 2 But there are those who disagree with the positions of Warburg and Brzezinski. One, for instance, was Franklin D. Roos evelt who certainly saw many monumental events occur during his consecutive administrations. President Roosevelt has been quoted as saying: \"In politics, nothing happens by accident. If it happens, it was planned that way.\" If harmful events are planned, it follows that the people who were about to suffer through the scheduled event would act to prevent the event from occurring if they knew about it in advance. The peo ple expect government to protect them from harmful events. But if the events still occur after the government officials had been expected to prevent them, the government officials have failed in their assigned duties. There are only two explanations as to why they failed: 1. The events overwhelmed them, and could not have bee n prevented; or 2. The events were allowed to occur because the offici als wanted them to occur. It is difficult for the casual observer to believe that these incredible events could not have been prevented, as humane people of conscience do not allow harmful events to occur. If a planned and unwanted event is allowed to happe n, those who planned the event would have to have acted in secre t so as to prevent discovery of their plans by those who would be adve rsely affected. Planners working in secret to plan an event that th e people do not wish to occur are, by definition, members of a conspirac y. Webster's defines conspiracy as a \"combination of people, working in secret, for an evil or unlawful purpose.\" Not only must the Conspirators work in secret, they must make every effort to insure that their plans are not made publ ic. The first task of a conspiracy, then, becomes that of convincing the pe ople that the conspiracy itself does not exist. This makes the task of uncovering the machinations of the conspiracy all the more difficult. There are three ways of exposing a Conspiracy: One is for any of the participants in the conspirac y to break with it and to 7"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION expose his or her involvement. This takes an extrem ely courageous individual, and that type of exposure is indeed rar e. The second group of exposers are those who have unk nowingly participated in a conspiratorial planning of an event but who di dn't realize it until later. These individuals, and there aren't many in the history of the world, have also exposed the inner workings of the conspiracy at great peril to themselves. The third method of exposing a conspiracy is for re searchers to uncover conspiratorial designs in the events of the past. Y our author is one of these researchers. It will be the position of this book that a conspir acy does indeed exist, and that it is extremely large, deeply entrenched, and therefore extremely powerful. It is working to achieve absolute and bru tal rule over the entire human race by using wars, depressions, inflations a nd revolutions to further its aims. The Conspiracy's one unchanging purpose h as been to destroy all religion, all existing governments, and all traditi onal human institutions, and to build a new world order (this phrase will be defined later) upon the wreckage they have created. Notice that if the Conspiracy does exist, it will d o everything it can to deny the charges of both those who seek to expose i t and those who claim to have been a part of it. There are those, perhaps not knowing the importance of their contribu- tions to the study of the conspiracy, who have adde d estimates of the size of mis ruling group. One was Walter Rathenau, who in 1909 controlled Ger man General Electric. He said: \"Three hundred men, all of whom know one another, direct the economic destiny of Europe and choose th eir successors from among themselves.\" 3 Another informed observer, Joseph Kennedy, the fath er of the late president John Kennedy, identified the number of in dividuals who run America. He said: \"Fifty men have run America and t hat's a high figure.\" 4 Dr. Carroll Quigley, a professor of History at Geor getown University's Foreign Service School, and who formerly taught at Princeton and Harvard, has written a thirteen hundred page book entitled T ragedy and Hope. This book, published in 1966, was, according to the auth or, the result of twenty years of research into the Conspiracy. Dr. Quigley concludes: There does exist, and has existed for a generation, an international Anglophile network which operates, to some extent, in the way the radical Right believes the Communists act. In fact, this network, which we may identify as the Round Table Groups, has no a version to 8"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION cooperating with the Communists, or any group, and frequently does so. I know of the operations of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years, i n the early 1960's, to examine its papers and secret records. But Quigley took a step none of the exposers have p ublicly taken. He admits that he is a supporter of the Conspiracy he has written about: I have no aversion to it or most of its aims, and h ave, for much of my life, been close to it and many of its instrumen ts. I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies... but in general my chief difference of o pinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known. 5 The ultimate purpose of this Conspiracy is power. T here are some who desire this more than even material goods, although the two frequently go together. One such individual was the previously me ntioned Joseph Kennedy. Family admirer and author Pearl Buck wrote the following in her book, The Kennedy Women: \"Rose Kennedy (the wife of Joseph Kennedy) knew that the man she loved loved a power beyond th e power of money. He wanted the power of government, and he would have i t.\" 6 The Conspiracy that Dr. Quigley and others saw, the n, needs conspira- tors, and it is logical to ask why illustrious men of wealth and fortune would join such an enterprise. One who answered this ques tion was author Blair Coan who wrote in his book, The Red Web: \"The answe r is quite the reverse of the question: These men (involved with the Consp iracy) became illus- trious primarily because they were part of the Cons piracy.\" 7 So those involved do not become rich and/or illustr ious and then join the Conspiracy; they become rich and illustrious be cause they are members of the Conspiracy. But what is their motive? What prompts men to seek wealth and position? Former Congressman John Schmitz explains that there is an additional goal: Power! Men join the Conspiracy to gain money and then power. Schmitz wrote: \"When a person has all the mo ney he needs, his goal becomes power.\" 8 Benjamin Franklin explained this connection between money and power when he said: \"There are two passions which h ave a powerful influence on the affairs of men. These are... love of power and love of money.... When united... they have the most violent effects.\" 9 However, power itself has a corrupting influence on those who seek it. In an oft-quoted truth, Lord Acton explained power thus: \"Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely.\" 9"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION Those who seek power will be corrupted by it. They will be willing to intentionally cause depressions, revolutions, and w ars in order to further their desire for more power. This corrupting nature of the very pursuit of power explains why the moral mind of the individual who neither desires power over others nor understands the desire for su ch power cannot fathom why power-seekers would want to create human misery through wars, depressions, and revolutions. In other words, the conspirators are successful bec ause the moral citizen cannot accept the conclusion that other individuals would actually wish to create incredibly destructive acts against their fe llow citizens. Another power seeker, the Russian anarchist Bakunin , explained that this process of corruption even affected those dedi cated to freedom who were given power to protect the powerless. He wrote that \"... the possession of power transformed into a tyrant even the most devot ed friend of liberty.\" 10 The delight in the possession of power over others was explained by another observer of the power-seeking Joseph Kenned y: \"I like Joe Kennedy. He understands power. Power is the end. What other delight is there but to enjoy the sheer sense of control? He would say: 'Le t me see any other motive in the people who command.' \" 11 So the motive of the Conspirators has been identifi ed: It is Power! 10"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 God or Government? The Conspiracy that will be examined in this volume has been in existence for many years. Comprehending how it coul d survive for such a long period of time has been difficult. One explanation of its lengthy existence was offere d by George Orwell, the British Socialist, who wrote Animal Farm and 19 84, two books on the subject of absolute power in the hands of a few. He wrote: \"The Party is not concerned with perpetuating its blood but with perp etuating itself. Who wields power is not important provided the hierarch ical structure remains always the same.\" 1 The method by which the Conspiracy recruits new mem bers to replace those who retire or the is explained by Norman Dodd , an investigator and researcher into the existence of the Conspiracy. Mr . Dodd explained: \"The careers of men are watched. The men who indicate th at they would be especially capable in terms of the aims of this gro up are approached quietly and invited into the inner circles. They are watche d as they carry out assignments and eventually they are drawn into it u nder circumstances which make it virtually impossible for them to ever get out of it.\" 2 What is the ultimate goal of the Conspiracy? If tot al power is the final 11"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 GOD OR GOVERNMENT? object, then, any system which maximizes power into the hands of a few is the system to be desired. In terms of government, t hen, the ultimate form of power is Communism. This is the seat of the maximum power over the economy and of the individual. The Conspirators: \"w ant big government because they understand that Socialism (and Communi sm as well) is not a humanitarian system for redistributing wealth, but for concentrating and controlling it. They also recognize it as a system for concentrating and controlling people.\" 3 It is common for detractors of this position to cla im that the last thing that the wealthy of the world want is government co ntrol over or ownership of the factors of production. But, as we shall see, Socialism or Communism offers the Conspiracy the greatest vehicle for conc entrating and controlling the wealth. This is the ultimate goal of these plan ners: power over not only the wealth of the world, but also the producers of that wealth, the people themselves. So the Conspiracy uses government to ge t control of the government, and total government control is their g oal. If government is being used by the Conspiracy to co nsolidate power into its hands, it behooves those who wish to preserve t heir freedoms to under- stand the very nature and function of government. O nce the character of government is understood, efforts can be directed a gainst the increase in governmental powers over both the national economy and the lives of its citizens. A good place to begin such a study is to examine th e two sources claimed to be the source of human rights. There are only tw o, presuming that it is admitted that humans do indeed have rights: either man himself, or someone or something external to man himself, a Creator. Many of America's founding fathers were aware of th e difference between these two alternatives. Thomas Jefferson, f or instance, stated his concern and understanding thus: \"The God who gave u s life gave us liberty. Can the liberties of a nation be secure when we hav e removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God?\" However, the corresponding alternative explanation argues that our rights come from government, the creature of man hi mself. This contention holds that man creates government to give man his r ights. A stern warning for those who do not distinguish be tween these two alternatives came from William Penn. He wrote: \"If men will not be governed by God, they then must be governed by tyra nts.\" There are four references to a Creator in the Decla ration of Independ- ence, but certain of America's leaders are now aski ng that God must be separated from the affairs of the government. If th is separation is made, as Mr. Penn indicated, the people will be governed by tyrants, and future tyrants will do all that they can to separate a bel ief in God from the existence of government. 12"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 GOD OR GOVERNMENT? A good example of the philosophy that governments g rant human rights to their citizens is found in the Internatio nal Covenants on Human Rights, passed in 1966 by the United Nations. It re ads, in part: \"The States parties to the present Covenant recognize that, in the enjoyment of those rights provided by the State, in conformity with th e present Covenant, the State may subject such rights only to such limitati ons as are determined by law.. ..\" 4 This document, passed unanimously by all of the par ties voting, including the United States, concluded that man's r ights are granted by the government. It further concluded that these rights could be limited by law; in other words, that which the government grants can b e controlled by the granting body, the government. That which the gover nment gives can also be taken away. Man's rights under this thought are not very secure . Governments can change, and with the change, man's rights can disap pear. Knowledge of this fact did not escape America's founding fathers, who wrote in the Declaration of Independence: \"We hold these truths to be self e vident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creat or with certain inalienable rights....\" Here, then, is the other theory of the source of ma n's rights: they are given to man by his Creator. Man's rights are inali enable (defined as incapable of being transferred) which means that th ey can not be taken away by anyone except the entity that gave the rights in the first place: in this case, the Creator. So here are the two competing and contradictory the ories about the rights of man: one holds that they are given by the Creator, and therefore can only be removed by the entity that created them in the first place; the other holds that man's rights come from man himself and t herefore can be limited or removed by man or by other men, as \"determined b y law.\" Therefore, the man who wishes to protect his rights from those who wish to limit them must protect himself and his hum an rights by creating an agency that has the power to exceed that exerted by those who violate human rights. The agency created is called government. Bu t granting power to government to protect human rights also grants powe r to those who can abuse it as a vehicle to destroy or limit the right s of the people who created the government. Those who wrote the Constitution realized that this tendency existed when they wrote the Bill of Rights, the first ten A mendments to the Consti- tution. The purpose of these amendments is to restr ict the power of the government to violate the rights of the citizens of the nation. The founding fathers wrote these restrictions with phrases like: 13"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 GOD OR GOVERNMENT? \"Congress shall pass no law...\" \"The right of the people... shall not be infringed. \" \"No person shall be... deprived.\" \"The accused shall enjoy the right.\" Notice that these are not restrictions on human rig hts, but are restric- tions on the activities of governments. If rights are granted by the Creator of those right s, what are rights granted by government? It becomes important to dist inguish between a Right and a Privilege by defining these two terms. A Right is a freedom to act morally without asking permission; A Privilege is a freedom to act morally but only af ter permission has been granted by some governmental entity. Perhaps a good illustration of the misuse of human rights occurred during World War II when the German government, act ing through its leader, Adolf Hitler, decided that certain of the p eople did not have the right to life, and decrees were issued to exterminate tho se who the government felt had no human rights. The right to life, then, granted to each individual by his Creator, no longer was a right in Germany, it had become a priv ilege. Man lived by permission of the government, which had the power t o limit and even curtail the human right to life. The human rights that the individual wishes to prot ect are simple in nature, and include the right to Life, Liberty and Property. These three rights are in essence only one right: t he right to Life. These rights are in accord with man's basic nature. Man (the author will use the generic term \"man\" to mean all of humanity, both male and female) is created hungry and needs to produce food to sust ain his life. Without the right to keep what he has produced (his property) m an will surely starve to death. Not only must man be allowed to keep the pro ducts of his labors, he must be free to produce the property he needs for h is sustenance (the right known as Liberty.) Governments do not need to take man's life to kill him. Governments can remove man's right to property or the freedom t o produce the property needed to maintain his life. A government that rest ricts man's ability to keep what he produces (his property) has an equal abilit y to kill a man as surely as a government that takes his life wantonly (such as in the case of Germany.) As will be shown in subsequent chapters, there are government entities that restrict man's right to property or his right to li berty widiout terminating his life directly. But the effect is still the same. One of the objections of \"pro-life\" supporters, tho se opposed to the government legalizing abortion, is that government is now justifying the 11"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 GOD OR GOVERNMENT? termination of life because the life has been terme d \"unwanted\" by its mother. This was the reason offered by Hitler for h is decision to terminate the lives of countless millions of individuals in G ermany. The Jews and others were \"unwanted\" and therefore the government could take away their right to live. As will be illustrated later, the Communists wish t o abolish \"private property,\" or the individual's right to keep what h e produces. One who spoke in favor of the concept of private pr operty was Abraham Lincoln, who said: \"Property is the fruit of labor; property is desirable; it is a positive good in the world. That some should be r ich shows that others may become rich, and hence is just encouragement to ind ustry and enterprise. Let not him who is houseless pull down the house of ano ther, but let him work diligently and build one for himself, thus by examp le assuring that his own shall be safe from violence when built.\" 5 15"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 Freedom Liberty is the only thing you cannot have unless yo u are willing to give it to others. Liberty is defined as rights with responsibilities. Its opposite, License, is defined as rights with no responsibilities. Another word for License would be Anarchy, or a situation where there are no rules, r ights, or privileges. The strong devour the weak; the powerful destroy the po werless. In the animal world, License is defined as \"the Law of the jungle .\" Those who love freedom must recognize that others h ave equal rights to their freedom as well, and that only by recognizing this fact will all be totally free. That means that all individuals must restrict their freedom to harm others, or none will be free to enjoy their rights to life, liberty, and property. The Creator of man laid down some guidelines about the rights of others. These guidelines are written in the negativ e in at least six of the Ten Commandments. The guideline is written \"Thou shall not ...\" which means that all will be free if all men confine thei r activities to those which do not harm odiers. America's founding fathers, when they wrote the Con stitution and the Bill of Rights, also wrote their guidelines in the negadve: \"Congress shall pass no laws....\" But these restrictions enable man to be freer because man's life would be free of governmental restraints. Those who wrote the Consdtudon were concerned about the concept of 16"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 FREEDOM equal rights. They were attempting to separate them selves from a monarchy as a form of government where certain individuals, the king and his court, had more rights than the common citizens. These ind ividuals had superior rights because of their positions. Conversely, the common people had little if any rights. America's founding fathers were conv inced that they would not allow this inequality to occur in this country as t hey wrote the founding documents. They wrote it into the Constitution that all men we re created equal, that the lowest had the same rights to Life, Liberty, an d Property as did the highest. Modern man, through the misuse of governme nt, passes laws to make men equal in all areas of their lives. This ob vious misunderstanding of man's nature has caused much grief as long as man h as been attempting to create government. The solitary man, alone in his environment, need no t concern himself with rights and the need to create government to pr otect those rights. No one exists to plunder his goods or take his life. There is no need to protect his rights, They are secure. It is only when another individual or groups of ind ividuals join him in his solitary existence that concerns about rights b ecome important. Each of the inhabitants has an equal right to life, liberty and property. That right is protected as long as each inhabitant recognizes the equal right of the others. No individual nor any group of indiv iduals has the right to take the life, liberty or property of another individual or group of individuals. There is no question that any individual, or group of individuals, has the ability to violate the rights of any individual . The question being discussed here is whether or not the violator has t he right to do so. If each individual has the right to his life, liber ty and property, and no one has the right to take these rights, then it fol lows that man must have the right to protect his rights. This right is called t he Right to Self Defense. Each individual has this right in equal proportion to an y other individual. If each individual has the right to self-defense an d each has it equally, then each individual has the right to pool his indi vidual right with others so that all can protect their rights from those who co me to violate all of their rights at the same time. In other words, if each has the right individually, then all have the right collectively. Such collective poolings of individua l rights to self defense are called governments. Men create governments when they pool their individ ual rights to self defense to create an agency that has the collective right to protect both the individual and the collective body of individuals. Men can only grant to government those rights they themselves have. If an individual does not have a right, it is not poss ible for that individual to 17"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 FREEDOM grant that right to government. Government can only have those rights that each individual has. These truths about human rights can best be illustr ated by a brief and simple economic model based upon two assumptions ab out human nature: 1. All people consume equally; and 2. All people produce unequally. Assumption #1 is not an absolute, obviously, since not all people consume exactly the same, but basically this statem ent is correct. Notice that the participants at a banquet are all given an equa l portion, whether they are large or small, and each serving at a drive-in rest aurant is the same size. So, for the sake of this discussion, it will be assumed that all people pretty well consume equally. Such is not the case with Assumption #2. Each perso n, if given equal opportunity to produce his sustenance, would produc e unequally. Some would produce more than others. Generally, the youn g, the energetic and the skilled would produce more than the old, the lazy, and the unskilled. The well would produce more than the infirm. But each w ould consume about the same. This means that some individuals produce more than they consume, while others consume more than they produc e. The author has constructed an economic model that w ill illustrate the validity of the concept of private property based u pon these two assumptions. There will be seven individuals in this economic mo del who have grouped themselves together on an island. These ind ividuals will have no outside interference from other individuals. Each individual, herein identified by a letter, pro duces at an unequal rate, and consumes at an equal rate.

For the sake of this model, all individuals will be presumed to be funct ioning at their utmost capacity. There are no slackers. All are producing to their fullest extent possible. Also, there is no waste in this model. Al l goods produced are consumed. That means that some individuals produce a Surplus, defined as an excess of production over consumption. (This is als o defined as Wealth.) And some individuals produce a Deficit, defined as a sh ortage of production over consumption. This can be illustrated thus: Individual Production Surplus Deficit Consumption A. 1,200 700 500 B. 750 250 500 C. 600 100 500 D. 400 100 500 E. 300 200 500 F. 250 250 500 G. -0- 500 500 TOTALS 3,500 1,050 1,050 3,500 The important thing to recognize is that certain in dividuals, in this case, D, E, F and G, are dependent, in varying degrees, u pon the rest of the individuals in this model. In fact, individual G is completely dependent upon the rest of the individuals, because if the ot hers didn't exist, individual G would surely the. A logical question to ask at this point would be wh ether individual G would have the right to prevent the others from lea ving the island should they choose to do so. A similar question that could be asked is whether G would have the right to force the others to produce what individual G requires to maintain his existence. These are real questions for all governments and in dividuals to ponder, and, as will be shown later, there are governments that have taken the position that individual G would have both the righ t to keep others within the environment and the right to force the others t o produce for G's individual needs. The next question that needs to be answered is whet her the less produc- tive individuals D, E, F, and G have a right to the surplus of individuals A, B, and C. There are governments and individuals tha t believe that this is indeed a right, and that governments are created to make certain that their individual needs are met, by distributing the surpl us of the productive. These forms of government will be identified later. There are, obviously, two positions on the question of to whom the 19"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 FREEDOM surplus belongs. Those who hold that private proper ty rights grant them the right to keep that surplus are obviously in disagre ement with those who hold that the surplus goods belong to those who do not p roduce them. There are only two methods by which the surplus of individuals A, B, and C can be divided: either with their consent or without it. Either the property belongs to those who produce it or it does n't. Presume that the four individuals, D, E, F, and G, ask A, B, and C to divide their surplus voluntarily, and the latter re fuse. Does that refusal grant the right to D, E, F and G to take the goods from t hem? If property rights have any meaning, the answer mus t surely be in the negative. Does the right to property include the ri ght to protect it from the plundering acts of those who come to take it by for ce? Does an individual have the right to protect his property against the acts of another individual? Does the individual have the right to protect his p roperty against the acts of a group of individuals? Does the group have the rig ht to protect their property against the acts of another group? Realizing that the property of the productive A, B, and C cannot be taken from them by force, it behooves the less prod uctive to find another way to acquire the surplus. Presume that they develop a new strategy. They call a meeting to discuss the question of the surplus, a nd all seven individuals attend. The question of how to handle the surplus i s discussed and then acted upon, allowing the majority to decide how to divide the property. In this case, D, E, F, and G vote to divide the property eq ually, and A, B and C vote against it. Do D, E, F and G have the right to vote away the pr operty rights of the minority. Does it make it right because all were gi ven an equal opportunity to express their opinion? Does it make it right if they call the meeting a go vernment? Does it make it right if the majority says that whatever the maj ority decides will be what the entirety will do? Does the minority have any ri ghts? If the majority votes to take the minority's proper ty, what is it called? It is called a Democracy! Next, presume that the majority is able to create a government to take the surplus from the producers, and that the produc ers decide among themselves to only produce what they consume the ne xt year, in this case 500 units apiece. Would the minority have mat right? That means that A, B, and C will only produce what they consumed the previous year, or 500 units apiece. The remainder o f the people continue to produce what they did the year before. The figures for the second year will be as follows: 20"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 FREEDOM 2nd Year: Individual Production Consumption A 500 350 B. 500 350 C. 500 350 D. 400 350 E. 300 350 F. 250 350 G. -0- 350 TOTALS: 2,450 2,450 The surpluses and deficits become: Individual Production Surplus Deficit Consumption A. 500 150 350 B. 500 150 350 C. 500 150 350 D. 400 50 350 E. 300 50 350 F. 250 100 350 G. -0- 350 350 TOTALS: 2,450 500 500 2,450 Notice that the total production dropped from 3,500 units to 2,450 units, a drop of 1,050 units. Each individual's share also decreased as well, from 500 units per person to 350. Now does the majority have the right to force the m inority to produce up to last year's productivity? Even if the majorit y tried, would the minority produce up to the standard that the majority expect ed of them? Will the use of force make them produce? Last, would the majority have the right to keep A, B, and C in the workplace should they choose to leave it? Would the y have the right to build a wall around the environment to make certain that they did not leave? Certain socialists in today's world have taken just that position. \"Iron\" and \"Bamboo\" Curtains are the results of the majori ty's realization (or at least of the realization of the ruling class claimi ng to act on behalf of the majority) that they need the productive talents of the minority, and because of this needed production, the majority builds wall s to keep the minority inside. What then, should the incentive be to encourage pro duction? Should it be the incentive of the government (fear) or the in centive of the market place (profit)? 21"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 FREEDOM The key to production is the incentive of the marke tplace, the right to keep what is produced, the Right to Private Propert y! The right of the individual to better his life by producing more tha n he consumes and to keep what he produces. This economic model has many illustrations in the w orld today. One is occurring today in the Soviet Union, where the basi c philosophy that motivates the government is the proposition that wh atever is produced in the society belongs to all in that society. However, ev en in Russia, there is a small percentage of the country where the individual can keep what he produces: According to the government's own figures..., priva te plots with a mere three percent of the nation's own acrea ge accounted for 30 percent of the gross harvest, other than grains, 40 percent of all cattle-breeding, 60 percent of the country's potato crops, 40 percent of all vegetables and milk, 68 percent of all meat products. Their fruit yields... are double those of state orc hards for equivalent areas, its potato harvest per hectare tw o-thirds higher than on collective farms. Even in grain, which is a very minor element in the private sector, it produces one-third more per sown unit th an an average socialized farm. 1 Why is just a small percentage of cultivated land a rea able to out- produce the remainder? It is because the producers can keep what they produce! The producer has the right to Private Prop erty! Governments can not take what has been produced in this free market environment, for any reason. People who are allowed to keep what they have produ ced will always out-produce those who have their production taken f rom them for the benefit of society. And no one can force the producer to eq ual his peak production in a free market. Even Communist China has discovered the truth of th is proposition, according to an article in Time magazine on the Jun Tan brigade. It is here that China allows the workers to keep for themselve s all the produce over the government set quota. The brigade's leader is quoted as saying: \"All the peasants feel happy. They work twice as hard as they used to because the y know that if they work harder, they can make more money.\" The article cited the results of China's experiment with the right to Private Property: \"Its per-person annual revenue of $201 is well above the national rural average of only $91.\" 2 But even with these glaring examples of the wisdom of the right to 22"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 FREEDOM Private Property, there are still those who wish to challenge this premise. One, for instance, is Nicole Salinger, who was quot ed as saying: \"In France and some other countries it is being proposed that there be a specified differential between the lowest paid worker and the highest paid executive.\" 3 Another, noted American economist John Kenneth Galb raith, also wanted to limit man's rewards for his productivity: \"Sooner or later there will probably be some such rule. If a full-time ass embly line worker in the United States got $12,000 a year, then a top execut ive would have a ceiling, say, five times as much, or $60,000. That is a livi ng wage.\" 4 If the top executives of the nation were earning mo re than Mr. Galbraith or some government bureaucrat felt they should be e arning, their wages would be reduced by some governmental edict. One ca n only wonder what Mr. Galbraith would do if any individual having his wages cut wished to leave his position because he felt he wasn't being rewarded adequately, especially if he were in a specialized field where only he had the experience or ability to perform the job. Perhaps Mr. Galbrait h would use the force of government to require that he stay. Another question unanswered by Mr. Galbraith is the question of what he would do if no one wanted to perform the job bec ause no one felt the salary was adequate. But Salinger and Galbraith and this economic model have not ade- quately answered the question of just how the socie ty provides for individual G who is unable to provide for himself. Basically, there are only two ways for the society to satisfy this individ- ual's basic needs. Either method takes the surplus produced by the more productive individuals in the society and divides i t, either: 1. Voluntarily, or 2. Coercively. In other words, the society can either steal the su rplus or they can ask the producers to share it voluntarily with the less pro ductive. Sharing a surplus voluntarily is called Charity; sharing it through t he use of force is called Welfare. Just imagine the public outcry should one of Americ a's charitable institutions choose to collect their needed revenue s through the use of coercion: \"Our needs are more than what you wish to give voluntarily. We will take what we need.\" Every person so wronged could expect that the force of government would be used to require the charitable institution to return the stolen property. That is one of the functions of governmen t: to right a wrong such as the taking of property by force. Returning to the seven individual Economic Model, w hat is it called when D, E, F, and G join together to violently take the property of A, B and C? 23"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 FREEDOM It is called Stealing! If each group, A, B, and C, and D, E, F, and G, wer e separate nations, and the latter came to take the former's property b y force, the action would be called a war! In either case, the individuals an d the nations wronged have the right to defend themselves against the attack o n their property. Individuals have the right to self-defense, and the y can combine these individual rights to self-defense by forming a gove rnment that has the right to collective self-defense. Once governments have b een formed, individual nations can join together to protect themselves fro m other nations. These nations have the right to hire individuals, called soldiers, to assist in the defense of the nation, just as individuals have the right to protect their life and liberty by hiring a \"bodyguard.\" Should war as a means of acquiring property fail, t hose who wish to acquire the property of others must design other st rategies. One method that was devised was the use of the majority vote, alrea dy discussed. The use of a democracy is another method of taking property away from the minority under the guise of whatever excuse the minority wou ld accept as valid. Notice that in such questions as are decided by maj ority vote, that whatever the majority decides is what the entirety gets. Notice that there is no question as to whether or not what the majority wan ts is right or wrong: the majority rules! However, the question should never be who is right, but what is right. Just because a majority decides what the action to be taken is, it does not necessarily follow that the action to be taken is c orrect. Notice that there are no minority rights in a true democracy: the majority rules. Notice that if the government (in t he name of the majority) decides to grant privileges just to a minority, the n the majority must give up its rights. \"Majorities do not determine right and wrong. Right is right though everyone votes against it, and wrong is wron g though all but God favor it.\" 5 Next, presume that the majority legitimizes its vot e by declaring that they have created a government, and that all are bo und to obey the decisions of the majority. It is proper to ask the inevitable question: where did the majority get this right? People can only give to government those rights tha t they themselves have. Does an individual have the right to take fro m another? Do two individuals have the right to take from another gro up of individuals? Do three individuals have the right? Do a grouping of individuals, when acting in concert, have the right? Can a group of individu als get together, call themselves a government, and then grant that govern ment a right that they themselves do not have? Even if that group is a maj ority? 24"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 FREEDOM Can man change the Commandment taken from the Ten C ommand- ments, that reads: \"Thou shall not steal\" and conve rt it to: \"Thou shall not steal, except by majority vote!\" Or to: \"Thou shall not steal, except that portion of thy neighbor's wealth which exceeds thin e own!\" Taking the property of another, no matter what the motive, is called stealing, no matter whether an individual, or a gro up of individuals acting through an agency they call government, commits the crime. Another word for stealing is Plunder, and when gove rnments legitimize the taking of another's property, it is called Lega l Plunder. What happens when a government legalizes stealing? I have long been convinced that institudons purely democradc must, sooner or later, destroy liberty or civilizad on, or both. How does this happen? The adoption of democracy. .. is fatal to good gover nment, to liberty, to law and order, to respect for authority , and to religion, and must produce chaos from which a new world tyran ny will arise. 6 You can never have a revoludon in order to establis h a demo- cracy. You must have a democracy in order to have a revoludon. 7 Is there any form of government that protects minor ity rights (or majority rights, for that matter) if Democracies ar e unable to do so? Those who created the American government believed that there were indeed ways to accomplish this vital protection. Th ey wrote in the Declara- don of Independence: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all m en are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalien- able rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men . . . There are, indeed, some \"self-evident truths\" in th at short paragraph, and America's founding fathers were quite aware of them. One of these was the proposition that men were created equal, but we re not equal. This means that men have equal access to their rights to life, liberty, and property, no matter what their social status, their color, their nadonality, their sex, or their religion. It did not mean that all men were equal i n ability or personal merit and that property should be divided equally amongst them. This particular position was extremely important as the founding fadiers had come from a monarchy as a form of gover nment where certain individuals, just because of their position or soci al status, had superior rights 25"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 FREEDOM to those born of \"common\" stock. It is quite appare nt that the founding fathers were attempting to limit this concept of th e European nobility. Another \"self-evident truth\" in that paragraph was the recognition that man's rights were inalienable, which meant that oth er men, or other governments, could not tamper with them. The founding fathers attempted to define what these human rights were: the right to \"life, liberty and the pursuit o f happiness.\" (They recognized that these were not the only rights of m an, but that these were \"amongst others.\") And lastly, that man creates governments to protect these inalienable rights. James Madison has been quoted as saying that: \"Gove rnment is instituted to protect property of every sort. This being the end of government, that alone is a just government which impartially s ecures to every man, whatever is his own.... That is not a just governme nt where... proper- ty... is violated by... seizures .. is violated by. .. seizures of one class of citizens for the service of the rest.\" Two other examples of the concern about the rights of man can be found in the Virginia Bill of Rights, adopted on Ju ne 12, 1776, and the Alabama Constitution. Article I of the Virginia Bill of Rights states: That all men are by nature equally free and indepen dent, and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they e nter into a state of society, they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity; Namely the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety. Article 1 of the Alabama Constitution reads, in par t: That the sole object and only legitimate end of gov ernment is to protect the citizen in the enjoyment of life, li berty and property, and when the government assumes other functions it is usurpation and oppression. Since government is the accumulation of individual rights to use force in the protection of individual or collective right s to life, liberty and property, great care should be exercized in the gra nting of power to the government. The question is always just how much po wer can be granted to government before it, in itself, becomes an enemy o f human rights. George Washington addressed this problem when he st ated: \"Govern- ment is not reason, it is not eloquence. It is forc e, and like fire, it is a 26"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 FREEDOM dangerous servant and a fearful master.\" 8 President Washington likened the power of governmen t to the power of fire: both were useful and necessary but both had t he power to destroy. Both were dangerous to the individual. The homeowner, anxious to warm his house, brings fi re into the exterior walls, but builds a furnace wall around it so that it will not destroy his home. Obviously, the fire can be both beneficia l and dangerous and man must learn its nature and protect himself against i ts consequences. Those who create government must design some struct ure to keep the government within its proper confines for exactly t he same reason: govern- ment also has the power to destroy not only the ind ividual but the entire nation as well. America's founding fathers attempted to contain the government's power to destroy the rights of the individual by us e of the containing walls of the Constitution. This document was not intended to restrain the power of the people. It was intended to restrain the powe r of the government. Notice that government is restricted to the powers enumera ted in the first three Articles of the Constitution: those that define the powers of the Legislative, the Executive, and the Judicial branches of the gov ernment. The purpose was to properly confine the power of government to those enumerated and those alone. A parallel to the limitation of powers in the Const itution to those enumerated specifically can be found in the Propert y Insurance field. There are two methods of insuring real and personal property: 1. The \"Named Peril\" method; and 2. The \"All Risk\" method. The former covers the property for damage by certai n perils enumerated by the policy. For instance, the property is insure d when damaged by a Fire, a Windstorm, or a Vehicle, etc., because those were included as coverages under the terms of the policy. For there to be cove rage under the policy, the property would have to be damaged by a specific per il exactly described by the coverage part of the policy. If the property wa s damaged by an avalanche, it would not be covered, because Avalanche damage i s not an enumerated peril. Under the \"All Risk\" method, all losses would be co vered unless the specific peril causing the loss was excluded by the policy. To see if a certain loss is covered, the policy holder would have to re ad the exclusions. For instance, in the above example, the damage to the p roperty caused by the avalanche would be covered unless it was specifical ly excluded by the terms of the policy. Governments are like the two methods of insurance: governments can 27"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 FREEDOM either have enumerated powers (those specifically g ranted by the people to the government) or governments can have all power u nless specifically prohibited by some document. The former type is the government of free men; the latter is the govern- ment of slaves. Kings, dictators, and tyrants want all power in their hands; free men attempt to limit government to specificall y enumerated powers. It would be difficult to limit the powers of the go vernment in the \"All Risk\" method: every conceivable instance where gove rnment was not intended to operate would have to be enumerated. Th e task of detailing the exact conditions where government could not operate would be impossible, especially if the intent was to limit the powers of government. America's founding fathers were aware of the differ ence between the two methods and attempted to limit government to a \"Nam ed Peril\" form: they listed the exact powers they granted government. Th ey spelled these out, specifying the powers exactly. Congress was granted the power \"to declare war,\" \"to coin money,\" to establish \"post offices a nd post roads,\" and to \"raise and support armies,\" amongst others. As a further evidence that they were concerned abou t limiting the powers of government, they added the Bill of Rights to the Constitution. These were specific limitations on governmental aut hority. But the ultimate limitation on the power of the federal government w as the 10th Amendment. This read: \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitu- tion, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reser ved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" In other words, the founding fathers gave us a \"Nam ed Peril\" form of government. They limited the powers of government t o those specifically enumerated in the Constitution. Confirmation of this fact comes frequently from our Congressmen, although less often than before. One supporter of t his limited power position stood up in the House of Representatives in 1814 an d addressed the nation. He said: The Government of the United States is a Government of limited powers. You take by grant; your powers are special and delegated — that must be construed strictly. All powers not delegated are reserved to the States or the people. Your authority is defined — you take nothin g by inference or application, except what may be \"necessary and p roper for carrying into execution\" the powers expressly grant ed. 9 There are those, unfortunately, who believe that th eir power in the halls of Congress is nearly unlimited. Most cite the so-c alled \"General Welfare\" clause of the Constitution as the source of their s upposed authority to 28"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 FREEDOM legislate in all areas. This clause is contained in Axticle I, Section 8 and reads: \"The Congress shall have power to lay and collect t axes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the commo n defense and general welfare of the United States....\" (emphasis added.) James Madison, one of the three writers of the Fede ralist Papers which were written in an attempt to explain the new form of government to the American people, wrote this about the General Welfa re Clause: \"The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the feder al government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite.\" (Federalist Paper #45) And in Federalist Paper #41, Madison attempted to r eply to a supporter of the broad interpretation of the General Welfare Clause who wrote: \"The power... to provide for the... general welfare... a mounts to an unlimited commission to exercise every power which may be all eged to be necessary for the... general welfare.\" Madison wrote that those who felt that the General Welfare Clause gave an enormous grant of power to Congress were in \"err or,\" and that the supporter's idea was an \"absurdity.\" Yet this claim continues to be heard around the nat ion. Hugh Williamson of North Carolina, a member of the Constitutional Convention, also took a position on the General Wel fare Clause, when he wrote the following in 1781: If Congress can apply money indefinitely to the gen eral welfare and are the sole and supreme judges of the general welfare, they may take the care of religion into their hands ; they may establish teachers in every state, county and paris h, and pay them out of the public treasury; they may take into thei r hands the education of children, establishing in like manner schools through- out the Union; they may undertake the regulation of all roads other than post roads. In short, everything from the highest object of sta te legislation down to the most minute objects of police, would be thrown under the power of Congress. For every object I have mentioned would admit the a pplica- tion of money, and might be called, if Congress ple ased, provisions for the General Welfare. (Mr. Williamson was indeed a prophet before his tim e!) So America's founding fathers had concerns about th e amount of power that should reside in the federal government. They attempted to limit that power by constructing a Constitution in such a mann er that government had specific, defined, and strictly limited powers. 29"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 FREEDOM Frederic Bastiat, a French economist, statesman, an d author, wrote during the years of the second French Revolution of 1848. He saw mat the taking of one man's property for the use of another was an improper activity, one that he called Plunder. When government perform ed the same activity, they had the power to make it legal, and Bastiat ca lled mis form of stealing Legal Plunder. Government in his day had taken the power to do what the individual members of his nation couldn't do: take property from one to give to another. He wrote the following in his classic book The Law: But how is this legal plunder to be identified? Quite simply: See if the law takes from some person s what belongs to them, and gives it to persons to whom it does not belong. See if the law benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what the citizen himself cannot do without co mmitting a crime. Then abolish the law without delay. If such a law, which is an isolated case — is not abolished immediately, it wi ll spread, mul- tiply and develop into a system. 10 Bastiat mentioned that Legal Plunder could manifest itself in two forms: 1. The taking of property by government from the indiv idual it belongs to and the giving of it to someone it does not belong to; and 2. The granting of a privilege to one group at the exp ense of another. Bastiat further went on to predict what would happe n under this system of government: As long as it is admitted that the law may be diver ted from its true purpose, that it may violate property instead of protecting it, then everyone will want to participate in making th e law, either to protect himself against plunder or to use it for pl under 11 A truism about Legal Plunder can be stated thus: Government cannot give anything it first doesn't ta ke from someone else. So government cannot be the great giver, as it has nothing to give. Governments can only take. But for those who demand that government should provide the people with their food, their ho using, their education, their clothing, their medical care, their livelihoo d, and their recreation, there is already a governmental agency providing these se rvices to certain of their fellow citizens. 30"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 FREEDOM These services are provided by government in a pris on. There are two classes of citizens in a prison: those who provide the services and those who receive them. The persons who receive the services are not free to provide these services for themselves. Those who provide th e services are free to come and go as they choose. Those for whom the services are provided are called Prisoners; those who provide the services are calle d Wardens. It is also important to examine whether or not gove rnment exists to protect man from himself. John Stuart Mill addresse d this question when he wrote: That the only purpose for which power can be rightl y exer- cised over any member of a civilized community, aga inst his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a su fficient warrant. He cannot rightly be compelled to do or forbear bec ause it will make him happier, because, in the opinion of others , to do so would be wise, or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or entreat- ing him, but not for compelling him, or visiting hi m with any evil in case he does otherwise. To justify that, the conduct from which it is desir ed to deter him must be calculated to produce evil to someone e lse. 12 So government does not exist to protect man from hi mself. It does not exist to re-distribute wealth from one group of ind ividuals to another. It does not exist to grant privileges to one group over ano ther. And it does not exist to operate in every situation envisioned by the min d of man. Government simply exists to protect individual righ ts to Life, Liberty, and Property. That is its sole function. Andrew Jackson summarized these sentiments quite we ll when he wrote the following: \"There are no necessary evils in gov ernment. Its evils exist only in its abuses. If it would confine itself to e qual protection, and, as Heaven does its rains, shower its favors alike on t he high and the low, the rich and the poor, it would be an unqualified blessing.\" 13 31"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 Forms of Government If the democratic form of government (rule by a maj ority) does not protect the rights of the minority, is there a form of government mat does?

It is generally conceded that even a monarchy or a dictatorship is an oligarchy, or a government run by a small, ruling m inority. Every monarchy has its small circle of advisors, who allow the kin g or dictator to rule as long as he does so in a manner pleasing to the oligarchy . It is doubtful that there has ever been a true dictatorship (rule by one pers on) anywhere in the world, except in some isolated instances, such as in a tri be or in a clan. Such is also the case with a democracy, for this fo rm of government is traditionally controlled at the top by a small ruli ng oligarchy. The people in a democracy are conditioned to believe that they ar e indeed the decision- making power in the government, but in truth there is almost always a small circle at the top making the decisions for the enti rety. So the only true form of government throughout history has been the oliga rchy, a rule by a minority. As proof of these contentions, one has only to read the 1928 United States Army Training Manual, which defined a democr acy as: A government of the masses. Authority derived throu gh mass meeting or any form of direct expression. Results i n mobocracy, attitude toward property is communistic — negating property rights. Attitude toward law is that the will of the majorit y shall regulate, whether it be based upon deliberation or governed by passion, prejudice, and impulse, without restraint or regard to consequence. Results in demagogism, license, agitation, disconte nt, anarchy. 1 A democracy, according to this definition, is actua lly controlled by a demagogue, defined as: \"A speaker who seeks to make capital of social discontent and gain political influence.\" So demagogues are usually hired by those supporting an oligarchy as a form of government to create the anarchy or social discontent that the oligarchs convert into a true oligarchy. Democracie s are converted to anarchy, where no one rules, as the oligarchs seek to control the government themselves. And anarchy ends with a dictatorship or a tyrannical form of government when the oligarchy imposes total control over all of the people. The 1928 definition of a democracy was later change d by those who write Army manuals, however. In 1952, this became the definition of a democracy in the Soldier's Guide: 83"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 FORMS OF GOVERNMENT Because the United States is a democracy, the major ity of the people decide how our government will be organized and run — and that includes the Army, Navy and Air Force. The people do this by electing representatives, and these men and women then carry out the wishes of the people. 2 (This is a strange definition to offer the American fighting man: that democratic policies manage the Armed Services. It i s doubtful that enlisted men elect their officers or make decisions as to ho w to conduct the war.) So if democracies are in truth oligarchies, where t he minority rules, is there a form of government that protects both minor ity and majority rights? There is, and it is called a republic, which is def ined as: Rule by law: a republic In the republican form of government, the power res ts in a written constitution, wherein the powers of the government are limited so that the people retain the maximum amount of power themselve s. In addition to limiting the power of the government, care is also taken to limit the power of the people to restrict the rights of both the ma jority and the minority. Perhaps the simplest method of illustrating the dif ference between an oligarchy, a democracy and a republic would be to d iscuss the basic plot of the classic grade B western movie. In this plot, one that the moviegoer has probably s een a hundred times, the brutal villain rides into town and guns down th e unobtrusive town merchant by provoking him into a gunfight. The sher iff hears the gunshot and enters the scene. He asks the assembled crowd w hat had happened, and they relate the story. The sheriff then takes the v illain into custody and removes him to the city jail. Back at the scene of the shooting, usually in a tav ern, an individual stands up on a table (this individual by definition is a Demagogue) and exhorts the crowd to take the law into its own hand s and lynch the villain. The group decides that this is the course of action that they should take (notice that the group now becomes a democracy wher e the majority rules) and down the street they (now called a mob) go. The y reach the jail and demand that the villain be released to their custod y. The mob has spoken by majority vote: the villain must hang. The sheriff appears before the democracy and explai ns that the villain has the right to a trial by jury. The demagogue cou nters by explaining that the majority has spoken: the villain must hang. The sheriff explains that his function is to protect the rights of the individual , be he innocent or guilty, until that individual has the opportunity to defend himself in a court of law. The sheriff continues by explaining that the will o f the majority cannot deny 34"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 FORMS OF GOVERNMENT this individual that right. The demagogue continues to exhort the demo- cracy to lynch the villain, but if the sheriff is p ersuasive and convinces the democracy that he exists to protect their rights as well, the scene should end as the people leave, convinced of the merits of the arguments of the sheriff. The republican form of government has triumphed ove r the democratic form of mob action. In summary, the sheriff represents the republic, th e demagogue the control of the democracy, and the mob the democracy . The republic recognizes that man has certain inalienable rights and that government is created to protect those rights, even from the acts of a majority. Notice that the republic must be persuasive in front of the dem ocracy and that the republic will only continue to exist as long as the people recognize the importance and validity of the concept. Should the people wish to overthrow the republic and the sheriff, they certainly have t he power (but not the right) to do so. But the persuasive nature of the republic's argumen ts should convince the mob that it is the preferable form of governmen t. There is another example of the truths of this asse rtion. It is reported in the Bible. The republic, in the form of the Roman government, \"washed its hands of the matter\" after finding the accused Jesus inno cent of all charges, and turned Him over to the democracy, which later cruci fied Him. It is easy to see how a democracy can turn into ana rchy when unscrup- ulous individuals wish to manipulate it. The popula r beliefs of the majority can be turned into a position of committing some in justice against an individual or a group of individuals. This then bec omes the excuse for the unscrupulous to grab total power, all in an effort to \"remedy the situation.\" Alexander Hamilton was aware of this tendency of a democratic form of government to be torn apart by itself, and he ha s been quoted as writing: \"We are now forming a republican government. Real l iberty is not found in the extremes of democracy, but in moderate governme nts. If we incline too much to democracy, we shall soon shoot into a monar chy (or some other form of dictatorship.)\" Others were led to comment on the perils of a democ ratic form of government. One was James Madison who wrote: \"In al l cases where a majority are united by a common interest or passion , the rights of the minority are in danger!\" 3 Another was John Adams who wrote: \"Unbridled passions produce the same effects, whether in a kin g, nobility, or a mob. The experience of all mankind has proved the prevalence of a disposition to use power wantonly. It is therefore as necessary to def end an individual against the majority (in a democracy) as against the king i n a monarchy.\" 4 35"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 FORMS OF GOVERNMENT In a democracy then, Might makes Right. In a republic, Right makes Might. In a democracy, the law restricts the people. In a republic, the law restricts the government. When Moses of the Bible carried the Ten Commandment s down to the people, they were written on stone. The majority of the people did not vote to accept them. They were offered as the truth, and were in stone to teach the people that they couldn't change them by majority v ote. But the people rejected the Commandments anyway, just as they can reject the principles of the republican form of government should they choos e to do so. America's founding fathers, while not writing the l aws in stone, did attempt to restrict man's ability to tamper with th em. The rules for revising or amending the Constitution are rigidly set out in the provisions of the Constitution itself. George Washington, in his farewell address to the A merican people as he was leaving the presidency, spoke about the amen ding of the Constitution: If in the opinion of the people, the distribution o r modifica- tion of the Constitutional power be in any particul ar wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way in which th e Constitu- tion designates. But let there be no change by usur pation, for though this, in one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed. It was about the same time that a British professor named Alexander Fraser Tyler wrote: \"A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can exist only until the voters disc over they can vote themselves largess (defined as a liberal gift) out of the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the c andidate promising the most benefits from the public treasury, with the re sult that democracy always collapses over a loose fiscal policy, always to be followed by a dictatorship.\" Here is outlined the procedure by which democratic, or even republican, forms of government can be turned into a dictatorsh ip. This technique of subverting a democracy into a dic tatorship was spelled out in a book in 1957 by Jan Kozak, a membe r of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. Mr. Kozak titled his book How Parliament Took a Revolutionary Part in the Transit ion to Socialism and the Role of the Popular Masses. The American versio n of his book is titled And Not a Shot is Fired, the Communist Strategy for Subverting a Represen- tative Government. Mr. Kozak describes what has bee n called the \"Pincers Movement,\" the method by which the conspirators can use the parliament, 36"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 FORMS OF GOVERNMENT the \"Pressure from Above,\" and the mob, the \"Pressu re from Below,\" to convert a democracy into a dictatorship. Mr. Kozak explained his strategy: A preliminary condition for carrying out fundamenta l social changes and for making it possible that parl iament be made use of for the purpose of transforming a capit alistic society into a socialistic one, is: a. to fight for a firm parliamentary majority which would ensure and develop a strong 'pres- sure from above,' and b. to see to it that this firm parliamentary majori ty should rely on the revolutionary activity of the broad working masses exerting 'pressure from below.' 5 What Mr. Kozak proposed was a five part program to seize control of a government. The first step consisted of having the conspiracy's own people infiltrate the government (the \"pressure from above.\") The second step was to create a real or alleged gri evance, usually through either an action of government or through s ome situation where the government should have acted and didn't. The third step consisted in having a mob created by the real or alleged grievance that the government or the conspiracy cau sed demand that the problem be solved by a governmental action (the \"pr essure from below.\") The fourth step consisted in having the conspirator s in the government remedy the real or alleged sitiuation with some opp ressive legislation. The fifth step is a repeat of the last three. The l egislation that the government passes does not solve the problem and th e mob demands more and more legislation until the government becomes t otalitarian in nature by possessing all of the power. And total power was the goal of those causing the g rievance. The plan is, as Nesta Webster wrote in her book World Revolu tion: \"the systematic attempt to create grievances in order to exploit th em.\" 6 This technique was used, with a slight variation, b y Adolf Hitler, who sent his own party loyalists into the streets (the \"Pressure from Below\") to create the terror that he blamed on the government (the \"Pressure from Above.\") The German people, told by Hitler that the government in power couldn't end the terror even though they passed opp ressive legislation in an effort to stop it, listened to the one man who was offering relief: Adolf Hitler. He was in a position to stop the terror. He was the one causing it! And therefore he could end it! And he promised that he would end it when he was given the power of government! 37"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 FORMS OF GOVERNMENT The people believed Hitler and voted him into offic e. And once in office, he called in his party loyalists and the terror end ed, just like he promised. Hitler appeared to be a hero: he did what he said h e would. There are some who saw this strategy at work in the passing of the Eighteenth Amendment (\"Prohibition\") to the Constit ution. If the creation of an organized crime syndicate was the reason for the passage of this Amendment, then what happened makes sense. Anyone who knew human nature realized that the Amen dment would not cause the drinking of liquor to stop: it would only make drinking illegal. And the American people responded by purchasing the ir liquor from those willing to risk penalties and fines for selling ill egal liquor. The more that the government clamped down on the illegal sale of liqu or, the more they played into the hands of those who wished to create a crim e syndicate. The more the pressure on those selling the liquor, the more the price went up. The more the price went up, the more unscrupulous became the seller of the liquor. The more unscrupulous the seller, the more crime in the streets. The more crime in the streets, the more pressure on the sell ers of the liquor. Finally, only the most ruthless survived. And the price of l iquor was raised even higher because of the risk involved in selling it. The American people thought that the crime syndicat e that survived the government's pressure would cease after Prohibition was repealed. But they stayed, much to the continued distress of the Ameri can people. Some very well-known Americans benefited from Prohi bition. In fact: \"Frank Costello, the so-called 'Prime Minister of t he Underworld'... in- formed Peter Maas, author of The Valachi Papers tha t he and Joseph Kennedy (the father of the late President, John Ken nedy) were partners in the liquor business.\" 7 This startling connection between organized crime a nd the father of the late President was confirmed in an article in Parad e Magazine on November 16, 1980. A more current example of this technique was used b y those who wanted to prolong the Vietnamese War. This strategy was used throughout the war with extreme effectiveness. One of the truths of the economic system under whic h America operates is that the name on the bottom line of the payroll check is the employer, and the name on the top line is the employee. As long a s the employee continues to perform as requested by the employer, the employ ee continues getting payroll checks. When the employee ceases to perform as requested, the checks are no longer issued. The same principle applies in the funding of the pu blic universities during the Vietnamese War. A good percentage of the anti-government, anti-Viet namese War 38"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 FORMS OF GOVERNMENT protestors came from the college campuses in the Un ited States. These schools were heavily financed by the very governmen t that the college students were protesting against. Yet the funding from the federal government continu ed. In other words, the employee (the schools) were producing a product (the anti-war protes- tors) that was pleasing to the employer (the federa l government.) And as long as the schools kept producing a product pleasing to the employer, the checks continued. Is it possible that the government, acting as the \" pressure from above,\" intentionally funded schools because it wanted thes e schools to produce anti- government dissidents, the \"pressure from below?\" Is it possible that the government's purpose was to prolong the war? Is it possible that this was the method by which the A merican people were conditioned to support the \"no-win\" strategy of Ame rica's involvement in the war? The American people, until at least the Korean War, believed that our government should first avoid wars, but once in one , they believed the government should win and then leave. But the gover nment's strategy during the Vietnamese War was never to win but to f ind ways to prolong the war, and the anti-war protestors were created for t hat purpose. The strategy was simple. The public was told by the major media that covered every meeting of three or more anti-war pro testors, that to oppose the war was un-American. The protestors were to do ever ything to discredit the American flag, the nation, and the military. To do this they burned the flag, used obscenities, and carried the flag of the enemy , the Viet Cong. All of these activities were calculated to tell the American peo ple that there were only two choices in the war: 1. Support your government in whatever action they mig ht take in the war; or 2. Join the protestors in objecting to the war by burn ing the flag, using obscenities, and carrying the flag of t he enemy. Another slogan made popular during the war was: \"Yo ur country: love it or leave it.\" There were only two options being offered: either s upport your government in its \"no-win\" strategy, or leave the c ountry. The traditional goal of America's strategy in a war, victory, was n ot being offered as an alternative. The most glaring, although not commonly understood, example of the \"no-win\" war strategy, was the use of the \"peace\" s ign, made by extending the first two fingers into a \"V.\" This gesture was first made popular during World War II by Winston Churchill who meant the sym bol to mean \"victory.\" (No one ever explained what the letter \" V\" had to do with the word 39"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 FORMS OF GOVERNMENT \"peace,\" but it didn't matter, as it was intended t o cause the American people to think of \"peace\" and not \"victory\" in the Vietna mese war.) The strategy worked. The American people allowed th e various administrations involved to wage the war without th e goal of a victory, and the war continued for about ten years. It is a well known fact that the quickest and sures t path to victory in any war is to deny the enemy the materials he needs to wage the war. In 1970, the world's largest petition drive focused on the fact that America was supplying Russia with strategic military items while Russia w as supplying eighty percent of North Vietnam's war materials. This peti tion drive was supported by the signatures of around four million Americans, yet it hardly received any press coverage. As the petitions were assembled , they were sent to U.S. congressmen and senators, but nothing was done, and the aid and trade to Russia continued. There was no question in the mind s of those who circulated the petitions that the war would have be en over in a very short time if this aid and trade stopped. The strategy worked. The American people, no longer offered a victory as an alternative, and turned off by the protestors who urged them to end the war, supported their government's \"no-win\" strategy , and the war kept grinding on, killing and injuring scores of America n fighting men and women, as well as countless Vietnamese on both side s of the war. Others have become aware of Kozak's strategy and ha ve used it in a beneficial manner. One such individual explained th e method in 1965: 1. Non-violent demonstrators go into the streets; 2. Racists unleash violence against them; 3. Americans demand federal legislation; 4. The administration initiates measures of immediate intervention and remedial legislation. The author of those words was Martin Luther King, J r., who wrote them in an article in Saturday Review. 8 It appears that Mr. King somehow had heard of Jan Kozak's book, as the methods are n early identical. Those who have studied Mr. King's background before he be came America's Civil Rights leader are certain that Mr. King was in a po sition to have read and studied Kozak's book itself. The Augusta, Georgia, Courier of July 8, 1963, printed a picture of Mr. King at the Highlander Fol k School in Monteagle, Tennessee during the Labor Day weekend of 1957. Thi s school had an interesting history. After King visited there, the school was closed by the Tennessee Legislature in 1960 after having conducte d hearings into its true nature. The school was cited as being a \"meeting pl ace for known Commu- nists and fellow travelers,\" and as a \"Communist Tr aining School.\" 9 Mr. King's association with the Communists and the Communist Party was not restricted to just those he met during the weekend at the Folk School, 40"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 FORMS OF GOVERNMENT as Communists virtually surrounded him as he planne d his civil rights activities. The Reverend Uriah J. Fields, the Negro clergyman who was King's secretary during the early stages of the bus boycott that made King famous, wrote this about those associated with him: \"King helps to advance communism. He is surrounded with Communists. This i s the major reason I severed my relationship with him during the fifti es. He is soft on communism.\" 10 Another who supported the assertion that the Commun ists were involved in the activities of Mr. King was Karl Pru ssion, a former counterspy for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mr. Prussi on testified in 1963 after attending Communist Party meetings in California fo r five years: \"I further swear and attest that at each and every one of the aforementioned meetings, one Reverend Martin Luther King was always set fort h as the individual to whom Communists should look and rally around in the Communist struggle on the many racial issues.\" 11 So Mr. King certainly had the opportunity to read t he book by Jan Kozak, and he was surrounded by those who certainly should have been familiar with the method of this Communist strategi st. And King even put the strategy on paper for all to see. The purpose of the Civil Rights movement was best s ummarized by a comment made by two of the past presidents of the A merican Bar Associa- tion, Loyd Wright and John C. Satterfield. They onc e wrote the following about the Civil Rights Bill, one of the major \"acco mplishments\" of the Civil Rights movement: \"It is ten percent civil rights an d ninety percent extension of Federal executive power. The 'civil rights' aspe ct of this legislation is but a cloak; uncontrolled Federal Executive power is th e body.\" 12 So King's major purpose was to increase the role of the government in the everyday lives of the American people. 41"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 Economic Terms It will be helpful at this point for certain econom ic terms to be defined to assist the reader in understanding the Conspirat orial View of History. Two of these terms are: Consumption Good: goods acquired for consumption pu rposes (food, drink, etc.) Capital Good: goods utilized for producing consumpt ion goods The distinction between these two economic terms ca n be illustrated by the use of a simple example, such as a primitive tr ibesman living in a remote jungle. His diet consists of the rabbit (a Consumpt ion Good) which first must be caught before it can be consumed. The tribe sman quickly learns that the rabbit is exceptionally quick and that catching it for a daily meal is rather difficult. But, by using his intelligence, the trib esman fashions a crude blow- gun to assist him in acquiring the Consumption Good . The moment that the tribesman builds the blow-gun, he becomes a Cap italist, because the blow-gun is a Capital Good: it is created to assist the tribesman in acquiring Consumption Goods. Therefore, it is possible now to define Capitalism as: 42"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 ECONOMIC TERMS Capitalism: any economic system that utlizes Capita l Goods in acquiring or producing Consumption Goods Notice that by this definition even the most primit ive economic systems are Capitalist if they choose to utilize Capital Go ods in meeting their Consumption Good needs. It follows logically, men, that the blow-gun is onl y effective when the tribesman agrees to use it, and that without his ef forts the blow-gun is a meaningless wooden tube. The tribesman gives utilit y to the blow-gun only by using it. It follows then, that the acquisition of Consumptio n Goods is not dependent on Capital Goods alone, but by someone us ing the Capital Goods. Human effort is the key ingredient in any Ca pitalistic economy. Without human effort, there will be no Consumption Goods produced. Should the tribesman not wish to secure the needed Consumption Goods by use of the Capital Goods, he and all those dependent on his efforts will go hungry. Increasing the number of Capital Go ods, or blow-guns, will in no way alleviate the problem. The only way to pr oduce Consumption Goods is for the individual to decide to utilize th e Capital Goods for that purpose, and that without that human decision, ther e will be nothing produced. The ultimate Capitalistic society is one, then, whe re all things become Capital Goods, including the individual efforts of all of the individual workers who comprise the society. The individual hi mself becomes the ultimate Capital Good, for without his efforts, the re will be no Consumption Goods produced. It follows logically for some, unfortunately, that the society has the right to make certain that efforts are made towards the p roduction of Consump- tion Goods, even if the individual members of the s ociety do not wish to produce any. The Soviet Union, for instance, was cited in 1974 f or forcing the ultimate Capital Good, man himself, to produce agai nst his will. The article identifying Russia's use of forced labor stated: The Soviet Union has been officially cited under th e rules of the International Labor Organization as having fail ed to meet its commitment to observe the organization's ban on for ced labor. ... the failure concerns the convention, a b inding interna- tional obligation, outlawing \"forced or compulsory labor in all of its forms\" mat Moscow ratified in 1956. The panel o f experts noted in a report... that Soviet law permitted \"idlers\" t o be given a one year jail or \"corrective labor\" sentence if they re fused to take a job assigned to them. 1 43"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 ECONOMIC TERMS Since each society needs Consumption Goods to survi ve, it follows that the society needs the productive efforts of all mem bers of that society, or it will fail. There are only two ways by which these goods can be produced: either through the use of force against the producing indi viduals, or through the creation of an economic environment wherein the ind ividual is encouraged to produce the maximum quantity of Consumption Good s. All Capitalistic societies soon discover that all C apital Goods tend to deteriorate through time and usage and therefore lo se their udlity. The blow- gun in the primitive society breaks or bends and be comes worthless. When this occurs, the tribesman must discard the useless Capital Good and construct a replacement. But other Capital Goods, humans themselves, also lo se their utility. They grow tired, old or become injured. There are s ocieties today that also discard tired, old and injured human Capital Goods as well as old, dred or broken Capital Goods such as a broken blow-gun. One such society is the nation of Russia. A Russian native, Igor Gouzenko i n his book The Iron Curtain, confirmed this, by writing: \"Lishnetzy is the Russian word for the aged and ailing who have become the superfluous one s. ... as an ardent young Communist I never regarded the Lishnetzy as s omething monstrous. It seemed practical and just to me then. As Komsono ls (young Commu- nists) ... we had actually reached the conclusion t hat when one became a lishnetz (an old Capital Good), that is one condemn ed to this form of civic extermination, one should be duty bound to free the country of a useless consumer by having the courage to commit suicide. T hat opinion was nationally encouraged to such an extent that, even today, the suicide rate in Russia is higher than in any other country in the w orld.\" 2 If Capitalism, then, is an economic system that uti lizes Capital Goods to produce Consumption Goods, what is the difference b etween the Commu- nist system and the Capitalistic system in the Unit ed States? Both systems utilize the same type of Capital Goods: the factori es, the railroads, and the other factors of producdon. The difference is not in the existence of these Cap ital Goods, it is the ownership of the goods. In the Communist system, th e state owns the Capital Goods, and in the Free Enterprise system, a better name for America's economic system, the individuals own the Capital Go ods. In brief, the difference between the two systems ca n be summarized thus: Capital Goods Economic System Owned By: Controlled By: Free Enterprise private owners private owners Communism the state the state 44"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 ECONOMIC TERMS Control of the factors of production is equally as important as owner- ship: ownership of an automobile is meaningless if someone else drives (controls) it. But there is an economic system not included in the above definitions: the system where the individual private owner owns the factors of produc- tion, but the state controls them. This system is c alled Fascism. It can be added to the above summary as follows: Capital Goods Economic System Owned By: Controlled By: Free Enterprise private owners private owners Fascism private owners the state Socialism the state the state Perhaps the most well-known advocate of the Fascist economic system was the titular head of the Italian government just prior to and during World War II, Benito Mussolini. It has been said that Pre mier Mussolini, a dedicated Socialist, did not wish to oppose the Rom an Catholic Church and the Pope, both housed inside the territory of Italy , and feared that the Church would officially oppose any economic system not fav ored by the hierarchy of the Church. It was well known that the Church had l ong opposed any form of Socialism (the ownership and control of property by the state) so Musso- lini, aware that control is equally as important as ownership, asked the Catholic population of Italy to support the comprom ise that he offered: Fascism, the economic system where the Catholic pop ulation could legally own their property, in accordance with the wishes o f the Pope and the Church, but where the state would control it. The n et effect, as Mussolini knew, was still the same as offered by the Socialis ts: the state would own the factors of production through control of the factor s of production. \"... Fas- cism recognizes the legal right to private ownershi p. ... Such ownership still means little in practice, for the state can and doe s tell the owner what to produce, what prices to charge, and what to do with the profits.\" 3 Those who advocate that the Capital Goods should be owned or controlled by the state frequently justify their po sition by declaring that they are doing so in the name of the poor, the workers, the aged, or any other minority deemed to be voiceless in the society and hence unable to be in a position to own any Capital Goods. However, those w ho lose sight of man's God-given right to own property also fail to see th e connection between the right to private property and the right to one's ow n life. It is the Socialists/ Communists who support the state's right to own all Capital Goods. In addition, they also support the right of the state to divide the property between those who have varying amounts of goods. On ce this process starts, 45"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 ECONOMIC TERMS the state must decide who is to receive the society 's surplus. It then logically follows that the state has the right to terminate t he lives of those that the state feels are not worthy of receiving their share of th e surplus. One who took great care in pointing this position o ut in detail was George Bernard Shaw, a leading Socialist of his day . Mr. Shaw wrote a book entitled The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism in which he detailed his concern about this problem: I also made it quite clear that Socialism means equ ality of income or nothing, and under Socialism you would no t be allowed to be poor. You would be forcibly fed, clothed, lodged, taught, and employed whether you like it or not. If it were dis covered that you had not the character and industry enough to be wor th all this trouble, you might be executed in a kindly manner, but whilst you were permitted to live, you would have to live well . 4 The Socialist government would permit all to live ( their right to life becomes a privilege) only so long as the government felt each was worth \"all the trouble.\" But should the government feel that t he individual's value had decreased, the government would terminate that indi vidual's life in an unspecified \"kindly manner.\" Mr. Shaw also connected the economic philosophy of Socialism with the truth that human labor is essential to the prod uction of all Capital Goods, and that those who do not produce have no ri ght to life, when he wrote: \"Compulsory labour with death as the final v ictory is the keystone of Socialism.\" 5 In the Socialist scheme of things, the individual i s not to be free, and it is not intended that he be free. Karl Kautsky, to t his day one of the leading theoreticians of the Socialist position, wrote: \"So cialist production is not compatible with liberty of work, that is to say, wi th the worker's freedom to work when or how he likes. In a socialist society, all the means of production will be concentrated in the hands of the state, and the latter will be the only employer; there will be no choice.\" 6 Proof that Kautsky's argument can become official g overnment policy lies in what happened in the Socialist country of G ermany, just prior to the beginning of World War II: \"No German worker could change his job without obtaining permission, while if he absented himself from work without proper excuse, he was liable to imprisonmen t.\" 7 Obviously, this type of government is not popular w ith the working class, the supposed benefactor of the economic phil osophy of Socialism, so the strategy became one of deceiving the worker so that the Socialism that the worker is induced to support in theory is different from the Socialism that the 46"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 ECONOMIC TERMS worker would experience once the Socialists came to power. The problem exists in how to conceal this truth from the worker . Norman Thomas, the Socialist Party presidential candidate for about tw enty years, and the leading Socialist in the United States prior to his death, said: \"The American people will never knowingly adopt Socialism, but under the name of Liberalism they will adopt every fragment of the Socialist pro gram until one day America will be a Socialist nation without knowing how it happened.\" 8 Mr. Thomas was never successful in his quest for th e Presidency as an identified Socialist, but he was extremely pleased with Socialist progress nevertheless. The American people were buying his S ocialist ideas by electing others not publicly identified as Socialis ts, but who supported the economic and political ideas of the Socialist Party . Thomas wrote: \"... Here in America more measures once praised or denounced as socialist have been adopted than once I should have thought possible sh ort of a socialist victory at the polls.\" 9 \"The United States is making greater strides towar ds Socialism under Eisenhower than even under Roosevelt.\" 10 Most people would agree that President Roosevelt gave the American governme nt more control over and ownership of the factors of production than any other president, but few would feel that President Eisenhower did more than Roosevelt. Yet the Socialist candidate for President praised the \"non- Socialist, pro free- enterprise\" Dwight Eisenhower for his support of So cialist programs. This means that Socialism has been concealed from the Am erican people. That the American people are being lied to by those who could be called \"closet Socialists.\" Someone once described the deception a s: \"One way they look, another way they steer.\" The strategy is to promise the American people one thing and to deliver another. Never make it appear that you, the candidate, are supporting socialism or are a Socialist, even t hough the platforms you will support after your election are indeed sociali st in nature. And you must never deliver so much socialism that the American p eople will discover the exact nature of the game and remove you from office . Arthur Schlesinger Jr., a noted historian, outlined the program of giving the American people their socialism in gradu al doses: \"If socialism is to preserve democracy, it must be brought about ste p by step in a way which will not disrupt the fabric of custom, law and mutu al confidence.... There seems no inherent obstacle in the gradual advance o f socialism in the United States through a series of new deals ....\" 11 The reason the socialists must deceive the unsuspec ting citizen was made clear by the London, England, Sunday Times whi ch stated that Socialism was defined as: \"competition without priz es, boredom without hope, war without victory, and statistics without e nd.\" 12 In other words, most people don't want Socialism an d they don't wish to live under the Socialist economy, so the Sociali sts must resort to trickery 47"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 ECONOMIC TERMS and deception, by a series of lies offered to the p eople by lying politicians. For the sake of the purist, is there any difference between Socialism and Communism? The absence of any essential differences was explained thus: \"There is no economic difference between socialism and communism. Both terms... denote the same system. ... public control of the means of produc- tion as distinct from private control. The two term s, socialism and commu- nism, are synonyms.\" This position was confirmed by no less a Communist luminary than Marshal Tito, the now deceased dictator of the Yugo slavian Communist government, who said: \"Communism is simply state ca pitalism in which the state has absolute ownership of everything includin g all the efforts of the people.\" 13 Notice that Marshal Tito has confirmed that everyth ing, including the efforts of the people, becomes a Capital Good under Communism. Perhaps this is the sole difference between these two econo mic systems: the Commu- nists readily admit that the human itself is a Capi tal Good, and the Socialist conceals it. But in both systems, the individual an d all he produces belongs to the state. Most Communists have made this point abundantly cle ar in their writings. Karl Marx, the so-called \"father of moder n Communism,\" once wrote: \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.\" 14 This basic tenet of Communism has become a principl e of the Russian Constitution, which states: \"Article 12: In the U.S .S.R. work is a duty and a matter of honor for every able bodied citizen in ac cordance with the principle: 'He who does not work shall not eat.' Th e principle applied in the U.S.S.R. is that of Socialism: 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his work.' 15 It is interesting that the last word of Marx's dict um has been changed from \"need\" to \"work.\" Notice that if one doesn't w ork, one doesn't eat. How does this system provide for those unable to work? This question has been answered by others, one of whom has stated mat thes e individuals would be \"executed in a kindly manner.\" Others have suggeste d that they should commit suicide (become a \"lishnetzy.\") In other wor ds, to restate the principle, when a Capital Good becomes unable to pr oduce, it is discarded, even if that Capital Good is a human being. Once the Socialist/Communist decides that the state exists to divide Consumption Goods and Capital Goods, then it behoov es him to involve himself with politics. Sam Brown, President Jimmy C arter's director of ACTION, the voluntary agency, is one who has discov ered this truth. He said: \"Politics is a struggle to redistribute power and wealth.\" 16 Notice that Mr. Brown admitted that this political process of goods redistribution is a \"struggle,\" which means that so me will not want to give 48"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 ECONOMIC TERMS up their property. Since Mr. Brown didn't say, one can only wonder what Mr. Brown wished to do with those who resisted. Another \"closet communist\" who agrees with those wh o feel govern- ment exists to divide surplus goods, wrote the foll owing: \"We are going to try to take all of the money that we think is unnecessa rily being spent and take it from the 'haves' and give it to the 'have-nots' that need it so much.\" 17 Notice that this statement is nearly identical with that of the Commu- nist Karl Marx who wrote: \"From each according to h is ability, to each according to his need.\" Only the words have been ch anged. That means that the speaker, the \"closet communist,\" supported the Marxist philosophy that government exists to take from one to give to anoth er. Those who know President Lyndon Johnson, the speaker of the words above, and his \"Great Society,\" know that this was indeed his goal: to re distribute wealth from the wealthy to the poor. Few, however, will dare to com pare Johnson's govern- mental philosophy with the writings and teachings o f Marx. But the comparison is inevitable: the action and its result s are the same, no matter whether it is called the \"Great Society,\" or Marxis t Communism. Both seek to use government to divide wealth. But it is not f ashionable to favorably compare the two by noticing the similarity between the \"Great Society\" and the teachings of Karl Marx. Sometimes the support of this Marxist philosophy ab out the purpose of government comes from the \"respectable right,\" from those the observer would never suspect of being a \"closet communist.\" Take, for instance, the thoughts on this subject fr om two respectable \"right wing Conservatives.\" One has written: \"Congr ess shall appropriate funds for social welfare only for the benefit of th ose states whose per capita income is below the national average.\" 18 This writer advocated a newer brand of Marxism: \"From each state according to its ability, to each state according to its needs.\" (emphasis added.) This wri ter advocated that the national government divide the wealth, taking it fr om the wealthier states and giving it to the less productive. Pure Marxism, except the writer involved both the state and the federal governments rather t han just the federal government as Marx envisioned. This is only expandi ng Marx one step: the result is the same. Property is distributed by the government just as before. The shock is that this new thought came from the pe n of William F. Buckley, Jr., hardly a paragon of Marxism. But notice that B uckley's intent is the same as that of Marx: to use government to redistribute Consumption and Capital Goods. Another method of income redistribution by governme nt was proposed by another respected member of the \"Conservative Ri ght.\" His proposal is called the Negative Income Tax, which would use the Income Tax as a method of redistributing wealth. Under this proposa l, the poverty level 49"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 ECONOMIC TERMS individual would have but to show his non-income on the Income Tax form, and the government would take some of the taxes pai d by the more prosper- ous tax-payers, and give it to the poorer individua l in the form of an income tax \"refund.\" The utilization of the income tax as a vehicle to divide wealth apparently must satisfy the concern of those who wi sh to use government as an income distributor, but do not wish to become as sociated with the Marxist \"Left\" which openly advocates Marxist theories. In other words, if it bothers the listener to be recognized as a supporter of the preachings of an open Marxist, he might find relief by supporting the pro posals of a member of the \"Conservative Right,\" Professor Milton Friedman, th e \"Free Enterprise Economist,\" who proposed the Negative Income Tax. Sometimes a member of the clergy becomes involved i n the subject of income distribution. Here is the statement of a Pop e, in this case Pope Paul VI, who wrote the following at Easter, 1967: \"But n owadays, no country can keep its wealth just for itself alone. It should be normal, now, for the developed nations to help the under-developed with some agreed percentage of their additional income.\" 19 Here the Pope speaks in favor of a national income distribution program where one country taxes itself for the benefit of another nation in accordance with the principle: \"F rom each nation according to its ability, to each nation according to its need.\" (emphasis added.) But the American people must never fear or despair: the American government will save them from this creeping Social ism. \"Administration opens battle on socialism\" reads th e headline of an article written on January 26, 1975. The article ex plained: \"Concerned about what it fears is a national drift toward socialism, the Ford (President Gerald Ford) administration is mounting a major campaign t o restrain the growth in Social Security benefits and other income redist ribution programs.\" 20 The writer of the article informed the reader that the purpose of the Social Security program was \"... income redistribut ion.\" One must honestly admire the cleverness of the administratio n in concealing this fact from those who have believed that it was intended t o be a retirement plan for those of the working population who reached retirem ent age. The article went on to point out that the concern of the Ford a dministration was that the spending for Social Security would rise to where it would be one-half of the total Gross National Product. If this happened, the United States would be irreversibly on the road toward a controlled econom y. (Fascism.) The ultimate purpose of all income redistribution s chemes is people control. This was graphically illustrated by Leon T rotsky, one of the founders of the Communist government in Russia in 1 917, who wrote: \"In a country where the sole employer is the State, opp osition (to the State) means death by slow starvation. The old principle.. . 'who does not work 50"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 ECONOMIC TERMS shall not eat' has been replaced by a new one... 'w ho does not obey shall not eat.'\" 21 The ultimate Communism is total control over all ma nkind. All of the efforts of the people belong to the state and if th e worker does not produce, he will be slowly starved unto submission, or unto death. Here the difference between Socialism and Communism shows itself in the attitude of what to do with the unwilling worker: the Socialist wishes to execute him in a \"kindly manner,\" while the Communist wishes to slowly starv e him to death. It is hardly a difference worth debating. The socialist machine slowly climbs the ladder to t otal control of the market place. The next logical step in the climb is to have the state become the final employer of all workmen and for that stat e to issue a \"worker's card\" so that the government can say who shall have the p rivilege of working. Without the card, the worker cannot find work. Leon Trotsky didn't recommend a card, apparently, but he certainly woul d have supported the concept as being consistent with the principle: \"wh o does not obey shall not eat.\" The proposal for a work card issued to the American people was the idea of Benjamin Civiletti, former President Jimmy Carte r's Attorney General, according to an Associated Press article of June 28 , 1980. The article read \"Civiletti urges 'card for all U.S. workers.' Attor ney General Benjamin R. Civiletti yesterday said he favored requiring Ameri cans and aliens in this country to carry a 'work card' in order to apply fo r a job.\" 22 If the American citizen doesn't obtain a card, the American citizen doesn't work. And if the American citizen doesn't w ork, the American citizen starves. Others have continued the thought that the national government should issue a worker identification card. The Ariz ona Daily Star of March 25, 1981 carried an article with the following head line: \"(Senator Dennis) DeConcini (Democrat from Arizona) 'not averse' to n ational worker ID to curb alien influx.\" 23 The article went on to detail that various senators were supporting legislation that would require an identification ca rd for all Americans that would do away with the \"tremendous benefits there a re in coming over here illegally.\" The bill would require the possessor of the card to show it when applying for a job. The illegal alien would presuma bly not have the card, and therefore would not be able to get a job, accor ding to the reasoning of those who support the legislation. How they would h andle the problem of those Americans who did not feel it was Constitutio nal for the American government to issue such a card was not answered by the article. What would happen to those dissenters is apparently not worthy of an explanation. 51"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 ECONOMIC TERMS An article that appeared on March 21, 1982, should be of interest to those supporters of President Ronald Reagan who are certa in that their \"conserva- tive\" President would never allow such an unconstit utional abomination as the national ID card. The article was entitled: \"Re agan 'open' to national ID card,\" and included this comment: \"It was the first time the Reagan administration had indicated it is not opposed to p lans for creating a nationwide identity card to deal with illegal immig ration.\" 24 So now the American people can begin to understand why the United States government is not doing more to prohibit the immigration of millions of illegal aliens. The problem of illegal immigrati on serves to justify the \"solution\" which is a national ID card. The America n people must have an identification card and the borders must come down so that there will be a reason for the issuance of the card. The Vietnamese Communists apparently do not have an illegal immigration problem so they avoided all of the form ality of the issuance of cards to their workers. They just resorted to the u se of the radio to broadcast the following work order: \"All citizens who have th e strength and the ability to work must absolutely carry out the state mobiliz ation orders, and serve in any capacity or any mission assigned to them by the state. Those who do not want to work or do not carry out the state's orders will be forced to carry out work in order to be useful to our society.\" 25 One of the North Vietnamese generals during the war made it clear that the Communists have nothing but disdain for human l ife. He is quoted as saying: \"Every minute hundreds of thousands of peop le are dying all over the world. The life or death of a hundred or a thousand or tens of thousands of human beings even if they are our own compatriots r eally represents very little.\" 26 Fortunately for those who love their freedoms eloqu ent spokesmen occasionally arise to oppose the intrusion of gover nment into every aspect of human life, and their words are terse and to the po int. One such spokesman was Thomas Jefferson, who wrote the following: \"Tha t government is best that governs least.\" And for every such advocate there arises an equally eloquent spokesman for more and more government intrusion. Take for in stance, the following statement of a former U.S. Senator, Joseph Clark: The size, range and complexity of government increa ses, and will likely continue to do so.... I would defend th e proposition that this expansion is good not bad. Surely we have reached the point where we can say, for our time at least, that Jefferson was wrong: that gover nment is not best which governs least.... 52"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 ECONOMIC TERMS The fallacy in Jefferson's argument is the assumpti on that the expansion of government leads to curtailment of ind ividual freedoms. That just is not true. 27 This position was further expanded by the Ford Foun dation, which in 1969 published a \"think piece\" entitled Planning an d Participation, in which it declared: \"The world is too complex for an abatement of govern- ment powers. If anything, the role of government mu st be strengthened....\" 28 And so we have those who wish to extend the governm ent's control into all aspects of human activity and those who wish to reduce it.

These rather humorless phrases about inflation do n ot answer the only question worth asking about the subject: What cause s it? Everyone agrees that inflation is a drop in the val ue of money (any given amount of money buys less). But that understanding doesn't answer the question of what causes it. The traditional definition of Inflation is as follo ws: \"... a rise in the general level of prices.\" Its causes are three in n umber: 1. When consumers, businesses and governments spend too heavily on ava ilable goods and services, mis high demand can force prices up. 2. I f costs of production rise and producers try to maintain profit levels, prices must increase. 3. The lack of competition between producers can also contribut e to inflation. 1 It appears by this definition that everything cause s inflation! But 54"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 INFLATION whatever it is that causes it, there is little one can do to prevent it. One who felt this way was Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur B urns who said the following in 1974: \"Inflation cannot be halted this year.\" 2 One of the reasons no one can supposedly prevent in flation is because Inflation is part of the Inflation-Deflation cycle. At least this is the opinion of one economist: \"Nikolai Dimitriyevich Kondratyev , Soviet economist- ... believes that capitalistic economies naturally follow long term cycles: first a few decades of prosperity, then a few decad es of slump.\" 3 (An interesting contemporary example that brought Kondr atyev's cyclical theory into question occurred recently in Chile, the South American country that voted Marxist Salvador Allende into office in 1970. Under Allende's Communist government inflation reached 652 percent a year, and the Wholesale Price Index rose by a staggering 1,147 pe rcent a year. That meant that wholesale prices were doubling every month. 4 After a coup ousted Allende in 1973, and the Pinochet administration ch anged the government's direction, inflation dropped to less than 12 percen t a year and the Wholesale Price Index actually fell. It is doubtful that Chil e's successful reduction in the inflation rate can be attributed to a long-term cyc le!) Another economist believes that America's lifestyle is the major cause of inflation. Alfred E. Kahn \"... the nation's new chi ef inflation fighter has named his foe: every American's desire for economic improvement.... The desire of each group with power or instruments to i mprove its economic situation... is after all what the problem of infla tion is.\" 5 The solution, men, is a \"Smaller piece of the pie.\" \"The living s tandard of Americans must decline if inflation is to be controlled, says... P eter Emerson... a key aide to Alfred Kahn.\" 6 No matter what the cause of inflation, one thing fo r certain is that it is never caused by government, at least according to P resident Jimmy Carter, who said: \"It is a myth that government itself can stop inflation.\" 7 Congress has a typical solution to the problem: imp ose wage and price controls on rising wages and prices. And it seems t hat these measures never work. Is it possible that the reason Congress can't control inflation is that Congress is not aware of its real cause? Is it poss ible that they are attacking the effect of inflation, and not the cause? The att empt to end inflation by the imposition of wage and price controls is not an new idea. (In fact, neither is inflation!) Free market Economist Murray N. Rothbar d has gone on record as saying: \"From the Roman Emperor Diocletian down to the American and French Revolutions and to Richard Nixon from 1971 t o 1974, governments have tried to stop inflation by imposing wage and p rice controls. None of these schemes have worked.\" 8 The reason wage and price controls do not work, and have never worked, lies in the simple fact that they attack th e effect of inflation and not 55"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 INFLATION the cause. The proof that this statement is true ca n be found in a simple definition found in a dictionary. Webster's 3rd Una bridged Dictionary defines inflation thus: \"An increase in the volume of money and credit relative to available goods resulting in a substant ial and continuing rise in the general price level.\" Inflation is caused by an increase in money (credit is a result of increases in the supply of money and for the sake of this dis cussion, money shall be the sole cause of inflation.) The result of inflation is a price rise. Another dictionary, this time the Webster's Collegi ate, defines inflation thus: \"Relatively sharp and sudden increase in the quantity of money, or credit, or both, relative to the amount of exchange business. Inflation always causes a rise in the price level.\" The cause of inf lation, an increase in the money supply, always produces a price rise. Inflati ng the money supply always increases prices. This is an economic law: t he effect of a money supply increase will always be the same. In summary, then, inflation has both a cause and an effect: Cause: an increase in money Effect: a rise in prices Now it is possible to see why wage and price contro ls do not work: they attack the effect (the price rise) and not the cause (the increase in the money supply.) An example of how Inflation is caused could be offe red by the use of a simple model. Suppose mat sea shells are used as money on Island A, and that the prices on the island are determined by the number o f shells in circula- tion. As long as the quantity of shells remains rel atively constant and there is no rapid increase, prices will remain rela tively stable. Suppose that some of the more adventurous islanders row ove r to a nearby island and collect a large quantity of sea shells, identic ally the same as those in circulation as money on the main island. When these additional sea shells are brought back to Island A and put into ci rculation as money, they will cause an increase in the price level. Mor e sea shells (money) will enable each islander to bid up the price of an y given good. If the islander has more money, he can afford to pay a hig her price for the product he wishes to purchase. There are certain elements in society that wish to increase the money supply for their own benefit at the expense o f the other members. These people are called \"counterfeiters,\" and are p unished for their crime when discovered. They are punished because th eir counterfeiting of extra supplies of money decreases the value of t he legitimate money 56"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 INFLATION held by the members of that society. They have the illegal and immoral power to cause inflation by increasing the money su pply, causing the value of the other money to drop. This activity, th e counterfeiung, is actually a crime against property, the money of the society, and the ciuzens have the legal and moral right to seek an e nd to this destruction of their private property, their money. How is it possible for inflations to persist if tho se who have the ability to counterfeit are punished by the public f or their crime? The solution for the counterfeiters lies in making it l egal to counterfeit money. Those who counterfeit can really reap the be nefits for their crime if they can get control of the government and make their crime legal. The government has the ability to make even counterfeit money \"legal tender\" (requiring all citizens of the natio n to accept the counterfeit money along with the legal money.) If g overnment could make counterfeiting legal, there would be no crime for counterfeiting, and this became the goal of the criminals. Those who sought to make government all powerful in the lives of their citizens soon learned that inflation could al so increase the impact and scope of government as well. The marriage betwe en the socialists and the counterfeiters was inevitable. Nobel Peace Prize winner and economist Friederich von Hayek detailed this relati onship thus: Inflation is probably the most important single fac tor in the vicious circle wherein one kind of government action makes more and more government control necessary.\" The government-and-inflation circle could be descri bed also in terms of the \"Pincers Movement\" described by Kozak. The bottom of the pincer is the price rise, the result of the Inflati on (the legal counterfeiung of the new money,) caused by the top of the pincer, the government. The people, sensitive to the rise in the prices, start demanding that the government take some remedial action to put a stop to the inflation, and government, informing the public that more governme nt action is the solution to the inflation problem, passes the legis lation. The distance between the two pincer arms shortens, until the res ult is total govern- ment. And all of this acdvity is in the name of sto pping inflation. One famous economist, John Maynard Keynes, detailed the procedure in his book, The Economic Consequences of the Peace: Lenin, (the Russian Communist) is said to have decl ared that the best way to destroy the Capitalist system was t o debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments c an confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important p art of the wealth of their ciuzens. By this method they not only conf iscate, but they 57"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 INFLATION confiscate arbitrarily, and while the process impov erishes many, it actually enriches some. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of econom ic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner no t one man in a million is able to diagnose. There are several important thoughts contained in t ins quote from Mr. Keynes' book. Notice that the purpose of inflation, at least according to the Communist Lenin, was to destroy Capitalism. Lenin r ealized that inflation had the power to destroy the free market. Lenin als o realized that the only agency that could cause inflation legally was the g overnment. Inflation was also to serve as an income redistribu tion system. It could impoverish those who held their assets in money, an d enrich others who held their wealth in items that increased in value durin g periods of inflation. Inflation, to be successful, must be concealed from those who stand to lose the most: the money holders. Concealment becom es the goal of those who do the counterfeiting. Never must the true caus e of inflation be properly identified. Inflation must be blamed on everything: the market place, the housewife, the greedy merchant, the wage earner, th e unions, oil shortages, the balance of payments, the common housefly! Anyth ing but inflation's true cause: the increase in the money supply. Keynes (and Lenin) admitted that the results of inf lation would constantly operate in a predictable manner. Inflati on was an economic law. And \"not one in a million\" would be able to diagnos e the correct cause. In 1978, the United States Chamber of Commerce at i ts annual meeting, honored Dr. Arthur Burns, the past Chairman of the Federal Reserve System, for \"his contributions to the nation and the enterp rise system, during his government service.\" The interesting thing about th is event was that Dr. Burns, as the head of the Federal Reserve, controll ed the growth of the money supply. He had the power to increase the money in c irculation. Therefore, he was the one who was creating inflation! Yet the major American business organization commen ded Dr. Burns for his efforts in preserving the free enterprise s ystem. The very man who was causing the increase in the money supply and theref ore causing the inflation that was destroying the free enterprise system was being honored by those in the free enterprise system! Keynes and Lenin were certainly right: not one in a million would be able to diagnose the true cause of Inflation! Inclu ding the American businessman! On page 94 of the Chamber of Commerce's magazine, N ation's Busi- ness, an editorial informed the reader that Dr. Bur ns \"... has authored a 58"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 INFLATION broad, well-reasoned plan to turn back the inflatio nary threat....\" But a review of the editorial and Dr. Burns' proposals in dicates that nowhere did Dr. Burns mention the money supply, nor stopping th e rapid increase of it! The past Chairman of the Federal Reserve writes, in stead, that the causes of inflation are other than an increase in the money s upply. No wonder that Dr. Burns is smiling as he accepts the award from the C hamber of Commerce. He has fooled the American business community. Keynes also went on to explain why he agreed with L enin mat inflation is intended to destroy the business community, when he wrote: \"The decadent international but individualistic capitali sm, in the hands of which we found ourselves after the War (World War I) is n ot a success. It is not intelligent; it is not beautiful; it is not just; i t is not virtuous — and it does not deliver the goods. In short, we dislike it and are beginning to despise it.\" 9 If you \"despise capitalism,\" and wish to replace th e system with another that you prefer, it becomes imperative to find a wa y to destroy it. One of the most effective methods of destruction is inflation, the \"debauching of the currency.\" \"Lenin was certainly right.\" Who is the victim of inflation? James P. Warburg co rrectly answered that question, when he wrote the following in his b ook The West in Crises: \"In recent times perhaps the greatest enemy of a mi ddle class society... has been inflation.\" 10 Why would the middle class be the target of inflati on? John Kenneth Galbraith informed the reader that inflation is a m ethod of income redistri- bution: \"Inflation takes from the old, the unorgani zed, and the poor and gives it to those who are strongly in control of th eir own incomes. ... Income is reallocated from the old to the people of middle years and from the poor to the rich.\" 11 So inflation has a purpose. It is not an accident! It is the tool of those who have two objectives: 1. to destroy the free enterprise system, and 2. to to take wealth from the poor and the middle clas s and \"re- distribute\" it to the rich. So inflation can now be understood. The reader is n ow \"one in a million\" able to diagnose its true cause! 59"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Chapter 6 Money and Gold The Bible teaches that the love of money is the roo t of all evil. Money by itself is not the root. It is the love of money, de fined as greed, that motivates certain members of society to acquire large quantit ies of money. It becomes important, then, for the members of the middle class to understand what money is and how it works. Money is defined as: \"anything that people will accept in exchange for goods or se rvices in a belief that they may in turn exchange it for other goods and service s.\" Money becomes a Capital Good. It is used to acquire Consumption Goods (and other Capital Goods as well.) Money also becomes a method of work avoidance. Money can work for its possessor: \" When money was put to work, it worked twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, three hundred and sixty five days a year, and stopped for no holi days.\" 1 So the desire to acquire money to reduce a need to work became the motive of many individuals in the society. The first man was self-sufficient. He produced what he wanted and stored what he needed for those times when he was u nable to produce. He had no need for money until other humans appeared a nd joined him in the acquisition of Consumption Goods. As populations gr ew, specialization 60"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 MONEY AND GOLD grew, and certain individuals produced Capital Good s instead of Consump- tion Goods. Man soon discovered that he needed some thing as a store of value to enable him to purchase Capital Goods when he was not producing Consumption Goods. Durable commodities, those that didn't spoil with t he passage of time, slowly became that store of value, and in time the most durable, a metal, became the money of society. The ultimate metal, go ld, became the final store of value for a variety of reasons: 1. Gold was universally accepted; 2. it was malleab le, and had the capacity to be minted into small quantities; 3. it was in short supply and difficult to locate: the quantity of gold couldn't be increased rapidly, thereby reducing its ability to be inflated;, 4. because of its scarcity, it soon acquired a high value per unit; 5. it was easily portable; 6 . gold also had other uses. It could be used in jewelry, in art, and in industry; 7. lastly, gold was extremely beautiful. But as the producer of gold saw the need to set thi s money aside for future use, problems arose as to how and where it s hould be stored. Since gold had a high value in what it could purchase in both Capital Goods and Consumption Goods, it became a temptation to those who were willing to take it from the owner by force. This led the owner of gold to take means to safeguard his holdings. Certain individuals, alread y experienced in the storage of non-durable goods, wheat for instance, s oon became the storage facility for gold as well. These warehouses would take the gold and issue the gold owner a warehouse receipt, certifying that the owner had a given quantity of gold in storage at the warehouse. These gold receipts could be transferred from one person to another, usually by writing on the back o f the receipt that the owner was transferring his claim on the gold in the warehouse to another person. These receipts soon became money themselves as men accepted the receipts rather than the gold they represented. Since gold is scarce and the quantity is limited, i t was impossible to make counterfeit money. It was only when the wareho useman realized that he could issue more gold receipts than there was go ld in the warehouse that he could become a counterfeiter. He had the ability to inflate the money supply, and the warehouseman frequently did this. B ut this activity only acted temporarily because as the quantity of gold r eceipts in circulation increased, because of the economic law known as inf lation, the prices would nse. The receipt holders would start to lose confid ence in their receipts and return to the warehouseman to claim their gold.

The people's check on the warehouseman, i.e. their ability to keep the warehouseman honest by constantly being able to red eem their gold receipts, acted as a restraint to the inflation of the gold s upply. This limited the greed of the counterfeiters and forced them into looking for alternative methods of increasing their wealth. The next step was for the counterfeiter to ask the government to make the gold receipts \"Legal Tender\" and also prohibit the receipt holder from redeeming the receipt into gold . This made the paper receipt the only money able to be circulated. Gold could no longer be used as money. But this posed an additional problem for the counte rfeiter. He now had to include the government in his scheme to increase his personal wealth. The greedy leader of the government, when approached by the counterfeiter with this scheme, often decided to eliminate the warehou seman altogether (\"off with his head\") and operate the scheme himself. Thi s was the final problem for the counterfeiter. He had to replace the leader with someone he felt he could trust and who would not use government to rem ove the counterfeiter from the plot. This process was costly and extremel y risky, but the enormity of the long-term wealth that could be accumulated b y this method was worth all the extra hazards. A classic example of this entire scheme occurred be tween the years of 1716 and 1721 in France. These events were set in m otion with the death of King Louis XIV in 1715. France was bankrupt with a large national debt of over 3 billion livres. A seedy character by the nam e of John Law, a convicted murderer who had escaped from Scotland to the conti nent, saw the plight of the French government and arranged with the newly c rowned King to save his country. His plan was simple. He wanted control of a central bank with an exclusive monopoly to print money. (France at th e time was under the control of the private bankers who controlled the m oney supply. However, France was on the gold standard, and the private ba nkers were unable to inflate the money supply through the issuance of mo re gold receipts than there was gold.) John Law was granted his wish by t he desperate king. He was granted the exclusive monopoly and the king dec reed that it was illegal to own gold. John Law then could proceed with the i nflation of the money supply and the people couldn't redeem their decreas ingly worthless paper money for gold. There was a short term prosperity, and John Law was hailed as an economic hero. The French debt was being paid off, necessarily with paper money of decreasing value, but that was the c ost of the short term prosperity. And the French people probably didn't u nderstand that it was John Law who was causing the loss in the value of t heir money. 62"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 MONEY AND GOLD However, the king and John Law got greedy and the n umber of receipts increased too rapidly. The economy nearly collapsed with the increasing prices, and the desperate people demanded an econom ic reform. John Law fled for his life, and France stopped the printing of worthless paper money. This printing of paper money, unbacked by gold, is not the only method utilized by the counterfeiters. Another meth od is more visible than the paper mediod and is therefore less popular with the counterfeiters. It is called Coin Clipping. Gold is monetized by the bank 's minting of the gold into coins. This process involves the melting of th e gold into small, uniform quantities of the metal. As long as the coins made are pure gold and all gold in circulation is minted into coins the only method of inflating the gold coinage is to either locate additional supplies of gold (that is, as discussed earlier, difficult, especially as the amount of gol d available to the miner is decreasing) or by calling in all of the gold coins, melting them down, and men increasing their number by adding a less precio us metal into each coin. This enables the counterfeiter to increase the numb er of coins by adding a less expensive metal to each coin. Each newly minte d coin is then put back into circulation with the same markings as the prev ious coins. The public is expected to use the coin exactly as before, except that there are now more coins in circulation than before, and as surely as economic law, the increase in the money supply causes inflation, and prices ri se. The early Roman Empire practiced this coin clipping in what has become a classic example of the coin clipping metho d. Early Roman coins contained 66 grains of pure silver, but, due to the practice of coin clipping, in less than sixty years their coins contained only a trace of silver. Coins clipped of their value by the addition of less prec ious metals soon drove out the silver coins that remained, in keeping with ano ther economic law, called Gresham's Law, which states: \"Bad money drives out good.\" As an illustration of this law, the clipped coins m inted during the middle 1960's and placed in circulation by Presiden t Lyndon Johnson's administration have forced the silver coins out of circulation. America's founding fathers were concerned with the practice of coin clipping and tried to keep this power out of the ha nds of the counterfeiters. Unfortunately, they did not completely restrict the government's ability to clip the coins when they wrote the following Congre ssional power into the Constitution: Article 1, Section 8: Congress shall have the power ... to coin money, regulate the value thereof, and fix the stan dards of weights and measures. There are several interesting thoughts contained in that simple sentence. 63"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 MONEY AND GOLD First, the only power Congress has in creating mone y is in the coining of it. Congress has no power to print money, only t o coin it. In addition, Congress was to set the value of money, and the pow er to coin money was placed together in the same sentence as the power t o set the standard of weights and measures. It was their intent to set th e value of money just as they set the length of a 12 inch foot, or the capacity o f an ounce or a quart. The purpose of this power was to set constant values so that all citizens could rely on the fact that a foot in California was the same as a foot in New York. A third way to inflate the gold standard consists i n calling in all of the gold or silver coins and replacing them with coins made of a more plentiful metal, such as copper or aluminum. The most recent example of this activity, called \"coin substitution,\" occurred during the adm inistration of Lyndon Johnson when the government replaced silver coins w ith ones made of strange combinations of more plentiful, and therefo re less expensive, metals. For the counterfeiter who finds such methods less t han perfect, the surest course to the acquisition of great wealth through i nflation, is for him to get the government off the gold standard altogether. Un der this method, the gold standard (the requirement that the government issue only gold coins, or paper directly issued on a one-for-one basis to gol d as money) is eliminated, and money is printed without any backing, with the official sanction of the government making it legal. By dictionary definition, such a money is called: F iat Money: paper money of government issue which is legal tender by fiat or law, does not represent nor is it based upon gold and contains no promise of redemption. One can see the transformation of America's gold st andard into the fiat standard by reading the printing on a one dollar bi ll. The early American money carried the simple promise that the govern- ment would redeem each gold certificate with gold s imply by the surrender of the certificate at the treasury. The Series of 1 928 dollar had changed this promise on the front of the bill to: \"Redeemable in gold on demand at the U.S. Treasury or in good or lawful money at any Fed eral Reserve Bank.\" There are those who question the true nature of thi s dollar if its holder can redeem it for \"lawful money\" at a Reserve Bank. Doe s it mean that what the holder was trading in was \"unlawful money?\" In any event, by 1934, the one-dollar bill read: This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private and is redeemed in lawful money at the Treasury or at a ny Federal Reserve Bank. And in 1963, this wording had again changed to: \"Th is note is legal tender for all debts, public and private.\" This bil l was no longer redeemable in \"lawful money\" so the question of whether the pr evious money was 64"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 MONEY AND GOLD \"unlawful money\" is now moot. But even more importa ntly, the bill was now a \"note.\" This meant that this dollar had been borrowed from those who have an exclusive monopoly on printing paper mo ney, and the ability to lend it to the U.S. government. The bill identif ies the source of the borrowed money: The Federal Reserve System (the top line of the bill reads \"Federal Reserve Note.\") America was on the gold standard until April, 1933, when President Franklin Roosevelt ordered all Americans to turn th eir gold bullion and gold coins into the banking system. For their gold, the American people were given irredeemable paper currency (Fiat Money) by t he banks who turned the gold over to the Federal Reserve System. President Roosevelt called in America's gold without benefit of a law passed by C ongress by using an unconstitutional Presidential Executive Order. In o ther words, he did not ask Congress to pass a law giving him the authority to call in America's privately owned gold; he took the law into his own hands and ordered the gold turned in. The President, as the Chief of the Executive Branch of the government, does not have the power to make laws, a s this power constitu- tionally belongs to the Legislative Branch. But the American people were told by the President that this was a step to end t he \"national emergency\" brought about by the Great Depression of 1929, and they voluntarily turned in the majority of the country's gold. The Presiden t included in his Executive Order the terms of the punishment if this order was not complied with. The American people were told to turn in their gold bef ore the end of April, 1933, or suffer a penalty of a fine of $10,000 or impriso nment of not more than 10 years, or both. Once the majority of the gold was turned in, Presid ent Roosevelt on October 22, 1933, announced his decision to devalue the dollar by announc- ing that government would buy gold at an increased price. This meant that the paper money that the Americans had just receive d for their gold was worth less per dollar. One dollar was now worth one thirty-fifth of an ounce of gold rather than approximately one twentieth as it had been prior to the devaluation. Roosevelt, when he announced this move, made the fo llowing state- ment in an attempt to explain his action: \"My aim i n taking this step is to establish and maintain continuous control... We are thus continuing to move towards a managed currency.\" (It is rather iro nic, and also extremely revealing, that Democratic candidate Roosevelt ran on a 1932 Democratic platform that supported the Gold Standard!) However, not all of the American gold was turned in : \"By February 19, gold withdrawals from banks increased from 5 to 15 million dollars a day. In two weeks, $114,000,000 of gold was taken from bank s for export and another $150,000,000 was withdrawn to go into hiding.\" 65"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 MONEY AND GOLD The gold was being called in at $20.67 an ounce and anyone who could hold their gold in a foreign bank only had to wait until the price was raised by the government to $35.00 an ounce and then sell it to the government at a rather substantial profit of approximately 75%. A similar profit was made by a Roosevelt supporter, Bernard Baruch, who invested heavily in silver. In a book entitled FDR, My Exploited Father- In-Law, 2 author Curtis Dall, Roosevelt's son-in-law, recall s a chance meeting with Mr. Baruch in which Baruch told Mr. Da ll that he had options on 5/16ths of the world's known silver supply. A fe w months later, to \"help the western miners,\" President Roosevelt doubled th e price of silver. A tidy profit! (It pays to support the right people!) There were some, however, who saw the sinister purp oses behind these maneuvers. Congressman Louis McFadden, Chairman of the House Banking Committee, charged that the seizure of gold was \"an operadon run for the benefit of the international bankers.\" McFa dden was powerful enough to ruin the whole deal \"and was preparing to break the whole deal when he collapsed at a banquet and died. As two ass assinadon attempts had already been made against him, many suspected poiso ning.\" 3 A giant step in the direcdon of remedying this dile mma, of returning to a gold standard, occurred in May of 1974, when legi slation was signed by the President allowing the American people to once agai n legally own gold. This legislation did not put the United States back on the gold standard, but at least it afforded those concerned about inflatio n an opportunity to own gold should they choose to do so. However, those who purchase gold have two generally unknown problems. One is the fact that the price of gold is not set by the free market, where two parties get together and arrive at a mutu ally satisfactory price. It is set: \"... twice a day on the London gold market by five of Britain's leading dealers in bullion. They meet in the offices of N.M . Rothschild & Sons, the City Bank, and agree upon the price at which all ar e prepared to trade in the metal that day.\" So the price of gold is not set by the free activity of buyer and seller but by five bullion traders. Even though the purchaser of gold still diinks that the gold he pur- chased belongs to him, the American government stil l may call it in. There is a little known provision of the Federal Reserve Act that reads: \"Whenever in the judgment of the Secretary of the Treasury su ch action is necessary to protect the currency system of the United States, t he Secretary... in his discretion, may require any or all individuals... t o pay and deliver to the Treasurer of the United States any or all gold coin s, gold bullion, and gold certificates owned by such individuals.\" So if the government wants to recall the gold of the American citizen, it has but to use this law and the force of government, and it will be called in. And the only options the gold owner has 66"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 MONEY AND GOLD to surrender his gold or face the penalties of the judicial system. But the government also has the power to call in pa per money by destroying its value through a rapid increase in th e money supply. This process is called \"hyper-inflation.\" Perhaps the classic example of this method of calli ng in the paper money occurred after World War I when Germany destr oyed the value of the German mark by printing large quantities of nearly worthless new marks. After the end of World War I, the peace treaty sign ed by the belligerents, called the Treaty of Versailles, required that the defeated German nation pay war reparations to the victors. The Treaty: \"had fi xed the amount that Germany must pay in reparations at two hundred and sixty nine billion gold marks, to be paid in forty-two annual installments. .. 4 The entire process was initially set into motion wh en the Reichsbank suspended the redeemability of its notes in gold wi th the outbreak of the war in 1914. This meant that the German government coul d pay for their involvement in the war by printing fiat money, and by 1918, the amount of money in circulation increased fourfold. The inflat ion continued through the end of 1923. By November of that year, the Reic hsbank was issuing millions of marks each day. In fact, by November 15,1923, the bank had issued t he incredible sum of 92,800,000,000,000,000,000 (quintillion) paper mark s. This astronomical inflation of the money supply had a predictable eff ect upon prices: they rose in an equally predictable manner. For instance, pri ces of three representative household commodities rose as follows: (in marks): Price in Commodity 1918 November, 1923 lb. potatoes .12 50,000,000,000 one egg .25 80,000,000,000 one pound of butter 3.00 6,000,000,000,000 The value of the German mark fell from a value of t wenty to the English pound to 20,000,000,000 to the pound by December, 1 923, nearly destroying trade between the two countries. It is apparent tha t Germany decided to print their way out of the war reparations rather than ta x their people for the costs of the war for several reasons. Obviously, taxing t he people is a very open and visible method of paying for the war debt, and cert ainly is not very popular. The result of the printing press is not visible in that the people can always be told that the price rises are the result of the sho rtages of goods caused by the war, rather than the increase in the money supply. Secondly, those candi- dates for high office in government who promise to end the inflation if and when elected are capable of doing so because the go vernment controls the 67"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 MONEY AND GOLD printing presses. So the middle class, who suffered the greatest during this inflation, looks for solutions and will frequently seek the nearest candidate who promises a solution. One such candidate was Ado lf Hitler: \"It is extremely doubtful whether Hitler could ever have c ome to power in Germany had not the inflation of the German currenc y first destroyed the middle class... .\" 5 Hitler certainly was given an issue to attack the G erman government with. He could blame the current government for the hyper-inflation and all German citizens could know what he was saying, beca use the price rise affected nearly all of the German people. Even more thought provoking is the possibility that there were those who actually wanted Hitler, or someone like him, to come to power, and who structured the Treaty of Versailles in such a m anner as to force Germany to turn on the printing presses to pay for the cost s of the reparations. Once these conditions were created and the printing of l arge quantities of paper money began, it was possible for a Hitler to promis e that he'd never allow such a travesty to occur under his administration s hould he be given the power of government. As John Maynard Keynes pointed out in his book The Economic Consequences of the Peace, there are those who bene fit by hyper-inflation, and these individuals are the ones most likely to b enefit by the rise to power of a Hitler who attacked the government for allowin g such a thing to occur no matter what the cause. Those who controlled the money supply could purchase Capital Goods at a reduced price (measured in pre-inflation marks) because they had unlimited access to unlimited quan tities of money. Once they had acquired as many Capital Goods as they des ired, it would be to their advantage to have the economic situation return to normal. They could turn off the printing presses. Those who sold property prior to the hyper-inflatio n were the greatest losers, for they were paid in marks worth far less than when they created the mortgage. A mortgagee could not go into the market place and buy a similar piece of property for the price of the mortgage jus t paid up. The only ones able to continue buying property were those who con trolled the printing presses. Is it possible that the German hyper-inflation was intentionally caused to eliminate the middle class? That certainly was t he result of the printing press money, according to Dr. Carroll Quigley, the noted historian, who wrote: \"... by 1924, the middle classes were largel y destroyed.\" 6 Some economists understand this damaging process an d have taken pains to point it out. Professor Ludwig von Mises, for one, lived in Germany during the hyper-inflation and wrote: Inflationism is not a variety of economic policy. I t is an 68"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 MONEY AND GOLD instrument of destruction; if not stopped very soon , it destroys the market entirely.

The first definition is: Monopoly: One seller of a particular good in a market place There are two types: Natural Monopoly: One that exists at the pleasure of the market place; entry to the market is not restricted except by the wishes of the consumer. For instance, the owner of a pet store in a small t own where it isn't profitable for another similar store to compete, wo uld have a Natural Monopoly. 70"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC TERMS Coercive Monopoly: Government either creates or allows the monopoly to exist and then uses force to restrict the access of others into the market place to compete. An example would be a cab company in a city where i t alone is allowed to transport passengers for a fee, by the edict of the governmental agency that created it. No one else is allowed to compete. The price charged is set by the government. The advantage of a monopoly is obvious: the seller sets the price of a good. It is not set by the interaction of a buyer a nd a seller, each with the option of dealing with others. The seller can make exorbitant profits if there is no competition, especially if the government ins ures that the seller will receive no competition from other sellers. Natural monopolies enable the greedy profit seeker only a short term to make an exorbitant profit. Competition tends to red uce the price of the goods sold, thereby reducing the profit made. It is when the monopolist realizes that the secret to long-term wealth is through the utili zation of governmental power to limit access of other sellers into the mar ket place that extreme fortunes are made. Another definition is: Monopsony: One buyer in a market place. Once again, as in the case of a monopoly, there are two types: a natural monopsony and a coercive monopsony. As an example, the creation of a coercive monopsony was the intent of legislation introduced in 1977 that would have made the United States government rather than the privately owned oil comp anies the \"sole buyer of foreign oil.\" The advantages are obvious. If the se ller of foreign oil wishes to sell his product in the United States, he must sell it at a price set by the government, and that price might not have any relat ionship to the price set by a free market. The diird definition is: Cartel: A few sellers in a market place combi ne to set the price of a good sold. There is one major disadvantage to the cartel: the monopolist has to divide both the market place and the profits with t he other sellers. A simple example should suffice to explain how this system works. The first producer of any product has the option of setting the price of the good where the profits are maximum. A product t hat costs $1 to produce ran easily be sold for, say, f 15 to enable the sel ler to make a profit of $14 on each item sold. 71"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC TERMS However, in the free-enterprise system, where acces s to the market place is not restricted, this type of profit encourages o thers to enter in an effort to acquire all or at least part of the profits being m ade. The second seller must reduce the price to induce the buyer to purchase hi s product. The buyer, to save a dollar on the purchase price, now shifts his purchases to the second seller. This price reduction forces the first selle r to reduce his price to match the new price of $14 or to a new price of $13 to re -capture the market place. This see-sawing of the price will continue until th e price reaches a level where one of the sellers will no longer sell his pr oduct. It is conceivable that one of the sellers will redu ce his price to one below the cost of production (his selling price will beco me $.50 even though it costs $1 to produce) in an attempt to bankrupt his compet itor. This price has two obvious disadvantages, though: 1. The seller who sells his product at $.50 must retur n the profits previously made at the higher price to the market p lace because he must continue to pay all of his costs. This is not popul ar with aspiring monopo- lists for obvious reasons. 2. With the reduced price, more product can be purchas ed, (a buyer can now buy 30 units at $.50 apiece as compared to one product at $15. This means that the seller will be forced to return larg e quantities of his previously acquired profits back to the market place and the c onsumer. A natural monopoly can be broken by competition wit hout the force of government nor the threat of governmental action. There is one other option that the monopolist has i n his quest of exorbitant profits. He can join with the another se ller and set the price together by dividing the market place. As stated pr eviously, this forms a cartel, and under this agreement, the two sellers c an set the price at $15 and avoid the head-to-head competition that tended to r educe profits for both. But as pointed out earlier, this form of agreement is not popular because each now must divide the market place and share the prof its. The only advantage is mat it curtails the cut-throat competition betwe en the two. So the cartel raises the price back up to $15 but t his higher price invites competition from a third seller, and the competitiv e process starts all over again. No cartel, in a free market place where acce ss is open to all sellers, can survive the price-cutting tendencies of competition . The way to break any cartel is to allow competitors to compete. This encourages the two cartel members to invite th e third seller into the cartel to avoid the price-cutting war which will br eak the strength of the original two member cartel. But once again, the mar ket is now divided between three sellers instead of two, or even one. This market sharing is also not popular with the monopolists. The key to monopoly control of the market place lie s, then, in fixing it 72"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC TERMS so that no one can compete with the monopolist. Thi s arrangement can be made with the only agency with the force to restric t competition in the market place: the government. This agency has the p ower to curtail competition if the monopolist can gain control of g overnment. This inescapable conclusion soon became apparent to thos e who wished to control the market place, and the monopolist quickl y moved to get control of governments by influencing the outcome of electi ons. This connection between the monopolists and governm ent was cor- rectly discerned by Frederick Clemson Howe, PhD., a n economist, lawyer, and a special assistant to Henry Wallace, the Secre tary of Agriculture and Vice-President to Franklin Roosevelt. He wrote: \"Th ese are the rules of big business: Get a monopoly! Let society work for you, and remember that the best business is politics, for a legislative grant, franchise, subsidy, or tax exemption is worm more than a Kimberly or Comstock Lode, since it does not require any labor either mental or physical, fo r its exploitation.\" 1 John D. Rockefeller, one who correctly assessed the situation as well, expressed the opinion that \"Competition is a sin.\" 2 Another who wrote of this connection was Dr. Antony Sutton, who wrote in his book Wall Street and FDR: Old John Rockefeller and his 19th century fellow ca pitalists were convinced of an absolute truth: that no great monetary wealth could be accumulated under the impartial rules of c ompetitive laissez-faire society (the free-enterprise system) society. The only sure road to the acquisition of massive we alth was monopoly: drive out your competitors, reduce compet ition, eliminate laissez-faire and above all get state pro tection for your industry through compliant politicians and governme nt regulation. The last avenue yields a huge monopoly and a legal monopoly always leads to wealth. 3 And in his book, Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revo lution, Dr. Sutton further amplified his point: The financiers... could by government control... mo re easily avoid the rigors of competition. Through political influence they could manipulate t he police power of the state to achieve what they had been un able, or what was too costly, to achieve under the private enterp rise system. In other words, the police power of the state was a means of maintaining a private monopoly. 4 The best known cartel in the world is OPEC, the Org anization of 73"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC TERMS Petroleum Exporting Countries, which has recently b ecome extremely influential in the oil markets of the world. This c artel is thought to be foreign, primarily Arabian, in ownership. However, there is ample reason to believe that the principle ownership of OPEC is not primarily Arabian but international, including American. Dr. Carroll Quigley, in his massive book entitled T ragedy and Hope, discussed an oil cartel formed in 1928: This world cartel had developed from a tripartite a greement signed on September 17, 1920 by Royal Dutch Shell, Anglo- Iranian, and Standard Oil. These agreed to manage oil prices on the world mark et by charging an agreed fixed price plus freight costs, and to store surplus oil which might weaken the fixed price leve l. By 1949 the cartel had as members the seven greates t oil companies in the world: Anglo-Iranian, Socony-Vacuu m, Royal Dutch Shell, Gulf, Esso, Texaco, and Calso. Excluding the United States domestic market, the So viet Union and Mexico, it controlled 92% of the world's reserves of oil.... 5 James P. Warburg, who should know, further discusse d the cartel in his book The West in Crisis. Apparently the cartel had grown to include an additional member: Eight giant oil companies — five of them American—c ontrol the non-Communist world's supply of oil, maintainin g adminis- tered prices which... yield exorbitant profits. The oil companies extract oil from the Middle East, which contains 90% of the known reserves of the non-commu nist world, at a cost of 20 to 30 cents a barrel and sell it at a collusive price, varying over a period of recent years from $1.75 to $2.16 p er barrel, f.o.b., the Persian Gulf. The resulting profit has, as a rule, been split on a fifty-fifty basis with the government of the country in which t he oil is produced. 6 Using the following figures, it is easy to extrapol ate price increases to today's oil market prices. Years Cost Price Profit % of Profit 1950 $ .30 $ 2.16 $ 1.86 620 1979** $3.25 $20.00 $16.75 515 74"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC TERMS ** presuming a 10% per year increase in costs and u sing the OPEC price of $20.00 in 1979, the profit of $16.75 is approxim ately the same as that pointed out in Warburg's book. In other words, the OPEC countries are increasing o il prices today in order to maintain their profit percentages of 30 ye ars ago. It is interesting to note that both Dr. Quigley and Mr. Warburg wrote about the years 1949 and 1950. OPEC was formed in 1 951, right after both authors pointed out that the Arabian oil reserves w ere owned by non-Arabian oil companies. It is doubtful mat these non-Arabian oil companies gave up the ability to make a 620 percent profit to the OPEC nations wh en OPEC was formed. In summary, then, these agreements that artificiall y set prices, (the cartels, monopolies, and monopsonies,) lead to the accumulation of large quantities of amassed wealth. These marketplace abe rrations exist solely because the monopolists have formed a partnership w ith the government, and the result is higher prices for the consumer. 75"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Chapter 8 The Secret Societies Author Arthur Edward Waite wrote: Beneath the broad tide of human history there flow the stealthy undercurrents of the secret societies, whi ch frequently determine in the depths the changes that take place upon the surface. 1 British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, 1874-1880 , confirmed the above assertion about the control by the secret soc ieties in the affairs of men when he wrote: There is in Italy a power which we seldom mention i n this House (the House of Parliament)....

All of the agitation at the bottom is stirred up, b uilt up, financed, and controlled by the Insiders, at the to p, to give them- selves the means and the excuse for seizing more po wer — always under the guise of stopping or preventing these rev olutionary activities among the masses at the bottom. 3 Communism is a front for something deeper. Communis m is not a revolt of the \"poor\" but a conspiratorial plo t of the \"rich.\" The international conspiracy does not originate in Moscow — but probably in New York. It is not an idealistic c rusade for the poor and the humble but a disguised power grab of t he rich and the arrogant. The story of modern-day Communism begins with a sec ret society called the Order of the Illuminati. It was about this organization that the 1953 Report of the California Senate Investigating Committee on Education, stated : \"So called modern Communism is apparently the same hypocritical world conspiracy to destroy civilization that was founded by the Illumi nati, and that raised its head in our colonies here at the critical period be fore the adoption of our Constitution.\" 4 Another historian, Oswald Spengler, has taken the i nvestigating committee one step further. He has linked Communism with the moneyed 77"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8 THE SECRET SOCIETIES interests of the world. He has written: \"There is n o proletarian, not even Communist, movement that has not operated in the in terests of money, in the directions indicated by money, and for the time being permitted by money — and that without the idealists among its le aders having the slightest suspicion of the fact.\" 5 According to Mr. Spengler, even the leaders of Comm unism are not aware of the secret workings of their own movement. Is it possible that Gus Hall and Angela Davis, the 1980 Communist Party can didates for President and Vice-President of the United States, who ran on a platform opposing \"the big banks and monopoly corporations that contr ol the economy\" are really being used by the very organizations they os tensibly oppose? Is it possible that the wealthy banks and monopoly corpor ations want and support the Communist Party because they want the P arty to oppose mem? One Communist Party member, Dr. Bella Dodd, a membe r of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the Un ited States, appar- antly decided mat there was indeed a connection bet ween wealthy \"capital- ists\" and the Party. She noticed that every time th e National Committee couldn't reach a decision, one of their members wou ld leave, go to the Waldorf Towers in New York City, and meet with a pa rticular individual, later identified as Arthur Goldsmith. Dr. Dodd obse rved that every time Mr. Goldsmith made a decision, it was later confirmed b y the Communist Party in Moscow. But what truly amazed Dr. Dodd was that Mr. Goldsmith was not only a member of the Communist Party, but an ex tremely wealthy American \"capitalist.\" So if the preceding commentators are correct in the ir charges that Communism is a front for secret societies, includin g the Illuminati, it behooves the student of the conspiratorial view to examine the origins and history of this organization. The Illuminati was founded on May 1, 1776, by Adam Weishaupt, a Jesuit priest and a professor of Canon Law at Ingol stadt University in Bavaria, today part of Germany. There is some evide nce that Professor Weishaupt had become affiliated with secret societi es before he founded the Illuminati. The founding date of May 1 is still celebrated by C ommunists around the world as May Day, although the purists claim th at May Day is celebrated because that was the beginning date for the Russian Revolution of 1905. But this doesn't change the date of May 1, 1905 as an a nniversary of the founding of the Illuminati on May 1, 1776. Weishaupt's organization spread quickly, especially among fellow \"intellectuals\" at his university. In fact, all but two of its professors had become members of this organization in the first fe w years of its existence. The basic philosophy that was being offered to the prosective member 78"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8 THE SECRET SOCIETIES of the Illuminati was a reversal of the traditional philosophy taught by the church and the educational system. It has been summ arized by Weishaupt himself as follows: \"Man is not bad except as he is made so by arbitrary morality. He is bad because religion, the state, an d bad examples pervert him. When at last reason becomes the religion of men, th en will the problem be solved.\" 6 There is reason to believe that Weishaupt's contemp t of religion started on July 21, 1773, when Pope Clement XIV \"forever an nulled and extin- guished the Jesuit order.\" The Pope's action was in response to pressure from France, Spain, and Portugal, which independently had come to the concl usion that the Jesuits were meddling in the affairs of the state and were therefore enemies of the government. The response of one ruler, King Joseph of Portugal, was typical. He \"hastened to sign a decree by which the Jesuits wer e denounced as 'traitors, rebels and enemies to the realm...' \" 7 So the three nations presented \"the categorical req uest that he (the Pope) should suppress the Jesuit order throughout the wor ld.\" 8 The Pope agreed and banned the order. Weishaupt, a Jesuit priest, certainly must have bee n concerned by the Pope's action, possibly to the point where he wishe d to organize an institu- tion strong enough to ultimately destroy the Cathol ic Church itself. Pope Clement's action was short-lived, though, as P ope Pius VII in August, 1814 reinstated the Jesuits to all of their former rights and privileges. 9 Pope Pius' reinstatement did not go without notice in the United States, as ex-President John Adams wrote to his successor, Thomas Jefferson: \"I do not like the re-appearance of the Jesuits. If ever there was a body of men who merited eternal damnation on earth. . . it is this So ciety...\" 10 Jefferson replied: \"Like you, I disapprove of the r estoration of the Jesuits, for it means a step backwards from light i nto darkness.\" 11 The Jesuits are still in trouble with the Church ju st as they were during the early 1700's. On February 28, 1982, Pope Paul I I told the Jesuits \"to keep clear of politics, and honor Roman Catholic traditi on.\" 12 An article on the Pope's action in the U.S. News an d World Report stated that the Jesuits had indeed meddled in the a ffairs of certain nations. The article said: \"Jesuits have played leading role s in Nicaragua's Sandinista revolution. Some Jesuits have joined Communist part ies. One priest in El Salvador has claimed that his order is working for the advancement of Marxism and revolution, not for God.\" l3 The article continued by stating that Jesuits have \"joined left-wing rebel movements in Central America and the Philippines, a nd have advocated a 79"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8 THE SECRET SOCIETIES molding of Marxism and Roman Catholicism in what is called 'liberation theology.' \" 14 Weishaupt's contempt for religion manifested itself with his thought that man's ability to reason would set the moral to ne of the society rather than the teachings of the Bible. This thought was not new. The Bible teaches that the first man and woman, Ada m and Eve, were instructed by God not to eat the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. Man was not to set his own moral precepts ; he was to listen to the laws of God. Man was tempted by Satan with the abil ity to \"be as Gods, knowing good and evil,\" capable of using his own mi nd to decide what was right and wrong. So Weishaupt's call to man's reason to determine ma n's morality was not new; it was the continuing battle between man's mind and the teachings of God. One well-known example of man's rebellion to the la ws of God occurred when Moses of the Old Testament of the Bib le brought God's laws in the form of the Ten Commandments to the people. While Moses was absent, the people had constructed their own god, a mouthless golden calf incapable of offering any instructions or moral tea chings. It is easy to worship something that does not require any obedien ce nor has the ability to issue laws by which to live. So man continued his rebellion against God. Weishau pt furthered the trend by teaching that man could free himself by em ancipating himself from religion. Even the name of his organization, the Il luminati, revealed his concern about man's mind. The \"Illuminated Ones\" of the Illuminati would be those possessing the greatest ability to d iscern the truths of the universe gleaned from the workings of the human min d. Once unhindered by religion, pure reason would lead man out of the spiritual wilderness. Those who believe in the teachings of God as reveal ed to man through the Holy Bible do not believe that God's laws are r estrictions on man's freedoms, but are exactly the opposite. They enable man to enjoy his freedom by not fearing the plundering of his life, liberty and property by others. The commandment \"Thou shalt not kill\" restricts man 's ability to kill his neighbor, thereby increasing man's ability to l ive. \"Thou shalt not steal\" encourages man to allow his neighbor to accumulate the property he needs to sustain his own life. \"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife\" discour- ages adultery and encourages fidelity, thus strengt hening the sacredness of God's institution of marriage. God's laws allow maximum freedom to those who will abide by them. Man becomes less free when his wife, his property, and his very life belong to those who feel they have the right to take them fro m him. 80"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8 THE SECRET SOCIETIES Weishaupt even admitted that he was founding a new religion when he founded the Illuminati. He wrote: \"I never thought that I should become the founder of a new religion.\" 15 So the goal of the new religion became the substitu tion of the religious man with the illuminated man: man solving man's pro blems through the use of his mind. Weishaupt declared: \"Reason will b e the only code of man.\" 16 \"When at last reason becomes the religion of man, so will the problem be solved.\" 17 Weishaupt believed that man was a product of his en vironment and that man would be happy if he could re-structure the env ironment completely. Today that teaching is the foundation of the philos ophy in the courts that frees criminals even before the victim can fil e the charges against the criminal. The rational, illuminated mind sees that the society, the environ- ment, and not the criminal, is at fault for the act ions of the individual. This thinking holds that the society must be punished fo r the acts of the criminal, and that the criminal must be released back into th e society so that it can be punished for the failure to meet the criminal's nee ds. So Weishaupt saw religion as the problem because re ligion taught that only moral means may be utilized to achieve a moral end. Weishaupt saw this as an obstacle to his achieving his desired result: the complete alteration of man's society. He wrote: \"Behold our secret. Rememb er that the end justifies the means, and that the wise ought to take all the means to do good which the wicked take to do evil.\" 18 Any activity, either moral or immoral, becomes mora l or acceptable to the member of the Illuminati as long as that activi ty promotes the goals of the organization. Murder, looting, wars, whatever, beco mes acceptable behavior to the real believer of the new religion. Another major obstacle to man's progress, according to Weishaupt, was nationalism. He wrote: \"With the origin of nations and peoples the world ceased to be a great family.... Nationalism took th e place of human love...\" 19 Weishaupt was not an anarchist (one who believes in the absence of government) but believed that there was a need for world government to replace what used to be the national governments. T his entity was in turn to be ruled by the members of the Illuminati: \"The pup ils (of the Illuminati) are convinced that the order will rule the world. E very member therefore becomes a ruler.\" 20 So the ultimate goal of the Illuminati, and hence a ll of its successors, becomes power: worldwide power. The power of govern ment over all the people of the world. If Weishaupt wished to so alter man's life in a man ner only his suppor- ters wanted, than it becomes imperative that his go als be kept secret from his 81"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8 THE SECRET SOCIETIES intended victims. He wrote: \"The great strength of our order lies in its concealment: let it never appear in any place in it s own name, but always covered by another name and another occupation.\" 21 Under the protection of its concealment, the order quickly grew. However, as has been the case with all of the secre t organizations that controlled the so-called Communist organizations, i t did not attract, nor was it intended to attract, the \"downtrodden masses,\" t he \"lowly\" peasant- worker it was supposedly created to assist. It drew from the near powerful, the representatives of that layer of society just under neath the power holders. For instance, a partial listing of the occupations of s ome of the members of the Illuminati revealed this statement was true: marqui s, baron, lawyer, abbe, count, magistrate, prince, major, professor, colone l, priest, and duke. These were the occupations of the individuals who, without fear of discovery, could meet secretly and conspire against the government, the army, the church and the establishment. These were the people who did not possess the ultimate power of control over their re spective fields of endeavor, but they saw the Illuminati as the means of achievi ng their goals of individ- ual power. The members of the Illuminati whenever together or in correspondence with fellow members assumed aliases to conceal thei r real identities. Weishaupt assumed the name of Spartacus, a Roman sl ave who led an uprising against the Roman government centuries bef ore. What was the goal of these conspirators? Nesta Webster, one of the major researchers into th e Illuminati, has summarized their goals as follows: 1. Abolition of monarchy and all ordered government. 2. Abolition of private property. 3. Abolition of inheritance. 4. Abolition of patriotism (nationalism). 5. Abolition of the family (i.e. of marriage and all m orality, and the institution of communal education of children). 6. Abolition of all religion. 22 In 1777, Weishaupt was initiated into the Masonic O rder, the Lodge Theodore of Good Councel, in Munich, Germany. His p urpose in joining was not to become part of this benevolent order, bu t to infiltrate it and then to control it altogether. In fact, the Masons held an International Congress at Wilhemsbad in July, 1782, and \"Illuminism was injected into Freem asonry by indoctrinat- ing the Masonic leaders....\" 23 However, the secrecy of the Illuminati was soon bro ken in 1783 when \"four professors of the Marianen Academy... were su mmoned before the 82"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8 THE SECRET SOCIETIES Court of Enquiry and questioned on... the Illuminat i.\" 24 The Bavarian government had discovered the philosop hies and pur- noses of the Illuminati and, more importantly, its desire to overthrow the Bavarian government. Hearings were held and the gov ernment abolished the order. But discovery of the organization was perhap s a blessing in disguise: the members fled the persecution of the Bavarian go vernment and they took the Illuminati with them, establishing new societie s all over Europe and America. The Bavarian government countered this expansion by warning other European governments about the exact purposes of th e Illuminati, but the rulers of Europe refused to listen. Those decisions would later come back to haunt these governments. As Nesta Webster observed: \"The extravagence of the scheme therein propounded rendered it unbelieva ble, and the rulers of Europe, refusing to take Illuminism seriously, put it aside as a chimera (a foolish fancy).\" 25 The fact that the rulers of Europe wouldn't believe the goals of the Illuminati is a problem that is recurring all over the world today. It is difficult for the observer to believe that such a g iant, well organized conspiracy does exist, and that the goals they envi sion for the world are real. This disbelief by the public is what fuels their su ccess and it behooves the Conspiracy to plan their events in such a way that the truth becomes so incredible and so preposterous that no one would be lieve that they were intentionally created. A Frenchman named Danton said this in French, and l oosely translated, what he said means: \"Audacity, audacity, always aud acity!\" One of the countries to which the Illuminati fled w as America, and they formed their first chapter in Virginia in 1786, fol lowed by fourteen others in different cities. 26 They organized the Callo-Italian Society, and with the onset of the American Revolution, disciples in America be gan to call themselves the Jacobins. 27 Much of what is known about the Illuminati today co mes from a book written in 1798 by Professor John Robison, a profes sor of Natural Philo- sophy at Edinburgh University in Scotland. He entit led his book Proofs of a Conspiracy Against all the Religions and Government s of Europe Carried On In the Secret Meetings of the Free Masons, Illum inati, and Reading Societies. Professor Robison, himself a Mason, had been asked to join the Illuminati but felt he should investigate the order before he joined. Robison concluded that the association had been formed \"for the express purpose of rooting out all the religious establishments and ov erturning all the existing governments of Europe.\" 28 These charges, even today, have fallen on deaf ears among many of Robison's fellow Masons. One of the more scholarly works supporting the 83"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8 THE SECRET SOCIETIES Freemasons is a book entitled An Encyclopaedia of F reemasonry by Albert Mackey, M.D., himself a 33rd degree Mason, the high est level attainable in the Masonic Order. Dr. Mackey makes these statements about Professor R obison's book: Many of his statements are untrue and his arguments illogical, exaggerated, and some of them altogether false. (His) theory is based on false premises and his reasonings (are) fallacious and illogical. He wrote that the founder of the Illuminati, Profes sor Weishaupt, was \"a Masonic reformer. Weishaupt could not have been the monster that he has been painted by his adversaries.\" 30 In fact, Dr. Mackey praised the Illuminati: \"The or iginal design of Illuminism was undoubtedly the elevation of the hum an race.\" 31 Dr. Mackey dismissed the Illuminati as being no thr eat to civilization because he apparently felt that the organization ha d disappeared: \"... by the end of the last century (by 1900) it had ceased to exist.\"' 2 This might be true, as far as the name Illuminati i s concerned, but there is strong evidence, mainly through the perpetuation of the philosophy through like-minded organizations, that the Order p erpetuated self by frequently changing its name and surfacing again. In 1798, shortly after the publication of Professor Robison's work on the Illuminati, American minister Reverend G.W. Snyder sent a copy of the book to President George Washington, who was a very visible member of the Masonic Order. On September 25,1798, President Wash ington wrote a letter to Rev. Snyder: \"I have heard much of the nefarious and dangerous plan and doctrines of the Illuminati, but never saw the book until you were pleased to send it to me. It was not my intention to doubt tha t the doctrine of the Illuminati had not spread in the United States. On the contrary, no one is more satisfied of this fact than I am... .\" 33 But not all of America's founding fathers agreed wi th President Washington. Thomas Jefferson, after reading part th ree of the writings of another exposer of the Illuminati, the Abbe Barruel , wrote: \"Barruel's own parts of the book are perfectly the ravings of a Be dlamite.\" 34 (Webster's dictionary defines a Bedlamite as an inhabitant of the Bedlam hospital for lunatics in London, England.) Jefferson also wrote the following about the founde r of the Illuminati: \"Weishaupt seems to be an enthusiastic philanthropi st. Weishaupt believes that to promote the perfection of the human charact er was the object of Jesus Christ. His (Weishaupt's) precepts are the love of God and love of our neighbor.\" 35 (It is truly amazing that two people could read the works of Weishaupt, or the writings of those who were out to expose him for what he was, and come away with two such divergent opinions about hi s purposes. Yet there 84"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8 THE SECRET SOCIETIES are still defenders of the Illuminati even today.) Some of the more vocal critics of the Illuminati be lieve that they were instrumental in fomenting the American Revolution i tself. But a simple review of the nature of this revolution will show t he difference between a revolution created by the Illuminati and the Americ an Revolution. Life magazine summarized it quite well in its series on Revolutions: \"The American revolution was strictly a war of independe nce. It gave later revolutions a noble ideal and gave America itself t he freedom to pursue its own destiny, but it left the structure of American society in all essentials unchanged.\" 36 In other words, the American Revolution did not dis solve the family, abolish religion, nor eliminate the national border s, the three targets of the Illuminati. The American Revolution was fought to d isengage the United States from the government of England. This fact is confirmed by the Declaration of Independence. The founding fathers w rote: \"When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for on e people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with anot her...\" But the Illuminati has had its hands directly in ot her revolutions, the most notable being the French Revolution of 1789. The facts of their involvement in this uprising are not well known. The traditional explanation of the French Revolution is that the French people, tired of being oppressed by King Louis XVI and Mari e Antoinette, rose up in opposition to the monarchy and started the revoluti on by storming the Bastille prison. This activity, according to the of ficial historical record, started the revolution that was to culminate in the replacing of the monarchy with the so-called \"French Republic.\" The French people commemorate the start of their \"r evolution\" by making Bastille Day, July 14, an annual holiday. Th is further supports the contention that the people of France truly revolted and overthrew the King of France. However, those who have studied the revolution in d epth have disco- vered the real reason for the storming of the Basti lle prison. As Nesta Webster explained it, \"A plan of attack on the Bastille had already been drawn up, it only remained now to set the people in motion.\" 37 The plan of attack was to storm the Bastille, not t o release the hundreds of \"oppressed political prisoners\" supposedly impri soned there, but to capture the needed weapons to start the revolution. This was confirmed by the fact that, when the mob reached the Bastille, s o-called \"torturous\" prison of the \"oppressive\" King Louis XVI, there were only seven prisoners incarcerated there: four forgers, two lunatics, and the Comte de Solages, incarcerated for \"monstrous crimes against humanity \" at the request of his family. In fact, \"The damp, dark dungeons had falle n into complete disuse; 85"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8 THE SECRET SOCIETIES since the first ministry of Necker in 1776, no one had been imprisoned there.\" 38 The second erroneous presumption about the causes o f the French Revolution is that the revolution was the action of the masses of the French people. This concept of large numbers of Frenchmen supporting the revolution is erroneous, because, in truth \"Out of the 800,000 inhabitants of Paris only approximately 1,000 took any part in the siege of the Bastille...\" 39 Those who were directly involved in the storming of the prison were in fact paid by those who directed the entire affair. That brigands from the South (of France) were delib erately enticed to Paris in 1789, employed and paid by the revolutionary leaders, is a fact confirmed by authorities too num erous to quote at length; and the further fact drat the conspirators felt that such a measure to be necessary is of immense significance, for it shows that in their eyes the people of Paris were not to be de pended on to carry out a revolution. In other words, the importation o f the contingent of hired brigands conclusively refutes the theory t hat the Revolu- tion was an irrepressable rising of the people. 40 In addition, not only Frenchmen were employed by th ose directing the revolution: \"... the motley crew of 'brigands,'... thirsting for violence, consisting not only of the aforesaid Marsailles (th ose Frenchmen from the 'South,' cited above) and Italians, but also... of large numbers of Germans....\" 41 One who was in a position to witness the actual sie ge of the Bastille in Paris was a Dr. Rigby, who was in Paris as a touris t during the French Revolution. His letters to his wife during these da ys offer an interesting insight into what actually happened. Nesta Webster, in her book The French Revolution, commented on Dr. Rigby's correspondence : \"So little commo- tion did the siege of the Bastille cause in Paris t hat Dr. Rigby, unaware that anything unusual was going on, went off early in th e afternoon to visit the gardens of Monceaux.\" 42 Another of the observers of the French Revolution w as Lord Acton, who confirmed that there was a hidden hand at work at f omenting the French Revolution: \"The appalling thing in the French Revo lution is not the tumult but the design. Through all the fire and smo ke, we perceive the evidence of calculating organization. The managers remain studiously concealed and masked; but there is no doubt about t heir presence from the first.\" 43 The plan of the conspirators was simple: to create \"popular\" grievances in order to exploit them to their benefit. They cre ated five particular 86"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8 THE SECRET SOCIETIES grievances to create the impression that the King h imself was responsible. It was hoped that the difficult conditions would be su fficient to arouse enough people to join those already hired so mat it would appear that the revolution was indeed one with popular support. The conspirato rs could men control the events and bring about their desired results. The first of these contrived grievances was the sho rtage of grain. Webster says: \"Montjoie asserts that agents employed by the Duc d' Orleans deliber- ately bought up the grain, and either sent it out o f the country or concealed it in order to drive the people to revolt.\" 44 So the Duc d' Orleans, a member of the Illuminati, purchased large quantities of grain to cause the people to take the ir grievances to the King whom they were led to believe had caused the shorta ge. It was, of course, the Illuminati that spread the story that the King had intentionally caused the grain shortage. This tactic is similar to the one d etailed by Jan Kozak in his book Not A Shot Is Fired, written about 160 years l ater. The second of these contrived grievances was the en ormous debt that caused the government to tax the people to pay for it. The national debt was estimated to be 4 1/2 billion livre, worth about $8 00 million in the dollar of the day. The money had been borrowed by the French government to assist the United States in the American Revolution of 177 6. (The connection between the Illuminati of France and the founding f athers of the American Revolution, will be discussed in a later chapter of mis book.) It has been estimated that two-thirds of the French debt had be en created by those loans. The third contrived grievance was the false impress ion that the French people were starving. Dr. Rigby, previously mention ed, stated mat: \"... we have seen few of the lower classes in rage, idlenes s and misery.\" 45 Nesta Webster explained further: \"... Dr. Rigby con tinues in the same strain of admiration — an admiration that we might attribute to lack of discernment were it not mat it ceases abruptly on h is entry into Germany. Here he finds a 'country to which Nature has been e qually kind as to France, for it has fertile soil, but as yet the inhabitants live under an oppressive government.' At Cologne, (Germany) he finds that 't yranny and oppression have taken up their abode.' \" 46 The fourth major grievance caused by the Illuminati and its fellow conspirators in the government was massive inflatio n which was bankrupt- ing the working classes. 35 million assignats were printed in a short time and this was partially the cause of the shortages. The government's response was to impose food rationing, and this further continue d to anger the people. This tactic is, once again, similar to the strategy detailed by Jan Kozak. The fifth distortion of the truth was the alleged \" oppressive\" reign of King Louis XVI. The truth is that France was the mo st prosperous of all the European states prior to the Revolution. France hel d one-half of the money 87"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8 THE SECRET SOCIETIES in circulation in all of Europe, and in the period of 1720 to 1780, foreign trade was multiplied by four. One half of the wealth in F rance was in the hands of the middle class, and the \"serfs\" owned more land t han anyone else. The King had abolished forced labor on public works in France and had outlawed the use of torture in interrogation. In ad dition, the king had founded hospitals, established schools, reformed th e laws, built canals, drained the marshes to increase the quantity of ara ble land, and had constructed numerous bridges to ease the flow of go ods inside the country. So in this, the first of several \"revolutions\" to b e reviewed in this book, we see the classic example of the Conspiracy at wor k. The benevolent King was fostering a rise of the middle class by encoura ging a better and healthier society. This situation was intolerable to those wh o were in the layer just underneath the ruling class, as the rising middle c lass began to assume power themselves. The conspirators intended to eliminate not only the King and the present ruling class but the middle class as we ll. The enemy of the Conspiracy is always the middle cl ass, and in the other revolutions to be reviewed elsewhere in this book, it shall be shown that the Conspiracy foments these contrived \"revolutions\" fo r just that purpose. So the French Revolution was a fraud and hoax. The people were being manipulated for reasons not made known to them. 47 The invisible hand that guided the entire French Re volution was the Illuminati, only thirteen years in existence, yet p owerful enough to cause a revolution in one of the major countries of the wor ld. But the members of the Illuminati had laid down the plans for the Revolution years before, and had infiltrated anothe r secret group, the Masons: \"France's galloping revolution was assisted in the decades previous to 1789 by the growth of the Masonic Brotherhood.\" 48 Freemasonry had come to France in 1725, but by 1772 , the organization had split into two groups, one of which became know n as the Grand Orient Lodge of Freemasonry. The first Grand Master, the e quivalent of president, of the Lodge was the Duc d' Orleans, also a member of the Illuminau. The Grand Orient Lodge spread quickly throughout th e entirety of France so that by 1789 there were a total of 600 lo dges all over France as compared to only 104 in 1772. Members of the Grand Orient were also active in government, as 447 of the 605 members of the Est ates General, France's parliament, were members. The plan of the Illuminau was to infiltrate the Mas onic Order, convert it into a branch of the Illuminati, and then use it s secrecy as the vehicle to overthrow the monarchy. The new head of the governm ent would be the Duc d' Orleans. The strategy worked for awhile, but lat er the Duc suffered the ultimate penalty for his treason against the French government: he died on the guillotine. 88"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8 THE SECRET SOCIETIES What, then, was offered to the French people instea d of their old society? What was to be the guiding force behind the new soc iety offered by the Illuminati? That question was answered by an author who has stu died the Revolu- tion: \"The French Revolution represented the first attempt to use the religion of reason... as the foundation of a new or der of society.\" 49 In fact, in November, 1793: \"... the multitude asse mbled in the Cathed- ral of Notre Dame to worship the Goddess of Reason, personified by an actress... placed naked by government decree upon t he altar...\" 50 So the French Revolution was created to replace God with the \"Goddess of Reason.\" The conspirators offered the French peo ple the essential program of the the Illuminati: man's mind would sol ve man's problems. In spite of all of the evidence of the planning, ho wever, there are still those who believe the French Revolution was the spo ntaneous activity of an oppressed population rising up against a tyrannical king.

This is, in addition, the official position offered by the Communists themsel ves. Their position is that this previously unknown young man suddenly ros e out of obscurity to write the Communist Manifesto and thereby launched the Communist movement. However, the truth is that this explanation is only partially correct. And the truth is far more interesting than the partiall y correct story. To understand why this is so, it becomes important to first examine Karl Marx, the individual. Marx, born in 1818, went to Paris, France, in 1843 to study economics, and while at a university met Frederick Engels, the son of a wealthy Lancashire, England, cotton spinner. Marx soon lear ned the joys of possessing unearned wealth, for Engels constantly a ssisted Marx, and later Marx and his family, with an income from his father 's cotton mills in England. Marx didn't care for the traditional forms of labor to earn the necessities of life, relying instead on the largess of his friend Engels to keep himself alive for nearly all of his adult life. 90"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 COMMUNISM Marx frequently made appeals to Engels for more mon ey because he said his daughters \"must have a bourgeois education so they can make contacts in life.\" 1 Traditional historians have not dwelt much upon thi s relationship between Marx and Engels. Those that do find it stra nge that Marx, the \"champion of the oppressed and the downtrodden work ers\" would spend nearly all of his adult life living off the profits acquired from a \"capitalistic\" cotton mill in England. Engels' father, if consiste nt with the charges against the \"propertied class\" of the day, was \"exploiting the working class, those who produce all of the capital of the world.\" Yet M arx continued living off the income provided by Engels' share of the cotton mill. If Marx had been true and consistent to his princip les, he would have rejected this money and lived by the earnings of hi s own labors. Yet the only official job Marx ever had was as a correspondent f or a newspaper for a short time. In his early youth Marx was a believer in God. But while at the univer- sity Marx changed his views. He once wrote that he wished to avenge himself \"against the One who rules above.\" 2 It was no coincidence that his change in his basic belief came after he joined the highly secret Satanist Church. As eviden ce of his membership in this sect, Marx grew a heavy beard and let his hair grow long. These outward manifestations were \"... characteristic of the disc iples of Joana Southcott, a Satanic priestess who considered herself in contact with the demon Shiloh.\" 3 By 1841 his conversion was nearly complete as a fri end of his had observed: \"Marx calls the Christian religion one of the most immoral of religions.\" 4 Not only did Marx attack the Christian religion, bu t the Jewish religion as well. In 1856 Marx wrote in the New York Tribune : \"Thus do these loans... become a blessing to the House of Judah. T his Jew organization of loanmongers is as dangerous to the people as the ar istocratic organization of landowners.\" 5 But generally Marx took out his anger against relig ion itself: \"The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of man is a demand for their real happiness.\" 6 The reasons for Marx's bitterness against religion are numerous: Marx saw religion: 1. as the mechanism of the wealthy to keep the poor, d owntrodden worker in his state of poverty; 2. as the teaching that one man's property did not bel ong to another; 3. as the teaching that man should not covet another m an's property; and 4. as the teaching that each man should be self-suffic ient and earn his own sustenance. 91"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 COMMUNISM Marx saw this unequal distribution of wealth as the cause of man's unhappiness. If only property could be equally divi ded, man would be happy. And the vehicle that kept man from acquiring his fair share of the property was organized religion that taught that on e man could not take the property of another by force: \"Thou shalt not steal .\" Religious teaching also included the commandment that it was wrong to desir e more property than you were able to acquire by your own efforts: \"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods.\" Marx reasoned, therefore, it was the religious syst em that kept man in poverty, as if the ownership of property was the on ly requirement for human happiness. It men followed, according to Marxist lo gic, that the capitalist system had to be destroyed because it encouraged ev ery individual to produce his own necessities through his individual labor. Therefore, the happiness of man was contingent upon abolishing not only the religious system but the \"Capitalistic\" sy stem as well. One of Marx's friends, Mikhail Bakunin, once wrote mis about Marx: \"Since Marx rejected the idea of God, he could not explain the 'human condition' as the result of sin. He blamed all evil , both moral and psycholog- ical, on the economic system which he said had to b e overthrown by revolution so that the society of man could be rest ructured.\" 7 But even the abolishment of religion and the Capita listic System was not enough for the Marxists. Marx himself wished to abolish \"all social conditions,\" not just the church and the free enter prise system. Marx wrote: \"The Communists... openly declare that their ends c an be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social condi tions.\" 8 Marx wrote frequently on these subjects. He wrote t he following about the subject of the family: \"The bourgeois clap trap about family and education, about the co-relation of parent and chil d, becomes all the more disgusting... 9 And on nationality: \"The working men have no countr y. We cannot take away from mem what they have not got.\" 10 Marx realized mat the main vehicle to be utilized i n the destruction of these values was the government, and he was correct . Take, for instance, the following newspaper article that appeared in 1980: FAMILY LIFE HARMED BY GOVERNMENT, POLL SAYS Pollster George Gallup said Friday nearly half of t hose who responded to his organization's 1980 survey on the American family believe that the federal government has an u nfavorable influence on family life. 11 Ideas on how the family unit can be further damaged are now being offered by a variety of people. One, an assistant p rofessor at a college, offered 92"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 COMMUNISM this thought on the subject: \"... the fact that chi ldren are raised in families means there is no equality. In order to raise child ren with equality, we must take them away from families and communally raise t hem.\" 12 To show their individual contempt for the tradition al view of family life, both Frederick Engels and Marx had affairs: E ngels with the wife of a friend, and Marx with his maid. (When Marx married Jenny von West- nhalen, the daughter of a rich and respected Prussi an official, her mother gave the couple a maid as a wedding present. Marx s howed his appreciation by getting his gift pregnant.) Marx further showed his contempt for his family by allowing two of his six children to starv e to death, because Marx's contempt for industrious labor frequently failed to provide for his family's sustenance. In addition, two of his other children later committed suicide, perhaps because of their wretched existence as chil dren. 13 Marx's views on marriage and the family were consis tent with the way he lived his life, but in other areas his hypocrisy was very evident. For instance, in June, 1864, \"in a letter to his un cle, Lion Phillips, Marx announced that he had made 400 pounds on the stock exchange.\" 14 Here Marx, the great champion of the working man ag ainst the \"exploiting capitalists\" (those who make their mone y on the stock exchange,) admits that he himself had made a profit on the stock exchange (in effect admitting that he considered himself a m ember of this class.) Notice that this was eighteen years after he urged the pro letariat (the working class) to overthrow the bourgeois (the wealthy class), tho se who make profits on the stock exchange. On one occasion, he wrote to Engels asking for the final settlement of the Wolff legacy. He said: \"If I had had the money during the last ten days, I would have been able to make a good deal on the s tock exchange. The time has now come when with wit and very little money, o ne can really make a killing in London.\" 15 The Wolff legacy referred to in Marx's letter was t he remains of an inheritance left to Marx by Wilhelm Wolff, an obscu re German admirer. The total legacy inherited by Marx was 824 pounds, when the annual income of the \"exploited working class\" was approximately 4.5 pounds. In rough equivalents today, that would mean that Marx inheri ted approximately $365,000 assuming that the average wage of an Ameri can workman in 1980 was $20,000. It was not as if Marx could not have earned an adeq uate living by his own efforts. Mr. Marx was indeed Dr. Marx, as he ha d earned a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Jena. With this d egree, he could have been employed by a European university and made a comfor table living. (Marx never actually attended the university. He purchase d his doctorate through the mail.) 93"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 COMMUNISM In about 1846, both Marx and Engels joined a group calling itself The Communist League which \"sprang from what was known as the League of the Just. The latter, in turn, was an offshoot of t he Parisian Outlaws League, founded by German refugees in that city. After a tu rbulent ten-year period, the League of the Just found its 'center of gravity ' as Engels put it, in London where, he added, a new feature came to the fore: 'f rom being German' the League became international.\" 16 After the Illuminati was discovered in Bavaria, Ger many, its members scattered throughout Europe. The League was an \"off -shoot of the Parisian Outlaws League, founded by German refugees.\" One ca n only wonder if those refugees were the scattering Illuminati. In any event, at the Second Congress of the Communi st League (the official title of the Manifesto, in German, is Mani fest der Kommunistichen Partei. (History has translated \"Partei\" variously as \"Party\" or \"League.\") Marx and Engels were selected to write a party plat form. Apparently both encountered delays in achieving this result, and th e two writers \"caused the Central Committee of the League to serve notice sha rply that if the manifesto was not ready by February 1, 1848, measures would b e taken against Marx and Engels. Results followed.\" 17 So Marx and Engels were given the task of writing a party platform for an already existing international group. The Manife sto was not the work of an inspired nobody by the name of Karl Marx (or Fre derick Engels, for that matter,) who suddenly sprang up from obscurity. Bot h were hired by an already existing group that now felt its power was strong enough for them to come out from the \"smoke-filled\" rooms and make their organization, and its platform, known to the people of Europe. But why was it so important for the manifesto to be completed by the first of February? Because the \"spontaneous revolut ions\" that had already been planned all over Europe could \"spontaneously\" erupt on schedule. In fact, these \"spontaneously planned\" revolutions sta rted on March 1, 1848 in Baden followed by others in Vienna on March 12; Par ma, March 13; Venice, March 22; London, April 10; Spain, May 7; and Naple s, May 15. Sixty-four revolutions \"spontaneously erupted\" all over Russia during the year as well. So the Manifesto of the Communist Party was issued in London, England, on February 1, 1848, as an explanation of the cause of the revolu- tions already planned. Fortunately for the people o f Europe, nearly all of these revolutions failed. Because of these failures, the name of the manifest o was changed to the Communist Manifesto and the name of Karl Marx was a dded as its author. This event occurred in 1868, twenty years after its original publication. What, then, did the Communist Party want Marx and E ngels to write? Marx saw the proletariat (the working class) wresti ng \"... by degrees, 94"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 COMMUNISM all capital from the bourgeoisie (the propertied cl ass)... by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property.\" 18 This meant that Marx and his contemporaries had to develop a program that would slowly destroy the rights to private pro perty in the society until one day the working class would own all of the prop erty. This would not require the use of force, just the action of an inc reasingly powerful govern- ment which would steadily expand its role in the af fairs of the society. Marx and Engels wrote the following for the Communi st Party: 19 \"These measures will of course be different in diff erent countries. Neverthe- less, in the most advanced countries the following will be pretty generally applicable: 1. Abolition of property in land and applicati on of all rents of land to public purposes.\" Marx had written elsewhere in the manifesto: \"You a re horrified at our intending to do away with your private property. Pr ecisely so, that is just what we intend.\" 20 So the first plank of the Manifesto was in keeping with the rest of the philosophy of Marx, although this plank only dealt with property in the form of land. \"2. A heavy progressive or graduated income ta x.\" Here Marx adds the income tax as a method of taking property from the \"propertied class\" to give it to the \"working class .\" This plank is in accord with Marx's statement about the obligation the weal thy have to the poor: \"From each according to his ability, to each accord ing to his need.\" Government was to become the great income distribut or. It was to take from the producers (the \"haves,\") and give it to th e non-producers, (the \"have-nots.\") \"3. Abolition of all right of inheritance.\" Not only was the producer of capital goods going to find out that, as his efforts increased his rewards would decrease, but, whatever was left after the government took what it felt was needed for the poo r, could not be left to his heirs. Property was to become only the temporary po ssession of the producer. \"4. Confiscation of the property of all emigr ants and rebels.\" Those who wished to leave the Communist state would have to forfeit their property to those who remained, and those who opposed the govern- ment would have their property confiscated. \"5. Centralization of credit in the hands of the State by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive m onopoly.\" The Communists told Marx to make certain that only the Communists would have the sole power to create inflation. This power would grant them the ability to destroy the private property rights of those citizens who kept their property in the form of cash. 95"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 COMMUNISM \"6. Centralization of the means of communicat ion and transport in the hands of the state.\" The state would restrict the citizen's right to spe ak out against the state by controlling his access to a mass audience, as we ll as control the society's right to freely disburse the goods they produced. \"7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State, the bringing into cultivation of waste l ands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance wit h a com- mon plan.\" The government would own all of the capital goods a nd the state would determine what was to be grown on the land. \"8. Equal liability of all to labor. Establish ment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.\" All capital goods, including the labor force itself , were to belong to the state. An industrial army would be formed, capable of being moved by its commander to whatever area the state felt needed wo rkers, especially in the agricultural area. \"9. Combination of agriculture with manufactur ing industries; gradual abolition of the distinction between town a nd country by a more equable distribution of population over t he country.\" The ultimate capital good, man himself, would lose his ultimate freedom: the right to live where he chose. Possibly Marx envisioned the growth of the labor union as a vehicle to combine \" agricultural and manufacturing industries.\" \"10. Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children's factory labor in its present form. Combi nation of education with industrial production etc., etc.\" The State would assume the responsibility for the e ducation of all of the children in the society. It is presumed that Marx w ould not have tolerated a private school where parents could teach their own children what they felt was appropriate. If the state were the only educato r, it could teach the children whatever it wanted. The ultimate goal of the state would be to set the values of the society through the public school system. It is also presum ed that Marx envisioned the ultimate abolition of the family itself, as the state assumed not only the role of the teacher in the life of the child but th e role of the parent as well. The ten planks of the Communist Manifesto were writ ten in 1848. It is interesting to see just how far these programs have advanced in the American society since that date. 1. Abolition of private property in land: The United States government now owns 33.5 percent of the land of the U.S., completely in violation of the U.S. Constitut ion. 96"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 COMMUNISM Article I grants powers to the Legislative Branch o f the Federal Govern- ment. Section 8 of Article I grants the power: \"To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over such distr ict (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular States and the acceptance of Congress, became the seat of government of the Unit ed States, and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the con sent of the Legislature of the State in which the same shall be, for the erect ion of forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards, and other useful buildings.\" That means that any land owned by the government in excess of Washington D.C. and the necessary military bases is owned in violation of the U.S. Constitution. And the government owns over one-third of the land in the United States. In addition, that land which the government does no t own is controlled through such controls as land use regulations, gove rnmental bureaucratic edicts, zoning laws, etc. Rent controls are not nor mally imposed by the federal government, but by local governments, but t he effects upon private property are the same. The government controls the land and property of its citizens by controlling the prices the property own ers may charge for the rental of their property. (Fascism was defined as c ontrol, but not ownership of the factors of production.) 2. Progressive or graduated income tax: The United States government passed the Graduated I ncome Tax in 1913, after several previous attempts had failed. 3. The Inheritance Tax: The United States government imposed the Inheritanc e Tax upon the American people in 1916. 4. The confiscation of the property of emigrants an d rebels: In 1980, Congress took a giant step towards confisc ation of property of emigrants when it passed H.R. 5691, which makes it a crime to transport or even to attempt to transport \"monetary instruments\" totalling five thousand dollars or more into or out of the country without filing the required reports with the government. 5. Centralization of credit; a national bank: The United States set up its national bank, the Fed eral Reserve, in 1913. 6. Centralization of communication and transport: The United States created the Federal Trade Commiss ion in 1916, and me Federal Communications Commission in 1934. 7. Factors of production owned by the state: Amtrak, the federal government's railway system, is a recent example of the intrusion of the government into those areas tr aditionally operated by the free-enterprise system. However, other governmental intrusions into the 97"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 COMMUNISM affairs of the American businessman take the form o f governmental controls of the factors of production (Fascism) rather than direct ownership. (The 1980 loan to the Chrysler Corporation was a good ex ample.) In addition, government bureaus of every form and shape issue ed icts for the privately owned business to follow. 8. Equal liability to labor: The American government has not moved into this are a as yet, but has moved into the position of being the employer of la st resort through such programs as the Comprehensive Employment and Traini ng Act, the Civilian Conservation Corps, the draft, and a propo sal known as the Universal Military Service, where all of military a ge are obligated to serve their country in some capacity. 9. Forced distribution of the population: Very little has been done in this area of Marxist t hought except in rather isolated instances, such as the call for \"Urban Ren ewal.\" Under this proposal, the government forces people out of low r ent areas in the name of renewing urban decay. Few of these people return to the renewal area after completion of the housing projects. 10. Free education in public schools: The United States government took a giant step, alb eit without constitutional authority, towards controlling Ameri ca's system of education, by funding colleges and universities after Russia o rbited the artificial satellite called Sputnik in 1957. Another step towards this goal occurred in 1980 whe n the Department of Education was established as a separate governme ntal department. Students of Marx have noticed that he wanted the Co mmunists to use both the Graduated Income Tax and the Central Bank as a means of making \"inroads into the property of the bourgeoisie.\" An understanding of how these two instruments of destruction work together will follow in subsequent chapters of this book. To show how close some of the Marxists are in every day life to abolish- ing the right to private property, the communists i n the Democratic Party in Oregon passed a rather revealing platform plank at their annual statewide convention in 1972. It read: \"Land is a common reso urce and should be held in public ownership.\" 21 The Communists are getting closer. 96"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Chapter 10 The Russian Revolution The Russian Revolution of 1917 was started by starv ing Russian workers who were being oppressed by the tyrannical leader of Russia, Czar Nicholas II. This is a one-sentence summary of the official expl anation of the cause of the Communist Revolution. But is there another e xplanation? Is it possible that the Russian workers were being used b y someone else for another reason, just as in the French Revolution of 1789? Perhaps the true cause of the Russian Revolution ca n be traced to a war of competition in the oil industry that started aft er the American Edward L. Drake drilled the first oil well in 1859. Drake was not the one, however, who saw the enormous potential in the oil business for exorbitant profits. John D. Rockefeller was one of the early refiners o f oil, as he started in 1863 with two partners. Rockefeller's interest was not satisfied with just one refinery, however. As author William Hoffman observ ed: \"What he wanted was to be the largest refiner in the world, the onl y refiner in the world.\" 1 By 1872, Rockefeller controlled twenty-five percent of America's 99"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10 THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION refining capacity and by 1879 he controlled ninety- five percent. 2 His goal shifted now from national control to international control. His company, Standard Oil, was supplying ninety percent of Ameri ca's foreign oil sales and America was the sole source of an exportable su rplus. But something was happening to his international market. \"The wal l of Standard's international oil monopoly had been breached with t he opening of Russia's great Baku field on the Caspian Sea. By 1883, a rai lroad had been built to the Black Sea, and the Czar had invited the Nobel broth ers and the Rothschild family to help develop these great oil riches.\" 3 Standard Oil now had an international competitor in the oil business! The Rothschild family was now in a position to comp ete favorably with Standard Oil in the sale of oil in the world market . By 1888, this new oil source had overtaken Standard Oil as the internatio nal seller of crude oil. The development of Russia's oil supply to the point where it could overtake the United States can be illustrated by th e following table: Petroleum Production: Year USA Russia 1860 70,000 tons 1,300 tons 1885 3,120,000 tons 2,000,000 tons 1901 9,920,000 tons 12,170,000 tons The rapid growth of the oil industry led Russia int o the industrialized world. The traditional explanation of Russia's econ omy at this time was that the nation was an agrarian economy, far behind the other European economies. However, during the period of 1907 to 19 13, Russia's increase in its industrial production rate exceeded that of the United States, England, and Germany, long believed to be the industrialized giants of the day. The following is typical of the conclusion of many researchers who have examined this period in history: \"The Russian revol ution of 1917 came not at the end of period of stagnation and decay, but r ather after more than a half- century of the most rapid and comprehensive economi c progess.\" And with this progress came the development of a middle clas s, the enemy of the conspiracy. There are historians who now believe that the Russi an Revolution of 1917 was in truth a revolution insdgated by the Ame rican and European oil interests to wrest control of the Russian oil field s from the Rothschild-Nobel combination. But other forces were at work as well in the Russia n Revolution. After the defeat of Napoleon and the occupation of Paris in 1814 by Russian troops, many Russian aristocrats visited France.

Both lodges enlisted as members many influent ial and wealthy Russian nobles. 4 The secret society had been brought to Russia. In a book entitled Russia 1917, author George Katkov cited the enormous influ ence the secret societies had in the Communist Revolution: \"There is no doubt ... that a widespread net of conspiratorial organizations modeled on free masons' lodges worked for revolution in Russia and played a decisive role in the formation of the first Provisional Government.\" 5 With the arrival of the secret society, the near po werful could conspire to replace the monarchy as a form of government thr ough control over the Provisional Government that replaced the Czar after he abdicated. The conspirators now had two of the three essential par ts of the \"pincers movement\" written about by Jan Kozak. The third part, the \"mob,\" was organized in 1895, w hen Vladimir Ilyich Lenin and nine others, including Leon Trotsky, form ed the Social Demo- cratic Labor Party, the forerunner of the Communist Party. Perhaps the incident that provoked Lenin's hatred o f the Russian monarchy and the Czar occurred in 1881, when his ol der brother was executed for having taken part in the assassination of Czar Alexander II, the grandfather of Nicholas II, the Czar at the time of Lenin's revolution. Lenin's revolutionary career began while he was a s tudent at the University of Kazan, where he became a devotee of K arl Marx. Lenin learned that Marx had anticipated two revolutionary methods for total control of a society: the violent and the non-violent. Marx's ten-plank program discussed in an earlier ch apter constituted Marx's non-violent method of communizing a society. The Russian Communist Party was torn between the ad vocates of both methods. Lenin preferred a violent revolution to ga in control of Russia, and Trotsky preferred the non-violent. The supporters o f Lenin became the majority on the debates on the issue and became kno wn as the Bolsheviks (translated as \"the majority\" in Russian), and the supporters of Trotsky became the minority and were known as the Menshevik s (\"the minority).\" Perhaps the most crucial event in the Russian Revol ution occurred in the spring of 1905, when the British Fabian Society , a non-violent revolu- tionary group, met the Bolsheviks, a violent revolu tionary group, in London, England. It was at this meeting that loans were arranged between the two groups so that the Bolsheviks could start t heir revolution. Joseph Fels, a member of the Fabian Society and a wealthy American soap manufac- turer, loaned the Bolsheviks large sums of money, a s did other members of the Fabians. 6 Arrangements also were made to finance the Japanese government in a 101"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10 THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION war with the Russian government in an attempt to we aken the monarchy so that it would make the task of the Bolsheviks much easier. From New York Jacob Schiff, J.P. Morgan, the First National Bank, and the National City Bank loaned Japan approximately $30,000,000 to atta ck the Russian government from the east. 7 In 1905, with financing from members of the Fabian Society and with the knowledge that American bankers had loaned Japa n money to move against Russia's eastern front, Lenin started his r evolution on May 1, the anniversary of the founding of the Illuminati. But Lenin and his Bolsheviks were not initially suc cessful in their revolution in spite of all of the assistance of the wealthy banking interests and members of the Fabian Society. The Czar exiled Leni n to Switzerland, Trotsky to the United States, and Joseph Stalin to Siberia. The Bolsheviks were at least partially successful i n weakening the monarchy, as the Czar responded to the charges of t he Revolution and instituted a series of reforms. For instance, he re cognized the principle of limited government, proclaimed a set of fundamental laws, and established a national parliament (called the Duma) with a shar e in the law-making process for the people. In other words, the monarch y was changing into a democratic republic. In an extremely puzzling move, the Czar, possibly t he richest man in the world, deposited $400,000,000 in the Chase Bank (th e Rockefeller interests), the National City Bank, Guaranty Bank (the Morgan i nterests,) the Hanover Trust Bank, and the Manufacturers Trust Bank, and $ 80,000,000 in the Rothschild Bank in Paris. It is possible that he re alized that his government was in trouble and he was hoping that his deposits would buy toleration from these interests after their attempt to remove him failed in 1905. The revolution led inexorably on, and on March 15, 1917, the Czar abdicated in favor of a provisional government led ultimately by the Socialist Alexander Kerensky. One of the first acts of this g overnment was to issue amnesty to the exiled Bolsheviks and back to the Ru ssian Revolution came Lenin, Trotsky, and Stalin. Many historians feel that the Kerensky government w as a temporary front for the Bolsheviks, for three important reaso ns: 1. Kerensky was allowed to live after Lenin assumed co ntrol of the government while virtually all the other members of the Provisional Government were butchered in the revolution that fo llowed. 2. Kerensky issued a general amnesty not only for the Bolshevik leaders, but all others exiled since the aborted revolution of 1905. It is estimated that this act freed over 250,000 dedicated revolutionari es. 3. Kerensky himself admitted that the Kerensky governm ent had \"received some support privately from industry in A merica,\" possibly from 102"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10 THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION the same individuals who financed Lenin in 1905. 8 So back came the major Communist revolutionaries to the revolution. Trotsky left New York City on March 27, 1917, on th e S.S. Christiana with 275 other followers on his way to Canada. He a nd his followers were detained in Halifax, Nova Scotia, by the Canadian g overnment, which found $10,000 on his person. This large quantity of money held by Trotsky was indeed a strange amount, as he himself had admi tted that the only money he had received during the years of 1916 and 1917 while in New York was $310 that he later admitted he had distributed among 5 emigrants who were returning to Russia. The subject of Trotsky's $10,000 came up in 1919 du ring a Senate investigating committee's hearings into the subject of Bolshevik propaganda and German money. \"It is quite remarkable that the (Overman) Committee adjourned abruptly before the source of Trotsky's f unds could be placed into the record. When questioning resumed the next day, Trotsky and his $10,000 were no longer of interest.\" 9 Some did know where the money had come from, howeve r, even if officially the United States government did not wan t to know. Congressman Louis McFadden, the Chairman of the House Banking C ommittee, went on record as saying: \"They (the private banking monopo lies) financed Trotsky's mass meetings of discontent and rebellion in New Yo rk. They paid Trotsky's passage from New York to Russia so that he might as sist in the destruction of the Russian empire. They fomented and instigated the Russian Revolu- tion and they placed a large fund of American dolla rs at Trotsky's disposal in one of their branch banks in Sweden.\" 10 The Canadian government, discovering that Trotsky c arried an American passport, questioned the American governme nt as to why they would allow Trotsky to return to Russia when not on ly were Canadian troops fighting the Germans in World War I, but Ame rican troops as well. It followed, according to the Canadian reasoning, t hat if the Russian goverment, led by Trotsky and Lenin, signed a peace treaty with Germany, because Russia was also at war with Germany at the time, it would free German troops at war with Russia to kill American t roops as well as Canadian. It certainly appeared to the Canadians th at it was in America's best interest to keep Russia in the war against Ger many and not assist Trotsky in his desire to overthrow the Czar. Canada's efforts failed, as the Wilson administrati on pressured the Canadian government into releasing Trotsky. Trotsky and his followers sailed as they had intended. Perhaps one of the reasons that the Democratic Pres ident Woodrow Wilson permitted Trotsky to leave Nova Scotia was t hat Charles Crane, of the Westingh ouse Company and Chairman of the Democrati c Finance Commit- 103"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10 THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION tee, was accompanying Trotsky. 11 Lenin also started his return to Russia along with thirty-two other Russian revolutionaries. These activists left Switz erland in an armored train protected by German troops and they journeyed acros s war-torn Germany, This was strange as Germany was at war with Russia, and it was unusual for Lenin and his followers not to be prisoners of war. Their destination was Sweden, where Lenin received something like 22 mill ion marks held for him in a Swedish bank. There are some historians who believe the reason th at Lenin and his fellow Russian revolutionaries received such prefer ential treatment was because the German government and Lenin had reached an agreement to end their war when the Bolsheviks took control of t he government Stalin returned from Siberia, and now the key indiv iduals were in place for the continuation of the revolution. The Bolshev iks replaced the Kerensky government on November 7, 1917. The provisional gov ernment had set November 25 th as the first general election ever h eld in Russia. For the first time in their history, the Russian people would hol d free elections and they could choose Bolshevism should they choose to do so . There was some dissension amongst the Bolsheviks as to whether they should allow the elections to be held as scheduled. Trotsky took the position that they should and his view ultimately prevailed. The people would get the opportunity to choose the form of government they w anted. There were nearly 42 million votes cast, and the Bo lshevik Communists only received thirty percent of the vote. The Bolsh eviks, when the Russian people had a chance to accept or reject Communist l eadership of their government, were rejected by the people by a sevent y to thirty margin. Yet the claim is continuously made that the Russian people rose up and overthrew the Czar because they wished to replace t he monarchy with a Communist government. Another of the interesting charges made by the Bols hevik government is that they had captured the seven members of the Imp erial family: the Czar, the Czarina (the Czar's wife,) the Czarevitch (the Czar' only son,) and their four daughters. The claim was made that all seven h ad been murdered in the basement of the Ipatiev House in Ekaterinburg, Russ ia. The claim continued that the bodies of the Imperial family had been dumped into an abandoned mine near the small town. Yet when various investigators attempted to check this story out, \"n o bodies, bones, skulls, of dental work of members of the Imperial family were ever found.\" 12 Rumors that the family had survived their captivity at Ekaterinburg and had not been murdered started to make the rounds of Europe shortly after the story was told that they had been murdered, but the Bolsheviks continued to deny them, holding to their official position that they were all dead. 104"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10 THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION These rumors were just rumors until a colonel (the Polish equivalent of general) in the Polish Army Intelligence defected t o the United States in 1961. He had supplied the Western countries with the name s of hundreds of Soviet spies safely hidden in Western governments prior to his leaving the Polish government. The charges the colonel made while in Poland had be en tested by the courts of the Western countries, and in each case, the spies he had named were found guilty. The American government tested his in formation as well, and \"... former FBI agent John Norpel testified before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee that, to his knowledge, no in formation (the defector) gave our government ever turned out to be wrong.\" 13 The defector, named Michael Goloniewski, brought ad ditional names of Soviet spies with him when he defected. But ther e was one individual that the colonel named that was never brought to trial. The colonel contended that\"... Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has bee n a Soviet agent and that his involvement with Soviet Intelligence was made t o agencies of our government even before his rise to prominence.\" 14 This charge was detailed in a book by Frank Capell, entitled Henry Kissinger, Soviet Agent, that was published in 1974 . Capell reported: \"that under the name of 'Bor,' and described as an agent of ODRA, (a spy group under the command of a Soviet intelligence general, ) was Sergeant Henry Kissinger, a U.S. Army counter-intelligence interro gator and instructor at the Military Intelligence School....\" 17 This is the charge that Goloniewski made that never got a hearing in an American court. Those charged in Europe with being Soviet spies, in each case, had been tried and convicted, but for some un explained reason, his charges against Kissinger never made it to court. But the story about Goloniewski is even more intere sting. He also claimed that the Imperial family, the Czar of Russia and the rest of his family, had survived the ordeal at Ekaterinb urg and had lived in Europe since 1918. He claimed that they had been ta ken out of Russia in the back of trucks, and then taken by ship to friendly ports where they could live in anonymity. Goloniewski's charge was partially substantiated by an article that appeared in the Detroit Free Press in 1970 that cla imed: \"British government documents recently made public in London indicate t hat President Wood- row Wilson backed a secret mission to Russia in 191 7 which may have resulted in the rescue of Czar Nicholas and his fam ily the following year. The documents... state that the U.S. government placed $75,000 at the disposal of Sir William Wiseman, a partner in the New York b anking house of Kuhn, Loeb & Co.\" 16 The article went on to explain why the Russian Comm unists had 105"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10 THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION agreed to let the Czar and his family escape: \"Ther e is also mounting evidence that the unpublished complete text of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, signed March 3, 1918, contains a guarantee from the Lenin government that 'no harm' will come to the Romanovs, according to r esearchers.\" 17 The treaty, named after the city where it was signe d, was a peace treaty signed between the German and Russian governments t o end their involve- ment against each other in World War I. Many histor ians now believe that the charge in the newspaper article about there bei ng such a secret codicil in this Treaty is correct. But Goloniewski makes one more astonishing charge: he claims to be the Czarevitch, the son of the Czar of Russia. The Colonel's claim was investigated by the American government: \"A number of skull measure- ments and comparison of facial features, ears, rela tive distances between mouth, nose, eyebrow, forehead, etc., have been mad e of Goloniewski and compared with photographs and paintings of the youn g Czarevitch Alexis. In general, they have turned out to be more affirmi tive than not.\" 18 One fact that would certainly improve the Colonel's case that he was the son of the Czar would be some sort of evidence that he had a blood condition similar to the one that the young Czarevitch exhibi ted as a boy. This condition, which reduces the ability of the blood t o coagulate, was called hemophilia by those who knew the young Czarevitch a s a boy, as mat was the state of the medical profession at the time. Goloniewski \"has been tested by Dr. Alexander S. Wi ener, a co- discoverer of the Rh factor in blood, who found tha t the Colonel does indeed suffer from a blood disease, the main feature of wh ich is slow blood coagulation.\" 19 Other tests, on his fingerprints and sole (foot) pr ints, blood tests, dental X-rays, and handwriting tests, also suggest that hi s claim could be true. In fact, the individual who had the colonel tested was Herman Kimsey, the Chief of Research and Analysis of the Central I ntelligence Agency, who, according to sworn testimony, claimed that: \"Michae l Goloniewski (was) in reality the Tsarevich Aleksei, a fact Kimsey and hi s staff personally confirmed....\" 20 The colonel's charges that the Imperial family had survived their capture and reported assassination were in part con firmed in 1977 by another source, when a woman claiming to be Anastasia, the Czarevitch's sister, had her charges certified by a French ear expert. This expert made ear compari- sons between her ears and the known pictures of the young Anastasia. These comparisons, made by one of France's best known for ensic experts, would be admissible in French courts as proof of Anastasia's claims. But the Colonel has had difficulty in proving his c laims in an American court, and few, if any, in government will listen a ny more. Perhaps the 106"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10 THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION reason the Colonel is having difficulty lies in the fact that the Czar left millions of dollars in American and European banks, and that this wealth is today worth billions of dollars. If the Colonel is certified to be the heir to the Czar he would have a good claim on these deposits, money that he has no aversion about saying would be used to destroy Comm unism around the world. The Colonel is no friend of the internationa l bankers who were the recipients of these deposits. (It is interesting that the colonel charges that He rman Kimsey, the C.I.A. official who conducted the tests that certified tha t he was who he claimed to he was murdered in January, 1971, by means of a \"wr ong blood transfusion.\") The Russian people were being conditioned to the fa ct that the Czar was dead and that the revolution had succeeded in repla cing the monarchy with a Communist form of government. The United States, during the revolu- tion, took little or no direct action against the B olsheviks, although it appeared to other nations, especially in Europe, th at the American govern- ment was supporting the Communists. At least that i s the gist of a correspon- dence the American government received from the U.S . legation in Bern, Switzerland, which read: \"... people are asking why the President expresses support of Bolsheviki, in view of rapine, murder an d anarchy of these bands.\" 21 (Rapine is defined as the seizing and carrying away of things by force and plunder.) Just what was the American government supporting? Lenin had answered that question by writing: \"Our p ower does not know liberty or justice. It is entirely established on the destruction of the individual will. We are the masters. Complete indif ference to suffering is our duty. In the fulfillment of our calling, the greate st cruelty is a merit.\" 22 And: \"Though a systematic terror, during which ever y breach of contract, every treason, every lie will be lawful, we will find the way to abase humanity down to the lowest level of existence. Tha t is indispensible to the establishment of our dominance.\" 23 Lenin also declared his philosophical kinship with Karl Marx when he declared on November 8, 1917, just after the Commun ists took over the Russian government: \"The right of private property in land is forever abolished. All land owned by the Church, private pe rsons, by peasants, is taken away without compensation.\" 24 It is interesting that the peasants of Russia, the supposedly landless class that the Russian Communists were causing a revoluti on to assist, lost their land as well. Lenin had lied to the people. He had promised them that the land would be taken away from the landed gentry and give n to them, the \"poor, 107"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10 THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION downtrodden working class.\" Some of the peasants al ready owned land that was taken away by Lenin's decree. The Revolution, with American help, was now complet e: the Bolshev- iks had seized control of the once prosperous Russi an government. One of the first acts of the Bolshevik government i n 1917 was to dissolve the lodges of the Freemasons. But the most insidious activity of the new Communis t government occurred when they signed a peace treaty with Germa ny to end their involvement in World War I, just as the Canadian go vernment had feared. As a result of this peace treaty, the Germans were abl e to move their troops to the western front to kill American and Canadian soldier s. 25 With the war in eastern Europe now over, the secret Communist organizations could start Communist revolutions all over Europe. For instance, the German Communists, calling themselves the German \"Spartacists\" after the Roman slave Spartacus who l ed an uprising against the Roman empire, (or was it because Adam Weishaupt , the founder of the Illuminati, had called himself Spartacus in his dea lings with his fellow Illuminati members) revolted against the German gov ernment. Revolutions were also instigated in Austria and Hun gary, but all of these failed and the traditional method of governme ntal rule prevailed. Life magazine, in its article on revolution, correc tly identified the enemy of these revolutions: \"Their nemesis was Europe's s olid middle class... a class once weakly represented in Russia. Chiefly be cause of it, no Communist Party has been able to seize power in Western Europ e to this day.\" 26 As is the case in every major Communist revolution, the enemy is the middle class, and their elimination becomes the rea son for the revolution. But the American support of the Bolshevik governmen t did not end with the ending of the fighting between the Germans and the Russians President Woodrow Wilson refused Japan's request to enter the revolution against the Bolsheviks in 1919. 27 This effort would have put enormous pressure on the Bolsheviks who would have had troub le raising an army against the Japanese, just like the Czar had in 190 5. The Fabian Society, non-violent Marxists, also assi sted the Bolshevik government later when they pressured the labor unio ns in England: \"The sweeping threat by British trade unions to 'down to ols' in 1920 was instigated by an arch-Fabian Arthur Henderson. This threat eff ectively ended British military intervention in Russia and enabled the Bol sheviks to capture large stores of British-made munitions — a decisive facto r in the survival of Bolshevik armed rule....\" 28 The \"non-violent\" branch of the Conspiracy was now assisting the \"violent,\" even though Lenin himself was warning th e world that his intent was to destroy the free-enterprise system: \"As long as Capitalism (the free 108"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10 THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION enterprise system) and Communism remain, We cannot live in peace. In the end, one or the other will perish.\" 29 Lenin also received assistance from those who suppo sedly had the most to lose in a Communist Russia: the wealthy American \"capitalists\" themselves. The director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New Yor k, William B. Thompson, gave a personal contribution of $1,000,00 0 to the Bolsheviks. Mr. Thompson was also a heavy stockholder in the Chase National Bank, owned by the Rockefeller interests. 30 The Morgan and Rockefeller interests also contribut ed cash to the cause, as did Jacob Schiff, the senior partner of Kuhn, Lo eb and Co., who gave Lenin $20,000,000. Schiff was a partner of Paul War burg, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and a participant at the Jekyl l Island, Georgia, meetings that wrote the Federal Reserve bill that created Am erica's central banking system. In addition to assistance from the Americans, prima rily the banking interests, Lenin also received, according to Alexan der Kerensky, the sum of forty million gold marks (about $5,000,000) from th e German banking interests. 31 While the banking fraternity was financing the Russ ian Revolution, they were also bringing World War I to a close by c ausing the Treaty of Versailles to be signed. President Woodrow Wilson l ed the American delegation to the signing of the treaty, taking alo ng with him, as delegates or assistants to the delegation, his trusted assistant Colonel Edward Mandell House; Thomas Lamont, a partner of J.P. Morgan; Pau l Warburg; and four young visionaries: Allen Dulles, later the head of the Central Intelligence Agency; John Foster Dulles, later the Secretary of State in President Eisenhower's cabinet; Walter Lippmann, later a nati onally syndicated columnist; and Christian Herter, later the Secretar y of State who replaced John Foster Dulles. The German delegation to the signing included Paul Warburg's brother, Max, who was the president of the M.N. War burg and Co., interna- tional bankers, and the individual who assisted Len in in crossing war-torn Germany during his return to Russia from exile in S witzerland. But even with all of the financial assistance given to Lenin by the wealthy \"capitalists,\" the Bolsheviks only controll ed a small percentage of Russia. The Communists now had to consolidate their power and expand it through the remainder of Russia. The strategy utili zed to achieve this goal was forced starvation of the Russian people. The Bolsheviks, in keeping with Lenin's dictum to u tilize terror in their quest for political power, would move into an area, grab all of the food supplies and the livestock, and then inform the pea sants who previously 109"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10 THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION owned these items that they were to be placed on a \"collective farm\" where the property would be owned by the state in the nam e of the people. Those who resisted the imposition of the collective were either starved or murdered, or placed into concentration camps so that they cou ld learn about the merits of collectivism through the teachings of the Bolshe viks. One of the Bolsheviks committing these heinous crim es against the people was Nikita Khrushchev, later to become the l eader of the Russian government. His crimes were documented in a seven p art study conducted by the House Committee on Un-American Activities, in a report entitled The Crimes of Khrushchev. This report concluded that \"K hrushchev... as the No. 1 Communist official in the Moscow area... sent thousands to their death, (and) scores of thousands to hideous slave-l abor camps.\" 52 Obviously, food production dropped when the governm ent took producers off the fields. So the starvation perpetu ated itself to the point where millions of Russian peasants starved all acro ss the nation. It was now important that the Bolshevik government have outside assistance if it was to survive. The American government again filled a very importa nt void in the Russian economy. This time it was Herbert Hoover who \"saved Lenin's dictatorship from popular revolt in the early 1920's. There is furthe r proof that Hoover, then President Harding's Secretary of Commerce, knew U.S . shipments of food, which the American people were told were to save st arving Russians, actually were used to strengthen Bolshevik power. I n his book Herbert Hoover and Famine Relief to Soviet Russia, professo r Benjamin Weissman of Rutgers University revealed that Hoover continue d to send public foodstuffs to Russia long after it was obvious the Bolsheviks were shipping their own food abroad in order to purchase machiner y.\" 33 Because of this American assistance, Lenin and the Bolsheviks were able to take power in the remainder of Russia. They bega n to build \"the Socialist Order.\" This program included the following: 1. Private ownership of land was abolished. 2. Banks were nationalized. 3. Most industrial enterprises were nationalized. 4. The merchant marine was nationalized. 5. The stock market was slowly abolished. 6. The right of inheritance was abolished. 7. Gold was declared a state monopoly. 8. All government debts were declared null and void. 9. The old criminal courts were replaced by revolution ary tribunals in which any citizen could act as judge or lawyer. 10. The old strict marriage and divorce laws were replaced by very lenient civil codes. 110"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10 THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION 11. The church was not abolished, but its lands w ere seized and religious teaching was forbidden in the schools. 54 Lenin, in keeping with Marx's teachings that the st ate should create a central bank and have an exclusive monopoly on the issuance of money took control of the Russian banking system. His first pr iority in this move was to create massive inflation. He \"... used the printing press to destroy the people's savings and redistribute the wealth by sha ring the poverty. In 1921, Communist economist Eugene Preobrazhensky had even dedicated a book to the 'printing press of the People's Commissariat of Finance,' which he described as that 'machine-gun which attacked the b ourgeois regime in its rear—its monetary system — by converting the bourge ois economic law of money circulation into a means of destruction of th at same regime and into a force of financing the revolution.' \" 35 Lenin used the printing press to increase the numbe r of rubles in circulation \"nearly 20,000 times from 1921 to 1923. \" 36 In fact the quantity of rubles issued each month was so staggering, the Com munists weren't even capable of remembering the exact quantity issued. \" In March, 1922, the Commissar of Finance... announced that the issues o f that month alone amounted to either twenty-three of twenty-four tril lions, he wasn't sure which.\" 37 The resulting inflation raised the general index of prices to 16,000 times what it was in 1913. It had its desired effect. The middle class was eliminated as a class in Russia. Now that the local banks had been nationalized, the next step was to create an international bank, which was formed in t he fall of 1922. It was based on a \"syndicate that involved the former Russ ian private bankers and some new investment from German, Swedish, American and British bankers.\" 38 So Lenin now rewarded those who had helped him fina nce the Russian Revolution by allowing them to become part of the i nternational bank he was creating. In fact, the Rockefellers were includ ed in his plans as well. \"In the 1930's the Chase National was one of four Ameri can banks and financial houses to institute relations with the Soviets (in addition to Equitable Trust, Guaranty Trust, and Kuhn Loeb.)\" 39 It was in 1929 that the final piece fell into place . The Russian govern- ment made it a crime for the Russian people to own gold in any form. The people had lost their right to check government's i ntrusions into the money supply by their ability to print increasingly worth less paper money. Now that the middle class had been destroyed as a c lass of people through inflation, the Soviets focused their attent ion on the poor. The starvation continued, even after Lenin died and Sta lin replaced him. In 1930 Stalin began his campaign to confiscate the lands o f the peasant farmers and 111"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10 THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION herd these men and their families into 'collective' or state farms. To crush their spirit, the regime created a man-made famine. Armed squads stripped vast areas of all grain, cattle, and food. More tha n 3.5 million more peasants died in concentration camps. Prominent Bolshevik Ni kolai Bukharin admitted 'we are conducting a mass annihilation of defenseless men together with their wives and children.' \" 40 In 1970, the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee released a study entitled The Human Cost of Soviet Communism which a sserted that at least 21.5 million persons have been executed or have die d in prison camps in the Soviet Union during the past fifty-one years. The a uthor of the report stated that his estimate was conservative and that the rea l figure may have been as high as 45 million. But even this cost in human misery is not considere d too high by certain Americans. President Harry Truman was quoted by aut hor Eldorous L. Dayton in his book Give 'em Hell, Harry as saying: \"Moscow emerged from the dark ages only in 1917. \" 41 So, in summary, Communism was imposed down on the p eople: the people did not rise up and demand Communism. But, e ven with the ample evidence supporting this statement, others still do not choose to believe that this is true. Life magazine, for one, in its series on Revolutions, concluded this about the Russian Revolution of 1917: \"The Rus sian Revolution began spontaneously in an urban insurrection against a fe udal regime....\" 42 Another author, Robert Goldston, in his book The Ru ssian Revolution, stated his opinion thus: \"Revolutions are not consp iracies — they are vast social upheavals as inevitable and self-justifying as earthquakes.\" 43 In fact, four American presidents felt that the pri ce the Russian people paid for Bolshevik \"progress\" was too high and they showed their contempt for the Bolshevik government by refusing to recogni ze them as Russia's government. This American policy lasted until 1933 when President Franklin Roosevelt granted diplomatic recognition t o the Communist government, legitimizing the brutal regime, and in essence approving their methods in achieving control of the Russian governm ent. 112"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 The Cuban Revolution Other countries have shared Russia's \"emergence fro m the dark ages\" by changing their governmental configuration to Commun ism as well. Cuba is one of these \"fortunate\" countries. The typical explanation of the reasons for Cuba's C ommunist experi- ment is that Cuba was a poverty-stricken country be set with internal problems so intense that the people were forced to seek a change in their government. \"There was a general misconception that the events in Cuba were brought about by low standards of living and s ocial inequalities. The facts belie this.\" 1 In fact, Cuba of all of the countries in Latin Amer ica, had a rising standard of living, and the people were moderately prosperous. Cuba was, amongst the Latin American countries: third in percentage of literacy; first in percentage of education; lowest in mortality-rate; second in number of doctors per 1,000 people; third in the number of dentists per 1,000 people; first in the number of cars per person; 113"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11 THE CUBAN REVOLUTION first in the number of TV sets; third in the number of telephones; fourth in wages per employee; and second in per capita income. Cuba in 1958, prior to the government of the Commun ist Fidel Castro, paid its employees an average of $3.00 per hour, wh ich was higher that year than Belgium ($2.70); Denmark ($2.86); France ($1.7 4); West Germany ($2.73); and comparable to the United States ($4.06 ). After the Cuban revolution, the standard of living dropped, as evidenced by these comments gleaned from four recent American magazine articles on Cuba: Anyone can observe the streets recalling that once they were filled with autos and now there are few. 2 Although food items are limited, they are available . Other products are simply not to be had. Such a system of shortages makes a ripe condition for black marketing. 3 No matter how much money a family has, it finds its elf equal before the Cuban rationing system, which includes p ractically all food and consumer goods. Every Cuban has a packet of ration books, one for e ach category. 4 The work hours are long, shortages are real, and th e many activities, freedoms, and possessions that American s consider necessary to happiness are either limited or unavai lable. 5 Since the Revolution, organized religion has marked ly lost power. The greatest change was the takeover of the schools, always a large part of the Catholic Church's activities. 6 An article in the U.S. News and World Report, June 26, 1978, further confirmed the scarcities and shortages in the Cuban \"paradise:\" Food shortages are a way of life in Castro's Cuba. Havana's best restaurants consistently run short of meat and other staples. Because almost everything is owned by the state, Cu bans are enmeshed in endless red tape.... Most workers lack motivation because of low pay. Of ten, four or five persons work on a job that requires only on e. Nobody does a good job. Here in Cuba, you do only what you have to do, and care little about the quality of your work. 7 The author of the book Inside Cuba Today, Fred Ward , was concerned about the dismal record of Cuba, especially after C uba had once been one of the most prosperous countries in Latin America. He interviewed many Cubans and they had difficulty with his simple ques tion: \"No one asked by 114"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11 THE CUBAN REVOLUTION the author in Cuba could answer the basic concern o f any student of Communism: If the system is so successful and desir able, why won't it work without the massive restrictions on individual libe rty?\" 8 The life is so undesirable in Cuba that many have v oted against it with their feet: \"About 800,000 Cubans have emigrated to America since Fidel Castro seized power in Cuba in 1959.\" 9 If the Cuban people knew what they know about the d ismal record of Communism in Cuba, they certainly would not have al lowed their country to go Communist. But the Cubans had the information necessary to determine if Communism had worked anywhere in the w orld prior to 1959, but the country went Communist anyway. The question should be asked, then, just why the country is Communist. The American Ambassador to Cuba during the Communis t Revolu- tion, Earl E. T. Smith, has this to say about the a nswer to that question: \"To the contrary, Castro could not have seized power in Cuba without the aid of the United States. American government agencies and the United States press played a major role in bringing Castro to power. As the U.S. Ambassador to Cuba during the Castro-Communist revolution of 1957 -59, I had first-hand knowledge of the facts which brought about the rise of Fidel Castro. The State Department consistently intervened — positive ly, negatively, and by innuendo — to bring about the downfall of President Fulgencio Batista, thereby making it possible for Fidel Castro to take over the government of Cuba. On January 1, 1959, the government of Cuba fe ll. The United States continued to aid the Castro regime by maintaining t he long-standing subsidy for Cuban sugar exports.\" 10 The question that has long plagued those who suppor ted the guerilla activities of Fidel Castro has been whether or not Castro was a Communist prior to his becoming the leader of the Cuban Commu nist government. The evidence was that Castro was indeed a long-term Communist prior to the commencement of his guerilla activities agai nst the Batista govern- ment and this fact was known to those in the Americ an government who supported his revolution. This conclusion is now a matter of fact, as the evidence of history confirms the fact that Castro h ad been a Communist since his early college days. In 1948 there was an attemp ted Communist takeover in Colombia, South America. Fidel Castro led a stud ent group into a radio station where he grabbed a microphone to announce: \"This is Fidel Castro from Cuba. This is a Communist revolution. The pres ident has been killed. all of the military establishments are now in our h ands. The Navy has capitulated to us, the revolution has been a succes s.\" 11 This statement was heard by William D. Pawley, form er American Ambassador to Brazil and Peru, who heard Castro on his car radio while he was in Bogota, Columbia, during the attempted revol ution. 115"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11 THE CUBAN REVOLUTION Castro fled Colombia and went to the Cuban mountain s, where he started his revolution against the Batista governme nt. This was in December 1956, and Castro had a total of eighty-two follower s. This number soon dwindled to eleven, and by June of 1957 Castro had only thirty guerillas. The claim is constantly made that Castro's revolution w as a popular one, and that the workers of Cuba flocked to assist him. The numb ers just aren't there to support this conclusion. One of the early supporters of Fidel Castro was Her bert Matthews, a reporter for the New York Times, and a member of th e Council on Foreign Relations. 12 On February 25, 1957, Mr. Matthews reported to his readers: \"There is no communism to speak of in Fidel Castro' s movement.\" 13 It was about this time, however, that the U.S. gove rnment learned that Mr. Matthews was incorrect: \"A complete dossier on Castro...and the Communists surrounding Castro, prepared by the G-2 (Intelligence) of the Cuban Army, was hand carried to Washington in 1957 and delivered to Allen Dulles, head of the C.I.A.\" 14 Unfortunately for the Cuban people and ultimately f or the world as well, Allen Dulles, also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, did nothing with this information. Once again, in 1958, official reports of Castro's C ommunist connections were delivered to William Wieland, Latin American S pecialist in the State Department. As a response to these reports, Mr. Wie land requested that the U.S. government cancel all arms shipments to the Cu ban government of Fulgencio Batista. About this time, Castro gave a written interview to Jules DuBois in which he declared: \"I have never been nor am I a Co mmunist....\" 15 Further support for the \"non-Communist\" Castro came from the American Ambassador to Cuba who declared that Batis ta no longer had the support of the U.S. government and that he should l eave Cuba. 16 To show that this statement was true, and that the U.S. government was supporting Castro, Roy Rubottom, the Assistant Secr etary for Latin American Affairs, declared in December, 1958: \"Ther e was no evidence of any organized Communist elements within the Castro move ment or that Senor Castro himself was under Communist influence.\" 17 One who disagreed was Major Pedro Diaz Lanz, head o f Fidel Castro's Air Force. He visited the United States in July of 1959 to proclaim that he had first-hand knowledge that Castro was a Communist. H e went on a nation- wide speaking tour proclaiming this fact, but few w ho could do anything about it were listening. Ambassador Smith gave credibility to the charges of Major Lanz when he reported: \"From the time Castro landed in the pr ovince of Oriente in December, 1956, the State Department received repor ts of probable Commu- 116"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11 THE CUBAN REVOLUTION nist infiltration..... of the 26th of July movement (the name of Castro's guerilla army.)\" 18 Smith placed the blame for Castro's assumption of p ower in Cuba where he felt it should be placed: \"The U.S. govern ment agencies and the U.S. press played a major role in bringing Castro t o power.\" 23 The debate as to whether or not Castro was a Commun ist ended when Castro himself proclaimed the following on December 2, 1961: \"I have been a Communist since my teens.\" 24 Those who had been stating that Castro was not a Co mmunist had been wrong, but the damage had already been done. Castro assumed power in Cuba, and the United States government quickly gran ted diplomatic recognition to his government. The State Department added its assurance of its \"good will\" towards the new government. Castro now had the opportunity to put his Communist ideas to work in Cuba. One of the first steps he took was in May, 19 59, when he passed the Agrarian Reform Law. This Communist program instruc ted the farmers in what products they could grow and what price they c ould charge for them. In addition, Castro passed the Urban Reform Law whi ch cancelled all leases and mortgages, thereby dealing a staggering blow to the middle and upper classes in Cuba. But the position of the United States government wa s changing, at least in the secret confines of the various departments i n charge of such things. President Eisenhower gave the C.I.A. permission to organize a group of Cuban exiles in the United States into an armed for ce trained to return to Cuba and attempt to overthrow the Castro government . Eisenhower placed the head of the C.I.A., Allen Dulles, in charge of the program. Both Dulles and Eisenhower were members of the Council on Forei gn Relations. The C.I.A. developed the plans for the armed invasi on of Cuba, and selected two preliminary invasion sites in 1961: th e Bay of Pigs, and the town of Trinidad, Cuba. The latter had several distinct advantages over the Bay of Pigs: it was 100 miles farther from Havana, the sea t of Castro's power; it had a basically anti-Castro population; it had an airfi eld located nearby, suitable as a site for unloading the troops, ammunition and supplies so vital to the success of the invasion; and the town had one ingre dient necessary should the invasion fail: there was a range of mountains nearb y into which the anti- Castro Cubans could flee. These mountains could hid e the force, enabling them to rally support of other anti-Castro soldiers in a guerilla war against the Castro government. The plans for the invasion were discussed and appro ved by a committee of various officials in the Kennedy administration, even though Mr. Dulles was the official designee as the chief of the opera tion. The members of this committee were: 117"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11 THE CUBAN REVOLUTION Secretary of State Dean Rusk, member of the C.F.R.; Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, member of the C.F.R.; General Lyman Lemnitzer, Chairman of the Joint Chie fs of Staff, member of the C.F.R.; Admiral Arleigh Burke, Chief of Naval Operations; Adolf A. Berle, Jr., Head of the Latin American Tas k Force, member of the C.F.R.; and McGeorge Bundy, Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, member of the C.F.R. 21 It is revealing that five of the six members of thi s committee were members of the Council on Foreign Relations, descri bed by one author as \"The Invisible Government\" of the United States. In addition, President Kennedy, now the President a fter replacing Eisenhower, called a meeting on April 4, 1961, of t he National Security Council in order to have a full-dress debate on the plan. Those attending included: Allen Dulles, member of the C.F.R.; Richard Bissell, member of the C.F.R.; General Lemnitzer, member of the C.F.R.; Mr. Rusk, member of the C.F.R.; Mr. McNamara, member of the C.F.R.; Adolf Berle, member of the C.F.R.; Arthur Schlesinger, member of the C.F.R.; McGeorge Bundy, member of the C.F.R.; Thomas Mann; Paul Nitze, member of the C.F.R.; Douglas Dillon, member of the C.F.R.; and Senator William Fulbright. The invasion force entered Cuba at the Bay of Pigs, the second choice of the two locations, and even though there were some early successes, the invasion failed. In the first few moments, the inva ders held control of approximately 800 square miles, but when Castro's a ir force suddenly appeared to control the skies over the invasion sit e, the invasion was doomed There has been much written on both sides about the question of whether the invading Cubans were promised American air cover. The anti-Castro Cubans were aware of how essential air cover was to the success of the mission and they have taken the posi tion since the invasion that the American government had indeed promised th is protection. The American government's position has basically been t hat no such air cover was promised. In any event, there was no American air cover and t he invasion failed.

It went on to report that the Guat emalan government was training a force to protect Guatemala against a Cub an invasion, but indicated that other Guatemalans were not accepting that explanation: \"Opponents of the Ydigoran Administration (the curr ent Guatemalan president) have insisted that the preparations are for an offensive against the Cuban regime of Premier Fidel Castro and that they are being planned and directed and to a great extent being paid for, by t he United States.\" 28 So all Castro had to do to know about the invasion that was yet to come was to read the New York Times] So the invasion was held on April 16, 1961, and Cas tro's armed forces and air force were victorious. There are several th ings about the invasion that are extremely revealing about how poorly it had bee n planned: l.The Cuban invasion force was told that there were no reefs in the landing area, yet the bottoms of three landing craf t were ripped open by the reefs, hidden by the tide. 2. Without any air support, Castro's air force was abl e to sink two supply ships. Without the needed supplies being bro ught ashore, many of the soldiers on the beaches ran out of ammunition w ithin the first twenty- four hours. 3. The C.I.A. armed the 1,443 man invasion force with weapons requir- ing over thirty different types of ammunition. The guns were purchased in second-hand stores to \"avoid identifying the invadi ng force with the U.S. (government).\" 4. Planned coordination of an underground uprising of anti-Castro Cubans on Cuba were mismanaged and word to over one hundred under- ground organizations was never given. They were not told when the invasion was planned. 5. Radio SWAN, the C.I.A.'s short wave broadcast stati on gave one conflicting and false report after another about up risings all over Cuba, none of which were true. After the Bay of Pigs invasion failed, the Castro g overnment could claim that tiny Communist Cuba had defeated the mighty Un ited States, and U.S. prestige as a result of this failure sunk to a new low in Latin America. The lesson was clear. The powerful United States could not train a force capable of putting an end to Communism in Cuba but, by infe rence, anywhere else in Latin America. And any country needing American assistance in solving their internal battles with Communism had best not ask the United States government to assist. 119"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11 THE CUBAN REVOLUTION One of the American journalists who reported on thi s turn in popular support was Dr. Steuart McBirnie, who toured the ar ea shortly after the Bay of Pigs. He reported that many leaders of the Latin American countries he visited reported that they felt that they couldn't trust the American govern- ment any longer as a protector of their government against Communism. Dr. McBirnie reported these attitudes in America throug h his extensive radio broadcasts and writings, but nothing changed. Cuba returned to the international spotlight once a gain a year later during what has been called \"The Cuban Missile Cris is.\" On October 16, 1962, President John Kennedy called a meeting at the White House because his intelligence sources were a dvising him that the Russian government was placing missiles and atomic weapons in Cuba. Present at that meeting were nineteen others, all k ey members of the Kennedy administration, including his brother, Attorney Gen eral Robert Kennedy. The Central Intelligence Agency made a formal prese ntation to those in attendance by showing them photographs taken at var ious missile sites in Cuba. Robert Kennedy later wrote a book entitled Th irteen Days, in which he commented on those pictures. He wrote: \"I, for o ne, had to take their word for it. I examined the pictures carefully, and what I saw appeared to be no more than the clearing of a field for a farm or the basement of a house. I was relieved to hear later that this was the same react ion of virtually everyone at the meeting including President Kennedy.\" 25 Of the twenty people at the meeting, fifteen were m embers of the Council on Foreign Relations. President Kennedy, apparently after being convinced that he should see missiles in pictures where there were no missiles, decided to take stern measures against the Russian government. He went on television and told the American people that several of the Cuban bases included \"ballistic missiles\" capable of reaching a portion of the Unit ed States. He then called on Premier Khrushchev of Russia to withdraw the \"mi ssiles\" from Cuba. When The New York Times carried the story of Kenned y's speech the next day, their article carried no pictures of either a missile or a missile base. However, the next day, October 24, 1962, they publi shed a picture of a supposed \"missile site\" with what they identified a s \"missiles on launchers.\" The supposed \"missiles\" in the picture were no larg er than an actual pencil dot, but the Times was certain that those dots were \"missiles.\" Whatever the objects were that the Russians had in Cuba, they agreed to remove them on October 28, subject to \"United Natio ns verification.\" 26 The American Navy was actually prepared to board the de parting Russian ships to verify that actual missiles were being removed. But no one actually boarded any Russian ship supposedly carrying missil es.

The media quickly labe lled these objects as \"Soviet missiles.\" 27 The myth that Russia was actually removing missiles has been perpet- uated for many years. As recently as March 29, 1982 , U.S. News and World Report carried a picture of the stern end of a ship moving through the water with a tarpaulin covered object on the deck. The ca ption under the picture read \"Soviet ship removes nuclear missiles from Cub a in 1962 showdown.\" 28 It is not known, because it has never been revealed , just how the American government or the American press knew that there were actual missiles under those tarpaulins, especially since t he government had stated that one of the conditions of their removal was tha t someone other than the Cubans was to actually inspect the Russian ships fo r verification purposes. So only the Russians and the Cubans know for certai n. And they have made no known statement to the effect that the obje cts under the tarpaulins and the little dots on large photographs were actua lly missiles. What they were saying, in essence, was that if the American g overnment wanted to believe that those objects were missiles, they had every right to do so. (It would certainly be foolish for the Cubans and the R ussian to admit that they had actually lied to the people of the world and ha d shipped out wooden crates containing nothing but humid air.) It was later revealed that President Kennedy, as pa rt of the agreement for the Russians to remove the alleged missiles, agreed to remove actual missiles from American bases in Turkey and Italy. In addition to the removal of American missiles, Pr esident Kennedy agreed to another condition. The American governmen t would give assurances to the Russian and Cubans governments th at they would intercede in any invasion of Cuba by anti-Castro fo rces. Anti-Castro Cubans, unaware of this agreement betwe en the Russians and the Americans, were purchasing weapons and ship s in the United States at the time and were making preparations for a coun ter-revolution in Cuba. As they moved towards the Cuban shore, they were st opped by the U.S. Coast Guard and their ships and weapons were taken away. The Castro regime was now being protected from an anti-Castro invasion by the U.S. Coast Guard. There are many who believe that this was indeed the purpose of the \"Cuban missile crisis;\" wooden crates were removed in exchange for an agreement on the part of the American government to do two things: 1. Remove actual strategic missiles from the borders o f Russia, and 2. guarantee that Castro's government would not be sub ject to an anti-Castro invasion.

In addition, those who plan the wars, depressions a nd other human calamities do not want the truth about their planni ng activities known.

The version of history contained in the following c hapters is not the traditionally accepted one, but it is nevertheless true. It has taken detailed research to ferret out this version of history, sif ting through the smoke of the \"smoke filled\" rooms. Reginald McKenna, past Chairman of the Board of the Midlands Bank of England, has written this about the power of the banking establishment: 123"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12 THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION \"I am afraid the ordinary citizen will not like to be told that banks can and do create money.... And they who control the credit of the nation direct the policy of Governments and hold in the hollow of the ir hands the destiny of the people.\" 1 Abraham Lincoln also warned about a banking establi shment, although he chose to call it the \"money power.\" He wrote: \"The money power preys upon the nation in times of peace and c onspires against it in times of adversity. I see in the near future a cris is approaching that... causes me to tremble for the safety of my country. The mon ey power of the country will endeavor to... work... upon the people, until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands, and the republic destroyed.\" 2 Another who warned about the powers of a banking es tablishment was Sir Josiah Stamp, a past President of the Bank of E ngland: \"If you want to remain the slaves of the bankers, and pay the costs of your own slavery, let them continue to create money and control the natio n's credit.\" 3 President James Garfield also voiced a similar opin ion: \"Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is abso lute master of all industry and commerce.\" 4 The goals of these banking establishments was detai led by Dr. Carroll Quigley in his book Tragedy and Hope: \"... the powe rs of financial capitalism had another far-reaching aim, nothing le ss than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able t o dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. The system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences.\" 5 Thomas Jefferson was also aware of the power of the banking establish- ment, and he attempted to warn the American people of the money-debt cycle: \"It is incumbent on every generation to pay its own debts as it goes — a principle which, if acted on, would save one half of the wars of the world.\" And: \"The principle of spending money to be paid by posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on a large scale.\" 6 Another of our founding fathers who feared the bank ing establishment and its ability to create money and debt was Benjam in Franklin, who wrote: \"The Borrower is a Slave to the Lender, and the Deb tor to the Creditor... Preserve your freedom, and maintain your independen ce. Be industrious and free; be frugal and free.\" 7 These warnings are very explicit. Banking establish ments create national debt. National debt makes slaves of those who owe the debt. It becomes important, then, to understand the nature o f banking establish- ments if they have the ability to create such human misery as has beer described by the above cited authors. 124"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12 THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION Bankers who loan to governments all over the world are called \"interna- tional bankers.\" And like all bankers, their succes s in business depends on their ability to have their loans repaid by the bor rower. Just like the local banker, who must secure his loan with some form of collateral, the interna- tional banker is concerned with the debtor pledging something of value, something that could be sold to sadsfy any outstand ing balance owed by the defaulting borrower. A local bank loans money on a house by having the d ebtor pledge the home as collateral. The banker can \"foreclose\" on t he mortgage and become the sole owner should the payments not be made as p romised. The international banker faced a more complex probl em than the local banker, though. What could he secure his loan with when he loaned money to the leader of a government? The head of the gove rnment had one power not shared by the homeowner: the right to \"repudiat e\" the loan. Repudiation is defined as: \"The refusal of a nation al or state govern- ment to pay real or alleged pecuniary obligations.\" The bankers had to develop a strategy by which they could make certain that the government they loaned to did not repudiat e the loan that the bankers made to the governments. The international bankers slowly developed their pl an. It was called \"Balance of Power Politics.\" This meant that the ba nkers loaned to two governments at the same time, affording them the op portunity to play one against the other as a means of forcing one to pay his debts to the banker. The most successful tool of insuring compliance with th e terms of payment was the threat of war: the banker could always threaten the defaulting govern- ment with a war as a means of forcing it to make th eir payments. This act of repossessing the nation would almost always work as the head of govern- ment, anxious to keep his seat of power, would agre e to the terms of the original loan, and continue making his payments. The key to using this tool, however, was making cer tain that both kingdoms were nearly the same size, so that one nat ion would not become so powerful that the direat of a war with a weaker nei ghboring nation would not be sufficient to force it into making its payme nts. In other words, both nations had to be approximatel y the same size and to have nearly the same potential to wage war with the other; if one nation had a larger potential than another, the larger nat ion would act as a direat against the smaller, but the smaller would not act as a direat against the larger. Both had to have the same potential or one would no longer be a threat to the other. With the basic understanding of how international b ankers operate, it is now possible to truly understand the nature of t he recent past. In his book, The Real History of the Rosicrucians, the author Arthur 125"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12 THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION Edward Waite makes this statement: \"Beneath the bro ad tide of human history, there flow the stealthy undercurrents of t he secret societies, which frequently determine in the depths the changes that take place upon the surface.\" 8 With this explanation in mind, a study of the recen t past should start with the American Revolution of 1776. The tradition al historians of the past have explained mat the cause of the Revoluuon was A merica's resistance to \"taxation without representation.\" But this suppose d cause doesn't hold up when measured against the taxadon the English gover nment was imposing upon the Colonists. The tax was less than one perce nt of the nadon's Gross Nadonal Product. And it would seem mat it would tak e more than that to inflame the American people into a full-scale revol uuon against the British government, since the American taxpayers in 1980 we re paying approxi- mately forty percent of their income to the America n government with little direct representadon (for instance, when did the Am erican people directly vote for foreign aid, the space race, welfare, etc. ) without a revoluuon against the American government. Perhaps Mr. Waite is correct. Possibly the \"secret societies\" he mentions were at work in the American colonies prior to the founding of this nation, and the revolution against the English government. Perhaps the beginning of the American Revolution ca n be traced bad to June 24, 1717, when four masonic lodges united i n London, England, to form the Grand Lodge of London. The basic tenet of the new Freemasonry, which up to mat time was generally that of a guild of stone masons and other builders, changed during this uniting of these four lodges. From a guild, Freemasonry became a church, a new religion. It cha nged from a profes- sional Masonry, to a philosophical Masonry: \"The in herent philosophy of Freemasonry implied a belief mat mystic thought and feeling were bound to disappear and to be replaced by a strictly logical and rational era.\" 9 Freemasonry: \"... tried to cooperate with the Churc h so as to be able to work from the inside, rationalize the doctrine of J esus and empty it gradually of its mystic content. Freemasonry hoped to become a friendly and legal heir to Christianity. They considered logic and the rule s of scientific thinking as being the only absolute and permanent element of th e human mind.\" 10 The new Masonry \"... did not defend revelation, dog mas, or faith. Its conviction was scientific and its morality purely s ocial. The new Masonry did not aim to destroy churches, but, with the aid of the progress in ideas, it prepared to replace them.\" 11 This new morality spread to France in 1725, and a f ew years later, in the early 1730's, to the United States, where Lodges of the Freemasons were formed in Philadelphia in 1731, and in Boston in 17 33. 12 One of the well known members of the Philadelphia Lodge was Benjami n Franklin, who 126"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12 THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION joined in 1732.

In 1731, mis St. John Lodge in Philadelphia \"got in touch with the Grand Lodge of London, and the Duke of Norfolk, then Grand Master of English F reemasonry, appointed Grand Master for the Central Colonies. His name was Daniel Coxe. Coxe was the first public man to advise a federation of the colonies...\" 13 Other early members of the Masons in America were G eorge Washing- ton Thomas Jefferson, John Hancock, Paul Revere, Al exander Hamilton, John Marshall, James Madison and Ethan Allen, all w ell known American patriots heavily involved with the American Revolut ion. More recently, at least twelve other American Presi dents have been members of the Masons: Andrew Jackson, James K. Pol k, James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson, James Garfield, William McKinley, T heodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, Warren G. Harding, Franklin Ro osevelt, Harry Truman and Gerald Ford. In addition to the direct influence of the Masons i n the American Revolution, other Masons were also influencing Amer ica in indirect ways. One of these influences started on July 4, 1776, wh en the Continental Congress appointed Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jeffer son, and John Adams to a committee of three to design the Seal of the United States. Two if not all three were members of the Freemasons, an d the seal they designed, especially the reverse side, conceals Masonic symbo ls and secrets. According to the Masons: \"Being on the reverse of the Seal, t his design reveals the 'Hidden Work,' the 'Lost Word' of Ancient Freemason ry. The motif used is the pyramid, for in ancient eras, where Freemasonry originated, the mission was the same as it is today: to do God's will on Ea rth. This labor is unfin- ished; therefore the pyramid on the Seal is not com pleted. Each Brother must contribute his portion, knowing that his work is wa tched over and guided by the All-seeing Eye of God.\" 14 Whatever the Freemasons are, they have stirred a co nstant controversy amongst the various levels of society, ever since t heir founding in 1717. The first formal declaration against this organization came just twenty-one years later, in 1738, when: \"the Roman Catholic Church of ficially condemned Freemasonry... in the form of a Bull issued by Pope Clement XII....\" 15 The condemnations of the Masons have continued sinc e 1738 as: \"No fewer than eight Popes have condemned Freemasonry o n 400 occasions since it was founded in Britain in 1717. The first public ly pronounced ban by Clement XII called the movement 'unprincipled.'\" One of his successors, Pope Leo XXIII, charged the Masons with aiming at the \"overthrow of the whole religious, po litical and social order 127"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12 THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION based on Christian institutions and the establishme nt of a state of things based on pure naturalism.\" 16 One of the more recent stands against the Freemason s came on March 21, 1981, when the Roman Catholic Church again warn ed that \"all Romar Catholics who belong to Masonic lodges risk excommu nication.\" 16 According to the book A New Encyclopaedia of Freema sonry \"the Latin Church... has agreed to regard Freemasonry as... th ose forces which are at work in the world against the work of the Church in that world.\" 17 In any event, \"In the tense times before the Americ an Revolution the secrecy of the Masonic lodges offered the Colonial patriots the opportunity to meet and plan their strategy.\" 18 One of the pre-American Revolutionary events obviou sly planned in secret was the Boston Tea Party where a group of in dividuals, disguised as Indians, dumped boxes of tea into the Boston harbor . The identity of these patriots has not been generally made known, until t he Freemasons them- selves offered this explanation of the event: \"The Boston Tea Party was entirely Masonic, carried out by members of the St. John's Lodge (in Boston during an adjourned meeting.\" 19 This revolutionary act had an almost immediate effe ct in the English Parliament, which passed laws closing the Boston po rt to all trade by sea and allowing the quartering of British troops in Massac husetts. These laws brought a deluge of protests from all of the coloni es in America. There is reason to believe that those who caused th e event were intend- ing to use the English retaliatory activities as th e incidents to unify the American colonies against the English government. A nd the strategy worked. The call to unify the states into a federal governm ent was strong and the Masons were the key to that call. They were the one s who had a nationwide membership, many of whom were well known enough to expect the colonists to listen to their message. In fact, fift y-three of the fifty-six signers of the Declaration of Independence were members of the Masons, 20 as were the majority of the members of the Continental Cong ress. Benjamin Franklin, partly because of his visibility as a member of the Masons, became a key to opening the doors of some o f the European nations often led by fellow Masons. His membership could ga in him critical audiences with other Masons all over Europe and the se contacts were to be used to gain support for the American Revolution. Franklin also understood the true cause of the Amer ican Revolution. He was asked in London once: \"How do you account for t he prosperity in the American colonies?\" Mr. Franklin replied: \"That is simple. It is only b ecause in the colonies we issue our own money. It is called Colonial Scrip t and we issue it in the 128"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12 THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION proper proportion to accommodate trade and commerce .\" 21 In other words, the colonies didn't use their power to create money to create inflation, and as a result the American nati on was becoming prosperous. This situation was to change, however, during the 1 760's when the Bank of England introduced a bill in Parliament mat no c olony could issue its own script. The colonies, according to this legislation , would have to issue bonds and sell them to the Bank, who would men loan them the money they were to use in their colonies. America's money was to be based upon borrowed debt. The colonies would have to pay interest for t he privilege of carrying their own money. This action caused great unemployment when put into effect as the Bank of England only allowed the colonies to borrow one-half of the quantity of money previously in circulation. 22 Franklin and others realized this, and Franklin is on record as saying: \"The col onies would gladly have borne the little tax on tea and other matters had i t not been that England took away from the colonies their money, which created u nemployment and dissatisfaction.\" 23 And in a quote attributed to him, he said: \"The ref usal of King George III to allow the colonies to operate an honest colo nial money system, which freed the ordinary man from the clutches of the mon ey manipulators, was probably the prime cause of the revolution.\" Franklin acknowledged that the cause of the Revolut ion was the resistance of the colonies to the idea of borrowed money, resulting in debt and inflation as well as interest payments, and not \"taxation without representation,\" as is commonly believed. One of the countries visited by the Mason Benjamin Franklin was France. In January of 1774, Franklin was dealing wi th certain Masonic leaders to buy guns for the American colonies. This transaction was made with the knowledge and support of the French Foreig n Minister Vergennes, a fellow Mason. In addition, the French government, again with the support of Ver- gennes, was loaning the American colonies a total o f three million livres. Another nation was also involving itself, although indirectly, in the American Revolution: \"At the birth of the American nation, during the Revolutionary War, Empress Catherine the Great of R ussia, refused the plea of King George III of England to send 20,000 Russia n Cossacks to crush the rebellion of the colonies... which... helped the co lonies to survive.\" 24 Russia, without a central bank controlling its deci sions, had assisted the United States by refusing to send troops against th e struggling colonies. Russia was exhibiting her friendship for the United States for the first time and would assist the United States once again in th e Civil War, as will be shown in a later chapter. 129"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12 THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION It is interesting to discover why the two major lea ders in the American Revolution of England were fellow Masons Benjamin F ranklin and George Washington. \"When America needed a national army an d a national diplomat, it turned to Brother George Washington as the only officer who not only had national fame but who, due to his Maso nic application, had friends in all parts of the Continent. At the cruci al moment when America on the verge of defeat, needed foreign alliances, i t turned to Brother Franklin — the only American who had world-wide fam e and who, due to Masonry, had friends all over the world.\" 25 Washington in turn surrounded himself with fellow M asons: \"All the staff officers Washington trusted were Masons, and all the leading generals of the Army were Masons.\" 26 These decisions by Washington paid an additional bo nus, as it is likely that Washington himself had decided to staff his ar mies with fellow Masons for this reason: \"It seems even likely that the unf orgettable and mysterious laxness of certain English military campaigns in Am erica, particularly those of the Howe brothers, (one an admiral and the other a general) was deliberate and due to the Masonic desire of the English Genera l to reach a peaceful settlement and shed as little blood as possible.\" 27 In other words, Washington selected fellow Masons a s his general staff because he knew that the commanding general of the English troops was also a Mason. The fact that a Mason is duty bound not to kill a fellow Mason if he knows that his opponent is also a Mason, has mad e it extremely difficult for many non-Mason generals to get their troops to perform well in battle. To show his public support for the Masons, after th e American army retook the city of Philadelphia from the British ar my on December 27, 1778, General George Washington \"his sword at his side, i n full Masonic attire, and insignia of the Brotherhood, marched at the hea d of a solemn procession of three hundred brethren through the streets of Ph iladelphia... This was the greatest Masonic parade that had ever been seen in the New World.\" 28 But even with the popular support of the Masons, Wa shington and the American people had to pay for the costs of the War against the British. In 1775, the Continental Congress voted to issue paper currency (Fiat Money) to finance the war. This money was not borrowed from a ny banking establish- ment. It was simply printed as a means of paying th e government's expenses in the war. Therefore, it contained no provision fo r the paying of interest to a group of bankers who had created it out of nothin g. Most of the independent state legislatures, as a si gn of good faidi and as a recognition that the central government had saved the American people countless millions of dollars in interest payments, passed laws requiring citizens to accept the Continental currency as lega l tender.

The merchants of America were accepting these dolla rs at a rate of 2.5 cents on the dollar, and for less than half a penny just two years later. Inflation had taken its toll in the value of the cu rrency. It had become nearly worthless when measured against real money, a hard metal. The lowest trading price of the \"Continental\" occurred at the end of the war, when it took 500 paper dollars in exchange for one silver d ollar. It is now apparent why the American people coined t he phrase \"not worth a Continental.'' Inflation had occurred once again, in accordance with the economic law that works in every case where the quantity of money, unbacked by gold or silver, is increased rapidly. It was during this time that a vital disagreement a mongst the leading American patriots was coming to the surface. The issue was whether or not the American governmen t should establish a central bank. Thomas Jefferson was oppo sed to the establishment of any such bank and Alexander Hamilton was in favo r. Jefferson supported his position by stating: \"If the American people ev er allow private banks to control the issue of currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of their property until their children will wake up ho meless on the continent their fathers conquered.\" 29 It was Hamilton's proposal that the United States c reate the Bank of the United States, a profit making institution to be pr ivately owned and to enjoy special access to the public funds. The bank would have the legal power to create money out of nothing, and loan it, at intere st, to the government. Hamilton felt that the majority of the people could n't handle their own money. He proposed that these matters would be best left up to the wealthy. He wrote: \"No society could succeed which did not u nite the interest and credit of rich individuals with those of the state. All communities divide themselves into the few and the many. The first are rich and well-born, the other the mass of the people. The people are turbul ent and changing; they seldom judge or determine right.\" 30 Jefferson responded with his charge that banking es tablishments, when given the ability to inflate and deflate the quanti ty of money at will, lend themselves to a continuing series of oppressions of the people. He wrote: \"Single acts of tyranny may be ascribed to the acci dental opinion of a day; but a series of oppressions, begun at a distinguished p eriod, and pursued unalterably through every change of ministry, too p lainly prove a deliberate, systematical plan of reducing us to slavery.\" 31 The conspiracy that Jefferson saw forming in the Un ited States was a 131"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12 THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION group called the Jacobins, created by the French Br anch of the Illuminati. 32 Today's dictionary defines the Jacobins as \"one of a society of radical democrats in France during the revolution of 1789; hence a plotter against an existing government.\" John Robison in his classic work on the Illuminati, titled Proofs of a Conspiracy, said this about the Jacobins: \"The inte lligent saw in the open system of the Jacobins the hidden system of the Ill uminati.\" 33 (This group will play an important part in the Civi l War of 1861-65 as will be covered in a later chapter.) Unfortunately for the United States, President Geor ge Washington appointed Alexander Hamilton as the Secretary of th e Treasury in 1788. Three years later, in 1791, the United States gover nment granted a twenty, year charter to its first national bank, called the First Bank of the United States. This charter was to expire in 1811, and the n the American citizens were to have a chance to discuss the Bank and its m erits before it could be re- chartered. Jefferson quietly joined in the discussion about th e First Bank, stating that Congress did not have any Constitutional autho rity to charter such an institution and that the Bank was therefore a non-e ntity. He based his arguments on Article I, Section 8, of the Constitut ion. This section reads: \"The Congress shall have the power to coin money, r egulate the value thereof...\" Jefferson argued that Congress had no audiority to delegate the money power to anodier agency, certainly not to an agency that was privately owned and had not only the power to coin money but to pri nt it and then loan it back to the government. However, such questions abo ut the constitutional- ity of the Bank were, unfortunately, just questions , and the Bank survived until 1811, when President James Monroe let the cha rter lapse. Even with the pressure on the government from the B ank to borrow to pay off the debts of the American revolution, Presi dents Jefferson and Monroe paid off all of the debts of the United Stat es Government without their assistance. But the pressure to re-charter the Bank started the next year when England started the War of 1812 against the United States. This war was intended to force the United States into a position of needing a central bank to pay for the costs of the war, thus creating inte rest payments and debt. It was hoped by the English bankers that the Americans wou ld re-charter the First National Bank, or create another under a different name. Two Americans, Henry Clay and John C Calhoun, were early suppor- ters of the American government's entry into the Wa r of 1812. They were also the main supporters of creating another bank under another name: The Second Bank of the United States. 132"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12 THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION The war with England proved expensive, and raised t he debt of the United States from $45 million to $127 million. Some Americans saw the war as the workings of a con spiracy. One, for instance, was the president of Harvard, Joseph Will ard, who made what is now a famous speech declaring the involvement of th e secret Illuminati in the events of the day. He said, on July 4, 1812: \"T here is sufficient evidence that a number of societies of the Illuminati have b een established in this land, They are doubtless striving to secredy undermine al l our ancient institu- tions, civil and sacred. These societies are clearl y leagued with those of the same order in Europe. The enemies of all order are seeking our ruin. Should infidelity generally prevail, our independence woul d fall of course. Our republican government would be annihialated...\" Unfortunately, the American people did not heed his warnings and the conspiracy continued its deadly work in the United States. The pressure to find a way to pay the costs of the War of 1812 through the re-chartering of a national bank continued, and in 1816, the Second Bank of the United States was chartered with a twenty-ye ar charter. This bank was given the ability to loan the government $60 millio n The money was created out of nothing, evidenced by bonds, and loaned to t he federal government The Second Bank now had the ability, as one writer put it, \"to control the entire fiscal structure of the country... 34 In 1816, Thomas Jefferson once again tried to warn the American people, this time in a letter to John Taylor: I believe that banking institutions are more danger ous to our liberties than standing armies. Already they have raised up a money aristocracy tha t has set the Government at defiance. The issuing power should be taken from the banks an d restored to the Government, to whom it properly bel ongs. 35 It didn't take long for the Bank to exercise its po wers. \"The inflationary policies of the Second United States Bank in the fi rst few years after 1812 caused banks to spread fairly discriminately throug h Kentucky, Tennessee, and other Western States. Then, with the depression of 1819, the big Bank, reversing its policy, began a peremptory contractio n. Specie flowed out of the West, leaving in its wake a trail of bankruptcies a nd a large debtor popula- tion unable to meet its obligations.\"' 36 The Bank was using its powers to increase and decre ase the money supply to cause, first inflation, and then deflatio n. This cycle was of benefit to the bankers who were able to repossess large qua ntities of property at a fraction of its real value.

But one thing that happened was pleasing to the ban kers. The Bank was declared constitutional in 1819 by Supreme Court Ju stice John Marshall, a member of the Masons, in the case of McCulloch vs. Maryland. 37 He decreed that Congress had the implied power to c reate the Bank of the United States. There was no specific power granted to Congress to create the Bank, so the Constitution was stretched to fit the circumsta nces by declaring that the Constitution had some mysterious \"implied power\" th at enabled it to do whatever the \"stretchers\" wanted. The arguments of Jefferson had not been heeded. Hamilton had won. The next relevant step in America's history occurre d in 1826 when a member of the Freemasons, Captain William Morgan, p ublished a book entitled: Illustrations of Masonry By One of the Fr aternity Who Has Devoted Thirty Years to the Subject; Captain W. Morgan's Ex position of Freemasony. This rather thin book of only 110 pages contained t he \"secrets\" of the Freemasons, or as Captain Morgan put it: \"... the L odge—room Signs, Grips, and Masonic Emblems.\" Less than a month after the book appeared, Captain Morgan was: \"carried away... by a number of Freemasons... \" 38 and murdered. It was alleged, according to a book entitled The Re volutionary Age of Andrew Jackson, by Robert Remini, that: \"... the Ma sonic Order had arranged his abduction and probable murder.\" 39 The charge that Morgan was killed because he had br oken his pledge of secrecy in all Masonic affairs by publishing a book detailing all of the secrets of the Order was certainly in keeping with an under standing of the Masonic ritual. Captain Morgan detailed the procedures of t he ritual of becoming a Mason wherein the prospective Mason is caused a sli ght pain and then warned: \"As this is a torture to your flesh, so may it ever be to your mind and conscience if ever you should attempt to reveal the secrets of Masonry unlawfully.\" 40 This single act by Captain Morgan was to have major ramifications in the years to come, especially in the Presidential e lection of 1832. This election was the second one for Andrew Jackson who had been elected first in 1828, primarily because he was in opposition to the Secon d Bank of the United States. Jackson was on record as saying: \"I was one of those who do not believe that a national bank is a national blessing , but radier a curse to a republic; inasmuch as it is calculated to raise aro und the administration a moneyed aristocracy dangerous to the liberties of t he country.\" 41 The election of 1832 was a crucial one to the Bank, because the charter was to be renewed during the term of the president elected that year. 134"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12 THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION Jackson promised the American people: \"The Federal Constitution must be obeyed, state rights preserved, our nationa l debt must be paid, direct taxes and loans avoided, and the Federal Union pres erved.\" (Is is revealing that even men, in 1832, Jackson wa s concerned about the preservation of the Union, the issue that would sup posedly cause the Civil War several years away.) He continued: \"These are the objects I have in view , and regardless of all consequences, will carry into effect.\" 42 It was prior to this election, in 1830, that a new political party was formed, called the Anti-Mason party, primarily as a warning to the American people about the menace of the Masons in the countr y and as a response to the murdering of Captain Morgan. 45 According to Mackey's Encyclopaedia, the new party was organized: \"... to put down the M asonic Institution as subversive of good government...\" 46 The Anti-Masons met on September 11 in Philadelphia , where dele- gates from eleven states met to \"denounce the Freem asonic Order and to call upon their countrymen to join a political crusade t o save the nation from subversion and tyranny at the hands of the Masons.\" 45 (One of the delegates to that convention was Willia m Seward from New York, who later became Secretary of State under Pre sident Abraham Lincoln.) Another of those who became concerned about the Mas ons was John Quincy Adams, president from 1825 to 1829. He publi shed a series of letters \"abusive of Freemasonry, directed to leading politi cians, and published in the public journals from 1831 to 1833. \" 46 But the main issue of the 1832 election was the ren ewal of the charter of the Second Bank of the United States. The President of this organization, Nicholas Biddle, \"decided to ask Congress for a ren ewal of the Bank's charter in 1832, four years before its current charter expi red.\" 47 The strategy behind Biddle's move was simple: \"... since Jackson was seeking re-election, he might see it to his advanta ge not to allow the matter to become an issue and thus permit the Bank to have its recharter.\" 48 Henry Clay, later to become the Republican candidat e for the presid- ency against Jackson, and his colleague Daniel Webs ter took the lead in guiding the re-chartering bill through the Congress . They were not to be disappointed as the bill passed the Senate by a vot e of 28 to 20 and the House by a vote of 107 to 85. But President Jackson had t he last opportunity to act on the Bill and he vetoed it on July 10, 1832. In h is veto, Jackson again warned the American people by saying: It is regretted that the rich and powerful too ofte n bend the acts of governments to their selfish purposes.

Jackson, who ran on the basic platform of \"Bank and no Jacks on or No Bank and Jackson,\" faced great opposition, especially in the press of the United States, \"largely because of advertising pressure.\" 52 This meant that there were elements inside the busi ness community which had something to gain by the re-chartering of the Bank. The only ones, apparently, who did not favor the re -chartering were the American people, who responded by re-electing Andre w Jackson by the following vote: Candidate Percentage of total votes cast Jackson 55 percent Clay 37 percent the Anti-Masons 8 percent That meant that approximately 2 out of every 3 vote rs, those who voted for either Jackson or the Anti-Masons, voted agains t the rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States. (An interesting f ootnote to history is the fact that the Anti-Masons actually carried the stat e of Vermont and thereby received its votes in the Electoral College.) After the election, President Jackson ordered Biddl e to withdraw government funds on deposit in the Bank, and Biddle refused.

Ridd le's order was so sudden and its financial effect so devasting, that it pitc hed the country into an economic panic.

The people were right. The y wanted no part of a banking establishment and they were being punished for their votes against it. Biddle reduced the amount of loans outstanding betw een August 1, 1833, and November 1,1834, by $18,000,000 and for t he next five months, they were reduced by almost $14,500,000. Then Biddle rev ersed himself and forced the banks to increase the quantity of money from $5 2,000,000 on January 1, 1833, to $108,000,000 a year later, and to $120,000 ,000 a year after that. Biddle was \"in fact embarked on the campaign the ra dicals above all feared: the deliberate creation of a panic in order to blackmail the govern- ment into re-chartering the Bank.\" He was quoted as saying \"Nothing but the evidence of suffering abroad will produce any e ffect in Congress... My own course is decided—all other Banks and all the m erchants may break, but the Bank of the United States shall not break.\" 54 And of course, the contraction and expansion cycle caused the types of economic problems that Biddle had anticipated. \"Bus inesses failed, men were thrown out of work, money was unobtainable.\" 54 President Jackson saw through Biddle's activities a nd once again warned the American people: \"The bold effort the pr esent bank had made to control the Government, the distress it had wantonl y produced... are but premonitions of the fate that awaits the American p eople should they be deluded into a perpetuation of this institution, or the establishment of another like it\" 55 Jackson not only saw that Biddle's efforts would de stroy the economy of the United States, he also felt that Europe would s uffer as well. But his real fears were that the Bank constituted a threat to hi s very existence. He told his Vice President, Martin Van Buren, \"The Bank, Mr. Va n Buren, is trying to kill me. But I will kill it\" 56 It is not certain whether Jackson meant that the Ba nk was trying to destroy his political career or to murder him, but on January 30, 1835, a would-be assassin named Richard Lawrence stepped in to his path and fired two pistols at close range at him. Both pistols mis fired, and President Jackson was not hurt. Lawrence later claimed that h e had been \"in touch with the powers in Europe, which had promised to in tervene if any attempt was made to punish him.\" 57 In addition to being the subject of the first presi dential assassination attempt in the United States, President Jackson was made the subject of the 137"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12 THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION first censure of a President.

He said: \"So gl aring were the abuses and corruptions of the Bank. . . so palpable i ts design by its money and power to control the government and change its character...\" 59 Someone had attempted to control the government by removing him from the presidency. The Senate of 1837 later reversed this action by vo dng to expunge the censure by a vote of 24 to 19. Even with all of the toils and tribulations of the period, Jackson was able to completely liquidate the national debt during hi s eight years in office.

So the Bank's charter expired in 1836 and, for the next 24 years, until the Civil War started in 1861, the United States had no central bank.

The brothers could finance both sides of the conflict thereby insuring not only that the debtor would pay its debts but that enormous fortunes woul d be made in the financing of the war. This power was visualized by Meyer Rodischild when he summarized the strategy thus: \"Permit me to control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws.\" 2 One of the early events that solidified the Rothsch ild control of the English government was the battle of Waterloo in Ju ne, 1815. The Rothschilds had created a system of Rothschild couriers in Europe so that important information could be exchanged am ongst the five brothers. The sign mat idendfied the messengers as being couriers for the Rodischild family was a red pouch that they carried . This pouch enabled them to cross national borders with impunity, as mo st European nations had instructed their guards that the pouch carrier was not to be detained, even if mat nadon was at war with the nadon represented by the pouch carrier. This method ensured that the Rothschild family had immediate informadon about the major events in Europe, even b efore the rulers of the countries involved. This device was also known to t he other banking families in Europe and the Rothschild access to quick inform ation often gave them an early advantage in the market place. England was at war with France, and the battle of W aterloo was to be the deciding battle in this war. If Napoleon, the comma nding general of the French forces, defeated Wellington, the commanding general of the English forces, there was little left to deter him from con trolling all of Europe. The other bankers around London knew of the significanc e of this battle and looked to Nathan Rodischild for advance informadon as to the outcome, because the bankers knew of the promptness of Roths child's courier system. Nathan was seen in the corner of the London bond ma rket looking exceedingly glum, and this was interpreted by the b ankers as meaning that Nadian knew who had won the Battle of Waterloo: Fra nce and Napoleon had defeated Wellington and England. At least that was what the English bankers thought, and because they felt that their n adon had lost, they started selling the government bonds that they owned. And as always, when large quantides of bonds are so ld at the same time, their price drops. And the more that the price fell , the more gloomy Nathan looked. But unknownst to the English bond holders, Nathan's agents were buying English bonds, and he was able by this metho d to acquire large quantities of these bonds at a small percentage of their true value.

After the demise of the Second Bank of the United S tates, the state banks those chartered by the various states in the Union, operated the banking system of the United States and issued all of the m oney. Almost exclusively this money was backed by gold, not by debt and pape r money. However, the financial position of the federal gove rnment had been slowly deteriorating: \"At the outbreak of the war t he United States Treasury was in greater shambles than Fort Sumter. Southern banks had been quietly withdrawing large amounts of funds on deposit in th e North. When Lincoln took office, he found his Treasury almost empty.\" 4 The Civil War started in 1837, the year after the c harter of the Second Bank had expired, when the Rothschild family sent o ne of their representa- tives to the United States. His name was August Bel mont, and he arrived during the panic of 1837. He quickly made his prese nce felt by buying government bonds. His success and prosperity soon l ed him to the White House, where he became the \"financial advisor to th e President of the United States.\" 5 Another of the pieces of this enormous puzzle fell into place in 1854 when a secret organization known as the Knights of the Golden Circle was formed by George W. L. Bickley, 6 who \"declared that he had created the fateful war of 1861 with an organization that had e ngineered and spread secession.\" 7 Another of the leading characters in the story of t he Civil War was J.P. Morgan, later to become one of America's most wealt hy and influential industrialists and bankers. Mr. Morgan went to Euro pe in 1856 to study at the University of Gottingen in Germany. It is not incon ceivable that one of the people he met while in college was Karl Marx, who w as active during this time writing and publicizing his ideas about Commun ism, since Marx was in and out of Germany on a regular basis. In any event, it was during this time that the Euro pean bankers began plotting the Civil War. \"According to John Reeves, in an authorized biography entitled The Rothschilds, the Financial R ulers of Nations, a pivotal meeting took place in London, in 1857. It w as at this meeting mat the International Banking Syndicate decided that (in Am erica) the North was to be pitted against the South under the old principle of 'divide and conquer.' This amazing agreement was corroborated by MacKenzi e in his historical research entitled The Nineteenth Century.\" 8 The plotters realized that once again the American people would not accept a national bank without a reason for having one, and once again the plotters decided upon a war. Wars are costly, and t hey force governments into a position where they must borrow money to pay for them, and the decision was made once again to force the United States into a war so that it would 152"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 THE CIVIL WAR have to deal with the issue of how to pay for its c osts. But the plotters had a difficult problem: what nati on could they induce to fight against the United States government? The United States was too powerful, and no country, or combinations of countr ies, could match them in a \"balance of power\" showdown. Canada to the nor th and Mexico to the south were not strong enough and couldn't raise an army adequate for the anticipated conflict, so they were discounted. Engl and and France were 3,000 miles away and across a huge ocean that made the su pplying of an invading army nearly impossible. And Russia had no central b ank so the bankers had no control over that nation. So the bankers made the decision to divide the Unit ed States into two parts, thereby creating an enemy for the government of the United States to war against. The bankers first had to locate an issue to use in causing the southern states to secede from the United States. The issue of slavery was ideal. Next the bankers had to create an organization that could promote secession amongst the southern states so that they would divide themselves away from the federal government. The Knights of the Golden Circle was created for th at purpose. Abra- ham Lincoln began to see the drama unfold as he was campaigning for the Presidency in 1860. He saw the war as an attempt to split the Union, not over the issue of slavery, but just for the pure sake of splitting the Union. He wrote: \"I have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sendments embodied in the Declaration of Independen ce. If it (the Union) cannot be saved without giving up that principle, I was about to say I would rather be assassinated on this spot than surrender it.\" 9 So many of his fellow Americans also saw the war as an attempt to split the Union that \"it was not uncommon for men to decl are that they would resign their officer's commission if the war for th e Union was perverted into an attack on slavery.\" 10 Curiously, Mr. Lincoln started having thoughts abou t his own assassi- nation during the 1860 convention. He went upstairs and, exhausted by repressed excite ment, he lay down on the couch in Mrs. Lincoln's sitting roo m. While lying there he was disturbed to see in the mi rror two images of himself which were alike, except that one was not so clear as the other. The double reflection awakened the pr imitive vein in the superstition always present in him. He rose and lay down again to see if the paler shadow would vanish, but he saw it once more.... The next morning... he went home and reclined on th e couch 153"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 THE CIVIL WAR to see if there was not something wrong with the mi rror itself. He was reassured to find it played the same trick. Whe n he tried to show it to Mrs. Lincoln, however, the second reflec tion failed to appear. Mrs. Lincoln took it as a sign that he was to have two terms in the Presidency, but she feared the paleness of one of the figures signified that he would not live through the second term. 'I am sure,' he said to his partner once, 'I shall meet with some terrible end...' 11 The Knights of the Golden Circle were successful in spreading the message of secession amongst the various Southern s tates. As each state withdrew from the United States, it left independen tly of the others. The withdrawing states then formed a Confederation of S tates, as separate and independent entities. The independence of each stat e was written into the Southern Constitution: \"We, the people of the Confe derate States, each state acting for itself, and in its sovereign and indepen dent character...\" 12 This action was significant because, should the Sou th win the war, each state could withdraw from the confederation, re-est ablish its sovereign nature and set up its own central bank. The souther n states could then have a series of European-controlled banks, the Bank of Georgia, the Bank of South Carolina, etc., and then any two could have a series of wars, such as in Europe for centuries, in a perpetual game of Balanc e of Power politics. It would be a successful method of insuring that large profits could be made on the loaning of money to the states involved. President Lincoln saw the problem developing, and w as fortunate that the government of Russia was willing to assist his government in the event of a war with England and France. \"While still Pres ident-elect, he (Lincoln) had been informed by the Russian minister to the Un ited States that his country was willing to aid the Washington governmen t should it be menaced by England and France.\" 13 Eleven southern states seceded from the Union to fo rm the Confederacy. But in a rather enigmatic move, the flag adopted by the Confederacy had thirteen stars on it. As mentioned before, the numb er thirteen has signifi- cance to the Freemasons. The South started the Civil War on April 12,1861, w hen they fired upon Fort Sumter, a Northern fort in South Carolina. One of the members of the Knights of the Golden Cir cle was the well known bandit Jesse James, and it was Jesse's father , George James, a Captain in the Southern Army, who fired the first shot at t he fort. Abraham Lincoln, now President of the Northern Stat es, once again reported to the American people that the war was a result of conspiratorial forces at work in the South. He told the North that : \"combinations too 154"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 THE CIVIL WAR powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary machinery of peacetime govern- ment had assumed control of various Soudiern states .\" 14 Lincoln, and later the Russian government, saw that England and France were aligning themselves against the North o n the side of the South, and immediately issued orders for a sea blockade of the Southern states to prevent these two nations from using the seas to se nd supplies to the South. The Russian minister to the United States also saw this alignment and he advised his government in April, 1861, that: \"En gland will take advantage of the first opportunity to recognize the seceded s tates and that France will follow her.\" 15 (It is interesting that two of the Rothschild brot hers had banks in England and France.) The Russian foreign minister instructed his America n minister in Washington in July, 1861, \"to assure the American n ation that it could assume 'the most cordial sympathy on the part of ou r August Master (the Czar of Russia) during the serious crisis which it is passing through at the present.' \" 16 Lincoln was receiving great pressure from certain o f the banking establishment to float interest-bearing loans to pa y the costs of the war. Salmon P. Chase, after whom the Chase Manhatten Ban k, owned by the Rockefeller interests, is named, and Lincoln's Secr etary of the Treasury during the Civil War, \"threatened the (rest of the) bankers that, if they did not accept the bonds he was issuing, he would flood the country with circulating notes, even if it should take a thousand dollars of such currency to buy a breakfast.\" 17 So Abraham Lincoln decided not to borrow money from the bankers nor to create interest bearing money by creating a national bank that would loan the government the needed money by printing la rge quantities of paper money. Lincoln issued the \"Greenback\" in February, 1862. This money was not only unbacked by gold, but was debt free. Lincoln was playing a deadly game. He had crossed t he international bankers. The war was being fought to force the Unit ed States into a position of having to create a national bank, run independen tly by the European bankers, and Lincoln had turned his back on them by issuing his own Fiat Money. The international bankers also out-manuevered Linco ln, at least to a degree, when on August 5,1861, they induced Congres s, mostly at the urging of Secretary of the Treasury Chase, to pass an inco me tax. They imposed \"a three-percent federal income tax. This was supersed ed almost at once by an act of March, 1862, signed in July, while maintaini ng a three-percent tax on income below $10,000, increased the rate to five pe rcent above that level.\" 18 It was a graduated income tax, just as proposed by Karl Marx just thirteen years before. 155"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 THE CIVIL WAR England and France now moved to increase the pressu re on Lincoln government. On November 8, 1861, England \"dispatche d 8,000 troops to Canada as tangible proof that she meant business\" 19 in supporting the South. France marched troops into Mexico after land ing them on the coast and imposing their choice of rulers, the emperor Ma ximillian, as the head of Mexico. Lincoln could see that he was being flanked by the European governments. In 1938, Jerry Voorhis, a Congressman from Californ ia, wrote a pamphlet entitled Dollars and Sense, in which he sh ared a little bit of history with the American people about the events of the Ci vil War: In July 1862, an agent of the London bankers sent t he follow- ing letter to leading financiers and bankers in the United States soon after Lincoln's first issue of greenbacks: \"Th e great debt mat capitalists will see to it is made out of the w ar must be used to control the volume of money. To accomplish this the bonds must be used as a banking basis. We are not waiting for the Secretary of the Treasur y (Salmon P. Chase) to make this recommendation to Congress. It will not do to allow the greenback, as it is cal led, to circulate as money any length of time, for we cannot control them. But we can control the bonds and through them the bank iss ues.\" 20 In order to curtail the flow of the military equipm ent the largely rural South needed to wage the war, Lincoln, on April 19, 1861, imposed the naval blockade previously mentioned. The Confederacy need ed \"to go abroad and replace privateers with powerful warships which (th ey were) to buy or have built to order. The first of these vessels, the Sum ter, was commissioned in the spring of 1861, and was followed in 1862 by the Flo rida and the Alabama.\" 21 The South was purchasing these ships from England a nd France to break the blockade, and Secretary of State William Seward saw the impor- tance of keeping these two nations out of the war. He \"warned the British government: 'If any European power provokes war, we shall not shrink from it.' Similarly Seward advised Mercier that French r ecognition of the Confederacy would result in war with the United Sta tes.\" 22 Lincoln continued to see the danger from the Europe an bankers and the two European countries of France and England. He sa w the main issue of the war as being the preservation of the union. He repe ated his statement that preserving the Union was his main task: \"My paramou nt object in this struggle is to save the Union. If I could save the Union without freeing any slaves, I would do it.\" 23 But even though Lincoln was not conducting the war over the issue of slavery, he issued the Emancipation Proclamation fr eeing the slaves on September 22, 1862, claiming the right to do so as the Commander-in-Chief 156"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 THE CIVIL WAR of the Army and Navy. There was no act of Congress, just the solitary act of the President of the United States. But his act had the force of law, and the American people accepted it as such. In addition to the external threat from England and France, Lincoln also had an internal threat to contend with: the ce ntral bank. On February 25, 1863, Congress passed the National Banking Act. Thi s act created a federally chartered national bank that had the power to issue U.S. Bank Notes, money created to be loaned to the government supported no t by gold but by debt. The money was loaned to the government at interest, and became Legal Tender. This bill was supported and urged by the Se cretary of the Treasury, Salmon P. Chase. Lincoln, after the passage of this act, once again warned the American people. He said: \"The money power preys upon the na tion in times of peace and conspires against it in times of adversity. It is more despotic than monarchy, more insolent than autocracy, more selfis h than bureaucracy. I see in the near future a crisis approaching that un nerves me, and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country. Corporatio ns have been enthroned, an era of corruption will follow, and the money pow er of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the p rejudices of the people, until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands, and the republic is destroyed.\" 24 A few months after the passage of the act, the Roth schild bank in England wrote a letter to a New York firm of banker s: The few who understand the system (interest-bearing money) will either be so interested in its profits, or so dependent on its favors that there will be no opposition from that c lass, while on the other hand, the great body of people, mentally inca pable of comprehending the tremendous advantages that capita l derives from the system, will bear its burdens without comp laint, and perhaps without even suspecting the system is inimi cal to their interests. 25 Lincoln was betting on the blockade he had imposed around the South as a means of keeping England and France out of the war. The blockade was effectively doing this, at least on the surface, bu t others were using it as a means of making enormous profits. Private individua ls were \"running\" the blockade by equipping several ships with essential provisions for the South, and then hoping that a percentage of these ships wo uld make it through the blockade, so that the blockade runner could charge exorbitant prices for the goods in Southern cities. One of these individuals was Thomas W. House, reportedly a Rothschild agent, who amassed a fortun e during the Civil War. House was the father of Colonel Edward Mandell Hous e, the key to the 157"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 THE CIVIL WAR election of President Woodrow Wilson and the passag e of the Federal Reserve bill in 1913. Lincoln realized that the North needed an ally to k eep the European countries out of the war directly, as both nations were building ships capable of running the blockade, and the entry of England a nd France directly into the war could spell the end of the North. He looked to other European countries for assistance and found none willing to provide the support for his government. There was one country, however, that ha d no central bank and therefore no internal force preventing its support of the United States government. That country was Russia. Russia had a large navy and had already pledged its support to Lincoln prior to the beginning of the war. It could now inv olve itself and keep England and France out of the war because these two nations feared a war with the Russian government. Lincoln needed something that he could use as a mea ns of encouraging the Russian people to send their navy to the defens e of the United States government. Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclam ation to free the slaves as a gesture to the Russian people who had t heir Czar free the serfs with a similar proclamation in 1861. Lincoln anticipated that this one act would encourage the Russian people to support their gover nment when it lent support to Lincoln's government. The Czar of Russia, Alexander II, issued orders to his imperial navy to sail for the American ports of New York City and Sa n Francisco as a sign of support for Lincoln and his government. It also ser ved as a dramatic means of indicating to France and England they would have to contend with the Russian government as well should they enter the wa r on the side of the South. These ships began arriving in the United Sta tes in September, 1863. It was commonly understood why these ships were ent ering the Amer- ican waters. \"The average Northerner (understood).. . that the Russian Czar was taking this means of warning England and France that if they made war in support of the South, he would help the North .. . . 26 In October, 1863, the city of Baltimore issued a pr oclamation inviting the: officers of the Russian ships of war now in or shor dy to arrive at that Port (New York) to visit the city of Baltim ore... and to accept of its hospitalities, as a testimonial of th e high respect of the authorities and citizens of Baltimore for the Sover eign and people of Russia, who, when other powers and people strong ly bound to us by ties of interest or common descent (England a nd France?) have lent material and support to the Rebels of the South, have honorably abstained from all attempts to assist the rebellion, and 158"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 THE CIVIL WAR have given our government reliable assurances of th eir sympathy and good will. 27 The Czar issued orders to his Admirals that they we re to be ready to fight anY power and to take their orders only from Abraha m Lincoln. And in the event of war, the Russian Navy was order ed to \"attack the enemy's commercial shipping and their colonies, so as to cause them the greatest possible damage.\" 28 In addition to all of these problems, Lincoln faced one more: the machinations of an internal conspiracy. Lincoln had anticipated such a conspiracy in 1837 when he stated: \"At what point t hen is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer, if it ever reaches us it must spring up amongst us; it cannot come from abroad. If destruct ion be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation o f free men, we must live through all time, or the by suicide.\" 29 So Lincoln feared that the ultimate death of his na tion would be caused by her own sons, his fellow Americans. Early in 1863, Lincoln wrote a letter to Major Gene ral Joseph Hooker, in which he said: \"I have placed you at the head of the Army of the Potomac. I have heard, in such a way as to believe it, of yo ur recently saying that both the army and the government needed a dictator.\" 30 Apparently what Lincoln had heard about General Hoo ker was true, as Hooker had \"once been feared as the potential leade r of a Radical coup d'etat.\" 31 The Radicals referred to in Lincoln's letter to Gen eral Hooker were a group of Republicans, amongst others, who saw that the North would ultimately win the war with the South, and they wan ted Lincoln to make the South pay for its rebellion after the victory. Linc oln favored the softer approach of allowing the Southern states to return to the Union after the war ended, without reprisals against them or their figh ting men. The Radicals were frequently called the \"Jacobins\" after the gro up that fomented the French Revolution of 1789. As mentioned earlier, th ey were an offshoot of the Illuminati. But Lincoln's biggest battle was yet to be fought: the battle for his life. The visions of Lincoln's earlier years about not se rving two complete terms, and his fears about internal conspiracies, were abo ut to come true. On April 14, 1865, the conspiracy that Lincoln both feared and had knowledge of assassinated him. Eight people were tr ied for the crime, and four were later hung. In addition to the conspiracy 's successful attempt on Lincoln's life, the plan was to also assassinate An drew Johnson, Lincoln's Vice President, and Secretary of State Seward. Both of these other attempts failed, but if they had been successful, there is l ittle doubt who would have been the one to reap all of the benefits: Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. 159"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 THE CIVIL WAR In fact, after the successful assassination of Linc oln, Stanton \"became in that moment the functioning government of the Unite d States, when he assumed control of the city of Washington D.C. in a n attempt to capture Lincoln's killer.\" The man who killed Lincoln, John Wilkes Booth, had several links with societies of the day, one of which was the Car bonari of Italy, an Illuminati-like secret organization active in Itali an intrigue. One of the many evidences of Stanton's complicity i n the assassination attempts is the fact mat he failed to block off the road that Boom took as he left Washington D.C. after the assassination, even though Stanton had ordered military blockades on all of the other road s. It is now believed that Stanton also arranged for a nother man, similar in build and appearance to Booth, to be captured and m en murdered by troops under the command of Stanton. It is further believe d that Stanton certified mat the murdered man was Booth, thereby allowing Bo oth to escape. But perhaps the most incriminating evidence mat Sta nton was involved in the assassination of Lincoln lies in the missing pages of the diary kept by Mr. Booth. Stanton testified before Congressional i nvestigating committees \"mat the pages were missing when the diary was give n to him in April of 1865. The missing pages contain the names of some s eventy high govern- ment officials and prominent businessmen who were i nvolved in a conspi- racy to eliminate Lincoln. The purported eighteen m issing pages were recently discovered in the attic of Stanton's desce ndants.\" 32 And Boom was even linked to those involved with the conspiracy i n the South: \"A coded message was found in the trunk of Booth, the key to which was discovered in Judah P. Benjamin's possession. Benjamin... was the Civil War campaign strategist of the House of Rothschild.\" 33 (Mr. Benjamin held many key positions in the Confederacy during the Civil War.) So it appears that Lincoln was the subject of a maj or conspiracy to assassinate him, a conspiracy so important that eve n the European bankers were involved. Lincoln had to be eliminated because he dared to oppose the attempt to force a central bank onto the American p eople, and as an example to those who would later oppose such machinations i n high places. (One of the early books on the subject of this cons piracy was published just months after the assassination of President Li ncoln. It was entitled The Assassination and History of the Conspiracy, and it clearly identified the Knights of the Golden Circle as the fountainhead of the assassination plot. The back cover of the book carried an adverdsement for another book that offered the reader \"an inside view of the modus of the infamous organization, its connection with the rebellion and the Copperhea d movement at the North.\" The second book was written by Edmund Wrigh t, who claimed to be a member of the Knights.) After the attempt on h is life failed, and after Lincoln's death, Vice-President Johnson became the President of the United 160"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 THE CIVIL WAR States. He continued Lincoln's policy of amnesty to the defeated South after the war was over. He issued an Amnesty Proclamation on May 29, 1865, welcoming the Soudi back into the Union with only a few requirements: 1. The Soudi must repudiate the debt of the war; 2. Repeal all secession ordinances and laws; and 3. Abolish slavery forever. The first requirement did not endear President John son to those who wished the South to redeem its contractual obligati ons to those who loaned it the money it needed to fight the war. One of the se debtors was the Rodischild family, who had heavily funded the South 's efforts in the war. Johnson also had to face another problem. The Czar of Russia, for his part in saving the Unit ed States government during the war by sending his fleet to American wat ers, and apparently because of an agreement he made with Lincoln, asked to be paid for the use of his fleet. Johnson had no constitutional authori ty to give American dollars to the head of a foreign government. And th e cost of the fleet was rather high: $7.2 million. So Johnson had Secretary of State William Seward ar range for the purchase of Alaska from the Russians in April, 1867 . This act has unfairly been called \"Seward's folly\" by those historians unfamiliar with the actual reasons for Alaska's pur chase, and to this day, Secretary of State Seward has been criticized for t he purchase of what was then a piece of worthless land. But Seward was only purchasing the land as a method by which he could pay the Czar of Russia f or the use of his fleet, an action that probably saved this nation from a more serious war with England and France. But the real problem Johnson was to have during his tenure as President of the United States was still to occur. He asked for the resignation of Secretary of War Ed win Stanton, and Stanton refused. The Radical Republicans, also called the Jacobins, in the Senate started impeachment proceedings against President Johnson. These efforts failed by the slim margin of only one vote, and Johnson conti nued in office. In an interesting quirk of fate, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court at the time was Salmon P. Chase, and it was his task to preside over the impeachment trial of President Johnson. Chase had resigned as S ecretary of the Treasury to become the Chief Justice. It was almost as if the c onspiracy had anticipated the impeachment proceedings and had wanted a man th ey felt they could trust in that key position. Senator Benjamin F. Wade, President Pro-Tempore of the Senate, and next in line of succession to the Chief Executive's position, had been so confident that Johnson would be found guilty of the charges against him and removed from office that he had already informa lly named his new 161"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 THE CIVIL WAR cabinet. Ironically, Stanton was to become the Secr etary of the Treasury. 34 Chief Justice Chase's role in these events would be recognized years later by John Thompson, founder of the Chase National Ban k (later to be called the Chase Manhattan Bank, after its merger with the Manhattan Bank owned by the Warburgs,) who named his bank after hi m. In addition, other honors came to the Chief Justice. His picture now i s found on the $10,000 bill printed by the U.S. Treasury. This bill is the high est existing denomination currency in the United States. After the Civil War ended, President Johnson \"had n o doubt there was a conspiracy afoot among the Radicals (the Jacobins ) to incite another revolution.\" 35 It was the intent of the Jacobins to stir up the ne wly freed slaves and then use uiis dissatisfaction as the reason for starting another Civil War. And in fact there was a large riot in Memphis, Tennessee, in April, 1866, where a group of whites attacked negroes and forty-six of t he Negroes were killed. Later, in July, 1866, there was a riot in New Orlea ns where a group of marching negroes were fired upon and many of them w ere killed. The Radicals blamed Johnson for these killings, but some knew that the rioting was the work of others. Gideon Wells, the S ecretary of the Navy, was one and he wrote in his diary: \"There is little dou bt that the New Orleans riots had their origin with the Radical members of Congress in Washington. It is part of a deliberate conspiracy and was to be the commencement of a series of bloody affrays through the States lately in the rebellion (the South.) There is a determination to involve the country in civil war, if necessary, to secure negro suffrage in the States and Radical asc endancy in the general government.\" 36 Even President Johnson was aware of the attempts to incite another Civil War as he once... told Orville Browning that \"he had no doubt that th ere was a conspiracy afoot among the Radicals to incite anodi er revolution, and especially to arm and exasperate the negroes.\" The President himself was coming to believe that St evens and Sumner (the leaders of the Radicals, also known as the Jacobins) and their followers intended to take the government into their own hands. It was an \"unmistakable design,\" he once told Welle s. They would declare Tennessee out of the Union and so get rid of him, and then set up a Directory based on the French Rev olution's model. 37 One of the groups acting to incite the riots was th e Knights of the Golden Circle, whose war-time members included John Wilkes Booth and Jefferson Davis, the head of the Confederacy.

It has been estimated that Jesse and the other members of the Knights had buried over $7 billion in gold all over the western states. Jesse James, a 33rd degree Mason, lived to be 107 y ears old. He claimed that his secret to his long life was that he change d his name frequently after first locating a cowboy with approximately his same physical characteristics. He then would kill or have him killed by shooting h im in the face. He would then plant some items known to be his on the body, such as jewelry or clothing. His next step would be to have a known re lative or a close friend identify the body as being that of Jesse James. Sin ce there were no other means of identifying the body such as pictures or f ingerprints, the public assumed that the relative or friend knew what they were saying when they identified the body. Grateful townspeople were happ y to think that the notorious bankrobber, or any or his dangerous alias es, was dead, so they tended to believe that the identification was corre ct. Jesse claimed mat it was by mis method that he assumed the identities or ali ases of some seventy-diree individuals. In fact, he claimed that one of his al iases he used in later years was that of William A. Clark, the copper king and l ater a U.S. Senator from the Las Vegas area of Nevada. It is after Senator C lark that Clark County, Nevada is named. Another group that was formed in 1867 to spread ter ror amongst the Negroes was a group known as the Ku Klux Klan, name d after the Greek word Kuklos, which meant \"band\" or \"circle.\" Someone suggested that the name should be changed t o Ku Klux, and this is the name that has existed to this very day. This organization was \"brother to those secret organizations made up of o ther victims of despotism: the Confrereries of medieval France, the Carbonari of Italy, the Vehmgerict of Germany, (and) the Nihilists of Russia.\" 38 It was the Nihilists who were credited with the ass assination of the Czar of Russia, Alexander II, in 1881. This was the same Czar who sent the fleet to America during the Civil War. So he, like Lincol n, had to pay the price for outwitting the international bankers who had caused the Civil War. The connection between the Ku Klux Klan and the Knights of the Golden Circle has now become known. One author has written that \" the Ku Klux Klan was the military arm of the Knights of the Golden Circl e.\" 39 The final important act of the Civil War came in 18 75, when Congress Passed the Specie Redemption Act, declaring it the policy of the government to redeem President Lincoln's \"greenbacks\" at par i n gold on January 1, 1879. Lincoln had outwitted the international bankers. The United States still did not have a central bank . It was time for the conspiracy to change the strate gy. 163"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Chapter 16 The Federal Reserve After their successive failures at convincing the A merican people that they needed a Central Bank by forcing them into a s eries of wars, the international bankers connected with the conspiracy decided to change their methods. Instead of utilizing wars for this purpose , they would convince the unsuspecting American citizen that they needed a ce ntral bank through the use of artificially created depressions, recessions , and panics. It was easy for the international bankers to create a banking panic. Because of the nature of the banking business, the bankers knew that only a small percentage of the deposits stored in a bank by the depositors is ever called for on any given day. Because of this, only a small percentage, say twenty percent, is kept at the bank at any one time . The other eighty is loaned out, at interest, to borrowers who in turn reinvest it in Capital Goods or Consumption Goods. Therefore, it would be easy for the bankers to caus e a bank panic, called a \"run,\" by convincing the depositors of any partic ular bank that the bank was insolvent and didn't have the money to pay the depositors should they withdraw their cash. This was of course a true stat ement, and if all of the depositors went to the bank at the same time to wit hdraw their deposits, the 164"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 THE FEDERAL RESERVE individual who had made the statement would prove t o be rather prophetic in his analysis of the situation. The news that a particular bank didn't have the dep osits belonging to the depositors would cause other depositors at othe r banks to wididraw their funds as well to make certain that their deposits w ere safe. What would start as a \"bank run\" on a particular bank would end in a full-fledged national panic. And the individual who made the assessment of the b ank's insolvency would be recognized as a prophet of the first order . The banks who would experience a run on their depos its would ask those to whom they loaned the money to return it an d there would be a rush to sell properties to pay off the mortgages. When t his happened all at once, property values would drop, allowing those with ext ra cash to buy properties at a reduced price. The pre-planned panic could wor k two ways: the bankers who knew it was coming could wididraw their cash pr ior to the beginning of the panic, and then go back into the market to b uy Capital Goods at a reduced price. This became, men, a powerful tool in the hands of t hose who wished to change our banking system from one where individual bankers functioned to one where a small group of bankers operated a na tional bank. The bankers would then blame the current banking system for the troubles in the economy. But more importantly, the international bankers who caused the problem could offer their desired solution: a centr al bank. So the tactic changed from one of creating wars to one of creating bank panics to influence the American people into the cr eation of a permanent central bank. One of the prime movers in this movement was J.P. M organ, whose father was one of the Rothschild agents who made a huge fortune in running President Lincoln's blockade during the Civil War. (It is interesting to note that the J. P. Morgan, t he supporter of America's need for a central bank, is related to Alexander Ha milton, the supporter of America's need for a central bank in the days of Am erica's revolutionary war against the English Government. This connection was revealed in 1982, when Time magazine announced that Pierpont Morgan H amilton, the great-great grandson of Alexander Hamilton and neph ew of J.P. Morgan, had passed away.) 1 In 1869, J. P. Morgan went to London and reached an agreement to form a company known as Northern Securities that was int ended to act as an agent for the N.M. Rothschild Company in the United State s. The first major panic created by the international bankers occurred in 1893 when local bankers around the nation were told to call in their loans. 165"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 THE FEDERAL RESERVE Senator Robert Owen \"... testified before a Congres sional Committee that the bank he owned received from the National Banker s' Association what came to be known as the 'Panic Circular of 1893.' I t stated: 'You will at once retire one-third of your circulation and call in on e-half of your loans....\" 2 Congressman Charles A. Lindbergh, the father of the famous aviator saw the circular that Senator Owen reported on, and said that it was intended to cause a \"stringency\" (a tightness) to cause \"bus iness men to appeal to Congress for legislation that would favor the banke rs.\" 3 (The bankers didn't create the panic by advising th e American people that the banks were insolvent. They issued a circul ar to have the bankers cause it themselves. They would hold the former str ategy for later panics.) This tactic, of course, is exactly the same as that explained by Jan Kozak in his book Not a Shot is Fired: create the problem , and then encourage the people affected to ask Congress for laws favorable to those who created the problem. Congress also took this opportunity to pass an inco me tax, including it in what was called the Tariff Act of 1894. So the t wo planks of The Manifesto created to destroy the middle class were being offe red to the American people at the same time: the central bank and the income t ax. One courageous Congressman, Robert Adams, went on r ecord as opposing the income tax. He is quoted as saying: \"T he imposition of the tax will corrupt the people. It will bring... the spy a nd the informer. It will be a step toward centralization.... It is expensive in its collection and cannot be fairly imposed.\" 4 But in spite of the actions of the conspirators, th e income tax as a law passed by Congress was declared to be unconstitutio nal by the Supreme Court. So the decision was made to add the income t ax to the Constitution as a Constitutional Amendment. It was now 1900, and the administration of Presiden t William McKinley was prosecuting the Northern Securities Company und er the anti-trust laws. McKinley changed his vice-presidents for his second term, and less than a year later he was assassinated. His second vice-pre sident, Theodore Roose- velt, became president, and the prosecution of Nort hern Securities stopped. Roosevelt was later elected in his own right in 190 4. Another agent of the British Rothschild banking int erests, Colonel Edward Mandell House, wrote an extremely important book in 1912. It was entitled Philip Dru, Administrator, and contained t he personal beliefs of the author in the form of a novel. Even though the book was written in 1912, it contained predictions about future events the autho r hoped would come true. The plot of the novel concerns a meeting in 1925 be tween John Thor, described as the \"high priest of finance,\" and Sena tor Selwyn, a very important Senator. 166"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 THE FEDERAL RESERVE Selwyn had discovered \"that the government was run by a few men, that outside of this little circle, no one was of much i mportance.

He wanted to govern the Nation with an absolute hand, and yet not be known as the directing power.\" 7 The nation came to know of this conspiracy between these two impor- tant individuals by a fluke, when Mr. Thor's secret ary played back a tape recording made on a dictagraph that had been inadve rtently turned on during the meeting. The secretary gave the recordin g to the Associated Press which spread the story of the conspiracy across the nation. America read the story and knew that \"revolution was imminent.\" The hero of the story, Philip Dru, who is not direc tly involved in the plot, organizes an army of 500,000 men and leads th em on a march to Washington. He actually clashes with government tro ops prior to his arrival in Washington, and he scores a decisive victory ove r the Army. The Presi- dent, named Rockland in the novel, flees the countr y, and Selwyn is appointed acting President in his absence. One of h is first acts as President is to surrender to Philip Dru. Dru moves in, keeps Selwyn as the President, but as sumes \"the power of a dictator\" as he allows Selwyn to continue functio ning as President, although Dru himself would make all of the decision s. He is now in a position to give the United States a new form of go vernment, Dru describes it as \"... Socialism as dreamed of by Karl Marx.\") He arranges for several key Marxist programs, such as a graduated income tax, and a graduated inheritance tax. He als o prohibits the \"selling of... anything of value,\" abolishing, at least in p art, the right of private property, just as spelled out by Marx in his writin gs. Dru starts making the laws of the nation, as \"... t here were no legisla- tive bodies sitting, and the function of law-making was confined to one individual, the administration (Philip Dru) himself .\" 8 Dru also re-wrote the \"obsolete... and grotesque\" C onstitution of the United States. Dru also meddled in the internal affairs of other n ations, including England, and concerned himself with the nation of R ussia as he: \"... won- dered when her deliverance would come.

Philip Dru is what he him self would like to have been. Every act in his career, every letter, every word of advice that passed from him to (President) Woodrow Wilson was consiste nt with the ideas enunciated by Philip Dru.\" 10 Colonel House had arranged to elect the next presid ent of the United States, Woodrow Wilson, in the election of 1912. Wi lson became the student of Colonel House, and as he began to learn the thou ghts of his mentor, he became so close that Wilson later said that House's \"thoughts and mine are one.\" Wilson is confusing, a sort of enigma in the events of that day. He admitted that there was a giant conspiracy, yet he became involved with it. He wrote: \"There is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive mat they better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.\" 11 Mr. Wilson didn't identify the power he had become aware of as being mat of the Masons, but he was, in fact, a member. 12 One of the many people that House gave a copy of hi s book to was another member of the Masons, Franklin Delano Roose velt, who is reported to have read the book with great interest. One evid ence that Roosevelt enjoyed the book was mat he called his meetings wit h the American public over me radio his \"fireside chats,\" possibly becaus e of the fact that in House's book, Dru, the hero, \"sat contentedly smoking by a great log fire in the library...\" House was an extremely important person during the Wilson years, as he once told biographer Charles Seymour: \"During th e last fifteen years I have been close to the center of things, although f ew people suspect it. No important foreigner has come to America without tal king to me. I was close to the movement mat nominated Roosevelt.\" 13 So not only did House create Woodrow Wilson, he als o was involved in making Franklin Roosevelt the President of the Unit ed States. So House became the \"secret power\" behind both Wils on and Roose- velt, exactly like his fictional character Senator Selwyn had hoped to become. Another representative of the Rothschild interests, J.P. Morgan, was preparing for the next scheduled event in the creat ion of America's central bank. Morgan during the early months of 1907 was in Europe for five months, shuttling back and form between London and Paris, homes of two branches of the Rothschild banking family. 168"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 THE FEDERAL RESERVE Apparently the reason Morgan was in Europe was beca use the decision was being made to have Morgan precipitate a bank pa nic in America. When he returned, he started rumors that the Knickerbock er Bank in New York was insolvent. The bank's depositors became frightened because they thought that Morgan, being the best known banker of the day , might very well be right. Their panic started a run on the bank. Morga n was right, and the panic at the Knickerbocker also caused runs on other bank s, and the Panic of 1907 was complete. The propaganda started almost immediately that the state-chartered bankers couldn't be trusted anymore with the bankin g affairs of the nation. The need for a central bank had become apparent by the Panic of 1907, or at least mis is how the conspiracy argued. Historian Frederick Lewis Allen, writing in Life ma gazine, became aware of the plot. He wrote: \"... certain chronicle rs have arrived at the ingenious conclusion mat the Morgan interests took advantage of the un- settled conditions during the autumn of 1907 to pre cipitate the Panic, guiding it shrewdly as it progressed, so that it wo uld kill off rival banks, and consolidate the pre-eminence of the banks within th e Morgan orbit.\" 14 Woodrow Wilson, who was president of Princeton Univ ersity in 1907, spoke to the American people, attempting to remove whatever blame might be placed upon the Morgan shoulders. He said: \"All this trouble could be averted if we appointed a committee of six or seven public-spirited men like J.P. Morgan to handle the affairs of our country.\" 15 So Wilson wanted to hand over the affairs of the na tion to the very person who had caused all of the concern: J.P. Morg an! But the main thrust of the explanations about the c auses of the 1907 Panic was that the American people needed a strong central bank to prevent the abuses of the \"Wall Street\" bankers: \"What fina lly convinced Congress of the need for better control over the nation's banki ng was one stark event: the Panic of 1907. The panic subsided. Agitation grew f or an effective national banking system.\" 16 So the American people, who had suffered through th e American Revolution, the War of 1812, the battles between An drew Jackson and the Second Bank of the United States, the Civil War, th e previous panics of 1873 and 1893, and now the Panic of 1907, were finally c onditioned to the point of accepting the solution offered by those who had caused all of these events: the international bankers. That solution was a central bank. The invididual the bankers used to introduce the le gislation that created the central bank was a Senator from Rhode Island, a Mason, and the maternal grandfather of the Rockefeller brothers, D avid, Nelson, et al., by the name of Nelson Aldrich. He was appointed to a Natio nal Monetary Commi- sion and charged \"to make a thorough study of finan cial practices before 169"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 THE FEDERAL RESERVE formulating banking and currency reform legislation .\" So for two years, this Commission toured the bankin g houses of Europe, learning (supposedly) the secrets of the central ba nking systems of Europe, (there are those who believe that they already knew the secrets of the central banking systems of Europe!) Upon Senator Aldrich's return, in November, 1910, h e boarded a train in Hoboken, New Jersey, for a ride to Jekyll Island , Georgia. His destination was the Jekyll Island Hunt Club, owned by Mr. Morga n. It was here that the legislation that would give America its central ban k was written. Aboard the train, and with Senator Aldrich later in Georgia, were the following individuals: A. Piatt Andrew, Assistant Secretary of the Treasur y; Senator Nelson Aldrich, National Monetary Commissio n; Frank Vanderlip, President of Kuhn-Loeb's National City Bank of New York; Henry Davidson, Senior Partner of J. P. Morgan; Charles Norton, President of Morgan's First Nationa l Bank of New York; Paul Warburg, Partner in the banking house of Kuhn- Loeb & Company; and Benjamin Strong, President of Morgan's Banker's Tru st Company. The railroad car that these gentlemen travelled in belonged to Senator Aldrich, and while they were aboard, they were swor n to secrecy and asked to refer to each other by first names only. One of those, Mr. Vanderlip, later went on to revea l his role in the writing of the bill that created the Federal Reserv e System. He wrote in the Saturday Evening Post: ... in 1910, when I was as secretive, indeed as fur tive, as any conspirator. I do not feel it is any exaggeration t o speak of our secret expedition to Jekyll Island as the occasion of the actual conception of what eventually became the Federal Reserve Syste m. We were told to leave our last names behind us. We were told further mat we should avoid dining together on the night of our departure. We were instructed to come one at a time and as unob- trusively as possible to the terminal of the New Je rsey littoral of the Hudson, where Senator Aldrich's private car would b e in readiness, attached to the rear end of the train for the South . Once aboard the private car, we began to observe th e taboo that had been fixed on last names. Discovery, we knew, simply must not happen, or else all our time and effort would be wasted. 17 Notice that the conspirators did not want the Ameri can people to know 170"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 THE FEDERAL RESERVE what they had in store for them: a central bank. Th e legislation was to be written not by a group of legislators, but by a gro up of bankers, mostly connected with the man responsible for the Panic of 1907: J.P. Morgan. The conspiracy also had one additional problem. The y had \"to avoid the name Central Bank, and for that reason (they) h ad come upon the designation of Federal Reserve System. It would be owned by private individuals who would draw profit from ownership of shares and who would control the nation's issue of money; it would have at its command the nation's entire financial resources; and it would b e able to mobilize and mortgage the United States by involving (the United States) in major foreign wars.\" 18 The method the conspirators used to defraud the Ame rican people was to divide the Federal Reserve System into twelve di stricts so that the American people could not call the bank a \"central bank.\" Th e fact that the twelve districts had one director, called the Federal Rese rve Chairman, apparently was not to be considered relevant. The one non-banker at Jekyll Island was Senator Nel son Aldrich, but he certainly could have qualified as a wealthy man, ca pable of starting his own bank. When he entered the Senate in 1881, he was wo rth $50,000. When he left the Senate in 1911, he was worth $30,000,000. Now that the legislation creating the central bank was written, it would need a president who would not veto the bill after it passed the House and the Senate. The President in 1910 and 1911 was William Howard Taft, elected in 1908, and he was on record as saying that he would veto the bill should it come to his desk for him to sign. He was a Republic an and was surely to be re-elected to a second term in 1912. The conspiracy needed to defeat him, so it supporte d first the campaign of ex-President Teddy Roosevelt, a fellow Republica n, to defeat Taft in the Republican primaries. This activity failed as Taft was re-nominated, so the conspiracy planned on defeating him with the Democr atic candidate, Woodrow Wilson. However, the supporters of Wilson soon found that t heir candidate would not draw enough votes to defeat Taft in the g eneral election. It was discovered that Taft would defeat Wilson by a 55 to 45 margin. This obviously caused a problem for the supporters of the Federal Reserve Bill, which would be defeated if Taft were to be re-elected. What they had fought wars for and had caused depressions for, was now within their grasp, and it all could be prevented by one man: Pr esident William Howard Taft. The supporters needed someone to draw votes away fr om Taft in the general election, so they urged Teddy Roosevelt to run against both Wilson and Taft. It was theorized that Roosevelt, a fellow Republican, would draw 171"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 THE FEDERAL RESERVE votes from the other Republican in the race, Taft, and enable Wilson to win without a majority of the votes cast. (Wilson, of c ourse, had agreed to sign the Federal Reserve Bill should it get to his desk for him as President to sign.) This strategy was confirmed in a book by Ferdinand Lundberg, entitled America's 60 Families. Lundberg wrote: In view of the vast sums subsequently spent by him (Frank Munsey) and Perkins, (two Roosevelt supporters, bot h of whom were closely allied with the J.P. Morgan interests) to forward the Progressive campaign (of Roosevelt) and insure Taft 's defeat, the suspicion seems justified that the two were not ove r-anxious to have Roosevelt win. The notion that Perkins and Munsey may have wanted Wil- son to win, or any Democratic candidate other than (William Jennings) Bryan, is partly substantiated by the fac t that Perkins put a good deal of cash behind the Wilson campaign. In short, most of Roosevelt's campaign fund was sup plied by the two Morgan hatchet men who were seeking Taft's scalp. 19 The tactic of dividing the votes of the apparent wi nner so that a candidate with a minority of the votes could be ele cted has been used frequently in the United States, most notably in th e nomination of George McGovern in 1972, and also in the election of 1980 which will be discussed in another chapter. In the case of the McGovern election, it was establ ished prior to the Democratic primaries that he apparently would not b e able to garner more than thirty to thirty-five percent of the primary e lection votes against Hubert Humphrey, the party's favorite, and their nominee i n 1968. Yet it was important for McGovern to get the nomination (for r easons that will be covered later in another context.) To implement thi s decision, the Democrats offered the Democratic voters a candidate of every political stripe and persuasion in the primaries. These candidates were to divide Humphrey's vote so that McGovern would win the primaries with thirty to thirty-five percent of the vote. This would enable McGovern, wi th his hard-core following, to win the Democratic nomination with bu t a small percentage of the vote. The strategy worked. McGovern won the nomination against the party favor ite, Hubert Humphrey. So the election of 1912 became history. The three c andidates, Taft, Wilson and Roosevelt, waited for the results. When the votes were counted, Wilson won the electio n with but forty- five percent of the vote, Roosevelt received more v otes than did Taft, and Taft 172"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 THE FEDERAL RESERVE ran third. But the interesting thing is that the to tal of the votes cast for Taft and Roosevelt, when added together, would have been enough to defeat Wilson, fifty-five percent to forty-five percent. I t was extremely likely that in a two-man race, Taft would have defeated Wilson rat her handily. The plot worked. Wilson was elected and then inaugu rated in January, 1913. Wilson could now sign the Federal Reserve Bil l in December, 1913, after it had passed the House and the Senate. And h e did. What did the American people get from the Federal R eserve System? The System itself publishes a paperback textbook en titled The Federal Reserve System, Purposes and Functions, that is use d in colleges to explain the activities of the System to college students, e specially in a class entitled Money and Banking. This booklet explains the functions of the Federal Reserve: \"An efficient monetary mechanism is indispensible to... the natio n... The function of the Federal Reserve is to foster a flow of money an d credit that will facilitate orderly economic growth, a stable dollar, and long- run balance in our international payments.\" 20 (It is a fair question to ask the Federal Reserve S ystem, if the Americans haven't had an \"orderly economic growth, a stable d ollar and a long-run balance in our international payments\" which has be en America's history since the creation of the System, why is it allowed to continue? It would seem that such a system with such a dismal record for about seventy years would be abolished without delay. Could it be that the system was created to ensure t hat America didn't have an \"orderly economic growth, a stable dollar, and a long-run balance in our international payments?\" In other words, the System was created to do exactl y the opposite of what it tells the American people! The System is working !) There were those who opposed the creation of the Sy stem at the time and made that opposition public. One such individual wa s Congressman Charles Lindbergh, Sr. Congressman Lindbergh warned the American people th at the Federal Reserve Act\"... established the most gigantic trust on earth. When the President signs this act, the invisible government by the money power- ...will be legitimized. The new law will create inf lation whenever the trusts want inflation. From now on, depressions will be sc ientifically created.\" 21 The Congressman had put his finger on the pulse of the problem: the Federal Reserve System was created to foster econom ic emergencies. This instrument of economic destruction was now in place. The staffing of the System's key positions with those w ho created and supported it followed. 173"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 THE FEDERAL RESERVE The first governor of the New York Federal Reserve branch was Benjamin Strong of Morgan's Bankers Trust Company, a participant in the Jekyll Island writing of the bill. The first Govern or of the Board of Directors was Paul Warburg, a partner in the banking house of Kuhn, Loeb and Company, also a participant at the Jekyll Island Me eting. What had those who called the system \"Federal\" crea ted? Was it really a \"Federal\" Reserve System? It is \"a private organization, since the member ban ks own all of the stock, on which they receive tax-free dividends; it must pay postage, like any other private corporation; its employees are not on civil service; it may spend whatever it wishes;... and its physical property, h eld under private deeds, is subject to local taxation.\" 22 In fact, America's elected officials know that the \"Federal\" Reserve System isn't federal. In speeches to the American p eople, recent Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Jimmy Carter have j oined Dr. Arthur Burns, former head of the System, the Associated Pr ess, the House of Representatives in a primer on the System, and othe rs, in stating that the System is \"independent,\" (or words to that effect.) In other words, these individuals and entities know that the system is not \"Federal.\" It is privately owned and operated. Other Congressmen, more recent than Congressman Lin dbergh, have also warned the American people about the dangers o f the non-federal Federal Reserve System. Congressman Wright Patman, the Chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee, said: \"In the United States today, we have in effect two governments. We have the duly constituted govern- ment. Then we have an independent, uncontrolled and un-coordinated government in the Federal Reserve System, operating the money powers which are reserved to Congress by the Constitution. \" 23 Ludwig von Mises, a free-market economist, has spok en somewhat humorously on the subject of the governments that c reate national banking systems like the Federal Reserve: \"Government is th e only agency that can take a perfectly useful commodity like paper, smear it with ink, and render it absolutely useless.\" The privately owned Federal Reserve System is in co ntrol of the money supply and therefore has the ability to create infl ation and deflation at will. The money supply per capita in 1913, when the Reser ve System was created was around $148. By 1978, it stood at $3,69 1. The value of the 1913 dollar, taken as a base of 1. 00, had shrunk to approximately 12 cents by 1978. (This must be what the Federal Reserve System calls a \"stable dollar.\") The quantity of money in January, 1968, stood at $3 51 billion, and in February, 1980, it was $976 billion, a 278 percent increase. In fact, the 174"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 THE FEDERAL RESERVE quantity of money doubles approximately every ten y ears. But strangely, this increase in the money supply, or so the American pe ople are told, does not cause inflation. Even though the dictionary definit ion of inflation states that an increase in the money supply always causes infla tion. The Federal Reserve System admits that the ability to create inflation rests with their agency: \"Thus, the ultimate capabi lity for expanding or reducing the economy's supply of money rests with t he Federal Reserve.\" 24 Not all of the banks in America, however, were inte rested in the creation of inflation. Some were concerned about their membe rship in the System and were withdrawing. In fact, William Miller, then the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, in 1978 warned mat the flight of the membe r banks out of the System was \"weakening the financial system of the United S tates.\" A total of 430 members banks had left the Federal R eserve in an eight- year span, including 15 major banks in 1977, with d eposits of more than $100 billion, and another 39 banks left in 1978. As a re sult of this attrition, twenty- five percent of all commercial bank deposits and si xty percent of all banks were now outside of the system. Miller continued: \"The ability of the system to inf luence the nation's money and credit (became) weaker.\" 25 The trend away from the Federal Reserve System cont inued, and in December, 1979, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volck er informed the House Banking Committee that \"... some 300 banks wi th deposits of $18.4 billion have quit the Fed (the Federal Reserve Syst em) within the past 4 1/2 years.' He said another 575 of the remaining 5,480 member banks, with deposits of more than $70 billion, 'have given us s ome indication of their intent to withdraw.' \" 26 And in February, 1980, it was reported that: \"In th e last four months, 69 banks (had) withdrawn from the Federal Reserve Syst em, taking with them seven billion dollars in deposits. Another 670 bank s, holding $71 billion in deposits, have expressed a desire to leave the syst em.\" 27 This exodus from the System could not be allowed to continue, so in 1980, Congress passed the Monetary Control Act whic h gave the Federal Reserve System control of all depository institutio ns, whether or not the banks were previously members of the System itself. But in any event, the System after its creation in 1913 was in a position to loan the federal government large sums of money. Their first real opportunity to do this occurred just a few years la ter during World War I. The following table illustrates just how much money the System loaned the United States government during the War: (in mi llions of dollars, rounded). 175"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 THE FEDERAL RESERVE Year Rounded Receipts Rounded Outlays Surplus or Deficit 1916 $ 761 731 $- 48 1917 1,101 1,954 - 853 1918 3,645 12,677 - 9,032 1919 5,139 18,493 -13,363 1920 6,649 6,358 291 The table shows how the size of the government grew from 1916 to 1920 and how enormous quantities of debt were accumulate d. This money, in large part, was borrowed from the Federal Reserve S ystem, America's central bank, which \"... hath benefit of interest on all mo neys which it creates out of nothing.\" 28 In addition to the ability to create interest-beari ng debt, the Federal Reserve System also has the ability to create econo mic cycles through the expansion and contraction of the quantity of money and credit. Their first major opportunity to create a depression by this me thod occurred in 1920, when the Federal Reserve created what has become kn own as the Panic of 1920. One of those who saw how this was the result of pri or economic planning was Congressman Lindbergh, who in 1921 wro te in his book Economic Pinch, the following: \"Under the Federal R eserve Act, panics are scientifically created; the present panic is the fi rst scientifically created one, worked out as we figure a mathematical problem.\" 29 The process works in the following manner: the Syst em increases the money supply (from 1914 to 1919, the quantity of mo ney in the United States nearly doubled.) The media then encourages the Amer ican people to borrow large quantities of money on credit. Once the money is out on loan, the bankers contract the money supply by calling in their outstanding loans. The entire p rocess was laid out by Senator Robert L. Owen, Chairman of the Senate Bank ing and Currency Committee, and a banker himself. He wrote: In the early part of 1920, the farmers were exceedi ngly prosperous. They were paying off their mortgages and buying a l ot of land, at the insistence of the government — had borrowed money to do it—and then they were bankrupted by a sudden contra ction of credit which took place in 1920. What took place in 1920 was just the reverse of wha t should have been taking place.

They met on the 16m of May, 1920, and it was a secr et meeting. Only the big bankers were there, and the work of th at day resulted in a contraction of credit (by ordering ba nks to call in outstanding loans) which had the effect the next ye ar of reducing the national income fifteen billion dollars, throwi ng millions of people out of employment, and reducing the value of lands and ranches by twenty-billion dollars. 50 Not only did the bankers transfer large quantities of land from the farmers to the bankers by this contraction, but the process also transferred large numbers of banks from the hands of those bank ers who could not meet the demands of the Federal Reserve and had to sell their banking assets for a reduced price to those who had the money to buy ban krupt banks (the Panic of 1920 bankrupted 5,400 banks.) One of the major non-banking targets of this panic was Henry Ford, the automobile manufacturer. Despite inflation, Ford ordered a price cut for his automobiles, but demand was still insufficient and a number of F ord plants had to be shut down. Rumor had it that a huge loan was being negotiated. But Ford, who thought New York bankers were nothing short of vultures, was determined not to fall into their hands... Bankers... lined up to offer their \"help\" in return for his surrender of independence. The game was clear to Mr. Ford. One representative of a Morgan-controlled bank in N ew York came forward with a plan to \"save\" Ford... Ford saved his company by turning to his dealers, t o whom he now shipped his cars collect in spite of the slowne ss of the market.... Demand grew... and the plants were re-opened. \" 31 Ford, had out-smarted the bankers who had planned t he Panic, in part, to destroy him. He did not need to borrow large qua ntities of money and surrender control of his company to the bankers who would certainly wish to control mat which they subsidized. The Panic of 1920 was a success, and this success l ed the bankers to plan another: the Crash of 1929. The first step was, once again, to increase the mon ey supply, and this was done from 1921 to 1929, as is illustrated by th e following table: 177"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 THE FEDERAL RESERVE Years Quantity of money (in billions) June 1920 $ 34.2 June, 1921 (low) 31.7 June, 1922 33.0 June, 1923 36.1 June, 1924 37.6 June, 1925 42.6 June, 1926 43.1 June, 1927 45.4 June, 1928 (high) 45.7 June, 1929 45.7 The figures reveal that the Federal Reserve expande d the money supply from a low of $31.7 billion in 1921, to a high of $ 45.7 billion in 1929, an increase of approximately 144 percent. To move this increase in the money supply into the economy, individ- ual banks could borrow money from the Federal Reser ve and re-loan it to the buying public. The money was borrowed at 5 percent interest, and was re- loaned at 12 percent. Contributing to the increase in the money supply, o r the money being made available by the Federal Reserve, was the mone y being made available by the large corporations, which were loaning their surplus funds to buyers on Wall Street. These loans from these non-banking sources were approxi- mately equal to those from the banking system. For instance, call loans to brokers in 1929 made by some leading corporations w ere as follows: Lender Peak amounts American and Foreign Power $30,321,000 (J.P.

Morgan and Company had nearly $11 0,000,000 in the call-loan market.' 2 This expansion in the money supply brought prosperi ty to the country, and the American people were encouraged by the medi a to buy into the stock market They were told that those who did were makin g large quantities of money. The stock brokers who were handling the new influx of buyers coming to make a fortune in the stock market were using a new tool to induce them into buying more shares of stock than they had andc ipated. This new tool was called \"buying on margin,\" and it enabled the s tock buyer to borrow money and to use it to buy stock. The buyer was encouraged to buy stock with only ten percent down, borrowing the remaining ninety percent from the sto ck broker, who had arranged for the buyer to borrow from either a bank or a large corporation. The following example will illustrate how this meth od worked: A share of stock sells for $100, but because of the ability of the purchaser to buy on margin, with only ten percent d own, ten shares could be bought, with the same $100 instead of only one: One share Ten shares Buyer's cash: $100 $ 100 Borrowed cash: -0- 900 Total: -$100 $1,000 Therefore for the same investment, $100, a purchase r could borrow $900, using the stock as collateral for the loan, and therefore buy ten shares for the same investment of $100. Now, for mis example, presume mat one share of stoc k went up ten percent in the stock market, or to $110. Thi s would increase the profits made by the stock buyer: Value of one share: $110 Ten shares: $1,100 Buyers investment: $100 $ 100 Profit: $ 10 $ 100 Profit on investment 10% 100% The investor could now sell the shares of stock, an d make a one-hundred percent profit with only a ten-percent increase in the stock's value (the buyer could double his investmen t) after paying off the loan to the lender. 179"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 THE FEDERAL RESERVE There was one catch, however, as the money was loan ed to the buyer on what was called a \"24 hour broker call loan.\" This meant mat the broker could exercise his option and require that the borr ower sell his stock and return the loan amount 24 hours after the lender ha d asked for it. The buyer had 24 hours to repay the loan and had to either se ll the stock or come up with the loan amount to pay off the lender of the money. This meant that, whenever the brokers wanted to, th ey could require all of the stock buyers to sell at the same time by cal ling all of the loans at the same time. This activity would precipitate a panic on the stock market, when all of the stock owners went to sell their stock. A nd when all the sellers offer stock at the same time, the price drops rapidly. Th e whole process was detailed by one autiior who wrote: When everything was ready, the New York financiers started calling 24-hour broker call-loans. This meant that the stock brokers and the customers had to dump their stock on the market in order to pay the loans. This naturally collapsed the stock market and broug ht a banking collapse all over the country, because the banks not owned by the oligarchy were heavily involved in broker ca ll-loans at this time, and bank runs soon exhausted their coin and c urrency, and they had to close. The Federal Reserve System would not come to their aid, aldiough they were instructed under the law to main tain an elastic currency. 33 The Federal Reserve \"would not come to their aid,\" even though they were required by law to do so, and many banks (and individuals) went bankrupt.

Some rare historians are convinced that Churchill was brought to witness the crash firsthand because it w as desired that he see the power of the banking system at work.' 5 Even though many stockholders had to sell their sto ck, it is not commonly questioned as to who bought all of the sto ck mat was being sold. The history books generally discuss all of the sell ing that went on during the crash, but fail to discuss all of the buying. John Kenneth Galbraith in his book The Great Crash 1929, wrote mis about the buyers: Nothing could have been more ingeniously designed t o maximize the suffering, and also to insure that as few as possib le escaped the common misfortune.

He has said: \"I had begun to liquidate my stock hol dings and to put my money into bonds and into a cash reserve. I also bo ught gold.\" 57 Another who got out early was Joseph P. Kennedy, th e father of President John Kennedy, who in the winter of 1928-2 9 got out of the market. \"The profits he took from the sale of his... holdin gs were not reinvested, but kept in cash.\"' 8 Others who sold their stock before the crash includ ed international hankers and financiers Henry Morgenthau and Douglas Dillon. 39 The selling on credit during the crash had another effect already mentioned. About sixteen-thousand banks, or fifty-t wo percent of the total, went out of business. Some of the stockholders went to their banks to wit hdraw whatever cash they had in the bank to pay whatever they could of their stock call in cash. This caused a nearly nation-wide bank run.

Roosevelt, two days after his inaugurat ion in March of 1933, shut down all the banks for a \"holiday.\" 40 There weren't many who saw what was happening to th e American people by these machinations of the bankers, but on e who did was Congress- man Louis McFadden, who was quoted as saying: When the Federal Reserve Act was passed, the people of these United States did not perceive that a world banking system was being set up here. A super-state controlled by international bankers a nd interna- tional industrialists acting together to enslave th e world for their own pleasure. Every effort has been made by the Fed to conceal it s powers but the truth is — the Fed has usurped the Government. It controls everything here and it controls all our foreign relations. It makes and breaks governments at will. 41 After the stock market crash had run its course, Co ngressman McFadden charged that: \"The money and credit resources of th e United States were now in the complete control of the banker's alliance be tween J.P. Morgan's First National Bank group, and Kuhn, Loeb's National City Bank.\" On May 23,1933, McFadden brought impeachment charge s against the Federal Reserve Board, the agency he thought had ca used the Stock Market Crash of 1929, with these charges, amongst others: I charge them... with having... taken over $80,000, 000,000 (eighty billion dollars) from the United States Gov ernment in the year 1928.... I charge them... with having arbitrarily and unlawf ully raised and lowered the rates on money,... increased and dimin- ished the volume of currency in circulation for the benefit of private interests...\" And then McFadden expanded his understanding of tho se who benefit- ted in the crash to include the international banke rs: \"I charge them... with- ... having conspired to transfer to foreigners and international money lenders title to and control of the financial resou rces of the United States—\" He then ended with this statement that the cause of the depression was not accidental: \"It was a carefully contrived occur rence... The interna- tional bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as the rulers of us all.\" 42 McFadden had a price to pay for his attempts to exp lain the causes of the depression and the stock market crash: \"On two occa ssions assassins 182"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 THE FEDERAL RESERVE attempted to kill McFadden with gunfire; later he d ied, a few hours after attending a banquet, and there is little doubt that he was poisoned.\" 43 Now that the stock market had crashed; the Federal Reserve took steps reduce the nation's quantity of money: Dates Quantity of money (in billions) June, 1929 (high) $45.7 December, 1929 45.6 December, 1930 43.6 December, 1931 37.7 December, 1932 34.0 June, 1933 (low) 30.0 The quantity of money went from a high of nearly $4 6 billion to a low of $30 billion in just four years. This action of t he Federal Reserve rippled throughout the entire business world to the point w here \"production at the country's factories, mines, and utilities fell by m ore man one-half. The total output of goods and services dropped by one-third.\" 44 In spite of all of the evidence to the contrary, th ere are still those who don't know who, or what, caused the Stock Market Cr ash of 1929. One of these is economist John Kenneth Galbraith, who, in his book The Great Crash, 1929, wrote mat: \"The causes of the Great De pression are still far from certain.\" In fact, Galbraith knows that people did not cause the crash and the resulting depression: No one was responsible for the great Wall Street Cr ash.

Take, for instance, the two articles i n the Portland Oregonian of Saturday, February 24, 1972. The two articles are o n top of one another on the same page. The top article is captioned: \"Reserve Board Raises Lending Rate for Banks\" and the bottom article is entitled: \"Wall St reet Values Plunge.\" Anyone could protect a fortune in the stock market by knowing in advance when the Board was going to take an action that would force the market down. Conversely, a fortune could be made if the advance informa- tion foretold a rise in the market. In fact, the Federal Reserve System doesn't even ha ve to do anything as even a rumored action will cause the stock market t o operate in a downward direction. For instance, a rumor spread on December 16, 1978, that the Federal Reserve System was anticipating a certain a ction, and the market went down! Later another Congressman attempted to investigate the Federal Reserve. Congressman Wright Patman introduced a bil l which would have authorized a full and independent audit of the Syst em by the General Accounting Office. Patman claimed that the audit wa s essential to give the public's elected representatives complete and accur ate information on the internal operations of the System, since they had n ot been audited since their inception in 1913. Patman was frankly astonished by the opposition to his bill. He wrote: \"Although I had anticipated that officials of the F ederal Reserve System would vigorously oppose my bill, I am frankly amaze d by the massive lobbying campaign now underway, to prevent enactmen t of this measure. This itself is further proof, if any is needed, tha t a thorough and independent audit... is an absolute necessity in the public int erest.\" 41 Congressman Patman did score a \"small victory,\" how ever. The Congress passed his bill but attached an amendment that will limit the audit to administrative expenditures only, presumably the expense accounts of the executives of the System, the numbers of pencils pu rchased per employee, etc., hardly what Patman had in mind. Later Congressman Patman, Chairman of the House Ban king Com- mittee, was removed from his Chairmanship after the elections of 1974, because, as one Congressman voting to remove him to ld one of his constit- uents, Patman was \"too old.\" Or maybe \"too smart!\" 184"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Chapter 17 Graduated Income Taxes Author and economist Henry Hazlitt observed in his book Man vs. the Welfare State: In the Communist Manifesto of 1848, Marx and Engels frankly proposed a \"heavy progressive or graduated income tax\" as an instrument by which the proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degrees, all capital from th e bourgeois, to centralize all instruments of production in the han ds of the State, and to make despotic inroads on the right of proper ty... 1 How does the graduated income tax wrest property fr om the \"bour- geois\" (the propertied class?)

In other words, those who belong to unions that claim that they have assisted their member-workers by obtaining a \"cost of living increase,\" pegged to inflation rate increases, have in truth been hurt b y their unions who did not include an increase to provide for the graduated in come tax. What the unions should insist upon is a \"cost of living increase, p lus a graduated income tax increase\" for their members. Notice that this gener ally doesn't happen. In fact, the unions are frequently blamed as being the cause of inflation, a charge not often refuted by the unions. When the Graduated Income Tax was finally passed as the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, there were those who were in support of the Amendment that claimed that the tax imposed was not significant. They argued: No one who had taxable income under five thousand d ollars had to pay any income tax at all. When (the wage earner) reached that sum all he had to pay was four-tenths of one percent—a tax of twenty dollars per year. If he had an income of ten thousand dollars, his ta x was only seventy dollars per year. On an income of one hundred thousand dollars, the t ax was two and one-half percent, or twenty-five hundred do llars. And on incomes of half a million dollars the tax wa s twenty- five thousand dollars or five percent. 2 But even this minimal tax could not fool those who felt that the tax would become an oppressive burden on the American t axpayer in the near future.

One Senator suggested that the rate would in crease to perhaps a rate as high as twenty percent of a taxpayer's income. Senator William Borah of Idaho felt that such specu lation was outrage- ous, declaring: \"Who could ever impose such a confi scatory rate?\" 4 But even with opposition and concern such as this, the Graduated Income Tax became the 16th Amendment to the Constit ution on February 25, 1913.

A monitor of the impact on these income taxes upon the average wage earner is a group called the Tax Foundation, and th ey have coined a name for the day on which the taxpayer actually begins earni ng for himself.

From that day on, what the wage-earner earned belonged to the individual. Even though the tax was sold to the American people as a \"soak the rich\" scheme (making the rich pay the most taxes as a percentage of their income) it is the middle class income wage-earners who pay the majority of the taxes. This point was made clear by an Associat ed Press article on September 13, 1980, headlined: \"Middle-incomers may be a minority, but they pay 60.1% of all taxes.\" 5 The article went on to report that tax returns with incomes: a. under $10,000 accounting for 43.9 percent of nea rly 91 million returns paid only 4.4 percent of the total. b. incomes of from $15,000 to $50,000 were 38.2 per cent of the returns processed and this group paid 60.1 percent of the t ax; and c. incomes of more than $50,000 made 2.4 percent of the tax returns but paid 27.5 percent of the tax. Now that the income tax and the central bank were i n place, the planners could more rapidly increase the size of go vernment. For instance, Franklin Roosevelt was President in 1945 when the F ederal Government spent a total of $95 billion. 1945 was obviously du ring World War II and the people expected a government to increase spending t o pay the costs of the war.

In fact, as will be discussed in a later chapter of this book, government is intentionally wasting money by finding wasteful ways to spend it. If government spending is a goal, then government waste is one easy method to increase government spending. This would, at least partially, explain why such ar ticles as these appear in America's newspapers and magazines, often withou t further action by the government: \"Welfare overpayments pass $1 billion mark.\" 6 \"Billions down the Pentagon drain.\" 7 One other indication that the federal government wa s intentionally wasting money came from an article authored by Dr. Susan L.M. Huck who discovered that for the eighteen years since its in ception in 1954 (until 1972) the budget for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, (the HEW) had grown from $5.4 billion to $80 billion. But the most startling discovery of all was that \"the Establishment Insiders set a 2 7.5 percent annual increase as their goal for the budget... .\" 8 In other words, the budget increases were set accor ding to a pre- determined percentage: the budgets were not set on need, but on spending money. HEW was obligated to spend a certain amount of money each year, whether or not there was a need to spend it! The HE W had to find ways to spend money! Spend, even if you must waste! The spending continued after Dr. Huck's article. Fo r instance, HEW spent over $200 billion in the 1979-80 fiscal year. But this agency is not alone in increasing the spen ding of government. In fact, seminars are now being promoted which inst ruct the attendee on \"How to get More Grants\" from the federal governmen t.

This increase in spending enables the government to increase the deficits each year, thereby causing the national de bt to increase. The increase in this national debt enables those who loan the mo ney to the government the central bank, in the United States the Federal Reserve, to charge interest payments to be paid for by the taxpayer. The connection between government spending and the national debt and its annual interest payments can be illustrated in the following table: Year National debt Per capita Annual interest 1845 15 million $ .74 $ 1 million 1917 3 billion 28.77 24 million 1920 24 billion 228.23 1 billion 1945 258 billion 1,853.00 4 billion 1973 493 billion 2,345.00 23 billion 1979 830 billion 3,600.00 45 billion 1980 1,000 billion 4,500.00 95 billion These unbalanced budgets since 1978 become all the more ludricrous when it is realized tiiat it is against the law to not balance the budget. Public Law 95-435, adopted in 1978, states unequivocally: \"Beginning with the fiscal year 1981, the total budget outlays of the F ederal government shall not exceed its receipts.\" 9 An even more dramatic set of statistics is the figu re of how much the various Presidents of the United States spent each day while they were in office. For instance, George Washington spent, on t he average, $14,000 each day while in office. That daily figure is compared to $1,325,000,000 spent by Jimmy Carter. 10 But President Ronald Reagan will become the unques ti- oned champion in daily spending. It is anticipated by his projected 1988 budget, if he is re-elected in 1984, that he will b e spending $3,087,000,000 each day in 1988 (that is over $3 billion dollars every day.)

Frequently those who join do not truly understand the nature and purpose of the organizati ons they associate with. This strategy was laid down in 1938 by Georgi Dimit rov, a leader of the Comintern, in Russia, who said: \"Let our friends do the work. We must always remember that one sympathizer is generally w orth more man a dozen militant communists. Our friends must confuse the a dversary for us, carry out our main directives, mobilize in favor of our c ampaigns people who do not think as we do, and whom we could never reach.\" 1 THE RHODES SCHOLARSHIPS Cecil Rhodes, who amassed a fortune in the gold and diamond mines in South Africa in the late 1800's with the financial support of the Rothschilds, had a vision (other than making large sums of money ) which motivated him during his lifetime. His purpose \"... centered on h is desire to federate the English-speaking peoples and to bring all the habit able portions of the world under their control.\" 2 Mr. Rhodes' biographer explained who Rhodes thought might be the leader of this world government rather succinctly: \"The government of the world was Rhodes' simple desire.\" 3 After the death of Mr. Rhodes, his will set up a sc holarship program where certain very intelligent young men would be a llowed to study in England. Between two and three thousand men in the prime of life from all over the world would be the recipients of his schol arships so that each one would have \"impressed upon his mind in the most sus ceptible period of his life the dream of the Founder...\" 4 The \"dream of the Founder\" was, of course, a one wo rld government. Some well known American Rhodes Scholars in public life are: Dean Rusk, former Secretary of State; Walt Whitman Rosto w, government official; J. William Fulbright, former Senator; Nicholas Katz enbach, former Attorney General; Frank Church, former Senator; How ard K. Smith, newscaster; Supreme Court Justice Byron White; and Senator Bill Bradley. Those who have studied the voting records and publi c proclamations of these individuals agree that not one is a so-called \"conservative.\" THE FABIAN SOCIETY The Fabian Society is an English organization found ed in 1884. It is named after a third-century Roman General, Quintus Fabius Maximus who successfully defeated Hannibal. The Fabians discovered the secret of the general's strategy: never confront the enemy directly in the open battlefield , but defeat him gradually 193"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 NON-VIOLENT ORGANIZATIONS through a series of small battles, running after ea ch successful foray. Fabius was a successful guerrilla fighter using the simple strategy of patient gradualism. He knew that he couldn't defeat the mig hty armies of Hannibal with an open confrontation because his armies were outnumbered. He never confronted his enemy directly. This is the strategy adopted by the Fabian Society. They decided mat the forces of the free-enterprise system have a superio r philosophy and that their strategy must never be to confront the free-enterpr ise system head on. They must be content with a series of small victories, t he lump sum of which will be a rather stunning victory and the ultimate trium ph of Socialism. Their original symbol was a tortoise, symbolizing t he slow, gradual progress of that animal, but this symbol was later changed to that of a wolf in sheep's clothing \"... which George Bernard Shaw (a member of the Fabian Society) long ago suggested was more appropr iate than the tortoise as a heraldic device for the Fabian Society.\" 5 The philosophy of the Society was simply written in 1887 and each member is obliged to support it. It reads: It (The Fabian Society) therefore aims at the reorg anization of society by the emancipation of land and Industrial Capital from individual and class ownership... The Society accordingly works for the extinction of private property in land.... 6 The Fabian Society acknowledges the principal tenet of Marxism: the abolidon of private property, in this case the righ t to own land. They then align themselves with the non-violent arm of the Ma rxist Conspiracy by accepting the non-violent road of padent gradualism to total government. The enure strategy was detailed by H.G. Wells, the noted science fiction writer, also a member of the Fabian Society, who wr ote: It (will be) left chiefly to the little group of En glish people who founded Fabian Socialism to supply a third system o f ideas to the amplifying conception of Socialism, to convert revo lutionary Socialism to Administrative Socialism. Socialism (will cease) to be an open revolution and will become a plot. George Orwell, also a member of the Fabian Society, in his novel entitled 1984, had his character O'Brien say: \"We k now that no one seizes power with the intendon of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes a revolution in order to establish a dict atorship.\" All of these efforts of all of these Fabian Sociali sts were brought to a head 194"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 NON-VIOLENT ORGANIZATIONS when, in 1905, the Fabian Society hosted a branch o f the Violent Method of Marxist ascendancy to power, the Bolshevik Communis ts. The main purpose of mis meeting in London was for members of the Fabian Society to loan money to the Bolsheviks for the 1905 revolutio n in Russia. John Maynard Keynes, also a member of the Fabian Society , was present at these meetings and later confided to his mother in a lett er after meeting the Bolsheviks, that \"The only course open to me is to be buoyantly Bolshevik.\" 7 Keynes was later to boast mat he shared the Bolshev iks' desire to destroy the free-enterprise system by stating mat his econo mic ideas were going to be \"the euthanasia (a merciful killing) of capitalism. \" Benito Mussolini, the Italian Fascist, read some of the works of Keynes and personally set his approval on one of the books he read. He said: \"Fascism entirely agrees with Mr. Maynard Keynes, d espite the latter's prominent position as a Liberal. In fact, Mr. Keyne s' excellent little book, The End of Laissez-Faire (1926) might, so far as it goes, serve as a useful introduction to fascist economics. There is scarcel y anything to object to in it and mere is much to applaud.\" 8 Keynes' ideas have made him \"by wide agreement the most influential economist of this century,\" 9 according to John Kenneth Galbraith, another economist. But mere are other economists who are familiar with the ideas of Keynes who do not agree. One is Dr. Friederich A. Hayek wh o advised the world that: \"The responsibility for current world-wide inflatio n, I am sorry to say, rests wholly and squarely with the economists who have em braced the teachings of Lord Keynes. It was on the advice and even urgin g of his pupils that governments everywhere have financed increasing par ts of their expenditure by creating money on a scale which every reputable economist before Keynes would have predicted would cause precisely the sort of inflation we have got.\" Unfortunately for the world, they do not listen to Dr. Hayek, even though he was a co-recipient of the 1974 Nobel Memo rial Prize in Economic Science, and the world gets infladon whenever they listen to the economists who have listened to Keynes. THE LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS Sidney Webb, a founder of the Fabian Society, creat ed an economic school intended to teach the ideas of the Socialist s to the sons of the very wealthy. It was called The London School of Economi cs. Its early funding came from the very wealthy: from the Rockefeller Foundation, the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust Fund, and from Mrs. Ernest Elmhirst, the widow of J.P.

THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS Thomas Jefferson attempted to warn the American peo ple about internal conspiracies when he stated: \"Single acts of tyranny may be ascribed to the accidental opinion of a day; but a series of oppressions, begun at a distinguished period and pursued unalterably throug h every change of ministers, too plainly prove a deliberate, systemat ical plan of reducing us to slavery.\" 10 Jefferson attempted to answer the question of those who wonder why nothing changes when they vote in a change in the A merican government by voting for the opposition party. He says, in essenc e, that if nothing changes, it is fair to presume that there is a conspiracy. There are many who believe that the major reason no thing changes during changes in administrations is the Council on Foreign Reladons, (the CFR) formed on July 29, 1921, in New York City. Although the organizadon today has about 2,000 memb ers representing the most elite in government, labor, business, fina nce, communicadons and the academy, it is not well known to the American p eople. The major reason it is basically unknown is because of Article II of the CFR by-laws. This article requires that the meeting s of the membership remain secret, and anyone releasing the contents of these meetings is subject to instant dismissal. The CFR was founded by a group of \"intellectuals\" w ho felt that there was a need for world government and that the people of America were not ready for it. After the League of Nations treaty fa iled to pass the Senate, the founders of the CFR organized this association for the specific purpose of conditioning the people to accept a world governmen t as being a desirable solution to the problems of the world. The founders included many of those who had been at the signing of the Treaty of Versailles after the end of World War I a nd included: Colonel Edward Mandell House, the author of the book Philip Dru, Administrator, Walter Lippmann, later to become one of the Liberal Establishment's favorite syndicated columnist; John Foster Dulles, later to become President Eisenhower's Secretary of State; Allen Dulles, late r to become the director of the Central Intelligence Agency; and Christian Hert er, later to become Dulles' successor as Secretary of State.

The CFR has repeatedly told the American people wha t their goals are through their publications, one of which is a magaz ine called Foreign Affairs. In addition, they frequently print positio n papers, one of which was railed Study No. 7, published on November 25, 1959. This document detailed the exact purpose of the CFR as advocating the \"bui lding (of) a new international order (which) may be responsible to w orld aspirations for peace (and) for social and economic change... An in ternational order- including states labelling themselves as Socialist (Communist).\" 11 The words \"a new international order\" are the catch words for a world government. A former member of the CFR, Rear Admiral Chester Wa rd (USN, ret.), told the American people the following about the in tentions of the organi- zation. He wrote: The most powerful clique in these elitist groups ha ve one objective in common — they want to bring about the surrender of the sovereignty and the national independence of th e United States. A second clique of international members in the CFR ... com- prises the Wall Street international bankers and th eir key agents. Primarily, they want the world banking monopoly fro m whatever power ends up in the control of global gov ernment. They would probably prefer that this be an all-powe rful United Nations organization; but they are also prep ared to deal with and for a one-world government controlled by t he Soviet Communists if U.S. sovereignty is ever surrendered to them. 12 The Reece Committee of Congress, while studying fou ndations, chided the CFR for not being \"objective.\" It said the CFR' s \"productions are not objective but are directed overwhelmingly at promot ing the globalism concept.\" 13 Dan Smoot, one of the earliest researchers into the CFR, summarized the CFR's purpose as follows: \"The ultimate aim of the Council on Foreign Relations... is... to create a one-world socialist system and make the United States an official part of it.\" 14 Rear Admiral Ward told the American people that dle ir overall influ- ence is used for the purpose of \"promoting disarmam ent and submergence of U.S. sovereignty and national independence into an all- powerful one- world government.\" 15 It is now clear mat many of the founders of the CFR , for instance, Walter Lippmann, Allen Dulles, and Christian Herter, also wrote the League of Nations charter, which, it was hoped, would become the world government 197"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 NON-VIOLENT ORGANIZATIONS that the war was fought for (see a later chapter fo r the discussion of the connection between World War I and the one-world go vernment.)

In fact, forty-se ven members of the CFR were members of the United States delegation, inclu ding Edward Stettinius the Secretary of State; John Foster Dulles; Nelson Rockefeller; Adlai Stevenson; and the first Chairman of the UN, Alger Hiss. The CFR has made its presence known in Washington D .C., as well: \"Its roster of members has, for a generation under Republican and Demo- cratic administrations alike, been the chief recrui ting ground for cabinet- level officials in Washington.\" 16 A typical comment about how the CFR is utilized cam e from John McCloy, a member of the CFR, who became Secretary o f War Henry Stimson's Assistant Secretary in charge of personne l. McCloy has recalled: \"Whenever we needed a man we thumbed through the ro ll of the Council members and put through a call to New York (the hea dquarters of the CFR.)\"\" Mr. McCloy's recollections about how the CFR has fi lled important governmental positions is indeed correct. Of the ei ghteen Secretaries of the Treasury since 1921, twelve have been members of th e CFR. Another twelve of the sixteen Secretaries of State have been members. The Department of Defense, created in 1947, has had fifteen Secretaries, including nine CFR members. And the Central Intelli gence Agency, also created in 1947, has had eleven directors, seven of whom belonged to the CFR. Six of the seven Superintendents of West Point, eve ry Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, and every U.S. Ambassador to N .A.T.O. have been members of the CFR. Other positions in the executive branch of governme nt have not gone without notice by the CFR as well. There are four k ey positions in every administration, both Democratic and Republican, tha t have almost always been filled by members of the CFR. They are: Nation al Security Advisor, Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and Secre tary of the Treasury. As a recent confirmation of this fact, President Ro nald Reagan appointed three members of the CFR to these four po sitions: Alexander Haig, Secretary of State; Casper Weinberger, Secret ary of Defense; and Donald Regan, Secretary of the Treasury.

Pogo, the cartoon character, once mused: \"How's I s 'posed to know what to say less'n you tells me how to mink.\" It is one of the purposes of the major media today to tell the American people how to think and what to say, exactly as not ed by Pogo. The CFR has played a major role in this indoctrination by havin g owners, writers, columnists and broadcasters join the CFR. This control over America's media started in 1915, according to a Congressman in office at the time, Oscar Callaway, who placed these comments in the Congressional Record: In March, 1915, the J.P. Morgan interests... got to gether 12 men high up in the newspaper world and employed the m to select the most influential newspapers in the United State s and sufficient number of them to control generally the policy of t he daily press of the United States. These 12 men worked the problem out by selecting 17 9 news- papers, and then began by an elimination process to retain only those necessary for the purpose of controlling. They found it was necessary to purchase control of 25 of the greatest papers. An editor was furnished for each paper to properly supervise and edit information regarding the questions of pre paredness, militarism, financial policies, and other tilings o f national and international nature considered vital to the intere sts of the purchasers. 20 Morgan's early control of the newspapers has been c ontinued through the fact that most of all of the various forms of t he media are either owned by members of the CFR, or employ members.

The fact that Mr. Dinsmore discovered that the New York Times has been supporting the Communist point of view was no new revelation, as there were other voices saying nearly the same thin g. In his book, Witness, Whittaker Chambers, an ex-member of the Communist P arty of the United States, wrote that: \"There is probably no important magazine or newspaper in the country that is not Communist-penetrated to some degree.\" 22 The important thing to realize is that most of the important magazines and newspapers in the United States are owned by or controlled by CFR members. The question as to why the CFR controlled media allows the Communist Party to infiltrate its newspapers and ma gazines is generally not answered by those in the media. Another major way that the people of America, espec ially the young people, are indoctrinated towards a particular poin t of view is through the music of the nation. Someone once wrote: \"I know a very wise man who bel ieves that, if a man were permitted to make all the ballads, he need not care who should make the laws of a nation.\" Ann Landers, nationally syndicated adviser, apparen tly was reluctant to admit that the music the young people were listenin g to was dangerous to their minds, but in October, 1979, she concluded: \" I've been hearing about the filthy rock and roll lyrics for a long time and decided to tune in and listen. Twenty-three years of this column have made me virt ually shock-proof, but some of the lyrics were incredibly crude.\" The filt h of the lyrics was not unintentional. The young people were being used by the recording industry for some very important reasons. One who attempted to make some sense of the reasons for the crudity of the music was the au thor Gary Allen, who wrote: Youth believes it is rebelling against the Establis hment.

It's part of our plot. . . . Drugs a re the most efficient way to revolution...\" 24 A musician, Frank Zappa, the leader of the rock gro up called Mothers of Invention, added this incredible statement: \"The lo ud sounds and bright lights of today are tremendous indoctrination tools . Is it possible to modify the human chemical structure with the right combina tion of frequencies? If the right kind of beat makes you tap your foot, wha t kind of beat makes you curl your fist and strike?\" 25 The thought that music was created for the express purpose of control- ling young people is an alien idea to the parents o f those who listen to the music, so the message in the music had to be concea led in a special language so that only the young people would understand it. It takes very gifted musicians and song writers to write the music in su ch a way that the parents interpret it one way and the young people in anodie r, but this has been the case in the modern music of today. This concealed message was accomplished by many gro ups, but one of the most successful was a rock 'n roll group known as the Beatles. Their pardcular message was intended to teach young peopl e the merits of drug use through such songs as: \"Yellow Submarine\" A \"submarine\" is a \"downer\" drug, one that slows the user down. \"Lucy in the Sky The first initials of the main words in the with Diamonds\" title, \"L,\" \"S\" and \"D\" represent the drug LSD. \"Hey Jude\" The term is widely interpreted as being a song about the drug known as methadrine. \"Strawberry Fields\" Opium poppies are often planted in straw- berry fields to avoid detection. \"Norwegian Wood\" A Britisher's term for marij uana A more recent phenomenon in the music industry is t he preparation of the young people for a Satanic experience through a group of musicians named KISS.

The establishment either owns the major record comp anies outright, or controls them through the ability to make or refuse loans to those record companies mat request them. Those record companies that do not promote the songs the establishment considers important to their goals do not get the loans and thereby do not operate at all. For those who question why the banks make the loans in the first place, the banks can always claim that they are only making loans to those companies that have given the indication mat they will meet the needs of the music-buying public .

THE BILDERBERGERS This group has no known formal name but has been ca lled the Bilder- bergers by the conspiratorialists who first discove red them at their 1954 meeting at the Bilderberg Hotel in Oosterbeek, Holl and. The first Chairman of this group was Prince Bernhar d, the husband of ex-Queen Juliana of the Netherlands (Queen Juliana recently abdicated in favor of her daughter.) This family, known as the H ouse of Orange, is extremely wealthy. Dutch journalist Wim Klingenberg estimated that Queen Juliana owned 5 percent of the stock of Royal Dutch Shell, which was worm approximately $425,000,000 in 1978. It has been reported that she also holds stock in E xxon, the world's largest oil company. Her total wealth has been estimated to be around $2 billion. 28 Her husband, Prince Bernhard, carefully explained h is philosophy a few years ago when he wrote: \"Here comes our greate st difficulty. For the governments of the free nations are elected by the people, and if they do something the people don't like they are thrown out . It is difficult to re- educate the people who have been brought up on nati onalism to the idea of relinquishing part of their sovereignty to a supern ational body... This is the tragedy.\" 29 The Bilderberg organization has been described as b eing: \"like the CFR, another of the formal conspiracies dedicated to cre ating a 'new world order.'

One researcher into this organization reported: \"Bu t even the fragmen- tary reports available indicate that decisions made at these affairs soon become the official policies of governments around the world.\" The importance of this organizadon can be at least partially exhibited by studying the 1966 meedng when a group of relativ ely unknown individ- uals were among the participants. These individuals were: Henry Kissinger of the United States; Palme of Sweden; Bieusheuval of The Netherlands; Gerald Ford of the United States; Helmut Schmidt of West Germany; Rumor of Italy; and Giscard d'Estaing of France; (Mr. d'E staing did not attend the 1966 meeting but was present at the 1968 meeting.) These men were then comparatively unknown, but eigh t years later each was the chief executive of his respective coun try or involved in top-level government positions. 31 Gerald Ford not only attended the 1966 meetings, he also attended the 1962, 1964, 1965 and 1970 meetings. And in fact, Pr ince Bernhard came to the United States in 1952 to campaign for Mr. Ford when he first ran for Congress. A review of the membership lists of other meetings is very revealing, and shows the connection between the very wealdiy of Am erica and those of other countries: 1971: Henry Kissinger; George Ball; Cyrus Vance; David Ro cke- feller; Robert Anderson, president of ARCO; and Bar on Edmond de Rothschild, from France. 1975: Garrett Fitzgerald, Irish Foreign Minister; Denis H ealey, British Chancellor of the Exchequer; Robert McNamar a, World Bank; David Rockefeller; Edmond de Rothschild ; Margaret Thatcher, then the leader of the British C onserva- tive Party, and later the Prime Minister of England ; Father Theodore Hesburgh, President of Notre Dame Universi ty; and William F. Buckley, Jr. The researchers into this organization have found t hat certain of the tax- free foundations have been funding these meetings. For instance, at the 1971 meeting at Woodstock, Vermont: \". . . all expenses... (were) picked up by the two tax-exempt (Ford and Rockefeller) Foundatio ns.\" 32 207"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 NON-VIOLENT ORGANIZATIONS THE TAX-FREE FOUNDATIONS When the Sixteenth Amendment, the Graduated Income Tax, was added to the Constitution, one of the provisions it contained under the legislation mat created it was the ability to creat e tax-free foundations. By mis method, certain wealthy individuals could avoid the graduated features of the income tax. Certain Americans had already set up foundations ma t would become tax-free under the acts of Congress after the impos ition of the Graduated Income Tax. Andrew Carnegie, the steel magnate, and John D. Rockefeller, for instance, set up their tax-free foundations pri or to the income tax laws of 1913. Other foundations have been created by the governme nt under these laws to the point where it is estimated that there are over 100,000 of these organizations now operating in the United States. Dr. Martin Larson, a researcher into the income tax laws and the tax-free foundations, tells the reader of his books that the re are advantages in establishing a foundation: 1. The property conveyed to the foundation is a deduct ible contribu- tion to charity; 2. Upon the death of the donor, it is immune to inheri tance and estate taxes; 3. The fortune or business remains intact; 4. If the donor is a parent-company, this continues in business exactly as before; 5. The foundation is exempt from all taxation in perpe tuity; 6. The individuals who comprise the interlocking direc torate or management are in a strategic position to enrich th emselves by transactions which, though neither charitable nor e thical, are nevertheless quite legal; and even if not, may be p racticed with virtual immunity. 33 In 1952, the 82nd Congress passed House Resolution 561 to set up a \"Select Committee to Investigate Foundations and Co mparable Organizations.\" This Committee was instructed to determine whether or not any of the foundations had been: \"using their resources for un -American and subver- sive activities or for purposes not in the interest s of the United States.\" 34 Congressman B. Carrol Reece, a member of that Commi ttee, has stated: \"The evidence that has been gathered by the staff p ointed to one simple underlying situation, namely that the major foundat ions by subsidizing collectivistic-minded educators, had financed a soc ialist trend in American government.\" 35 The reason mat the foundations are operated in this manner is in part 208"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 NON-VIOLENT ORGANIZATIONS explained by former Communist official Maurice Malk in who testified that, in 1919, a Soviet agent named Ludwig Martens ordere d us \"... to try to penetrate these organizations, if necessary take co ntrol of them and their treasuries; ... that they should be able to finance the Communist Party propaganda in the United States...\" 36 The importance of the collectivistic-minded foundat ions is measured by the endowment funding that they provide for univers ities around the country, as together they stimulate about two-third s of the total. Is this the reason that the large universities usually do not h ave a \"free market\" economist on the staff teaching economics, or a \"co nspiratorialist\" teaching history? The purpose of at least one of these foundations wa s illustrated in a conversation that Norman Dodd, the chief investigat or and director of research for the committee, had with H. Rowan Gaith er, the then President of the Ford Foundation. Mr. Gaidier had asked Mr. D odd to come to the foundation to ask him about the investigation. Duri ng the conversation, Mr. Gaidier told Mr. Dodd: \"all of us here at the polic y-making level have had experience, either in the OSS, or the European Econ omic Administration, with directives from the White House. We operate un der those directives here. Would you like to know what those directives are?\" Mr. Dodd indicated that he would, so Mr. Gaither to ld him: \"The substance of them is that we shall use our grant-ma king power so as to alter our life in the United States that we can be comfor tably merged with the Soviet Union.\" 37 What Mr. Gaither presumably meant was that the Amer ican economy, its military power, its maritime power, etc., all h ad to be lowered so that America could be merged with the Soviet Union in a one-world government. Economically, the then expressed desires of the For d Foundation are coming true. An Associated Press article of August 11, 1981, hea dlined: \"Faltering U.S. now no. 8 in income per person.\" One of the methods the foundations are promoting to reduce America's standard of living is socialism. One researcher, Ga ry Allen, has been studying the several Rockefeller foundations for some time a nd has concluded that he has been: \"unable to find a single project in the h istory of the Rockefeller foundations which promotes free-enterprise.\" 38 That is quite a revelation for a foundation that de rives its funds from the free-enterprise system. As a demonstration that this statement is correct i n the case of another foundation, in this case the Ford Foundation, Henry Ford II, a member of its Board of Directors, resigned his position because h e felt that \"the foundation is a creature of Capitalism. It is hard to discern recognition of this fact in 209"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 NON-VIOLENT ORGANIZATIONS anything the foundation does. It is even more diffi cult to find an understand- ing of this in many of the institutions, particular ly the universities, that are the beneficiaries of the foundation's grant program s. (He was) suggesting to the trustees and the staff that the system mat make s the foundation possible very probably is worth preserving.\" 39 One of the universities mat has been funded by both the many Rocke- feller foundations and the Rockefeller family is th e University of Chicago. One of the instructors at this school is Dr. Milton Friedman, the supposed \"conservative\" free-market economist. Dr. Friedman is on record as saying: \"Over 40 percent of the income of the American peop le is now spent on their behalf by civil servants.... We talk about how we a void Socialism. Yet 48 percent of every corporation is owned by the U.S. g overnment. We are 48 percent Socialist. ... What produced the shift... t o our present 48 percent Socialist society? It was not produced by evil peop le for evil purposes. There was no conspiracy.\" 40 One of the more famous graduates of the University of Chicago is David Rockefeller who received his doctorate in economics there. 41 Dr. Rockefeller shares the view of Dr. Friedman that there is no co nspiracy. THE INSTITUTE OF PACIFIC RELATIONS \"In 1925, the Institute of Pacific Relations (the I PR) was established as an association of national councils... The United S tates council was called the American Institute of Pacific Relations (the AI PR.) From 1925 until 1950, the IPR received 77 percent of its finances f rom American foundations and the AIPR. In turn, the AIPR received 50 percent of its financial support from the Rockefeller Foundation, the Carnegie Corpo ration and the Carnegie Endowment. ... The major institutional con tributions to the AIPR included: Standard-Vacuum Oil (Rockefeller con trolled); Interna- tional General Electric; National City Bank; Chase National Bank (now called the Chase Manhattan Bank, and controlled by the Rockefellers); International Business Machines; International Tele phone and Telegraph; Time, Inc.; J.P. Morgan and Company; Bank of Americ a; and Shell Oil.\" 42 What did the very wealthy get for their investments in the AIPR and the IPR? In 1951 and 1952, the Senate Internal Security Subc ommittee held hearings on the AIPR and the IPR and concluded that : The IPR has been considered by the American Communi st Party and by Soviet officials as an instrument of C ommunist policy, propaganda, and military intelligence. The IPR disseminated and sought to popularize false infor- mation including information originating from Sovie t and Communist sources. 210"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 NON-VIOLENT ORGANIZATIONS Members of the small core of officials and staff me mbers who controlled the IPR were either Communist or pro-Com munist. The IPR was a vehicle used by the Communists to ori entate American far eastern policies toward Communist obje ctives.... 43 Witnesses before the McCarren Committee (have) iden tified forty-seven persons connected with the Institute of Pacific Rela- tions as having been Communists or Soviet agents. 44 The IPR sought to change the minds of the American people about the American goverment's Pacific relations, namely its interest in the Chinese government. One of the ways they accomplished this was to change the thoughts of the American student. For this purpose: \"American schools bought a million copies of IPR-prepared textbooks. The U.S. Government distributed some 750,000 copies of IPR pamphlets to American G.I.'s in the Pacific theater.\" 45 Some of the IPR's members, however, did not complet ely support what the IPR was doing, and attempted to let others know of the particular slant of the IPR. Mr. Alfred Kohlberg, an American busine ssman and a member of the IPR, testified before the Cox Committee that was discussing the Foundations, that he: ... had never paid much attention to what it was pr oducing until 1943 when he saw some material which he found questionable. He men studied an accumulation of IPR material and made a lengthy report which he sent in 1944 to Mr. Carter, the Secretary of the IPR, and to the trustees and others. As a result he came into communication with Mr. Wil lets, a Vice-President of the Rockefeller Foundation. In th e summer of 1945, an arrangement was made, apparently through M r. Willets, for a committee of three persons to hear Mr. Kohlbe rg's charges and his evidence of Communist infiltration and propagan da, and to make a report to IPR and to the Rockefeller Foundat ion. Later, apparently at the insistence of Mr. Carter, Mr. Willets withdrew as mediator. Mr. Carter had indicated that he would take the matter up himself. No investigation was held. The Rockefeller Foundati on nevertheless went right on supporting the Institute . According to Mr. Willet's statement, great reliance was placed upon a special committee of IPR trustees who \"repor ted that the Executive Committee had investigated Mr. Kohlberg's charges and found them inaccurate and irresponsible.\" 46 The overall purpose of the Institute of Pacific Rel ations did not surface 211"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 NON-VIOLENT ORGANIZATIONS until after the Chinese Revolution which ended when the Chinese Commu- nists grabbed control of the government after a ver y bloody and lengthy revolution. The story of the IPR's role in these events started in 1923, when Dr. Sun- Yat-Sen, China's ruler, became enchanted with the i dea of Communism for the whole of China. He began relations with the Rus sian Communists and accepted their advice, \"... since he was a friend a nd admirer of Lenin, a devotee of the economic philosophies of Karl Marx.. . . 47 Sun-Yat-Sen sent his heir apparent, Chiang Kai Shek , to Moscow to learn the merits of the Communist philosophy. But s omeone else had other advice for him, and sent him a copy of a book \"...c alled The Social Interpretation of History by a New York dentist nam ed Maurice Willi- am... a charter member of the Socialist Party. But intimate association with the Socialist hierarchy led him (William) to the co nclusion that such radicals are escapists and frauds. He broke with the Sociali st Party and set down his reasons in this book... \" 48 The book had an enormous impact on Dr. Sun-Yat-Sen, who: \"read and re-read William's book. Within months he had repudi ated the Communists and was working to establish a Republic like that o utlined by our own Founding Fathers in the Constitution of the United States.\" 49 Sun-Yat-Sun ruled for two more years before his dea th in 1925 made Chiang the ruler of China. It was about this time t hat Chiang was undergo- ing a religious experience after meeting May Lin So ong, the daughter of a Christian missionary. After Chiang went to her fami ly asking for her hand in marriage, he became a Christian himself. This oc curred in 1927, after Chiang expressed a liking for the quality and dedic ation of those who he knew were Christians. One who knew Chiang during th is period was Dr. Walter Judd, a Christian missionary and later an Am erican Congressman, who testified that this was the main reason Chiang had forsaken his religion to become a Christian. It was no coincidence, then, that the Chinese Commu nist Revolution began in 1927 as well, started by Chou En Lai and M ao Tse Tung, amongst others. Chiang began a change in the basic direction of the Chinese government when on May 5, 1931, he convened a People's Convent ion of 447 delegates, elected by the farmers' associations, labor unions, Chambers of Commerce and other businessmen's associations, educational a nd professional associa- tions, and the Kuomintang, Sun-Yat-Sen's political party. These delegates were not directly elected by the people, but were e lected by the members of the various associations and organizations. Chiang was attempting to do two things with this co nvention: 1. He wanted the delegates to adopt a Provision al Constitution, the first ever for China, and 212"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 NON-VIOLENT ORGANIZATIONS 2. He was hoping that he could turn over some o f the authority he possessed to the people themselves, through thei r elected representatives. The Convention did indeed adopt a Provisional Conti tution, and it was hoped and anticipated that the people could elect t heir own convention directly by popular vote four years later, in 1935. In addition to the Constitution, the convention pro mised the Chinese people that the government would: 1. develop all natural resources along modern lines; 2. modernize agricultural methods; 3. increase the production of raw materials; 4. establish new industries to manufacture and process the nation's raw materials; 5. extend the nation's communications, including railw ays, high- ways, and airlines; 6. undertake vigorously forestation and river control; 7. guarantee protection to all who invest their money in productive enterprises; 8. provide measures for the harmonious cooperation of capital and labor; 9. simplify the currency; 10. encourage investment of hoarded capital; and 11. place taxation on a scientific basis. 50 Chiang's government was called the Nationalist gove rnment of China and many have praised it for the dramatic changes i t was making in the method of governing the Chinese people, and for the important benefits it was offering them. One such supporter was Dr. Arthur Young, the financ ial advisor to the Chinese government from 1929 to 1946. He wrote: \"Wh en the Nationalist government took over, they set out on a program of financial rehabilitation. During the period from 1928 to 1937, they succeeded in unifying and stabilizing the currency. They developed quite prom ptly very large revenues from the customs and internal revenue with the resu lt that the Government had a large degree of financial stability by 1937.\" 51 In other words, Chaing's government was benefiting the Chinese people by protecting the value of their money by en ding the destructive influences of inflation. Also, when government func tions to protect the rights of the people, and their money is stable, a middle class develops. Professor John Fairbank, certainly no supporter of Chiang, had to admit in his book The United States and China that: \"The National 213"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 NON-VIOLENT ORGANIZATIONS government of China at Nanking in the decade from 1 927 to 1937 was the most modern and effective that China had known.\" 52 However, China's experiment with democracy started to experience exterior problems when Japan attacked Shanghai, Chi na, on August 13 1937. Suddenly Chiang had a two-front war: on one f ront he was repelling the Japanese invaders, and on the other his troops were fighting the Chinese Communists. The attack by Japan caused the most problems, howev er, as \"... the Japanese rapidly overran the principal cities and d estroyed the sources of revenue. The Chinese government, therefore, was for ced to rely on paper money as their main financial resource available fo r the purpose of fighting the war.\" 53 The Chinese government was in need of allies, and t hey turned to America after Japan attacked at Pearl Harbor. Chian g sent the following telegram to President Roosevelt on December 8, 1941 : \"To our new common battle, we offer all we are and all we have to stan d with you until the Pacific and the world are freed from the curse of brute for ce and endless perfidy.\" 54 America, in addition to fighting Japan after Pearl Harbor, was also at war with Italy and Germany and became the ally of R ussia, also fighting the Germans in Europe. America's solution to the war, especially during th e early stages, was what it called Lend Lease: the equipping of the mil itary forces of its allies. However, America's priorities seemed a bit out of o rder, as in some cases it chose to equip its soldiers after its allies. America decided to equip its soldiers in the Europe an theater first; its ally Russia second; General Douglas MacArthur's mil itary forces in the Pacific theater third, and China last. Aid to Russi a's military forces had higher priority than America's fighting forces in t he Pacific. And Chiang never received more than five percent of America's war material during the course of the war. Chiang, desperate for assistance \". . . arranged for a loan of $250 million in gold from the United States to stabilize his mon ey. The man in charge of delivering the gold to China was Assistant Secretar y of the Treasury Harry Dexter White (a) Soviet agent (and a member of the CFR.) Over a period of three and a half years, White shipped only $27 mill ion of the $250 million that had been promised Chiang.\" 55 Notice that Mr. White broke the law by not deliveri ng the aid that Congress had voted. But the story does not end ther e, as: \"In 1945, Congress voted a second loan, this one of $500 million—but n ot one cent of tins ever reached China. Again, Soviet agent Harry Dexter Whi te was the culprit. China's currency collapsed.\" 56 Even with all of these problems, Chiang continued t he fight against 214"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 NON-VIOLENT ORGANIZATIONS both the Communists and the armies of Japan. After the war ended in 1945, Chiang called a National Assembly on November 15, 1 946, to approve a permanent constitution, which was approved on Decem ber 25, 1946. The plan was for this constitution to go into effect on e year later, in 1947. The new constitution provided for a social insuranc e system and for government management of the public utilities, but also contained a \"Bill of Rights\" to guarantee personal liberty and rights fo r the citizens of China. It also provided for the first nationwide election hel d in China (there had never been an election in China) on November 21 through 2 3, 1947. The constitution also planned the convening of a Na tional Assembly on March 29, 1948, where 1,744 delegates were to selec t the president and vice president of China. Chiang repeatedly refused to run for the presidency of China, but the delegates to the Convention elected him for a six-y ear term by a vote of about seven to one. But the Communists would not accept the popular man date of the Convention and they continued their aggressive atta ck against Chiang's newly elected government. But Chiang's enemy was not the Japanese government, nor even the Communists under the leadership of Chou En Lai and Mao Tse Tung. It was the American government and Secretary of State George Marshall, a member of the CFR. Secretary Marshall took measures in 1946 to impose \"an embargo on the sale and shipment of arms from the United States... .\" 57 Using Marshall's own boastful language: \"As Chief o f Staff I armed 39 anti-Communist divisions, now with a stroke of the pen I disarm them.\" 58 Chiang's elected government was doomed to failure a nd the Commu- nists under Mao and Chou finally succeeded in forci ng Chiang and his government to leave the mainland of China and to mo ve his armies onto the offshore Chinese islands of Formosa. The pressure mounted on the American government to recognize the Communists as the legitimate government of China. T his pressure was in part assisted by the appearance of twenty-nine book s published during the period of 1943 to 1949. John T. Flynn, in his book While You Slept, reviewed these books and classified twenty-two of them as be ing \"pro-Communist\" and the other seven as being \"anti-Communist.'' The twenty-two books were reviewed with what Flynn called \"glowing approval\" in literary reviews appearing in the New York Times, the Herald Tribune , The Nation, The New Republic, and the Saturday Review of Literature . Nine authors wrote twelve of these books and these same nine authors submitted forty-three reviews. In other words, the same pro-Communist authors were reviewing the pro-Communist books, eit her neglecting the 215"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 NON-VIOLENT ORGANIZATIONS anti-Communist books or ridiculing them. The general line of the pro-Communist books was tha t Chou and Mao were \"agrarian reformers\" seeking to change the ten ure of the land from the large landowners to the poor peasants. For instance , even George Marshall in 1946 said this about the Communism of Mao and hi s followers: \"Don't be ridiculous. These fellows are just old-fashioed agr arian reformers.\" 59 Chiang and his supporters were now safely ensconced on the islands of Formosa, and it is now possible, with hindsight, to see what type of government Chiang gave the Taiwanese, the people wh o were on the islands before Chiang and his followers appeared. Taiwan developed a true agrarian reform where today seventy-five percent of the farm land is owner-cultivated. This reform was achieved without a bloody revolution. In addition, Chiang Kai Shek and his successors, ha ve been elected by the people of Formosa, and Mao and his successors o n mainland China have never allowed the Chinese the opportunity to freely elect their rulers. Congressman Eldon Rudd in 1979 issued a message fur ther detailing the differences between the mainland Chinese government of the Communists and the Taiwanese government of Chiang and his succ essors: \"With 270 times the land area and 53 times the population, th e Gross National Product of Mainland China is only 10 times the G.N.P. of Ta iwan... The figures I have cited illustrate beyond contradiction the mate rial abundance created by freedom's climate. In my view, this is the smallest and least important of the remarkable differences between the People's Republi c of China and the free government of Taiwan. The true difference is spirit —the human condition, the absence of compulsion and regimentation, the pr esence of individual opportunity.\" 60 What was the cost of the Chinese Revolution spawned by Secretary of State George Marshall, Harry Dexter White, and the Communists Mao Tse Tung and Chou En Lai? In 1971, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary issu ed a twenty-eight page document entitled \"The Human Cost of Communism in China\" that concluded that Chou and Mao, were \"responsible for the deaths of as many as 64 million people.\" 61 In addition to the deaths of as many as 64 million Chinese, the Commu- nist government has other areas of progress to be p roud of. Valentin Chu is a professional journalist who was born and raised i n China but who escaped from the Communist regime. He wrote a book in 1963 called Ta Ta, Tan Tan, the Inside Story of Communist China. Mr. Chu d evotes a chapter to Communist efforts to destroy the family, from which the following was taken: 216"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 NON-VIOLENT ORGANIZATIONS The family everywhere is man's source of strength a nd cour- age as well as his emotional harbor at times of nat ural disaster and personal misfortune. In China it was even more so. It was society itself . The Chinese Communists were acutely aware that thei r control of the people could never be effective unle ss the monolithic family system was destroyed, along with religion an d conventional morals. This they set out to do as soon as they came to pow er. 62 Another move of the Chinese Communists to destroy t he family was to move the Chinese mothers away from the home and int o the fields as farm workers. As the Boston Globe put it on January 31,1 973: \"Ninety percent of the women work in factories and on farms and then a ttend school,\" 63 which obviously leaves little time to function as wives, mothers and homemakers. A related move, according to Chu, was the commune s ystem, which summarily put men, women, children and the aged in segregated labor camps, destroyed ancestral graves, and reduced mari tal relations to brief, Party-rationed sex-breaks. 64 But there are some who feel that all of these costs , the sixty-four million dead, the destruction of the family, and the establ ishment of the commune, was worth the price. David Rockefeller said this about the cost of the R evolution after his return from a visit to China in 1973: Whatever the price of the Chinese Revolution, it ha s obviously succeeded not only in producing a more efficient an d dedicated administration but also in fostering high morale an d community of interest.... The social experiment of China under Chairman Mao's leadership is one of the most important and success ful in human history. 65 This statement by Rockefeller was a little more tha n three years after Chairman Mao urged the \"World to defeat U.S.\" by ap pealing to the peoples of the world to: \"Unite and defeat the U.S. aggress ors and all their running dogs.\" 66 The American policy towards Communist China was now due for a change. It was now time for the American government to recognize the Communists as the legitimate government of the Chin ese people and to break all diplomatic relations with the Taiwanese g overnment of Chiang and his successors. On July 15, 1971, Premier Chou En Lai, on behalf of the People's Republic of China, according to a press re lease issued by President Richard Nixon's staff: \"extended an invitation to P resident Nixon to visit 217"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 NON-VIOLENT ORGANIZATIONS China at an appropriate date before May, 1972. Nixo n accepted the invita- tion with pleasure.\" 67 It was no coincidence that President Nixon accepted that invitation on July 15, 1971, the very day that Radio Peking, Chin a's official radio station. issued the following statement: \"People of the Worl d, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their running dogs.\" 68 The American press and President Nixon refused to a cknowledge the hypocrisy of the Chinese government and accepted th e invitation the same day they were calling for a world wide revolution a gainst the United States. Nixon's support of Red China was strange, indeed. A s a Presidential candidate in 1968, Nixon said: \"I would not recogni ze Red China now, and I would not agree to admitting it to the United Nat ions...\" 69 And in his book, Six Crises, he wrote: \"admitting Red China to the United Nations would be a mockery of the provision of the Charter which limits its member- ship to 'peace-loving nations.' And what was most d isturbing was that it would give respectability to the Communist regime w hich would immensely increase its power and prestige in Asia, and probab ly irreparably weaken the non-Communist governments in that area.\" 70 So President Nixon went to China and opened the doo rs to the Chinese Communist government of Mao and Chou. The next step in America's betrayal of the Chinese people came in 1976 when first Chou En Lai and later Mao Tse Tung passe d away. The tributes that flowed from the mouths of the world's leaders about these two bloody butchers was amazing. These comments were made about Chou En Lai by the f ollowing individuals: Gerald Ford: \"Chou will be long remembered as a rem arkable leader.\" Secretary of State Henry Kissinger: \"I admired Chou En Lai very much.\" Former President Richard Nixon: \"Chou's legacy will be that he helped end the darkness. Only a handful of men i n the 20th century will match Premier Chou's impact on world h istory.\" These comments were made about Mao Tse Tung: Premier Pierre Trudeau of Canada: \"The People's Rep ublic of China stands as a monument to the spirit and pol itical philo- sophy of Chairman Mao. Canadians recognize the path -breaking spirit of community that, under Chairman Mao's guid ance, had contributed to the modernization of China.\" President Gerald Ford: \"Mao was a very remarkable a nd a very great man.\" 218"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 NON-VIOLENT ORGANIZATIONS Secretary of State Henry Kissinger: Mao was \"one of the titans of the age.\" Former President Richard Nixon: \"A visionary poet, deeply steeped in the history of the Chinese people.\" The New York Times: \"a moralist who deeply believed - ... mat man's goodness must come ahead of his mere economic progress.\" Boston Globe: \"the symbol of millions of human bein gs around the world for the possibility of social chan ge, of economic and political progress, of dignity for the exploite d.\" These efforts came to a head in December, 1978, whe n the American government recognized the Chinese Communists as the official and legiti- mate government of China, after fifty-five years of accepting the governments of Sun-Yat-Sen and Chiang Kai Shek as the represent atives of the Chinese people. Others did not approve of the move of the American government. One, a former Chinese citizen, Dr. Chiu-Yuan Hu, told a Congressional Commit- tee in Washington: \"To recognize the Chinese Red Re gime is to discourage the people in the whole world.... It will make the world know that the great nation of the United States is unworthy to be a fri end, that it sometimes betrays its most loyal allies.\" 72 Senator Barry Goldwater was one who felt mat the mo ve was improper. He told a news conference: \"I have no idea what mot ivated him other than (that) the Trilateral Commission, composed of banke rs in this country and others, want to expand big business. This is a dang erous thing because it puts fear in our allies, especially our small allie s, as to how the U.S. will keep its word.\" Arizona Daily Star (Tucson), Dec. 17, 19 78, p. A-11. But the final betrayal to the Chinese people occurr ed on January 1,1979, when President Jimmy Carter severed diplomatic rela tions with the only elected government China has ever had, the governme nt on Taiwan, and went so far as to state that the United States posi tion was that: \"there is but one China, and Taiwan is part of China.\" Arizona Da ily Star (Tucson), Dec. 16, 1978, p. A-l. The Nationalist government on Taiwan took the betra yal rather bitterly but stated that they would \"neither negotiate with the Chinese Communist regime nor compromise with Communism.\" Both moves caused Senator Barry Goldwater to charge that President Carter's motives were economic, saying that \"he did it for the big banks of the world — Chase Manhattan and the French bankers — an d for companies like Coca-Cola.\" 72 Ronald Reagan called the break with Taiwan a \"betra yal.\" The hypocrisy of the entire China scenario was dram atically illustrated in May, 1979, when the New York Times ran a picture showing Commerce 219"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 NON-VIOLENT ORGANIZATIONS Secretary Juanita Kreps in China touring the Great Wall of China, and she was smiling and apparently enjoying herself.

Mr. Luttwak wrote an article for the April, 1977, R eader's Digest in which he asked a series of questions: Why have Amirican journalists failed to convey to u s such fundamental Chinese realities? After all, the miser able poverty of the country is everywhere in evidence. Why, moreover, have previous visitors not been revo lted by the schoolrooms where children are taught from booklets replete with the brutal images of harsh class-war propaganda? Why have our \"Asia scholars\" failed to denounce the milita- rism of a system where the cheapest suit of clothin g for little boys is a mini-uniform complete with rifle? And above all, how could they have missed the centr al pheno- menon of (Red) Chinese life: its unique, almost pur e totalitarianism? But it was too late. Secretary of State George Mars hall, the Institute of Pacific Relations, and modern politicians had betra yed the only elected government of China and replaced it with the most b rutal and bloody government on the face of the earth. China was now truly Communist. THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF CHURCHES In 1831, Alexis de Tocqueville, a young Frenchman, was sent to the United States by the French government to study Ame rica's prisons and penetentiaries. Upon his return to France, he wrote a book titled D emocracy in America, an examination into the reasons why Americ a had been successful in its experiment with a republican form of governm ent. He summarized his findings thus: I sought for the greatness and genius of America in her ferule fields and boundless forests; it was not there. 220"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 NON-VIOLENT ORGANIZATIONS I sought for it in her free schools and her institu tions of learning; it was not there. I sought for it in her matchless constitution and d emocratic Congress; it was not there. Not until I went to the churches of America and fou nd them aflame for righteousness did I understand the great ness and genius of America. America is great because America is good. When America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great. On December 2, 1908, Walter Rauschenbusch and Harry Ward formed the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in Americ a, commonly called the Federal Council of Churches, (the FCC.) Dr. Rauschenbusch was a theologian who wrote: \"If e ver Socialism is to succeed, it cannot succeed in an irreligious countr y.\" 74 Dr. Harry Ward, a teacher at the Union Theological Seminary, was identified under oath as a member of the Communist Party by Manning Johnson, also a member. Mr. Johnson referred to Dr. Ward as \"the chief architect for Communist infiltration and subversion in the religious field.\" 75 The organization that these two created received a percentage of their income from a rather unusual, but not unexpected, s ource: \"... John D. Rockefeller Jr. (who) had, from 1926 to 1929, contr ibuted over $137,000 to the Federal Council of Churches — a sum equal to about ten percent of its total annual income from all sources.\" 76 Odiers became aware of the FCC as well. In 1927, Co ngressman Arthur M. Free introduced a resolution in the House of Rep resentatives describing the Federal Council of Churches as a \"Communist org anizauon aimed at the establishment of a state-church...\" 77 The FCC partially repaid the support of the wealthy when, in 1942, it issued a platform calling for \"a world government, international control of all armies and navies, a universal system of money, and a democratically controlled international bank.\" 78 The pressure against the FCC became too intense as the knowledge of its activities grew. So, the FCC decided to change its name but not its direction. On November 29, 1950, the FCC became the National C ouncil of the Churches of the Church of Christ, (the NCC.) The direction of the NCC was no different from that of the FCC. This was revealed in an interview with Gus Hall, the Gen eral Secretary of the Communist Party, USA, that appeared in the July 15, 1968, Approach magazine. Mr. Hall declared that Communism and the Church (apparently the NCC) share so many goals that \"they ought to ex ist for one another.\" Hall continued by citing \"current Red goals for Ame rica as being 'almost 221"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 NON-VIOLENT ORGANIZATIONS identical to those espoused by the Liberal Church. We can and we should work together for the same things.' \" 79 Whatever the NCC was offering, many found it attrac tive. One \"church,\" the Church of Satan, led by \"high priest\" Anton LaVey of San Francisco, recently became a member of the NCC. 80 THE WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES This world-wide organization was formed on August 2 3, 1948, and follows much the same course as the National Counci l of Churches. One example of this similarity is the fact that the secretary-General of the World Council (the WCC) in 1975, Philip Potter, said he \"may some- times be more radical than most Marxists.\" 81 Another official in the WCC has echoed Mr. Potter's sentiments. In 1982, Emilio Castro, the head of the Council's Comm ission on World Mission and Evangelism, said: \"The philosophical ba sis of capitalism is evil, totally contrary to the Gospel.\" 82 These expressions of support for Marxism and agains t the free enter- prise system are shared by those who attended their global conferences. In the meeting in November, 1975, the Jamaican Prime Minis ter, Michael Manley, told the assemblage of delegates: \"that Christendom must help destroy the capitalist system and create a new world economic o rder. His speech... re- ceived prolonged applause... .\" 83 The WCC puts its money where its convictions are. T he organization has created a Program to Combat Racism, (the PCR.) Since 1970, this organizadon has given over $5,000,000 to more than 130 organizations that are ostensibly fighting racism in thirty countries. But nearly half of that money has gone to guerillas seeking the violent overthrow of white regimes in Southern Africa. 84 But the WCC is rather selective in that \"not a cent of PCR money goes to dissident groups in the Soviet Union...\" 85 This is curious since it is estimated that there ar e nearly 5,000,000 Russians in 3,000 forced labor concentration camps in Russia. One who should know is Avraham Shifrin, a Russian who was e xiled by the Russian government in 1970 and who is executive director of the Research Center for Prisons, Psychprisons and Forced Labor Concentratio n Camps of the U.S.S.R. He has stated that \"the largest group of i ndividuals in the concen- tration camps is made up of faithful Christians\" wh o are there strictly and solely because they are Christians. 86 FREEMASONRY In 1871, a Freemason named Albert Pike copyrighted an 861 page book titled Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry prepared for the Supreme Council of the Thirty-Third Degree 222"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 NON-VIOLENT ORGANIZATIONS for the outhern Jurisdiction of the United States a nd Published by its Authority. Many historians believe that Mr. Pike wr ote the book himself. He had an interesting background. Many historians c laim that he was selected by Guiseppe Mazzini to head the IIluminati in the United States. In addition, he became a brigadier general in the Conf ederate Army during the Civil War. Mazzini wrote Pike in January, 1870, about the need to create a \"super- rite\" inside the traditional Masonic order: We must allow all of the federations (the Masons) t o continue just as they are.... We must create a super-rite, which will remain unkn own to which we will call those Masons of high degree whom we shall select.... These men must be pledged to the strictest secrecy. Through this supreme rite, we will govern all Freem asonry which will become the one international center, the more powerful because its direction will be unknown. 87 Mazzini's letter was written before Pike wrote his study of the thirty-two degrees of Masonry titled Morals and Dogma so it is conceivable that his book, which Pike states is not \"intended for the wo rld at large,\" is intended for this \"super-rite\" inside the Masons. In any eve nt, its contents are extremely revealing as can be illustrated from the following gleaning of some of its more salient points. The book makes the statement that Masonry is a reli gion: \"Every Masonic Lodge is a temple of religion, and its teac hings are instructions in religion.\" \"Masonry is a worship....\" He later iden tified what it was that Masonry worshiped: \"Behold the object, the end, the ultimate annihilation of evil and restoration of Man to his first estate by Reason....\" \"In the beginning was... the word... the Reason that speaks .\" \"The Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Masonry has become... a t eacher of great truths, inspired by an upright and enlightened reason.\" \"Re ason is the absolute, for it is in it we must believe.\" Pike stated what the greatest delight of his \"relig ion of reason\" would be when \"Human reason leaps into the throne of God and waves her torch over the ruins of the universe.\" He ridiculed Christianity: \"The teachers, even of C hristianity, are in general the most ignorant of the true meaning of th at which they teach.\" \"... Jesus of Nazareth was but a man like us....\" ( Masonry) ...sees in Jesus (a) great teacher of morality.\" And a belief in God: \"Self,... the true ruler of th e Universe.\" \"The conception of an Absolute Deity outside of or indep endent of Reason is the 223"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 NON-VIOLENT ORGANIZATIONS idol of Black Magic.\" Pike's religion has many of the objects and beliefs of traditional Christianity: an altar (\"Masonry, around whose alta rs...\"); a \"born again experience: (Initiation [into the Mysteries] was co nsidered to be a mystical death... and the [initiate] was then said to be reg enerated, new born...\") and a baptism: (... baptism... [is a symbol] of pur ification necessary to make us perfect Masons.\") Pike identifies the subject of Masonic worship: \"Lu cifer, the Light- Bearer! Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! It is he w ho bears the Light...\" He limits the individual's God-given right to life: \"It is not true to say mat 'one man, however little, must not be sacrifice d to another, to a majority or to all men.' That is not only a fallacy, but a m ost dangerous one. Often, one man and many men must be sacrificed, in the ord inary sense of the word, to the interests of the many.\" And finally, Mr. Pike states what the ultimate goal of the Masons was: \"... the world will soon come to us for its soverei gns (political leaders) and pontiffs (religious leaders.) We shall constitute t he equilibrium of the universe and be rulers over the masters of the worl d.\" The goal of the Masons, according to Mr. Pike, is t o become the \"rulers over the masters of the world.\" The secret power behind the power! 224"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Chapter 19 Population Control Dr. Paul Ehrlich wrote a book entitled The Populati on Bomb in which he prophesied: \"It is already too late to avoid fam ines that will kill millions, possibly by 1975.\" Ehrlich also predicted: \"the total pollution and de ath of the world's oceans by 1979.\" 1 Harper's magazine for January, 1970, carried a full -page advertisement titled: \"Whatever your cause, it's a lost cause unl ess we control population.\" The article urged the American government to: \"Cont rol the flood of humanity that threatens to engulf the earth.\" Kenneth Boulding, a University of Colorado economis t, warned the world in February, 1973, that the human population must stop growing: \"or in several hundred years there will be standing roo m only.\" 2 The belief that the world was suffering from a \"pop ulation explosion\" and was in danger of having only enough room on the eardi for people to stand on each other's heads in a few centuries can be quickly illustrated as a giant fraud by the use of simple mathematics. Oregon, a rather small state by comparison to other s in the United States, has a total of 95,607 square miles inside i ts borders. The world has 225"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19 POPULATION CONTROL approximately 4,000,000,000 (four billion) inhabita nts. If the entire population of the world moved to Oregon, all four b illion, and left the remainder of the world completely devoid of human l ife, a family of four would have a piece of Oregon approximately 50' by 5 3'. This is about half the size of a typical residential lot in a subdivision. The people of the world have been told that the rea son there is starvation in India is because their population is too large f or their food production. But a thoughtful review of that nation's history wi ll reveal that India has been starving for many centuries, even though their population was much smaller in the past and the size of their country h as remained constant. Could there be another explanation for India's star ving population other than that there are just too many people? Could the reason be that India has a Socialist gove rnment that believes that whatever an individual produces belongs to the state? Could it be that this Socialist government has destroyed the incenti ve to produce? And has done so for centuries? India has approximately 500 people per square mile living within its borders, Japan has approximately 700, and Holland a pproximately 800. But notice that Japan and Holland have far more prosper ous economies than does India, because Holland and Japan basically all ow their producers to keep what they produce. The \"population explosion\" was, then, a giant fraud . But it is interest- ing to see what solutions were being offered to thi s imaginary problem. One came from a Washington psychologist and sex the rapist who suggested: \"that the world's nations remove 'the ri ght to reproduce' from their people as the only solution to the global pop ulation explosion... by such means as placing temporary sterilizing chemica ls in food and water supplies... whether or not it was with the individu al's approval and consent.\" 3 Another individual said that the United States had too many people. He saw the problem and offered a solution: \"It is nece ssary that the United States cut its population by two-thirds within the next 50 years, according to Howard Odum, a marine biologist at the University o f Florida. Odum said that the nation will be unable to support the prese nt population of 225 million. Once the population is cut to 75 million.. . it could be stably employed in subsistence agriculture.\" 4 How Odum intended to cut the population was not men tioned by the article. Perhaps he planned on \"executing them in a kindly manner.\" John Maynard Keynes, the Fabian Socialist-Communist , also had some comments to make about the population explosion: \"T he time has already come when each country needs a considered national policy about what size of population, whether larger or smaller than at pr esent or the same, is most 226"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19 POPULATION CONTROL expedient. And having settled this policy, we must take steps to carry it into operation. The time may arrive a little later when the community as a whole must pay attention to the innate quality as well as the mere number of its future members.\" 5 As far as the article reported, Mr. Keynes did not explain just how he planned on limiting the size of the population. It must be frustrating for people like Keynes to see a problem and not be able to explain to the people that their solution is the mass killing of those th ey consider to be excess population. It must be difficult for Keynes and the odiers to explain to those they wish to see murdered that it is important that they the so that odiers might live. India has taken steps to control its population gro wth by the use of forced sterilization of its citizens. In the Indian states of Maharashtra, for instance, where Bombay is located, all men up to ag e 55 and women to age 45 must be sterilized within six months after the b irth of their third child. Couples with 3 children who have no child under the age of 5 are exempt— but they must have an abordon if pregnancy occurs. 6 In fact, during one period of a \"special emergency,\" the Indian governm ent performed some 10 million forced sterilizations. 7 China is still the leading nation in populadon cont rol, however. They are currently limiting each family to one child. \"T hose who have more will not get radons for them.\" 8 The decision about birth, as well as death, has bec ome a \"collective decision,\" according to a Chinese physician, wherei n: \"the residents in each street get together and decide how many babies will be born during the year.... Those who are obliged by collective decisi on to forego pregnancy are not permitted the excuse that they forgot to ta ke the pill. A volunteer- ... distributes pills each morning when the women a rrive at their place of work.\" 8 One of the lingering Chinese customs, even with all of the Communist attacks on the family structure, is the tradition t hat male children must provide for their parents in their old age. Now tha t China is limiting the family to only one child, many Chinese couples are concerned that, if their first child is a female, they will not be provided for in their older years, and they are murdering their female offspring. In fact, many of the parents are leaving their dead female child at the doorstep of the local Communist Party headquarters. 10 But not only is China controlling the birdi of its citizens as a means of controlling its population size, but it is also con trolling the death of its elderly. In a government report entitled Communist Persecution of the Church in Red China and North Korea, dated March 26 , 1959, it is reported that: \"All the elderly people 60 years of age and a bove who cannot work are 227"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19 POPULATION CONTROL put in the old people's 'Happy Home.' After they ar e placed in the home they are given shots. They are told these shots are for their health. But after the shots are taken, they the within two weeks.\" 11 In addition, the solutions to the imaginary populat ion explosion are affecting those of the middle age as well. In an es say entitled \"An Interna- tional Mortality Lottery,\" students in America read about a lottery: \"... that would solve the world over-population crisis. Each year, 5 percent of the earth's inhabitants between the ages of 30 and 40 w ould be exterminated...\" 12 But, in summary, there is another purpose for the m yth of over- population. It was summed up in a Reader's Digest a rticle, written by Laurence Rockefeller, the brother of David Rockefel ler, entitled \"The Case for a Simple Life-Style.\" The article read, in part ,: \"In total, this all adds up to a new pattern of living... If we do not follow i t voluntarily and demo- cratically, it may be forced upon us. Some economis ts and analysts argue mat, if we continue consuming resources as we are n ow, the only way to bring about a balance between demand and supply wil l be through author- itarian controls. Robert Heilbroner, the distinguis hed economist, is particularly pessimistic about the capacity of a de mocratic and capitalist state to impose the discipline necessary to survive in a world of scarcity.\" 13 So the reason for the \"population explosion\" is tot al government control of not only the citizen but his environment as well. This transfer of authority from the individual to the state is furth er supported by another individual, Zbigniew Brzezinski, who wrote: \"I thin k we accept the idea of a vast expansion in social regulation. It may take su ch forms as legislation for the number of children, perhaps even legislation de termining the sex of children once we have choice, the regulation of the weather, the regulation of leisure, and so forth.\" 14 Once again, as in the case of the organizations dis cussed in the previous chapter, it becomes important to ask just who has b een paying for the \"population explosion\" campaign. Once again, the in quisitive find the money of the tax-free foundation: \"the first large foundations to make grants in the population field were the Rockefeller Founda tion and the Carnegie Foundation. These foundations were joined by the Fo rd Foundation...\" 15 And the \"Rockefellers put money into the population -control move- ment by financing the Population Council, Planned P arenthood and The Population Reference Bureau.\" 16 But those in China who murder female babies because they are the wrong sex, are not alone. Others emulate their beha vior in America: \"Doctors around the country (the United States) hav e begun helping some pregnant women kill their unborn babies because the parents wanted a child of the opposite sex, according to an article in the Washington Post.\" 17 228"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19 POPULATION CONTROL But are such extreme measures necessary? Must we co ntrol the popula- tion of the world, no matter how many people there are, because they are starving in a world soon to be so crowded that ther e will be no room for food production? Are the people of the world starving? One who believed that food supplies are increasing was Bob Berglund, Secretary of Agriculture in President Jimmy Carter' s administration, who is quoted as saying: \"In fact, the four billion people who inhabited the earth in 1978 had available about one-fifth more food per pe rson to eat than the world's 2.7 billion had twenty five years ago.\" And American farmers are taking fertile land out of production. Agriculture Secrerary John Block in 1983 reported t hat these farmers had agreed to idle about one-third of their land, a tot al of eighty-two million acres, in exchange for certain subsidy programs. And in the United States, there is concern that our population growth rate is declining too rapidly: \"By the year 2000, t he federal government may have to subsidize childbearing if the birthrate con tinues to plummet, according to a Temple University sociologist.\" 18 Someone who believes that there are sinister forces at work behind the \"population explosion\" is researcher Gary Allen, wh o has written that \"... by playing upon forces of impending social and environmental chaos, the Left is hoping to convert sincere and legitimat e concern over our environment (and the number of people in it) into a cceptance of government control of that environment. The object is federal control of the environment in which we all must live.\" 19 The federal control Mr. Allen is discussing must ma nifest itself in every aspect of the lives of every citizen. The new phras es to describe the all- encompassing changes are: \"The New Economic Order,\" or \"The New International Economic Order,\" or \"The New World Or der.\" These phrases all mean the same thing and are used interchangeably. The United Nations' World Population Conference at Bucharest called for a \"new economic order by eradicating the cause of w orld poverty, by ensuring the equitable distribution of the world re sources...\" This is simple Marxism carried only one step furthe r: \"From each (nation) according to its ability, to each (nation) according to its needs.\" If governments are going to create a New Economic O rder, and they are going to divide the wealth between the wealthy nati ons and the poor nations, they will need a method by which to accomplish this . One method proposed by the United Nations in 1969 and 1970. \"The Genera l Assembly adopted without dissension Thursday a declaration calling f or: (the use of) the world fiscal system and government spending for a more eq uitable distribution of income.\" 20 The United Nations later considered a proposal wher e: \"everybody in 229"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19 POPULATION CONTROL the world would pay a sales tax on certain home app liances and some luxury items to help poor nations.\" 21 (It is readily apparent just which nations have \"ho me appliances and some luxury items:\" the wealthier nations, those wh ich protect the right to private property.) Further discussions about this problem of providing for the poor, overpopulated nations of the world continued in 197 9 when the representa- tives of 156 nations met \"... to debate the best wa y to divide the world's dwindling resources. A bloc of 80 poor nations will call for $25 billion in new aid from (the) rich nations.\" The caption over the article read: \"Haves, have-not s meet,\" and pictured then UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim and Phillip pine President Ferdinand E. Marcos. 22 A similar caption was on top of anodier article dis cussing the Cancun, Mexico, meetings held in October, 1981. It read: \"H aves, Have-nots gathering to debate new economic order.\" 23 If there is going to be a world-wide tax collected to provide for the poor nations, there will have to be a world-wide tax col lector, and this is coming in the near future. For instance, James Warburg tol d a Senate Subcommittee on February 17, 1950: \"We shall have world governme nt (a world tax collector) whether or not you like it, by conquest or by consent.\" 24 Even one of the Popes of the Catholic Church, in th is case Pope Paul VI, in his Encyclical entitled, This is Progress, also went on record of supporting a world government. He wrote \"The need is clear to have in course of time world government by a world authority.\" 25 The world tax collector is very nearly in place. 230"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":" Chapter 20 The Trilateral Commission On December 13,1973, a little known governor of a s mall Southern state appeared on a television panel program called \"What 's My Line\" and stumped the panel who attempted to guess who he was .

If he was elected he would select those who were not identified as in siders, men and women who have never had the chance to run this country. And true to his word, he selected members of a new group not previously known called the Trilateral Commission to fill impo rtant positions. Apparently some of the minions beneath him had not read the script. Before Carter's election, his advisor Hamilton Jord an said: \"If, after the inauguration (of Jimmy Carter) you find Cy Vance as Secretary of State, and Zbigniew Brzezinski as head of National Security, t hen I would say that we failed, and I'd quit.\" 2 But strangely enough, after the inauguration, we fo und these two gentlemen in exactly the positions Mr. Jordan predi cted. But Mr. Jordan did not quit. It appears mat Mr. Jordan was told to rea d the script after he made his statement. Apparently, Mr. Carter did not consi der these two gentlemen to have been \"insiders\" who had been running the pr evious government, even though both were members of the Council on For eign Relations, heavily involved in American government since its c reation in 1921. The organizational meetings of the Trilateral Commi ssion were held on July 23 and 24, 1972, at the estate of David Roc kefeller, chairman of the CFR. In fact, all eight American representatives to the founding meeting of the Commission were members of the CFR. 3 The other individuals present were citizens of eith er Japan or western European countries, (the three areas represented th e \"Tri-\" in the Trilateral.) The Trilateral Commission tells the curious what th eir purpose is. They explain: \"Close Trilateral cooperation in keep ing the peace, in managing the world economy, in fostering economic r e-development and alleviating world poverty will improve the chances of a smooth and peaceful evolution of the global system.\" 4 But there are otiiers who disagree with this stated purpose and have tried to detail what they think their exact purpose is. O ne of these is Senator Barry Goldwater who wrote the following in his book With No Apologies: \"What the Trilateral truly intend is the creation of a wo rldwide economic power superior to the political government of the nation- states involved. As managers and creators of the system they will rule the world.\" 5 Shortly after the founding of the Commission, in th e fall of 1973, the little-known Governor of Georgia was in London, Eng land, having dinner with David Rockefeller.

Either: 232"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20 THE TRILATERAL COMMISSION 1. Jimmy Carter asked David Rockefeller to have dinner with him; or 2. David Rockefeller asked Jimmy Carter. (It will be presumed that the third alternative, of these men meeting by chance, should not be considered seriously.) A careful examination of the first alternative will reveal that it is possible, but not very probable. It is possible mat Mr. Carter, desiring to become p resident of the United States, discovered that Mr. Rockefeller, because of his closeness with the Council on Foreign Relations and their ancillary or ganizations, had the power to make any one of their choosing President, and he arranged the meeting. This is quite possible, as Mr. Rockefeller is an ex tremely important individual. In fact, during 1973: \"David Rockefelle r met with 27 heads of state, including the rulers of Russia and Red China .\" 6 This is truly incredible because David Rockefeller has neither been elected or appointed to any governmental position w here he could officially represent the United States government. Author Ferdinand Lundberg, author of the book The R ockefeller Syndrome, wrote this about the Rockefeller power: One of the little-noticed features of the (Rockefel ler) brothers is me ready entree they have to all high-level quar ters, foreign and domestic. A telephone call from David at Chase (Manhattan Ban k) can unlock practically as many tightly shut top-level d oors all over the world as a call from the President of the United St ates, perhaps more. This is power. 7 Three examples of the power that Rockefeller has mi ght illustrate the power that Jimmy Carter might have seen prior to th eir London meeting. It is known that in January, 1974, David Rockefelle r, who is not a Catholic, had an audience with Pope Paul VI, the sa me Pope who wrote the Encyclical urging the nations of the world to form a world government. This has long been a goal of David Rockefeller and the C ouncil on Foreign Relations, the organization of which Mr. Rockefelle r was then Chairman. Less than a month later, in February, 1974, Pope Pa ul recalled Josef Cardinal Mindszenty, the Catholic Primate of Hungar y and a long time enemy of the Communist regime in Hungary. When the Cardinal reached Rome, the Pope asked him to remain silent and no lo nger speak out against Communism. Were the two events connected? Possibly the reason for these strange actions of th e Pope occurred in 233"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20 THE TRILATERAL COMMISSION November, 1977, when the State Department of the Un ited States returned the Crown of St. Stephen to the Communist governmen t of Hungary. The Crown has an interesting history. It was given to King Stephen, the King of Hungary, in the year 1,000 by Pope Sylveste r II, after the King had converted to Catholicism. It has become a national treasure of immense historic and symbolic significance to the Hungarian people. The Hungarian people believe that the authority to rule Hungary is inherent in the crown itself (\"he who holds the Cro wn rules Hungary.\") The Crown was kept in Hungary until the Russians ov erran the country near the end of World War II. Before the Soviets co uld seize the Crown, Hungarian patriots delivered it to General George P atton, the commander of the American army near Hungary. The Crown, along with other items of value to the H ungarian people, was brought to the United States and safeguarded by the State Department. It was understood that this symbol of freedom would remain in the United States unul Hungary could once again funcdon as a consdtutional government established by the Hungarian people thro ugh choice. The Hungarian people's desire to keep the Crown out of the hands of the Communist government was betrayed by President Carter when he announced that the Crown would be returned to the C ommunist govern- ment in Hungary, ruled by the Communist dictator Ja nos Kadar, in December, 1977; (It was Janos Kadar who, as Minister of the Interio r, gave the orders for Cardinal Mindszenty's arrest and subsequent torture many years before.) And it was Cardinal Mindszenty who fervently pleade d with the American government not to release the Crown to the Kadar government. It is not a coincidence that it was on the twenty-f irst anniversary of the and-Communist revolt in Hungary in 1956 that Presid ent Carter announced that the Crown would be returned to Hungary and giv en to the Kadar government. It certainly appeared as a way of expre ssing to the world that the United States was now giving its official blessing to the Communist government in Hungary. In addidon, the timing of th e announcement was intended to broadcast to the world that the America n government was no longer supporting the aspiradons of oppressed peopl e around the world to be free from tyrannical Communist governments. This acdon, of course, came as no shock to Cardinal Mindszenty who once charged that \"the late President Eisenhower wa s responsible for the defeat of the Hungarian Freedom Fighters revoludon in 1956.\" 8 So the Cardinal was used to America's betrayal of j ust causes.

D id the \"Chairman of the Board\" fire a \"Branch Manager?\" This is the unanswe red question that certainly leads to speculation about why Khrushchev resigned. The third example of Rockefeller's enormous power w as reflected in August, 1976, when visiting Australian Prime Minist er Malcolm Fraser met with Mr. Rockefeller before he met with President o f the United States Gerald Ford. 10 The second alternative about the London meeting of Rockefeller and Carter, that Rockefeller discovered Carter, is more plausible and much more consistent with the facts. The Trilateral Commission was the idea of Zbigniew Brzezinski, or so the public is told, who went to David Rockefeller f or his assistance in creating the organization. There is some indication that Brzezinski liked Carter even before the forming of the Commission. According to the New York Times of March 21, 1978, Brzezinski \"enjoys his public role. The key to his confidence is his c lose relationship with Mr. Carter. The two men met for the first time four yea rs ago [in 1974, which appears to be incorrect] when Mr. Brzezinski was ex ecutive director of the Trilateral Commission, an organization favoring clo ser cooperation among Western Europe, Japan and the United States, and ha d the foresight to ask the then obscure former Governor to join its distinguis hed ranks. Their initial teacher-student relationship blossomed during the c ampaign and appears to have grown closer still.\" 11 And again, in the New York Times Magazine of May 23 ,1976, the reader is informed that \"Zbig was the first guy in the Com munity to pay attention to Carter, talked to him, sent him his books and ar ticles. For the better part of three years (from 1973, not 1974 as was reported above in the other New York Times article) Brzezinski (along) with Profess or Richard N. Gardner of Columbia had Carter virtually to himself... \" 12 Mr. Carter himself commented on this learning exper ience as a member of the Trilateral Commission when he wrote the foll owing in his election- year book entitled Why Not the Best?: \"Membership o n the commission has provided me with a splendid learning opportunity, a nd many of the other members have helped me in my study of foreign affai rs.\" 13 It is interesting that Mr. Carter admitted that he was being taught by members of the Trilateral Commission, and that he r eceived his greatest understanding from Mr. Brzezinski, especially from his \"books.\" 235"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20 THE TRILATERAL COMMISSION It appears that one of the things that Zbigniew tau ght Mr. Carter was his desire to increase the scope of government in the l ives of the American people. Brzezinski had once written: \"I should like to address myself to the problem of political change. I think we accept the idea of a vast expansion in social regulation. It may take such forms as legisl ation for the number of children, perhaps even legislation determining the sex of children once we have choice, the regulation of weather, the regulat ion of leisure, and so forth.\" 14 One of the \"books\" written by Mr. Brzezinski that M r. Carter might have read was a book entided Between Two Ages, written i n 1970. A careful reading of this book reveals that Mr. Brz ezinski has some rather shocking things to say about America and the rest o f the world. On page 300, for instance, Zbigniew reveals that th e American people will be introduced to two new concepts in their eco nomic life: 1. A new monetary system replacing the American dollar ; and 2. A reduced standard of living in order to achieve it . He wrote: \"In the economic-technological field some international cooperation has already been achieved, but further progress will require greater American sacrifices. More intensive efforts to shape a new world monetary structure will have to be undertaken, with some consequent risk to the present relatively favorable American position. \" 15 Brzezinski also revealed his views about the econom ic philosophies of Karl Marx: page 72: Marxism represents a further vital and cre ative stage in the maturing of man's universal vision. Marxism is simultane- ously a victory of the external man over the inner, passive man, and a victory of reason over belief. page 73: Marxism has served as a mechanism of human progress even if its practice has often fallen shor t of its ideals. Teilhard de Chardin notes at one point that 'monstr ous as it is, is not modern totalitarianism really the distortion of something magnificent, and thus quite near to the truth?' page 83: Marxism, disseminated on the popular level in the form of communism, represented a major advance in m an's ability to conceptualize his relationship to his world. page 123: Marxism provided a unique intellectual to ol for under- standing and harnessing the fundamental forces of o ur time. It supplied the best available insight into contempora ry reality. Brzezinski theorizes that the liberal, democratic s ocieties would support an authoritarian form of government if they were gi ven a choice between a dictatorship and social and intellectual disorder: 236"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20 THE TRILATERAL COMMISSION page 118: In the absence of social consensus, socie ty's emo- tional and rational needs may be fused — mass media makes this easier to achieve—in the person of an individual wh o is seen as both preserving and making the necessary innovation s in the social order. Given the choice between social and intellectual di sorder — and by this is not meant anything that even approac hes a revolu- tionary situation—and authoritarian personal leader ship [a dictator] it is very probable that even some presen t constitutional and liberal democratic societies would opt for the latter. He also sees a threat to liberal democracy involvin g: page 252: the gradual appearance of a more controll ed and directed society. Such a society would be dominated by an elite whose claim to political power would rest on allegedly superior sc ientific know- how. Unhindered by the restraints of traditional liberal values, this elite would not hesitate to achieve its political e nds by the latest modern techniques for influencing public behavior a nd keeping society under close surveillance and control. And then Brzezinski details his desires to move tow ards a world government: page 296: Movement toward a larger community of the deve- loped nations... cannot be achieved by fusing exist ing states into one larger entity. It makes much more sense to attempt to associate ex isting states through a variety of indirect ties and alrea dy developing limitations on national sovereignty. Then he detailed the reasons for founding the Trila teral Commission: page 296: Movement toward such a community will in all probability require two broad and overlapping phras es. The first of these would involve the forging of com munity links among the United States, Western Europe and J apan. Such a loose-knit community would need a taxation p ower and Brzezinski has already predicted this: page 304:... it might also eventually lead to the p ossibility of something along the lines of a global taxation syst em. And then he sums it all up by declaring: 237"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20 THE TRILATERAL COMMISSION page 308: Though the objective of shaping a communi ty of the developed nations is less ambitious than the go al of world government, it is more attainable. Brzezinski doesn't completely discount the possibil ity of a world government; he just theorizes that it would be easi er to achieve control of the developed nations through an association of these n ations. But Brzezinski just doesn't stop with getting the U nited States strangled with ties to other nations, he has also suggested t hat the American govern- ment should become dependent on the Soviet Union an d Red China for our oil needs. While Mr. Brzezinski was director of the Trilateral Commission, they published a report in 1977 entitled \"Collaboration With Communist Countries in Managing Global Problems: An Examinati on of the Options.\" It read: \"Both the U.S.S.R. and [Communist] China a re exporters of energy and apparently possess substantial oil reserves. Th e Trilateral countries import energy, of which very little now comes from the U.S.S.R. or China. The global situation appears likely to tighten in t he coming years. There are immediate advantages for the Trilateral countries i n diversifying their sources of supply. Trilateral-Communist cooperation in energy may thus be feasible and desirable. This cooperation might take the form of investment by Trilateral countries in Soviet or Chinese energy production to secure energy exports from these countries.\" 16 And lastly, Brzezinski, the teacher of President Ca rter, does not believe in the Conspiratorial View of History: \"History is muc h more the product of chaos than of conspiracy.... increasingly, policy m akers are overwhelmed by events and information.\" 17 But the support of the presidential campaign of Jim my Carter did not come just from members of the Trilateral Commission . He received financial support from the following, amongst others: Dean Ru sk, CFR member; C. Douglas Dillon, CFR member; and Henry Luce, Time ma gazine's Vice President and CFR member. In addition, Carter surrounded himself with the fol lowing members of the CFR before his election: Theodore Sorenson, W. Averill Harriman, Cyrus Vance, Richard Gardner, Paul Nitze, and Paul Warnke. And candidate Jimmy Carter even spoke before the Ch icago branch of the CFR in May, 1976, wherein he called for \"a just and stable international order,\" the phrase of those who understand the natu re of the future. It was almost as if Mr. Carter was paraded before the CFR to reveal that he was indeed one of them. But the major support after the election came from the Trilateral Commission. As the Washington Post revealed after t he election of President Jimmy Carter: \"If you like Conspiracy theories abou t secret plots to take over 238"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20 THE TRILATERAL COMMISSION the world, you are going to love the administration of President-elect Jimmy Carter. At last count 13 Trilateralists had gone in to top positions in the administration. This is extraordinary when you cons ider that the Trilateral Commission only has about 65 American members.\" 18 We have been told that, at the Democratic conventio n, after Carter received the Presidential nomination, he had not as yet made up his mind on whom he was going to select as his vice-president. The American people were told mat he had narrowed his list of possible candidates down to seven men. He selected a fellow member of the Trilateral Commi ssion: Walter Mondale. But even with the support of the wealthy establishm ent members of the CFR and some support of the media from CFR members, Jimmy Carter still spoke out against the liberal establishment: \"Accep ting the Democratic presidential nomination in New York, Carter denounc ed those 'unholy alliances that have formed between money and politi cs.'\" One of the interesting connections in the Trilatera l Commission is the fact that the: \"Majority of the important Frenchmen [who are members of the Commission], perhaps all of them, belong to the Grand Orient Lodge of Free Masonry.\" 19 But the Commission needs financial support, and it gets it from \"the Ford Foundation, [which] has been its largest contr ibutor.\" 20 But are those who are concerned about the influence and direction of the Trilateral Commission just exaggerating the danger? Should we agree with those who say that \"There's certainly nothing sinis ter about the group.\"? One who is concerned is Senator Barry Goldwater who on national television at the 1980 Republican Convention warned the nation that \"This might be the last Republican convention and, in two weeks, the last Democratic convention. There are forces working aga inst our country. There are selfish forces working for their own inte rest in our country.\" 21 (Was it just an inadvertent omission that CFR membe r Dan Rather failed to ask Senator Goldwater on nationwide telev ision, shortly after Goldwater made his charges, just what he meant by h is statement?) Goldwater went on to describe just who he thought, at least in part, these forces were. In his chapter entitled \"The Non -Elected Rulers,\" in his book With No Apologies, the Senator wrote: \"In my v iew, the Trilateral Commission represents a skillful, coordinated effor t to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power: political, m onetary, intellectual and ecclesiastical.\" 22 There are even critics residing outside the United States. Take this comment by England's Weekly Review, about the Trila teral Commission for instance. They wrote: \"International Communism of t he Moscow order has 239"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20 THE TRILATERAL COMMISSION many features in common with David Rockefeller's Tr ilateral Commis- sion — such as undermining the national sovereignty of the United States. It is for this reason, plus odiers, that one finds kno wn Marxists supporting the goals of the new world economic order sought by the Trilateral Commission...\" 23 The economic intent of the Trilateral Commission wa s pointed out by Jeremiah Novak in 1977: \"The Trilateral Commission' s most immediate concern is the creation of a new world monetary sys tem to replace gold and the dollar as the international exchange with a new currency called Special Drawing Rights (SDR's.)\" 24 The purpose of a common money was spelled out by Jo hn Foster Dulles, a CFR founder, years before. He wrote: \"... the establishment of a common money might be vested in a body created by a nd responsible to the principal trading and investing peoples. This would deprive our govern- ment of exclusive control over a national money.... 25 A precursor of this common money revealed itself wh en six Common Market nations in Europe agreed to join in a moneta ry system. 26 So the process marches on. Now that the Trilateral Commission was in place, an d their selected candidate was installed as the President of the Uni ted States, they could have the American government act in a manner that was im portant to the Commission. A brief review of some of the major acc omplishments of the Carter administration informs the student of just w hat the Commission wanted from President Carter: 1. The Betrayal and Expulsion of the Shah of Ir an: A senior Iranian diplomat in Washington stated: \"Pr esident Carter betrayed the Shah and helped create the vacuum that will soon be filled by Soviet-trained agents and religious fanadcs who hat e America.\" 27 A possible motive as to why Carter did this is answ ered by a review of the record of the Shah in the years prior to his leavin g Iran. His record as head of the Iranian government was summarized in an ardc le that stated that: Under the direction of its able monarch, Iran had b een trans- ferred in a single generation from a near-feudal ag ricultural society to an urbanized, burgeoning, industrial, and modern country. His plan was to make Iran a technologically advance d, economically diversified, and self-sustaining natio n so that, in the next century when the oil ran low, Iran would not g o into an economic decline and return to the dark ages. 28 The Shah \"had written into law in Iran... the princ iples of religious toleration, separation of church and state... and a n advisory parliament 240"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20 THE TRILATERAL COMMISSION was set up to which, over the years, additional pow ers were granted.\" 29 In other words, the Shah had intended to structure the government in such a way that a middle class would develop in his country. And once again, just as in the economies of China, Russia and Cuba, this was not acceptable to the master planners of the world. He had to be replaced. One clue mat mis statement is correct is this comme nt, made in the book entitled Trilaterals Over Washington, Volume II, wr itten by Antony Sutton and Patrick M. Wood. They have written \"The Shah wa s induced to invest his funds (estimates range from $1/2 billion to $25 billion,) with Chase Manhattan.\" 30 The mediod Carter used has been partially revealed in various news- paper articles. He sent General Robert E. Huyser, D eputy Commander of U.S. Forces in Europe, to Iran. His purpose was to tell the Iranian Generals not to stage a \"coup\" against the impending governm ent of the Khomeini. The Generals, loyal to the Shah, did nothing. A few hours after Khomeini took over, the Generals were shot. These charges against President Carter were confirm ed by the memoirs of the deposed Shah of Iran who wrote that \"the Ame ricans wanted me out. Certainly this is what the human rights champions i n the State Department wanted.\" The Shah then revealed why, in his opinion, the Car ter administration truly wanted to replace him. The Shah \"repeatedly a rgued in the memoirs mat for years the great multinational oil companies , possibly in league with the U.S. government, had been subverting his rule b ecause of his insistence that Iran get a greater share of oil revenues.\" 51 (That is a strange comment in view of the fact that the American people were told that OPEC member Iran's oil prices were s et by the government of Iran, not by the multinational oil companies.) According to a book entitled The Energy Cartel, by Norman Medvin, 32 written in 1974, Iran has three major oil companies , the Iranian Offshore Petroleum Co., the Iranian Oil Consortium, and the Lavaan Petroleum Co. Each company is a joint venture involving the follo wing companies: Name Companies involved Iranian Offshore CFP, Atlantic Richfield, Cities Ser- Petroleum Co. vice, Superior, Kerr-McGee, Sun, National Iranian Oil Co. 241"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20 THE TRILATERAL COMMISSION Iranian Oil BP, Shell, Gulf, Mobil, Exxon, Tex- Consortium aco, Standard of California, CFP, Am. Independent Lavaan Petroleum Atlantic Richfield, Murphy Oil, Co. Union Oil, National Iranian Oil Company So now it is possible, if the Shah was right, to se e which oil companies wanted to replace the Shah of Iran with the Ayatoll ah Khomeini. Carter's strategy worked. The Shah of Iran left and was replaced by the Ayatollah. Another interesting revelation about the whole Khom eini affair is the charge mat the Khomeini in Iran today is not the sa me Khomeini that was exiled by the Shah in 1965, even though he is suppo sed to be. A memoran- dum written by an individual considered to be one o f the world's best- informed international intelligence sources states: In its edition of June 11, 1979, on page A-2, the L os Angeles Herald Examiner carried a story which questioned th e authenticity of the Ayatollah Khomeini. The article quoted a col umn by William Hickey in the London Express which included photo- graphs of the Ayatollah Khomeini, which were taken while he was in France, showing that he had only 9 fingers. The middle digit of his right hand was missing. Recent photographs show that the present \"Ayatollah Kho- meini\" has 10 fingers. In addition, Iranian Premier Amir Hoveida testified : \"I know him and I can assure you he had only nine fingers. This Kho meini is an imposter.\" Shortly after making that statement, Hoveida was sh outed down in me court he was testifying in and pulled out of the bu ilding and shot. 33 Just who the new Khomeini is and why the previous o ne had to be replaced, was not explained. One clue to the myster y was offered by the Polish Army Intelligence Colonel, Michael Goloniews ki, an expert on Soviet intelligence. He charged that the Soviets ha d penetrated the Shiite Moslem sect of which the Ayatollah is a member, and mat the Ayatollah was a Soviet agent. 2. Support of Communist Terrorists in Soumern A frica: When Senator Barry Goldwater returned to the United States from a trip to Southern Africa, he charged the Carter Administr ation with basing its African policies on a \"'deliberate scheme with pro- Soviet overtones.' Goldwater said that 'everything the Carter Administ ration has done in Africa 242"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20 THE TRILATERAL COMMISSION has played directly into the hands of the Soviet Un ion. These actions are so obviously subverting the strategic interests of the United States that it almost seems drat someone must be following a deliberate s cheme with pro-Soviet overtones.' He says that the Administration is 'med dling in a dangerous way in many African situations which are beyond its con trol. The effect is the creation of the kind of fear and confusion upon whi ch Communism thrives and Soviet objectives are advanced.' \" 34 3. Delivery of the Panama Canal to a Marxist Di ctator: During the televised debates in 1976 between Presid ent Gerald Ford and candidate Jimmy Carter, Mr. Carter explained: \"I wo uld never give up complete or practical control of the Panama Canal Z one. But I would continue to negotiate with the Panamanians.... I wo uld not relinquish the practical control of the Panama Canal Zone anytime in the forseeable future.\" 37 Perhaps the reason that Carter decided that \"never\" was 1977 was the growing inability of the government of Marxist Omar Torrijos to pay the interest on their growing government debt. It is ve ry revealing that, when Torrijos seized power over Panama in 1968, its nati onal debt was only $160 million. When it was time to acquire the Panama Can al in 1977, it was $1.4 billion. Columnist Charles Bartlett agreed that the dictator ial Torrijos regime \"has put the small nation so deeply in the red that the canal treaty has no supporters more fervent than the American bankers w hose hopes for payment rest on a revival of faith in the Panamania n economy.\" 56 The Panamanian debt to the United States banks was so large that Panama had to \"allocate some $47 million—which is 3 9 percent of its national Budget—to debt service [interest] on the m assive loans. Undoubt- edly the directors of the creditor U.S. banks, whic h include Chase Manhattan Bank, First National City Bank, Bank of America, Ba nker's Trust, First National Bank of Chicago, Republic National Bank of Dallas, and Treaty negotiator Sol Linowitz's Marine Midland Bank, see that the only way of getting back their money with interest is to get co ntrol of the Canal and Canal Zone from Torrijos so he can extort the money owed to the interna- tional banks from shipping fees.\" 37 It is very revealing that, under the terms of the t reaty that gave the Canal to Panama, the United States paid the Panamanian go vernment millions of dollars so that the Panamanian government would tak e the canal. It is important to remember that \"of the 30 or so b anks that had made rather shaky loans, one-half of them had at least o ne Trilateral on their boards of directors. Had Panama defaulted on these loans, some major international banks would have faced financial ruin .\" 38 243"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20 THE TRILATERAL COMMISSION It is also revealing that fifteen of the sixteen se nators in the U.S. Senate who had either been a member of the CFR or were cur rently a member, voted for the Treaty. 39 The American people, who according to the polls tak en just before the Treaty was signed, were opposed to it by a 70 to 30 margin, remembered those Senators who had voted for the Treaty and were up f or re-election in 1978 and 1980. Twenty of these Senators were defeated. 40 4. Betrayal of the government of Nicaragua: Perhaps the most glaring example of Carter's misuse of his presidential power occurred in the overthrow of the government o f Nicaragua in 1979 and 1980. Congressman Larry McDonald, on September 17, 1980, laid the blame for the fall of the Nicaraguan government on Presid ent Carter (and thus onto the Trilateral Commission): \"The policies of the Un ited States of America, the policies of this Administration, were deliberat ely and calculatingly designed to destroy the elected government of the p eople of Nicaragua and to bring the Cuban-dominated Sandinistas to power.\" 41 The elected president of Nicaragua, a West Point-tr ained officer, Anastasio Somoza, also came to the same conclusion as Congressman McDonald. After he left office, President Somoza wr ote a book entitled Nicaragua Betrayed, in which he made the following observation: \"... I come to one startling conclusion: There is a planne d and deliberate conspiracy in the United States of America to destr oy that republican form of government.\" 42 Somoza saw that this conspiracy was also responsibl e for the overdirow of his government, and he specifically zeroed in on President Carter: \"His put Nicaragua in the hands of the Communists.\" 43 And again: \"... the betrayal of steadfast anti-Comm unist allies places Mr. Carter in the company of evil worldwide conspir atorial forces. I repeat, the treacherous course charted by Mr. Carter was no t through ignorance, but by design.\" 44 President Somoza again laid the blame on the Americ an government: \"... when the United States assumes leadership in a conspiratorial fashion to annihilate anti-Communist nadons, I believe it i s my duty to speak out. When I have factual evidence that the United States of America has actually aided and abetted the evil forces of Communism, I b elieve the people of the United States should share in such facts and incont rovertible manifestations.\" 45 For all of President Somoza's efforts to warn the A merican people and the remainder of the world about a truth that other nations had learned before him, that the United States government could not be trusted in 244"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20 THE TRILATERAL COMMISSION preventing a Communist takeover of a friendly gover nment, he met a violent death in an assassination in September, 1980. This murder took place just a few weeks after his book was published. The Soviet-trained Sandinistas were now fully in co mmand of the Nicaraguan government, and their opposition leader had been eliminated. Have they offered the Nicaraguan people a better go vernment than the supposedly \"tyrannical despot\" Somoza? One former Sandinista leader doesn't believe so. He reported: Nicaragua's Communist rulers have done more damage in nine months than Somoza did in ten years. Something like 12,000 opponents of the regime are s till in jail. Hundreds of others have simply disappeared. Every aspect of life in Nicaragua today is being di ctated by the Communists. Every day, the junta seizes more property. More tha n one million acres of farmland have already been taken o ver, but less than one-fifth of the land is now in use. In two mo nths, hundreds will be starving for lack of food. 46 A former Major in the Nicaraguan National Guard is another who agrees. He told a congressional committee mat the S andinistas are working to encourage revolutions in El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Costa Rica. He said: \"The consolidation of Central Americ a, the allegiance of the parties in power in Mexico and Venezuela, will give access to the rich oil fields of the continent. If you do not take action to neutralize this error in policy immediately, you will be fighting a war in y our territory in no more than five years.\" 47 After the betrayal of Niciragua to the Sandinistas, President Carter's administration released $75 million in aid, after t he President \"certified that Nicaragua's Marxist regime was not aiding Communist guerillas in El Salvador and Guatemala.\" 48 There were those in the United States who agreed wi th the above charges. The American Legion passed the following r esolution at its 1980 national convention. The resolution demanded \"in th e best interests of our country that the Congress of the United States laun ch a comprehensive investigation into the Trilateral Commission and it s parent organization, the Council on Foreign Relations, to determine what influence has been and is being exerted over the foreign and domestic poli cies of the United States.\" But the real message in the actions of the United S tates government lies in the following statement of the former Prime Mini ster of England, Edward Heath, who was quoted as saying: \"We in Europe will no longer be able to expect the United States to take action in any part of the world to put right 245"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20 THE TRILATERAL COMMISSION something we don't like.\" 49 In other words, America is no longer an ally of tho se who seek freedom for their nation against any Communist tyrant. 5. The Election of 1980: But the final drama in the current run of the Trila teral Commission came in the presidential election of 1980, when Jim my Carter and Walter Mondale ran for re-election. They were opposed by n on-member Ronald Reagan and member George Bush. An interesting dimension to this election was added by Trilateral Commission member John Anderson, running as an inde pendent. An article dated August 1, 1980, stated that \"Anderson might quit if Carter is dumped\" 50 by the Democratic convention. In other words, the \"independent candidate\" was running against Jimmy Carter. It see ms strange that the Trilateral Commission would allow two of their memb ers to run against each other unless they wanted President Carter out of office. This was further illustrated when Anderson supported Mondale for the Presidency in 1984. That possibility raises the interesting question as to why they wanted the other candidate, Ronald Reagan, in office in 19 80. Reagan didn't appear to be the early choice of the Trilateral Commis- sion. For instance, the U.S. News and World Report magazine began mentioning the candidacy of two other members of th e Trilateral Commis- sion early in 1978. On February 27, 1978, the magazine wrote: \"In the v iew of the Presi- dent's top political advisers, a Republican ticket of Texan George Bush [a Commission member] and Illinois Governor James Thom pson [a Commis- sion member] would provide the most formidable oppo sition for Carter in 1980\". 51 And again on July 3, 1978: \"Ronald Regan's backers are pinpointing Governor James Thompson [a Commission member] of Il linois as the candidate in the race for the 1980 Republican presi dential nomination.\" 52 And the magazine continued the call for Commission members again in 1980, first on February 11, 1980: \"George Bush's [a Commission member] sudden emergence in the Republican presidential rac e . . . calls for a moderate vice-presidential nominee from the west—po ssibily John Ander- son [a Commission member] or Governor James Thompso n [a Commission member], both from Illinois.\" 55 And then again on October 6, 1980: \"Top Republicans already are talking about who would lead the party if Ronald Re agan loses his presiden- tial bid. Early consensus: Representative Jack Kemp of New York [not a Commission member] for conservatives, Illinois Gove rnor James Thomp- son [a Commission member] for moderates—with George Bush [a Com- 246"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20 THE TRILATERAL COMMISSION mission member] appealing to yet others.\" 54 Candidate Ronald Reagan was asked whether he would allow any Trilateral Commission members in his Cabinet during the Florida primary, on March 17, 1980, and mis is how he replied: \"No, I don't believe that the Trilateral Commission is a conspiratorial group, bu t I do mink its interests are devoted to international banking, multi-nationa l corporations, and so forth. I don't mink that any administration of the U.S. government should have the top 19 positions filled by people from any one group or organization representing one viewpoint. No. I would go in a dif ferent direction.\" 55 Just prior to the election, candidate Ronald Reagan was asked about who truly ran this country. He replied: \"I think th ere is an elite in this country and they are the ones who run an elitist go vernment. They want a government by a handful of people because they don' t believe the people themselves can run their lives.... Are we going to have an elitist government that makes decisions for people's lives or are we g oing to believe as we have for so many decades, that the people can make these decisions for themselves?\" After the election, Reagan: \"assembled a 'transitio n team' which would later select, screen and recommend appointees for m ajor administration posts. Of the fifty-nine people Reagan named to tha t team, twenty-eight were members of the CFR, ten belonged to the secret and elite Bilderberg group, and no less than ten were Trilaterals.\" 56 There was concern during the Republican convention that Reagan would appoint George Bush as his Vice-Presidential nominee. The day before he made that decision, a group of conservati ve activists visited Reagan to present the case for him to appoint a conservati ve running mate, one not connected to the elitist groups Reagan had publicly spoken out against. Reagan didn't listen and appointed George Bush, not only a member of the Trilateral Commission, but a member of the C ouncil of Foreign Relations as well. Even before Reagan had officially made his decision about George Bush at the convention, and as an early indication of wh at was to come, Reagan lieutenants \"shot down a proposed plank [to the Rep ublican Party platform] that would have denouced the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations. Among the things Reagan's subseq uent selection of Bush has accomplished is the elimination of the Trilater al Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations as issues the Republic an Party can use in the campaign.\" 57 In other words, Reagan knew that he was going to no minate George Bush as his vice-president even before the time he officially selected him, and he and his supporters didn't want the Trilateral Co mmission to be denounced at the convention. It was extremely impor tant that that particular 247"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20 THE TRILATERAL COMMISSION platform plank be defeated. And it was, and Trilateral Commission member George Bush became Reagan's nominee. And the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations did not become campaign issues. After the election, President Ronand Reagan continu ed his support of both the Trilateral Commission and the Council on F oreign Relations by appointing: 64 CFR members; 6 Trilateral Commission (TC) members; 6 TC and CFR members; and 5 former members of the TC to positions in his administration. 248"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Chapter 21 The Purpose What is the overall purpose of these secret and sem i-secret organiza- tions?

Mr. Tho mas said: \"We have learned that it is possible, to a degree not antici pated by most earlier Socialists, to impose desirable social controls on privately owned enterprises by the development of social planning, by proper ta xation and labor legislation and by the growth of powerful labor org anizations.\" 1 Mr. Thomas was revealing the game plan for the ulti mate success of Socialism: the utilization of non-Socialist hands t o gradually achieve the goals of Socialism. The question was how could the Socialists get the American people to accept Socialism when the Americ an people had made it clear through the years they didn't want the eco nomic philosophy known as Socialism. Mr. Thomas answered this question on another occasi on: \"The American people will never knowingly adopt Socialis m, but under the name 249"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 21 THE PURPOSE of Liberalism, they will adopt every fragment of th e Socialist program until one day America will be a Socialist nation without knowing how it happened.\" 2 The key to success for the Socialists was to get th e American people to support candidates that they perceived were \"anti-S ocialist\" but were in truth secretly supporting the cause of the Socialis t Party in increasing the size and scope of government in the lives of the America n people. Mr. Thomas later identified one of these \"Liberal\" \"closet\" \"Socialists\" when he wrote: \"The United States is making greater strides toward Socialism under [President Dwight] Eisenhower than under [President Franklin] Roosevelt . . . .\" 3 There are many who considered Roosevelt to be a sem i-Socialist, but Eisenhower has been perceived as a \"conservative\" b y the American people. Yet Thomas told the American people that Eisenhower as President was doing more to promote Socialism than had Roosevelt as President. Another individual hiding his Socialism, according to Norman Thomas, was President Lyndon Johnson. Thomas was pl eased with Johnson's Great Society: \"I ought to rejoice and I do. I rub my eyes in amazement and surprise. His war on poverty is a Soc ialisdc approach...\" 4 Thomas also heaped praise upon another \"closet\" soc ialist, Hubert Humphrey, who \"is the type of Democrat I like and o ne who would be a Socialist if he got to England.\" 5 Another so-called \"conservative, anti-Socialist\" Pr esident was President Richard Nixon. But John Kenneth Galbraith, the Paul Warburg Professor of Economics at Harvard University, idendfied him as a \"closet\" socialist, one doing the work of the Socialist Party. First, Professor Galbraith presented his credential s that enabled him to determine if anyone else was a Socialist. He made a statement that indicated that he personally was a Socialist. He advocated th at \"... a certain number of industries should be publicly owned. For moving and housing people at moderate cost, private enterprise does not serve.\" Then he makes the connection between Socialism and President Nixon: \"But I had come reluctantly to the conclusion that Socialism, even in this modest design, was something I would never see. Now I am being rescued by this new Socialist upsurge, promoted, of all things , by socialists, not on the Left, but on the Right, and they have the blessing and conceivably much more, of a Republican Administration. Certainly, th e least predicted development under the Nixon administration was the great new thrust to Socialism. As an opponent of Socialism, Mr. Nixon s eemed steadfast.\" 6 What these people were saying was that it didn't ma ke any difference whether the American people voted Republican and \"a nti-Socialist,\" or Democratic and \"Liberal,\" they get the same thing: more Socialism. 250"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 21 THE PURPOSE This statement becomes graphically clear when the f ollowing issues are examined in light of what the two major political p arties have done in support of them.

One such report that has done research into the Inv isible Reasons for War is a report called the Report From Iron Mountai n on the Possibility and Desirability of Peace. 1 Written in 1963 and released in March 1966, this r eport examines the visible and invisible functions or rea sons of not only war but peace as well.

Not only were they concerned about the lasting effects of a long-term peace, they also wished to examine the functions, both visible and i nvisible, of war. The report states that: \"War has provided... societ y with a debatable system for stabilizing and controlling national eco nomies. No alternate method of control has yet been tested in a complex modern economy that has shown it is remotely comparable in scope or effecti veness.\" War, therefore, was not fought for the usual reason s outlined above. It was fought to \"control economies.\" These individual s apparently were concerned that there had been no efforts made to de tail how they were to control economies during a time of peace: \"War fill s certain functions essential to the stability of our society; until ot her ways of filling them are developed, the war system must be maintained, and i mproved in effectiveness.\" So, in a manner not detailed in the report itself, these three somehow arranged for a study of these problems. The report states that fifteen members of the investigating team got together to write the report, and that it was unanimously agreed to. Furthermore, no minutes of t he meetings were maintained, as it was thought they would be \"too in hibiting.\" The team which wrote the report recommended that the report not be made public after it was completed. One of those who read the report attempted to locat e the authors. It was his theory that it had been written by the Hudson I nstitute. He wrote: \"There is considerable evidence that the Report is the wor k of the Hudson Institute and Herman Kahn.... There is an Iron Mountain just a stone's throw [literally] from the Hudson Institute near Croton-o n-Hudson, [New York.]\" 2 The Hudson Institute is not well known among the Am erican public, but it is known to government officials who have us ed it as a \"think-tank\" by hiring it to report on the issues of national co ncern. The Hudson Institute was started in 1961 when Mr. K ahn, the owner, decided \"to help determine the entire future of the U.S. —and, time permit- ting, much of the world beyond.\" 3 The Institute primarily receives its income from th e government. Hudson listed five sources for its $1.36 million of income in 1968: The Office of Civil Defense, The Office of Secretary of Defens e, the Military Services, Other Government and Non-U.S. Government 4 Kahn and his \"think tankers\" have become so importa nt to the Amer- ican government that they are frequently accused of setting older administra- tions on a path that new adminstrations cannot alte r. \"This is a process of invisible power.

Two of the Fellows are known to the public: Henry K issinger (CFR member) and Dr. Milton Friedman. The report starts by defining the traditional view of the functions of war. It claims that there are three: 1. to defend a nation from military attack by another or to deter such an attack; 2. to defend or advance a national interest; and 3. to maintain or increase a nation's military powe r for its own sake. It continues by stating that these are the \"visible \" functions, and that there are \"invisible, or implied, functions\" as wel l. These are spelled out in the report, but all functions have one common purpo se: \"War has provided both ancient and modern society with a debatable sy stem for stabilizing and controlling national economies. No alternate method of control has yet been tested in a complex modern economy that has shown i t is remotely compar- able in scope or effectiveness. War fills certain f unctions essential to the stability of our society; until other ways of filli ng them are developed, the war system must be maintained — and improved in effecti veness.\" The report then goes on to detail what the \"invisib le functions\" of war are: War... is the principal organizing force in most so cieties. ... The possibility of war provided the sense of ex ternal necessity without which no government can long remain in powe r. The historical record reveals one instance after an other where the failure... of a regime to maintain the credibil ity of a war threat led to its dissolution.

The younger, and more dangerous, of these hostile s ocial groupings have been kept under control by the Selec tive Service System. As a control device... the draft can again be defen ded...

This is the typical explanation. But the \"revisioni st historian\" knows just what caused and what the purpose was of the co nflagration of World War I. Up until America's entry into this war, the America n people had followed the wise advice of President George Washin gton given in his farewell address, delivered to the nation on Septem ber 17, 1796. President Washington said: \"It is our true policy to steer cl ear of permanent alliance with any portion of the foreign world...

Norman Dodd, former director of the Committee to In vestigate Tax Exempt Foundations of the U.S. House of Representat ives, testified mat the Committee was invited to study the minutes of the C arnegie Endowment for International Peace as part of the Committee's inve stigation. The Commit- tee stated: \"The trustees of the Foundation brought up a single quesdon. If it is desirable to alter the life of an entire peop le, is there any means more efficient man war.... They discussed this question. .. for a year and came up with an answer: There are no known means more ef ficient than war, assuming the objective is altering the life of an e nure people. That leads them to a question: How do we involve the United States in a war. This is in 1909.\" 1 So the decision was made to involve the United Stat es in a war so that the \"life of the entire people could be altered.\" This was the conclusion of a foundation supposedly committed to \"peace.\" The method by which the United States was drawn int o the war started on October 25,1911, when Winston Churchill was appo inted the First Lord of the Admiralty in England. Winston Churchill is an interesting individual, as he later came to the conclusion that there was indeed a master conspirac y at work in the major events of the world, when he wrote the following in 1920: \"From the days of Spartacus — Weishaupt to those of Karl Marx, to tho se of Trotsky (Russia- )... this world-wide conspiracy for the overthrow o f civilization... has been steadily growing.\" 2 The second key appointment made during the pre-war period was the appointment of Franklin Delano Roosevelt as Assista nt Secretary of the Navy by President Woodrow Wilson. Roosevelt is also on record as concluding that ther e was a conspiracy, at least in the United States. He once wrote to Colone l Edward Mandell House: \"The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know , that a financial element in the larger centers has owned the government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson, and I am not wholly excepting the administ ration of W.W. (Woodrow Wilson.) The country is going through a re petition of Jackson's fight with the Bank of the United States — only on a far bigger and broader basis.\" 3 The next step in the maneuvering of the United Stat es into the war came when the Cunard Lines, owner of the ocean liner, th e Lusitania, turned the ship over to the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winst on Churchill. It now became a ship of the English Navy and was under the control of the English government. The ship was sent to New York City where it was loa ded with six million rounds of ammunition, owned by J.P. Morgan & Co., to be sold to 257"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 23 WORLD WAR I England and France to aid in their war against Germ any. It was known that the very wealthy were interested in involving the American government in that war, and Secretary of S tate William Jennings Bryan was one who made note of this. \"As Secretary [Bryan] had anticipated, the large banking interests were deeply interested in the World War because of wide opportunities for large profits. On August 3, 1914, even before the actual clash of arms, the French firm of Rothschild Freres cabled to Morgan and Company in New York suggesting the flotation of a loan of $100,000,000, a substantial part of which was to be left in the United States, to pay for French purchases of American goods.\" 4 England broke the German war code on December 14, 1 914, so that \"By the end of January, 1915, [British Intelligence was ] able to advise the Admiralty of the departure of each U-boat as it lef t for patrol... .\" 5 This meant that the First Lord of the Admiralty, Wi nston Churchill, knew where every U-boat was in the vicinity of the English Channel that separated England and France. The ocean liner was set to sail to England already at war with Germany. The German government had placed advertisements in the New York newspapers warning the American people considering whether or not to sail with the ship to England that they would be sailing into a war zone, and that the liner could be sunk. Secretary Bryan promised that \"he would endeavor to persuade the President (Woodrow Wilson) publicly to warn the Ame ricans not to travel [aboard the Lusitania]. No such warning was issued by the President, but there can be no doubt that President Wilson was tol d of the character of the cargo destined for the Lusitania. He did nothing... \" 6 Even though Wilson proclaimed America's neutrality in the European War, in accordance with the prior admonitions of Ge orge Washington, his government was secretly plotting to involve the Ame rican people by having the Lusitania sunk. This was made public in the boo k The Intimate Papers of Colonel House, written by a supporter of the Col onel, who recorded a conversation between Colonel House and Sir Edward G rey of England, the Foreign Secretary of England: Grey: What will America do if the Germans sink an ocean l iner with American passengers on board? House: I believe that a flame of indignation would sweep t he United States and that by itself would be sufficien t to carry us into the war. 7 On May 7, 1915, the Lusitania was sunk in the Engli sh Channel by a U- boat after it had slowed to await the arrival of th e English escort vessel, the Juno, which was intended to escort it into the Engl ish port. The First Lord 258"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 23 WORLD WAR I of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, issued orders that the Juno was to return to port, and the Lusitania sat alone in the channel. Because Churchill knew of the presence of three U-boats in the vicini ty, it is reasonable to presume that he had planned for the Lusitania to be sunk, and it was. 1201 people lost their lives in the sinking. This sinking has been described by Colin Simpson, t he author of a book entitled The Lusitania, as \"the foulest act of wilf ul murder ever committed on the seas.\" 8 But the event was not enough to enable President Wi lson to declare war against the German government, and the conspirators changed tactics. They would use other means to get the American people in volved in the war, as the \"flame of indignation\" did not sweep the United Sta tes as had been planned. Robert Lansing, the Assistant Secretary of State, i s on record as stating: \"We must educate the public gradually — draw it alo ng to the point where it will be willing to go into the war.\" 9 After the sinking of the Lusitania, two inquiries w ere held, one by the English government, in June, 1915, and one by the A merican government in 1918. Mr. Simpson has written that \"Both sets of ar chives... contain meager information. There are substantial differences of f act in the two sets of papers and in many cases it is difficult to accept that th e files relate to the same vessel.\" 10 But in both inquiries, the conclusions were the sam e: torpedoes and not exploding ammunition sank the Lusitania, because th ere was no ammuni- tion aboard. The cover-up was now official. But there have been critics of these inquiries. One was, of course, the book written by Colin Simpson, who did the research necessary to write his book in the original minutes of the two inquiries. The Los Angeles Times reviewed Mr. Simpson's book a nd concluded: \"The Lusitania proves beyond a reasonable doubt tha t the British govern- ment connived at the sinking of the passenger ship in order to lure America into World War I. The Germans, whose torpedo struck the liner, were the unwitting accomplices or victims of a plot probably concocted by Winston Churchill.\" 11 President Wilson was seeking re-election in 1916. H e campaigned on his record of \"keeping us out of the War\" during his fi rst term of office from 1912 to 1916. But behind the scenes, Wilson was secretly plotting America's entry into the War, mainly through the machinations of Wilson' s major advisor, Colonel Edward Mandell House. House had already com mitted America to a participation in the war: \"The House-Grey memoran dum... pledged American intervention on the side of the Allies if Germany would not come promptly to the peace table. This agreement was app roved by Wilson eight 259"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 23 WORLD WAR I months before the 1916 election.\" 12 But the real reason the War was being fought was sl owly emerging. One of the first revelations occurred on May 27, 1916, when President Wilson proposed a the League of Nations in a speech before the League to Enforce Peace. Wilson argued that what the world needed to prevent the recurrence of a similar war was a world government. Some were not happy with the slowness of America's entry into the war One of these was Franklin Roosevelt, who: In the early months of 1917 [before the official de claration of war by the United States government] he had been in constant conflict with his chief, Secretary of the Navy, Jos eph Daniels, over the same issues. For Daniels, who resisted every move that might car ry the United States into the war, those four months (Janu ary through April) of 1917 were the \"agony of Gethsemane.\" He opposed convoying [the intentional sending of Am erican ships into the war zone in the hope that one would be sunk by the German Navy]. He opposed the arming of merchant shi ps [inten- tionally provoking the German Navy into believing t hat the ship was a ship of war]. Roosevelt favored both. And when a filibuster prevented congressional autho rization of the arming of merchantmen, Roosevelt was impatie nt with Wilson for not immediately using his executive powe r to arm [the ships]. He dined at the Metropolitan Club with a gr oup of Repub- lican \"warhawks\" [Roosevelt was a Democrat]. It inc luded Theo- dore Roosevelt, General Wood, J.P. Morgan, and Elih u Root [one of the founders of the CFR]. The primary topic of discussion was, according to R oosevelt's diary, \"how to make Administration steer a clear co urse to uphold rights.\" This was an euphemism for an aggressive policy on t he highseas that would result in incidents and involve the United States in the war. 13 Roosevelt's badgering apparently paid off, for on A pril 2, 1917, President Wilson asked Congress for a Declaration o f War, and it was granted on April 6. The United States was now in the war \"t o end all wars,\" and \"to make the world safe for democracy.\" The war wound its horrible course through the destr uction of human lives and ended on November 11, 1918. Historian Walter Mills wrote the following about th e purpose of the 260"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 23 WORLD WAR I war and about House's basic intent: \"The Colonel's sole justification for preparing such a batch of blood for his countrymen was his hope of establishing a new world order [a world government] of peace and security...\" 14 The official treaty that ended the war was the Trea ty of Versailles, where representatives of all sides sat down at a conferen ce table and wrote the treaty. Several interesting personalities attended these me etings. In the British delegation was the British economist John Maynard K eynes, and represent- ing the American banking interests was Paul Warburg , the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. His brother, Max, the head of the German banking firm of M.M. Warburg and Company, of Hamburg, Germany, and who \"was not only in charge of Germany's finances but was a lead er of the German espionage system\" 15 was there as a representative of the German govern ment. The Treaty was written to end the war, but another delegate to the conference, Lord Curzon of England, the British For eign Secretary, saw through what the actual intent was and declared: \"T his is no peace; this is only a truce for twenty years.\" Lord Curzon felt th at the terms of the Treaty were setting the stage for a second world war, and he correctly predicted the year it would start: 1939. Lord Curzon was indeed a prophet: he picked the act ual year that World War II would start! One of the planks of the Treaty called for large am ounts of war repara- tions to be paid to the victorious nations by the G erman government. This plank of the Treaty alone caused more grief in the German nation than any other and precipitated three events: 1. The \"hyperinflation\" of the German mark between 192 0 and 1923; 2. The destruction of the middle class in Germany; and 3. The bringing to power of someone who could end the inflation: a dictator like Adolf Hitler. This plank was written by John Foster Dulles, one o f the founders of the Council on Foreign Relations, and later the Secreta ry of State to President Dwight Eisenhower. Even John Maynard Keynes became concerned about the Treaty. He wrote: \"The peace is outrageous and impossible and can bring nothing but misfortune behind it.\" 16 . In addition to writing the Treaty of Versailles, th e nations who were victorious in the war also wrote the Charter of the League of Nations, which was ratified on January 10, 1920, and signed by Pre sident Wilson for the American government. Wilson brought the treaty back to the United States and asked the Senate to ratify it. The Senate, reme mbering George Washing- ton's advice to avoid foreign entanglements and ref lecting the views of the American people who did not wish to enter the Leagu e, refused to ratify the 261"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 23 WORLD WAR I treaty. President Wilson was not pleased, possibly because he saw himself, as Senator Henry Cabot Lodge was quick to point out, a s: \"... a future President of the world.\" 17 It is now apparent that Wilson intended to head up the world govern- ment the war was fought to give the world, and he b ecame depressed when the Treaty was not ratified. Imagine the disappoint ment of one who had come so close to becoming the very first President of the World, only to have it taken away by the actions of the Senate of the U nited States. Imagine the sense of incredible power that Wilson must have fel t, thinking he would become the very first individual in the history of mankind to rule the world. Others had tried and failed, but Wilson was confide nt that he would succeed. But the American people, expressing their displeasu re through the Senate, would not let him. Odiers were not so disappointed, however. \"The war, in brief, provided an unparalled opportunity for the richest families to grab [exorbitant profits] at the expense of the public and, without exception , they made the most of this opportunity. The rich families, to be sure, wa nted the war to be won, but they took care that the victory was expensive to th e common taxpayers. They uttered no cries for government economy... so long as the public treasury was at their disposal.\" 18 One of the families who reaped the exorbitant profi ts were \"the Rockefellers, who were very eager for the United St ates to enter World War I, [and who] made far more than $200,000,000 from t hat conflict.\" 19 But support for the League of Nations continued. Th e Grand Orient Lodge of Freemasonry of France was one which advise d all of its members: \"It is the duty of universal Freemasonry to give it s full support to the League of Nations....\" 20 As could have been anticipated, the League of Natio ns became a major issue during the Presidential election of 1920. The Republican candidate Warren G. Harding was on r ecord as opposing the League and further attempts to ratify the charter: \"It will avail nothing to discuss in detail the League covenant, w hich was conceived for world super-government. In the existing League of N ations, world govern- ing with its super-powers, this Republic will have no part.\" He was opposed in the Republican primaries by Gener al Leonard Wood, one of the Republican \"warhawks,\" who was \".. . backed by a powerful group of rich men who wish(ed) a military man in the White House.\" The American people, once again manifesting their d isapproval of the League, voted for Harding as an evidence of that di strust and concern. Harding outpolled his opposition by a greater margi n than did President Wilson who had \"kept us out of the war\" during the election of 1916. Wilson 262"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 23 WORLD WAR I got only fifty-two percent of the vote, and Harding got sixty-four percent. Harding was a supporter of William Howard Taft, the President who opposed the bankers and their Federal Reserve Bill. After his election, he named Harry M. Daugherty, Taft's campaign manager, as his Attorney General. His other Cabinet appointments were not as wise, ho wever, as he unexplainedly surrounded himself with men represent ing the oil industry, for instance: his Secretary of State was Charles Evans Hughes, an attorney of Standard Oil; his Secretary of the Treasury was Andrew Mellon, ow ner of Gulf Oil; his Postmaster General was Will Hays, an attorney f or Sinclair Oil; and his Secretary of the Interior was Albert Fall, a pr otege of the oil men. It was Mr. Fall who was to be President Harding's d ownfall, as he later accepted a bribe from Harry Sinclair in exchange fo r a lease of the Navy's oil reserves in Teapot Dome, Wyoming. There are many who believe that the scandal was int ended to discredit the Harding administration in an attempt to remove him from office for two very important reasons: 1. Harding was consistently vocal against the League o f Nations, and there was still a chance that its supporters could get the United States to join as the League had survived the Senat e's prior refusal to ratify the treaty, and 2. Attorney General Daugherty had been prosecuting the oil trusts under the Sherman anti-trust laws. These activities did not please the oil interests w ho had created the Teapot Dome scandal. But Harding unfortunately did not live to see the full repercussions of the artificial scandal, as he died on August 2, 1923, before the story completely surfaced. (There are those who bel ieve that there were some who couldn't wait for the Teapot Dome Scandal to re move President Harding, and that he was poisoned.) But the oil interests allowed it to completely play its course as a warning to future Presidents of the United States not to op pose the oil interests. The warning has been generally heeded.

In the Thule Society: \"... the sun played a prime r ole... as a sacred symbol of the Aryans, in contrast to... the moon, r evered by the Semitic peoples.

There were additional sources of Hitler's strength. One who of fered an explanation of Hitler's easy rise to power was Walter Langer, a no ted psychoanalyst. Langer wrote in his book The Mind of Adolf Hitler that it was his theory that Hitler was himself one-quarter Jewish and the grandson of a Rothschild. He wrote: There is a great deal of confusion in studying Hitl er's family tree. Adolf's father, Alois Hitler, was the illegitimate son of Maria Anna Schicklgruber. It was generally supposed that the father of Alois Hitler was Johann Georg Hiedler... Alois, however, was not legitimized, and he bore hi s mother's name until he was forty years of age when he change d it to Hitler. A peculiar series of events, prior to Hitler's birt h, furnishes plenty of food for speculation. There are some people who seriously doubt that Joha nn Georg Hiedler was the father of Alois. Thyssen and Koehler, for example, claim that Chancellor Dolfuss (the Chancel lor of Austria) had ordered the Austrian police to conduct a thorou gh investiga- tion into the Hitler family. As a result of this in vesdgadon a secret document was prepared that proved Maria Anna Shickl gruber was living in Vienna at the dme she conceived. At that time she was employed as a servant in the h ome of Baron Rothschild. As soon as the family discovered her pregnancy she was sent back to her home in Spital where Alois was born. 5 265"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24 WORLD WAR II In a postscript in Langer's book, Robert G.L. Waite adds this comment. But even when Langer is mistaken and his guesses pr ove incorrect, he is often on the right track. Consider his hint that Hitler's grandfather might h ave been a Jew. There is no reason to believe the unlikely sto ry told by Langer's informant that Hitler's grandmother Maria Anna Schick- elgruber, a peasant woman in her forties from the W aldvietral of rural Austria, had had an intimate liason with a Ba ron Rothschild in Vienna. But Hitler had worried that he might be blackmailed over a Jewish grandfather and ordered his private lawyer, Hans Frank, to investigate his paternal lineage. Frank did so and told the Fuehrer that his grandmot her had become pregnant while working as a domestic servant in a Jewish household in Graz. The facts of this matter are in dispute — and a ver y lengthy dispute it has been. The point of overriding psychological and historica l impor- tance is not whether it is true that Hitler had a J ewish grandfather, but whether he believed that it might be true. He did so believe and the fact shaped both his pers onality and his public policy. 6 It is possible that Hitler discovered his Jewish ba ckground and his relation to the Rothschilds, and aware of their eno rmous power to make or break European governments, re-established contact with the family. This would partially explain the enormous support he rec eived from the interna- tional banking fraternity, closely entwined with th e Rothschild family, as he rose to power. One thing is certain, however. Hitler started World War II by moving into Austria first. It has been theorized that he m oved into this country for two reasons. First, he wanted to silence Dolfuss wh o Hitler believed knew that he was a descendant of the Rothschilds, and se condly, he wished to remove all traces of his ancestry from the Austrian records. But the major source of Hitler's power came from a chemical cartel called I.G. Farben, (the name is an abbreviation of the complete name: Interssen Gemeinschaft Farben.) The importance of I .G. Farben's support for the Socialist movement was pointed out in a boo k about the cartel, in which it is stated: \"without I.G.'s immense product ion facilities, its far reaching research, varied technical experience and overall concentration of economic power, Germany would not have been in a po sition to start its aggressive war in September, 1939.\" 7 266"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24 WORLD WAR II But I.G. Farben had a little-known source of its en ormous economic power: Wall Street, U.S.A. \"Without the capital sup plied by Wall Street, there would have been no I.G. Farben in the first p lace, and almost certainly no Adolf Hitler and World War II.\" 8 I.G. Farben had its beginning in 1924 when American banker Charles Dawes arranged a series of foreign loans totalling $800 million to consolidate gigantic chemical and steel combinations into carte ls, one of which was I.G. Farben. Professor Carroll Quigley terms the Dawes P lan: \"largely a J.P. Morgan production.\" 9 Three Wall Street houses, Dillon, Read & Co.; Harri s, Forbes & Co.; and National City handled three-quarters of the loans u sed to create these cartels. 10 The importance of I.G. Farben to the plans of the G erman Nazi Party can be illustrated by a product that an I.G. domina ted company manufac- tured. It was called Zyklon B, the lethal gas utili zed by the exterminators at Auschwitz, Bitterfeld, Walfen, Hoechst, Agfa, Ludwi gshafen, and Buchen- wald. (I.G. Farben, being a chemical company even b efore it was merged with other chemical companies to form the cartel, w as also the producer of the chlorine gas used during World War I.) American support for I.G. Farben continued as Henry Ford merged his German as sets with those of I.G. in 1928. 11 But the real importance of I.G. to the war efforts of Adolf Hitler came in the utilization of the process known as hydrogenati on, the production of gasoline from coal, created by the I.G. Farben chem ical cartel. Germany had no native gasoline production capabilities, and thi s was one of the main reasons it lost World War I. A German scientist dis covered the process of converting coal (Germany was the possessor of large quantities of coal) into gasoline in 1909, but the technology was not comple tely developed during the war. In August, 1927, Standard Oil agreed to em bark on a cooperative program of research and development of the hydrogen ation process to refine the oil necessary for Germany to prepare for World War II. 12 And finally, on November 9, 1929, these two giant c ompanies signed a cartel agreement that had two objectives: First, the cartel agreement granted Standard Oil on e-half of all rights to the hydrogenation process in all countrie s of the world except Germany; and Secondly, the two agreed: \" . . . never to compete wit h each other in the fields of chemistry and petroleum prod ucts. In the future, if Standard Oil wished to enter the broad f ield of industrial chemicals or drugs, it would do so only as a partne r of Farben. Farben, in turn, agreed never to enter the field of petroleum except as a joint venture with Standard.\" 13 267"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24 WORLD WAR II In the words of a Standard Oil official: \"The I.G. are going to stay out of the oil business — and we are going to stay out of the chemical business.\" 14 This cartel agreement was extremely important to th e war effort because, by the end of the war, Germany was produci ng about seventy-five percent of its fuel synthetically. 15 But even more significant was the fact that these p lants were not the subject of Allied bombing raids, so that, by the wa r's end, twenty-five to thirty of its refineries were still operating with only ab out fifteen percent damage. 16 Standard Oil got into the refining business as well . In fact, William Dodd, the U.S. Ambassador in Germany, wrote the fol lowing in his diary about the pre-war years around 1936: \"The Standard Oil Company of New York, the parent company of the Vacuum (Oil Company ,) has spent 10,000,000 marks in Germany trying to find oil reso urces and (in) building a great refinery near the Hamburg harbor.\" 17 Meanwhile, back in the United States, preparations were being made to elect a President. In 1932, President Herbert Hoove r, a member of the CFR, was seeking re-election, He was approached by \"Henr y Harriman, President of that body (the United States Chamber of Commerce who) urged that I agree to support these proposals (the National Indu stry Recovery Act, the NRA, amongst others,) informing me that Mr. Rooseve lt had agreed to do so. I tried to show him that this stuff was pure fascis m; that it was merely a remaking of Mussolini's 'corporate state' and refus ed to agree to any of it. He informed me that in view of my attitude, the busine ss world would support Roosevelt with money and influence.\" 18 Hoover, later in 1940, indirectly explained why he refused the support of the American business community. He saw inherent problems with government control of the business world: In every single case before the rise of totalitaria n governments there had been a period dominated by economic plann ers. Each of these nations had an era under starry-eyed men who believed that they could plan and force the economi c life of the people. They believed that was the way to correct abuse or to meet emergencies in systems of free enterprise. They exalted the state as the solver of all economi c problems. These men thought they were liberals. But they also thought they could have economic dictatorship by bureaucracy and at the same time preserve free speech, orderly justice, and fre e government. They might be called the totalitarian liberals. Directly or indirectly they politically controlled credit, prices, production of industry, farmer and laborer. They devalued, pump-primed, and deflated. They cont rolled 268"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24 WORLD WAR II private business by government competition, by regu lation and by taxes. They met every failure with demands for more and more power and control... Then came chronic unemployment and frantic governme nt spending in an effort to support the unemployed. Government debts mounted and finally government cre dit was undermined. And men came the complete takeover, whether it was called Fascism, Socialism, or Communism. Yet, even with Hoover's refusal to support the goal s of \"big business,\" Roosevelt's presidential campaign of 1932 consisten tly attacked President Hoover for his alleged association with the interna tional bankers and for pandering to the demands of big business. The perva sive historical image of FDR is one of a president fighting on behalf of \"th e little guy,\" the man in the street, in the midst of unemployment and financ ial depression brought about by \"big business\" speculators allied with Wal l Street. \"Roosevelt was a creation of Wall Street [and] an integral part of the New York banking fraternity.. ..\" 19 The 1932 presidential campaign strategy was very si mple: \"big busi- ness\" wanted Roosevelt, but ran him as an \"anti-big business\" candidate. Hoover was \"anti-big business,\" but the media convi nced the American people that he was \"pro-big business.\" The result was predictable. Roosevelt defeated the incumbent Hoover. He could now start his move, what he called the \"Ne w Deal,\" towards a Fascist state. One observer, Whitaker Chambers, the American Communist Party member who defected, commented thus about the \"New Deal:\" \"(It) was a genuine revolution, whose deepest purpose was not simply reform within existing traditions but a basic change in th e social, and above all, the power relationship within the nation.\" 20 It was about this time that an incredible scheme co ncerning the presidency of the United States started taking shap e. From July, 1932 through November, 1933, a well known and popular mi litary general, Major General Smedley Butler of the U.S. Marine Corps \".. . was sought by wealthy plotters in the United States to lead a put sch (revolution) to overthrow the government and establish an American Fascist dictatorship.\" 21 Butler was tempted into the plot by \"... the bigges t bribe ever offered to any American — the opportunity to become the first dictator of the United States.\" He was approached by three gentlemen: Gray son Mallet-Provost Murphy, a director of Guaranty Trust, a J. P. Morga n Bank; Robert S. Clark, a banker who had inherited a large fortune from a f ounder of the Singer Sewing Machine Company; and John W. Davis, the 1924 Democratic 269"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24 WORLD WAR II candidate for President and the chief attorney for J. P. Morgan and Company Their plan was to \". . . seize the White House with a private army [of 500,000 veterans], hold Franklin Roosevelt prisoner , and get rid of him if he refused to serve as their puppet in a dictatorship they pla nned to impose and control.\" 22 The plotters revealed to Butler that they had \"$3 m illion in working funds and could get $300 million if it were needed. \" 23 Why the plotters selected General Butler is a myste ry, as Butler truly understood his role as a general in the Marine Corp s. He was on record as saying: \"War was largely a matter of money. Bankers lend money to foreign countries and when they cannot repay, the President sends Marines to get it.\" Butler didn't say it, but his role in the military was exactly in accordance with the \"Balance of Power\" political game describe d in a previous chapter. He continued: \"I know — I've been in eleven of thes e expeditions.\" 24 Butler's assertions that the military actually acte d as a collection agency for the big bankers was confirmed in 1934 by the Se nate Munitions Investi- gating Committee which \"confirmed his (Butler's) su spicions that big business — Standard Oil, United Fruit, the sugar tr ust, the big banks — had been behind most of the military interventions he h ad been ordered to lead.\" 25 In addition, Congress created the McCormack-Dickste in Committee to investigate Butler's charges. The conclusions of th is group confirmed General Butler's charges: \"(it) found five signific ant facts that lent validity to Butler's testimony.\" 26 Jules Archer, the author of the book on Butler's ch arges, entitled The Plot to Seize the White House, interviewed John J. McCormack, the co- chairman of the Committee and asked for his views o n the plot: Archer: Then in your opinion, America could definit ely have been a Fascist power had it not been for General Bu tler's patriotism in exploding the plot? McCormack: It certainly could have. The people were in a very confused state of mind, making the nation weak and ripe for some drastic kind of extremist reaction. Mass frustratio n could bring about anything. 27 There are those, however, who believe that the inte nt of the plotters was not the imposition of Butler as the leader of the g overnment, but was actually to use the incident as a means by which Roosevelt c ould impose a dictator- ship down upon the American people after Butler led his army upon the White House. This action, after Roosevelt termed it to be a \"national emergency,\" could have enabled him to take complete control of the government in the emergency, and the American peopl e would probably 270"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24 WORLD WAR II have cheered the action. So Butler was, according t o this theory, only the excuse to take complete control of the machinery of the government, and was never intended to be the new dictator. The plan failed, after Butler revealed the existenc e of the plot, and Roosevelt had to be content, if the theory is corre ct, with just being the President and not the dictator of the United States . Roosevelt had other plans for a fascist United States, however. Frances Perki ns, Roosevelt's Labor Secretary, reports that \"At the first meeting of th e cabinet after the President took office in 1933, the financier and advisor to R oosevelt, Bernard Baruch, and Baruch's friend, General Hugh Johnson, who was to become the head of the National Recovery Administration, came in wi th a copy of a book by Gentile, the Italian Fascist theoretician, for each member of the Cabinet, and we all read it with care.\" 28 So the plan was to move the American government int o the area of Fascism or government control of the factors of pro duction without a Butler- led revolution. It was decided that one of the main methods of achieving this goal was through a war, and the plans for a war inv olving the United States were being laid. One of the sources for confirming the fact that the se plans were underway is Jim Farley, Roosevelt's Postmaster Gene ral and a member of Roosevelt's Cabinet. Mr. Farley wrote that at the s econd cabinet meeting in 1933: \"The new President again turned to the possib ility of war with Japan.\" 29 It is possible that President Roosevelt knew that w ar with Japan had been planned even before 1933. According to one his torian, Charles C. Tansill, professor of diplomatic history at Georget own University, war with Japan was planned as early as 1915. In a book entitled Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt and the Coming of the War, published by D.C. Heath and Company, Professor Tans ill makes this interesting observation: The policy of pressure upon Japan antedated [Presid ent Roosevelt's Secretary of War Henry] Stimson some tw o decades... . Under Woodrow Wilson, a three-pronged offensive was launched against Nippon [Japan]. . . . In January, 1915, the American minister at Peking.. . sent to the Department of State a series of dispatches so c ritical in tone that they helped to create in American minds a fixation of Japanese wickedness that made eventual war with Japan a prob ability. It will be recalled that Franklin Roosevelt had bee n appointed Wilson's Assistant Secretary of the Navy, so it is both conc eivable and probable mat he knew about these dispatches and the plans to involv e us in a future war with 271"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24 WORLD WAR II Japan as early as 1915. If the professor is correct, it was not Roosevelt's purpose to bring President Wilson's plans into fruition. All that wa s needed was an act that could be utilized as the reason for a declaration o f war against Japan. That reason was an attack at Pearl Harbor. In fact, the American government knew that they wer e vulnerable at Pearl Harbor, the site of Japan's \"surprise\" attack to start World War II. It was at Pearl Harbor in 1932 that the United States Navy conducted maneuv- ers to test the chances of success of an attack fro m the sea. They discovered that Pearl Harbor was vulnerable from as close as s ixty miles off the shore That meant that Japan could attack from sixty miles away from Pearl Harbor and be undetected. The American Navy had pro ved it. 30 Not only was the government concerning itself with a possible war with Japan, but it was also aware that American capitali sts were creating a war machine in Germany in the early 1930's, years befor e Germany started their involvement in World War II. William Dodd, the U.S. Ambassador in Germany, wrote Roosevelt from Berlin: At the present moment, more than a hundred American corporations have subsidiaries here or cooperative understandings. The DuPonts have their allies in Germany mat are ai ding in the armament business. Their chief ally is the I.G. Farben Com- pany, a part of the government which gives 200,000 marks a year to one propaganda organization operating on American o pinion. Standard Oil Company . . . sent $2,000,000 here in December, 1933 and has made $500,000 a year helping Germans m ake ersatz [a substitute] gas [the hydrogenation process of conve rting coal to gasoline] for war purposes; but Standard Oil cannot take any of its earnings out of the country except in goods. The International Harvester Company president told me their business here rose 33% year [arms manufacture, I be lieve], but they could take nothing out. Even our airplanes people have secret arrangements with Krupps. General Motors Company and Ford do enormous busines s here through their subsidiaries and take no profits out. 31 In addition to these American companies, others wer e assisting the Germans in creating the materials they needed to wa ge war. For instance, International Telephone and Telegraph (I.T.T.) purc hased a substantial interest in Focke-Wolfe, an airplane manufacturer w hich meant \"that I.T.T. was producing German planes [fighter aircraft] used to kill Americans.\" 32 272"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24 WORLD WAR II I.G. Farben's assets in America were controlled by a holding company called American I.G. Farben. The following individu als, among others, were members of the Board of Directors of this corporati on: Edsel Ford, President of the Ford Motor Co.; Charles E. Mitchell, Preside nt of Rockefeller's National City Bank of New York; Walter Teagle, Pres ident of Standard Oil of New York; Paul Warburg, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and the brother of Max Warburg, the financier of Germany's war effort, and Herman Metz, a director of the Bank of Manhattan, controll ed by the Warburgs. It is an interesting and revealing fact of history that three other members of the Board of Governors of the American I.G. were tried and convicted as German \"war criminals\" for their crimes \"against hu manity,\" during World War II, while serving on the Board of Governors of I.G. Farben. None of the Americans who sat on the same board with those conv icted were ever tried as \"war criminals\" even though they participated in th e same decisions as the Germans.\" It appears that it is important whether y our nation wins or loses the war as to whether or not you are tried as a \"wa r criminal.\" It was in 1939, during the year that Germany starte d the war with its invasions of Austria and Poland, that Standard Oil of New Jersey loaned I.G. Farben $20,000,000 of high-grade aviation gasoline. The two largest German tank manufacturers were Opel , a wholly owned subsidiary of General Motors and controlled b y the J.P. Morgan firm, and the the Ford subsidiary of the Ford Motor Compa ny.' 4 In addition, Alcoa and Dow Chemical transferred tec hnology to the Germans, as did Bendix Aviation, in which the J.P. Morgan-controlled General Motors had a major stock interest, which su pplied data on auto- matic pilots, aircraft instruments and aircraft and diesel engine starters. (35) In addition to direct material support, other \"capi talistic\" companies supplied support: \"In 1939 the German electrical eq uipment industry was concentrated into a few major corporations linked i n an international cartel and by stock ownership to two major U.S. corporatio ns (International General Electric and International Telephone and Te legraph.)\" 36 Further support for the American owned or controlle d corporations came during the war itself, when their industrial c omplexes, their buildings and related structures, were not subject to Allied bombing raids: \"This industrial complex (International General Electric and International Telephone and Telegraph) was never a prime target f or bombing in World War II. The electrical equipment plants bombed as t argets were not affiliated with U.S. firms.\" 37 Another example of a German General Electric plant not bombed was the plant at Koppelsdorf, Germany, producing radar sets and bombing antennae. 38 Perhaps the reason certain plants were bombed and o thers weren't lies 273"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24 WORLD WAR II in the fact that, under the U.S. Constitution, the President is the Commander-in-Chief of all armed forces, and therefo re the determiner of what targets are bombed. The significance of America's material support to t he German govern- ment's war efforts comes when the question as to wh at the probable outcome of Germany's efforts would be: \"... not only was an influential sector of American business aware of the nature of Nazism, bu t for its own purposes aided Nazism wherever possible (and profitable) wit h full knowledge that the probable outcome would be war involving Europe and the United States.\" 39 Even Hitler's ideas about exterminating the Jews we re known to any observer who cared to do a little research. Hitler himself had written: \"I have the right to exterminate millions of individuals of inferior races, which multiply like vermin.\" In addition, Hitler made his desires known as early as 1923 when he detailed his plans for the Jews in his book Mein Ka mpf. Even the SS Newspaper, the Black Corps called for: \"The extermi nation with fire and sword, the actual and final end of Jewry.\" 40 This material support continued even after the war officially started. For instance, even after Germany invaded Austria in Mar ch, 1938, the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation, fifty percent owned by Genera l Motors and fifty percent by Standard Oil, was asked by I.G. Farben t o build tetra-ethyl plants in Germany, with the full support of the U.S. Depar tment of War which expressed no objection to the transactions. 41 And in August, 1938, I.G. Farben \"borrowed\" 500 ton s of tetra-ethyl lead, the gas additive, from Standard Oil. Later, after the invasion of Austria, and prior to the German invasion of Poland in 1939, Germany and Russia signed a pact on August 23,1939, with a secret clause for the division of Poland by these two war-time allies. All of the material support and all of the secret a greements came to a head on September 1, 1939, when Germany invaded Pol and in accordance with the terms of the pact signed with Russia. The Second World War had begun. The date of September 1, 1939, when Germany invaded Poland, is remembered as the date the war started. But little is remembered about the date Russia also moved into Poland, on September 16 , 1939. The nation of Poland was now divided between these two war-time a llies. It is interesting to notice what the responses of t he major allied nations were to these two dates. When Germany entered the w estern portion of Poland, Britain and France declared war on Germany. But when Russia moved into eastern Poland, there was no war declara tion by either nation. The Soviets caused one of the tragic events of hist ory after they occupied 274"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24 WORLD WAR II their portion of Poland. They captured approximatel y 10,000 Polish officers and brutally murdered them, most of them meeting th eir death in Katyn Forest near the Russian town of Smolensk. The tradi tional story about their deaths was that the officers had been killed by the German army, but now the evidence is clear that the Russians committed this crime. The other victims were taken aboard a barge which was towed out to se a and then sunk. Even with all of these efforts of the American busi nessman to construct the German war machine with the full knowledge and approval of President Roosevelt, he kept repeating that the nation would continue its \"neutral\" position: it would remain out of the war. On Septem ber 1, 1939, when the war started, he was asked by a reporter whether Ame rica would stay our of the war and Roosevelt replied: \"... I believe we can, a nd every effort will be made by the Administration to do so.\" 42 Roosevelt responded by appointing George Marshall, a GFR member, as Chief of Staff of the Army over General Douglas MacArthur, not a member of the CFR, and other senior officers. Others did not believe Roosevelt's claim that Ameri ca would remain neutral. On September 12, 1939, Hans Thomsen, the G erman charge d' affaires in Washington, cabled the German governmen t: \"... if defeat should threaten the Allies (England and France), Ro osevelt is determined to go to war against Germany, even in the face of the resistance of his own country.\" 43 But Germany's war efforts were still dependent on o il resources, and it came from a variety of sources, some external to th e German border. Before Rumania was invaded by the Germans, it was selling oil to Germany. Life magazine of February 19, 1940, has a picture of Rum anian oil being loaded into oil tank cars. The picture has a caption under it which reads, in part: \"Oil for Germany moves in these tank cars of Americ an Essolube and British Shell out of Creditul Minier yards near Ploesti (Ru manina.) Notice that cars are marked for German-American Oil Co. and German R ailways, consigned to Hamburg and Wuppertal in Germany. They were sent from Germany to speed up Rumanian oil shipments.\" 44 This picture was taken after Germany had invaded Austria and Poland, yet American and Br itish oil companies are transporting oil for the German government, (the ta nk cars in the picture are clearly marked \"Essolube,\" and \"Shell\"). And other sources supplied oil as well: \"... when t he German air force ran short of fuel, this was generously supplied fro m the great refinery belonging to the Standard Oil Company situated on t he island of Aruba via Spanish tankers.\" 45 This occurred during the war itself, yet these tan kers were not sunk by American submarines. 46 Even with the purchases of oil from non-German sour ces, the major supplier of oil was still the cartel: \"The I.G. Far ben-Standard Oil coopera- 275"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24 WORLD WAR II tion for production of synthetic oil from coal gave the I.G. Farben cartel a monopoly of German gasoline production during World War II. Just under one half of German high octane gasoline in 1945 was produced directly by I.G. Farben, and most of the balance by its affilia ted companies.\" 47 But as the war in Europe continued, America's leade rs were attempting to get America involved, even though the American p eople didn't want to become part of it. Roosevelt, the presidential cand idate, was promising the American people that the Roosevelt administration w ould remain neutral should he be re-elected. Others knew better. One, f or instance, was General Hugh Johnson, who said: \"I know of no well informed Washington observer who isn't convinced that, if Mr. Roosevelt is elected (in 1940), he will drag us into war at the first opportunity, and that , if none presents itself, he will make one.\" 48 Roosevelt had two opportunities to involve America in World War II: Japan was at war with China, and Germany was at war with England, France and other countries. Both war zones presente d plenty of opportunities to involve the American government in the war, and Roosevelt was quick to seize upon the opportunities presented. His first opportunity came from the war in the Paci fic. It was in August, 1940, that the United States broke the Japanese \"pu rple\" war-time code. This gave the American government the ability to read an d understand all of their recoverable war-time messages. Machines were manufa ctured to de-code Japan's messages, and they were sent all over the w orld, but none was sent to Pearl Harbor. Roosevelt's public efforts to involve America, whil e ostensibly remain- ing neutral, started in August, 1940, when the Nati onal Guard was voted into Federal service for one year. This was followed in September by the Selective Service Act, also for one year's duradon. But the key to America's early involvement occurred on September 28, 1940, when Japan, Germany and Italy signed the Trip artite Treaty. This treaty required that any of the three nations had t o respond by declaring war should any one of the other diree be attacked by an y of the Allied nations. This meant that should Japan attack the United Stat es, and the United States responded by declaring war against Japan, it would automatically be at war with the other two nations, Germany and Italy. Roosevelt now knew that war with Japan meant war wi th Germany. His problem was solved. He had made secret commitments to Winston Churchill and the English government to become involved in the war ag ainst Germany and he knew \"... that the only way he could fulfill his se cret commitments to Churchill to get us into the war, without openly di shonoring his pledges to the American people to keep us out, was by provokin g Germany or Japan to attack.\" 49 276"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24 WORLD WAR II Roosevelt moved towards the Pacific theater first, knowing that, if he could provoke Japan to attack America first, Americ a would automatically be at war with Germany as well. He also knew that, should Germany attack America, Japan would have to declare war on America . So Roosevelt attempted to get either nation to attack the United States first. Japan was to get the first opportunity. In October, 1940, Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox sent for Admiral J.O. Richardson, Commander-in-Chief of the American fleet in the Pacific. Knox advised him that \"the President wanted him to establish a patrol of the Pacific—a wall of American naval vessels stretched across the western Pacific in such a way as to make it impossible for Japan to reach any of her sources of supply; a blockade of Japan to prevent b y force her use of any part of the Pacific Ocean. Richardson protested vigorous ly. He said that would be an act of war, and besides, we would lose our navy. Of course Roosevelt had to abandon it.\" 50 This scene in history poses two rather interesting questions: 1. Why did Roosevelt, the Commander-in-Chief of all armed forces, including the Navy, not directly order Admiral Rich ardson to do as he wished? Why did he choose to use his Secretary o f the Navy to almost politely ask him to create the naval patrol? Is it possible that Roosevelt did not choose to use his supreme power because he knew that this was indeed an act of war and that he did not want to be identified as the originator of the plan. If Richardson had agreed to Knox's proposal, and Japan had attacked an American naval vessel, Roosevelt could have directly blamed the admiral fo r allowing the vessel to get into the position of being fired upon by the Ja panese Navy in the first place. Roosevelt wanted a scape-goat and Richardson refuse d. 2. Why did Roosevelt not replace the admiral wi th someone who would do exactly as he wished? It is possible that Roosevelt realized that Richard son now knew about the plan, and since he did not approve, he would be in a position to clearly identify Roosevelt as the source of the idea should the second admiral agree to it. Roosevelt did not want to jeopardize his carefully constructed image as a \"dove\" in the question of whether or not America should become involved in the war. It is important to remember that, in November, 1940 , just after this incident, candidate Roosevelt told the American peo ple: \"I say to you fathers and mothers, and I will say it again and again and again, your boys will not be sent into foreign wars.\" 277"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24 WORLD WAR II Richardson later appraised his situation at Pearl H arbor and felt that his position was extremely precarious. He visited R oosevelt twice during 1940 to recommend that the fleet be withdrawn to th e west coast of America, because: 1. His ships were inadequately manned for war; 2. The Hawaiian area was too exposed for Fleet trainin g; and 3. The Fleet defenses against both air and submarine a ttacks were far below the required standards of strength. 51 That meant that the American government had done no thing to shore up the defenses of Pearl Harbor against an offshore attack since the naval manuevers of 1932 discovered just how vulnerable th e island was. Richardson's reluctance to provide Roosevelt's inci dent for the United States to enter the war, and his concern about the status of the Fleet, led to his being unexpectedly relieved of the Fleet command in January, 1941. The American Ambassador to Tokyo, Joseph C. Grew, w as one of the first to officially discover that Pearl Harbor was the intended target of the Japanese attack, as he corresponded with President Roosevelt's State Department on January 27, 1941: \"The Peruvian minis ter has informed a member of my staff that he had heard from many sour ces, including a Japanese source, that, in the event of trouble brea king out between the United States and Japan, the Japanese intended to m ake a surprise attack against Pearl Harbor...\" 52 In March 1941, President Roosevelt was still hoping for an incident involving the United States and Germany, according to Harold Ickes, Roosevelt's Secretary of the Interior. He reported: \"At dinner on March 24, he [Roosevelt] remarked that 'things are coming to a h ead; Germany will be making a blunder soon.' There could be no doubt of the President's scarcely concealed desire that there might be an incident wh ich would justify our declaring a state of war against Germany...\" 53 Roosevelt and Churchill had conspired together to i ncite an incident to allow America's entry into the war. According to Ch urchill: The President had said that he would wage war but n ot declare it, and that he would become more and more provocat ive. If the Germans did not like it, they could attack American forces. The United States Navy was taking over the convoy r oute to Iceland. The President's orders to these escorts were to att ack any U- boat which showed itself, even if it were two or th ree hundred miles away from the convoy... Everything was to be done to force \"an incident.\" Hitler would be faced with the dilemma of either at tacking the convoys and clashing with the United States Navy or holding off, 278"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24 WORLD WAR II thus \"giving us victory in the Battle of the Atlant ic. It might suit us in six or eight weeks to provoke Hitler by taunting him with this difficult choice.\" 54 But Hitler was attempting to avoid a confrontation with the United States. \"He had told his naval commanders at the en d of July [1941] to avoid incidents with the United States while the Eastern compaign [the war against Russia] is still in progress .... A month later the se orders were still in force.\" 55 Churchill even wrote to Roosevelt after the German ship the Bismarck sank the British ship the Hood, recommending in Apr il, 1941: \"... that an American warship should find the Prinz Eugen (the e scort to the Bismarck) then draw her fire, 'thus providing the incident fo r which the United States would be so thankful,' i.e., bring her into the war .\" 56 Hitler was not as wise in other matters. He attacke d his \"ally\" Russia on June 22, 1941, even though Germany and Russia had s igned a treaty not to declare war on each other. With this action, the pressure to get the United St ates involved in the war really accelerated. Roosevelt, on June 24, 1941 , told the American people: \"Of course we are going to give all the aid that we possibly can to Russia.\" 57 And an American program of Lend-Lease began, supply ing Russia enormous quantities of war materials, all on credit . So with Hitler pre-occupied with the war against Ru ssia and refusing to involve himself with the Americans on the open sea, Roosevelt had to turn his attentions back to Japan for the incident he ne eded. The next step was to assist other countries, the En glish and the Dutch, to embargo oil shipments to Japan in an attempt to force them into an incident that would enable the United States to ent er the war. Japan, as a relatively small island, and with no oi l industry to speak of, had to look elsewhere for its oil, and this was the reason for the proposed embargo. It was thought that this action would prov oke Japan into an incident. Ex-President Herbert Hoover also saw the manipulations leading to war and he warned the United States in August, 1 941: \"The American people should insistently demand that Congress put a stop to step-by-step projection of the United States into undeclared war ...\" 58 But the Congress wasn't listening. President Roosevelt wasn't listening either to the charges of Congress- roan Martin Dies, Chairman of the House Committee o n Un-American Activities. By August of 1941, \"The Dies committee had assembled a large amount of evidence which more than confirmed the su spicions which we had entertained on the basis of surface appearances : It was clear that the Japanese were preparing to invade Pearl Harbor and that they were in Possession of vital military information.\" 59 279"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24 WORLD WAR II This information was made available to the Roosevel t administration by Congressman Dies personally. But this was the se cond time mat Dies had appealed to Roosevelt about his knowledge of Japan' s intendon to attack Pearl Harbor: \"Early in 1941 the Dies Committee cam e into possession of a strategic map which gave clear proof of the intenti ons of the Japanese to make an assualt on Pearl Harbor. The strategic map was prepared by the Japanese Imperial Military Intelligence Department. \" Dies telephoned Secretary of State Cordell Hull who talked to President Roosevelt. 60 Congressman Dies was told not to release the docume nt to the public and the Roosevelt administration did nothing. (In April, 1964, when Dies told the American public of these revelations he added this comment: \"If anyone questions the ver acity and accuracy of these statements, I will be glad to furnish him wit h conclusive proof.\") 61 It was also in August, 1941, when the new product o f the I.G. Farben cartel was tested on humans for the first time. The product was called Zyklon B and it was to be used on the Jews and others at t he concentration camps. In the Pacific Theater, Japan's war messages, being read in Washing- ton, started asking their spy in Pearl Harbor to re port ship movements, and, later, the exact nature and location of the ships i n the harbor. Japan's request for more information on what was ha ppening at Pearl Harbor was followed on October 16, 1941, by the res ignadon of the Prince's cabinet in Japan. These resignations were followed by the military adminis- tration of General Tojo and his cabinet. All of thi s activity was recognized by the American government as a decided step toward wa r, but still nothing was done to alert Pearl Harbor. It was on this day that Henry Stimson, Roosevelt's Secretary of War, wrote the following in his diary: \"... and so we fa ce the delicate question of the diplomatic fencing to be done so as to be sure that Japan be put into the wrong and to make the first bad move — overt move.\" 62 Stimson was to repeat this concern that faced the R oosevelt administra- tion when he testified before one of the Committees investigating Pearl Harbor. There he was quoted as saying: \"The questio n was how we should maneuver them [the Japanese] into the position of f iring the first shot without allowing too much danger to ourselves.\" 63 The Japanese would still not respond with the incid ent to provoke the United States into retaliating, but America was con vinced that it would happen ultimately. For instance, Secretary of State Cordell Hull told Roosevelt on Novbember 7, 1941, that he foresaw \"ev ery possibility of an early war with Japan.\" Japan continued its efforts towards staying out of a war with the United States and had its Ambassador in Washington continu e his efforts towards 280"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24 WORLD WAR II securing a no-war treaty with the Secretary of Stat e. On November 22, 1941, they wired their Ambassador: \"Do your best, spare n o efforts and try to bring about the solution we desire.\" But even though Japan was attempting to avoid war w ith the United States, the Japanese were being encouraged by an un likely source to strike out at the United States. \"On May 17, 1951, the New York Daily News featured an article by its Washington correspondent , John O'Donnell, concerning various old Far Eastern intelligence rep orts which were being closely guarded in Washington. Among those document s were the 32,000 word confession of Soviet spy Richard Sorge.\" Mr. Sorge was a Russian spy who had infiltrated the German embassy in Japan and worked hard to convince Japanese offic ials that Japan should not attack Russia, but move south, at the risk of w ar with the United States. \"When [Sorge] informed the Kremlin [in Russia] in O ctober, 1941, that the Japanese intended to attack Pearl Harbor within 60 days, . . . he . . . received thanks for his report and the notice that Washingto n — Roosevelt, Marshall, Admiral Stark, et al. — had been advised of the Jap anese intentions.\" 64 On November 25, 1941, the day that the Japanese fle et sailed for Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt convened a meeting of t he various Cabinet officers: Secretaries Stimson, Knox, Marshall and A dmiral Harold R. Stark, Chief of Naval Operations. According to Stimson's t estimony: \"The President brought up the event that we were likely to be attacked perhaps [as soon as] next Monday, for the Japanese are notoriou s for making an attack without warning.\" 65 \"In spite of the risk involved, however, in lettin g the Japanese fire the first shot, we realized that in o rder to have the full support of the American people, it was desirable to make su re that the Japanese be the ones to do this so that there should remain no doub t in anyone's mind as to who were the aggressors.\" 66 On November 26, 1941, the Japanese Embassy in Washi ngton sent the following message to Tokyo: \"Hull said... I am sorr y to tell you that we cannot agree to it [Japan's treaty Proposal].\" 67 The British Intelligence Service, which had men ins ide the Japanese diplomatic agencies in the United States, took the November 26th telegram to Tokyo as meaning that the \"Japanese negotiations off. Services expect action within two weeks.\" 68 And Roosevelt and the Department of the Army also k new this, as \"... a very important American Army Intelligence officer, in service in the Far East during 1941... had gained knowledge of the Yamamoto plan to send a task force to attack Pearl Harbor and sent three separat e messages to Washington revealing this information, and at least two of the se reached the Army files well before the attack on Pearl Harbor.\" 69 Finally, in desperation, the Japanese government se nt a message to their 281"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24 WORLD WAR II Washington embassy on December 6, 1941, in essence breaking off all negotiations with the American government. After th e message was inter- cepted by the American government, de-coded and giv en to Roosevelt, he is quoted as saying: \"This means war.\" 70 Roosevelt now knew that Japan planned on attacking the United States but still he did nothing about warning the American forces at Pearl Harbor And on December 7, 1941, Japan launched a \"surprise attack.\" The American forces were not prepared for the attac k. And the attacking Japanese forces had orders from Japan to return to Japan should they detect any evidence mat the Americans had been alerted. As their air force attacked Pearl Harbor, they repo rted mat the American planes were having difficulty in getting off the gr ound. This was because the American planes had been group ed in circles, with their propellors all facing inward as the result of an order by President Roosevelt. It was reported that Roosevelt had order ed the planes grouped in this fashion because he feared \"acts of sabotage\" a gainst the planes and he was acting to protect them. Since airplanes do not have a \"reverse gear\" the gr ouping of the planes in this manner made it extremely difficult for them to rapidly get out of the circle and into the air. One critic of the circling of these airplanes, Harry Elmer Barnes, has written: \"Bunching the planes in a circle, wing to wing, would [make them] helpless in the event of a surpri se air attack.\" 71 Another strange circumstance was the make-up of the fleet anchored at Pearl Harbor at the time of the attack. The Pacific Fleet consisted of nine battleships and three aircraft carriers along with a host of smaller ships. During the attack, the Japanese sank or seriously d amaged eight battleships but no aircraft carriers. The American government had reasoned that the aircr aft carriers would have an extremely important role to play in the typ e of war they felt would be waged in the Pacific theater. So all of the airc raft carriers were moved out of Pearl Harbor and all of the less valuable battle ships were left behind. The battleships were expendable because most of them ha d been constructed prior to or during World War I, which meant that th ey were old and obsolete. Along with the aircraft carriers, Roosevelt's gover nment also withdrew the smaller, more mobile ships that they knew could be more efficiently utilized in a sea war. \"On November 28th, Admiral W illiam F. Halsey was sent to Wake [Island] with the carrier Enterprise, three heavy destroyers and nine destroyers. On December 5th, Admiral John E. N ewton was sent to Midway with the carrier Lexington, three heavy crui sers and five destroyers. The carrier Saratoga had been sent to the Pacific C oast...\" 72 Admiral Husband Kimmel, the commander of the naval forces at Pearl Harbor, clearly places the blame for Pearl Harbor's unpreparedness on 282"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24 WORLD WAR II President Roosevelt. He has written: \"We were unrea dy at Pearl Harbor because President Roosevelt's plans required that n o word be sent to alert the fleet in Hawaii.\" 73 The Rt. Hon. Oliver Lyttleton, a member of Churchil l's war cabinet, declared in an address to the American Chamber of C ommerce in London on June 24, 1944: \"America provoked [the Japanese] to such an extent that the Japanese were forced to attack Pearl Harbor. It is a travesty of history to say that America was forced into the war.\" 74 The Council on Foreign Relations published an artic le in its publica- tion called Foreign Affairs in January, 1974, that agreed with Lyttleton. The article stated that \"Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor actually thrust the United States into World War II, but the Roosevelt adminis tration decided a year and a half earlier to risk war in order to prevent the totalitarian domination of all Europe.\" 75 So on December 8, 1941, President Roosevelt asked t he Congress to declare war on Japan, stating that December 7, 1941 would go down in history as a \"day of infamy.\" So when Roosevelt addressed the nation through his speech inCongress, he lied when he said: \"We don't like it—and we didn 't want to get in it—but we are in it and we're going to fight it with every thing we've got.\" 76 So Roosevelt asked for, and received, a Declaration of War against Japan. Germany followed on December 11th with a Dec laration of War against the United States. This action was in accor dance with the terms of the Tripartite Treaty signed earlier by Germany, Italy and Japan. Roosevelt's activities in the planning of Pearl Har bor had a costly price. The final toll was 2,341 U.S. servicemen dead and 1 ,143 wounded; eighteen ships including the eight battleships were sunk or heavily damaged; more than two hundred Army Air Corps and Navy planes wer e destroyed or unusable; and sixty-eight civilians were killed. 77 For his supposed unpreparedness at Pearl Harbor, Ad miral Kimmel was relieved of his command, and he retired on Janu ary 7, 1942. After the war was over, Congress looked into the re asons for the lack of preparation at Pearl Harbor. Their conclusions are most revealing: 1. The attack was unprovoked by America; 2. There was no evidence that the President, Secretary of State, Secretary of War, Secretary of Navy, provoked the a ttack; 3. The American government made every effort to avoid the war with Japan; 4. The attack was caused by the Army's and Navy's fail ure to detect hostile forces; and 5. The errors made were errors of judgment and not der elictions of duty. 78 283"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24 WORLD WAR II The last conclusion was apparently intended to reli eve the commanders of the armed forces from responsibility so that the y could not be court- martialed. Admiral Kimmel and General Walter C. Sho rt, the commander of the armed forces at Pearl Harbor, continuously plea ded for a court martial to clear their reputations, but they were never grante d. Admiral Robert Theobold, the Commander of all destr oyers at Pearl Harbor, wrote a book entitled The Final Secret of P earl Harbor, in which he detailed his conclusions about the \"surprise attack .\" He wrote: 1. President Roosevelt forced Japan to war and enticed them to initiate hostilities by holding the Pacific fleet i n Hawaiian waters as an invitation to that attack; 2. The plans to use Pearl Harbor as the bait started i n June, 1940; 3. War with Japan meant war with Germany; and 4. Roosevelt, Marshall and Stark knew about Pearl Harb or 21 hours before the attack. 79 But in spite of all of this evidence that the Japan ese attack on Pearl Harbor was known by Roosevelt and his top advisors well in advance of that actual event, there are those who still hold to the position that the govern- ment, and Roosevelt specifically, knew nothing abou t it. One of these skeptics is Walter Scott, who writes t he question-and- answer series called \"Personality Parade\" in the Pa rade magazine. In answer to the question: \"Is it true that Franklin D. Roose velt knew that Japan was going to attack Pearl Harbor in World War II?\" Mr. Scott answered: \"Not true.\" 80 So America now had a two-front war against Japan in the Pacific and against Germany in Europe. Just as planned! 284"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Chapter 25 Communist Betrayal The entry of the United States into the war was now complete. After years of planning and plotting on the part of the A merican government, the fighting men of the American armed forces were now committed to a life and death struggle in two widely separated theaters of war. On January 1, 1942, the twenty-five nations at war against Germany and Japan signed a \"Declaration by the United Nations,\" (emphasis added) which pledged that any one nation involved would no t sign a separate armistice or peace. 1 When General Douglas MacArthur was appointed as the commander- in-chief of the armed forces in the Pacific theater , he was appointed as the \"United Nations Commander of the South Pacific.\" 2 (emphasis added.) So it was becoming apparent just what the purpose o f the war was: to give the world a one-world government: a United Nat ions. The second reason the war was being fought was for Russia to expand its imperialism into the countries of Eastern Europ e. This secondary motive was made clear in June, 1942, when Churchill and Ro osevelt postponed a planned 1943 invasion of Europe by the Allied armed forces for one more year until 1944. This delay had the effect of allow ing Russia more lime to 285"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25 COMMUNIST BETRAYAL advance from the east, thereby assuring it control of the many Eastern European countries it occupied with its armed force s as it moved westward. In addition, this move had to be couched by the act ivities of the war; in other words, the Russians would be allowed to commu nize Eastern Euro- pean countries under the disguise of the war. Becau se Russia was advancing easterly at a slower rate than was anticipated, the Allies had to give her more time; hence the delay in the invasion of Western Eu rope. Senator Joseph McCarthy attributed this decision to Secretary of State George Marshall: \"We now come to what was without q uestion the most significant decision of the war in Europe: the deci sion by Marshall... to concentrate on France and leave the whole of Easter n Europe to the Red Armies.\" 3 Another event that occurred during the war seems to indicate that this interpretation of these decisions is correct. In the spring of 1943, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, hea d of the German Secret Service, met with George Earle, the American Naval Attache in Istanbul, Turkey. Admiral Canaris came to discuss t he surrender of the German armed forces. He reported that he had joined with other German leaders in an assassination plot to remove Hitler f rom power. After this was accomplished, they would take over the German gover nment, and surrender to the Allies, with only one condition: There must be no Soviet advance into Central Europe . Mr. Earle sent President Roosevelt a note informing him of Canaris' proposal. He received no reply. Earle tried again, and this time he received what h as been termed a \"brush-off\" from President Roosevelt. So Earle flew to Washington. Roosevelt told him tha t his concerns were overly anxious, that Germany would soon surrender a fter the planned attack commenced through Western Europe. Earle was very disappointed, and returned to Istanb ul. He advised Canaris of what he had learned, and he returned to Germany, where he and the other plotters against Hitler's life were found out and either hung or shot for their efforts to shorten the war and prevent th e expansion of the Russians into Eastern Europe. 4 If Roosevelt had accepted Canaris' offer: \"... the war might have ended in 1943. Countless lives would in all probability h ave been saved, and, of greatest importance, the Allies wouldn't have suppl anted one dangerous ideology with another. The Soviet hordes would have been stopped at the Polish border. The entire map of Europe would have been different.\" 5 Earle returned to the United States. He wrote \"I de cided to make known some of my views and observations about the so-call ed allies, the Soviets, so 286"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25 COMMUNIST BETRAYAL as to wake up the American people about what was re ally going on. I contacted the President about it, but he reacted st rongly and specifically forbade me to make my views known to the public. Th en upon my request- ing active duty in the Navy, I was ordered to Samoa , in the far-distant South pacific\" 6 In fact, Earle was warned by Roosevelt's daughter i n a letter to him \"... that if he carried out his outlined program of publicly criticizing and commenting on some of the Soviet moves, he could be adjudged guilty of treason.\" 7 It is indeed unfortunate that the Roosevelts took t his position on the \"Soviet moves,\" the movement of Russian troops into the Eastern European countries as the war was ending, as evidenced by Pr esident Roosevelt's inaction in the Canaris case, and the letter of his daughter in the Earle case, because the citizens in these countries did not wan t the Russians to occupy their nations. This fact was made brutally apparent as millions of these patriots actually joined with the German armed forc es in an attempt to keep the Russians from advancing into their respective c ountries. So Roosevelt could have truly assisted these patrio ts in keeping their countries free of Communism by assisting the Canari s group, and Earle could have been of immense assistance in bringing t hese matters to the attention of the American people. But it was not to be, and the Eastern European coun tries were occupied by the Russian Communists much to the chagrin of mi llions of patriots. Roosevelt continued his support of the Russian gove rnment as the war ended by guaranteeing their occupation of these nations b y the agreements made at the wartime conferences with the major leaders of t he Allied governments. In February, 1945, Roosevelt met with Joseph Stalin at Yalta, one of the wartime conferences, even though he was showing sig ns of severe illness. There are many now who insist that Roosevelt was dy ing of cancer, one being his personal physician. A magazine article st ated: \"As early as April 1944, the White House physician, Vice Admiral Ross McIntire, began systematically lying to everyone about the Presiden t's condition, and perhaps because the war was going well the press di d not seriously challenge him.\" 8 In 1979, Dr. Harry S. Goldsmith, a Dartmouth Medica l Surgeon and a student of Roosevelt's health history, announced th at he felt Roosevelt had been secretly suffering from cancer when he died of a stroke in 1945, even though there were reports of his being well. One author, Frazier Hunt, in his book entitled Doug las MacArthur, has stated that the reason Roosevelt's physicians were lying to the American people about his health was that Roosevelt had a st rong reason to survive until after the war ended. That reason was that Roo sevelt had been offered 287"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25 COMMUNIST BETRAYAL the presidency of the world government, the United Nations that was to be created after the war was over: \"The sick and undep endable Roosevelt, his already handicapped mind inflamed with grandiose id eas of a World State that he would head...\" 9 So when Roosevelt met Stalin at Yalta, he was provi ding Stalin with whatever he wanted as a gesture to the Communists t hat he was truly assisting their plans for the occupying of these co untries. For instance, at Yalta he gave the Russians, in addition to the Euro pean countries: Port Arthur in the Yellow Sea, the port of Dairen, the K urile Islands, Outer Mongolia, and the lower half of Sakhalin Island. Most of these lands were previously occupied by Ame rica's other World War II ally, China. American Ambassador William C. Bullitt, after disco vering what had happened at Yalta, said this: \"No more unnecessary, disgraceful and potentially disgraceful document has ever been sign ed by a president of the United States.\" 10 In addition, Roosevelt also gave Russia three votes in the yet to be created General Assembly of the United Nations (one vote each for ByloRus- sia, the Soviet Union, and the Ukraine) even though every other nation, including the United States, has only one vote. Roosevelt, when asked about the three votes for Rus sia issue, said: \"I know I shouldn't have done it. But I was so tired w hen they got hold of me.\" 11 But Roosevelt was not the only one providing Europe an countries to the Russians. Winston Churchill, according to papers ma de public in 1973, agreed \"... in 1944 to Soviet dominadon of Poland i n exchange for Joseph Stalin's support of Bridsh interests in the Far Eas t and the Mediterrean.\" 12 It is strange, indeed, that Churchill, the originat or of the term \"Iron Curtain\" to describe the wall built around Eastern Europe by the Commu- nists, also had his share in the building of that w all. In his book Triumph and Tragedy, Churchill himself confirmed that he wa s involved with the building of that same Iron Curtain. He wrote: \"I sa id to Stalin: \"Let us settle our affairs: How will it do to have 90% predominanc e in Rumania, for you, for us to have 90% of the same in Greece, and 50%, about, in Yugoslavia? I wrote on a half-sheet of paper: Rumania: Russia 90%, others 10% Greece: Great Britain: 90 %, Russia 10% Yugoslavia: 50-50 Hungary: 50-50 Bulgaria: Russia 75%, others 25% Stalin took a pencil and made a large dck upon it, and passed it to me. It was setded in no more time than it takes to set it down .\" But the giving of Eastern Europe to the Russian Com munists was not 288"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25 COMMUNIST BETRAYAL just the work of these two individuals. Others were involved as well. For instance, the decision to allow the Russians to rea ch Berlin before the Americans, thereby guaranteeing Communist control o f part of this major city, was the responsibility of the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight David Eisenhower, according to military docu ments released in 1970. 13 But the overall responsibility for the Communizatio n of Eastern Europe rests squarely with the administration of President Roosevelt, who desired to assist them at any cost. He is quoted as saying on March 8,1944: \"I think the Russians are perfectly friendly. They aren't trying to gobble up the rest of Europe. These fears that have been expressed by a l ot of people here that the Russians are going to try and dominate Europe, I pe rsonally don't think there is anydring to it.\" 14 And according to Ambassador Bullitt, Roosevelt told him: \"I have just a hunch that Stalin... doesn't want anydring but se curity for his country, and I think mat if I give him everydring I possibly can, and ask nodring in return, he won't try to annex anything and will wor k for a world of demo- cracy and peace.\" 15 It is not known why Roosevelt placed such misguided trust in the Russian Communist Stalin, but it is known mat Roose velt and Eisenhower approved of the forced repatriation of some six mil lion people back to Russia, many of whom were tortured or killed after they reached their destination. Two Russians who have written about this abominable decision of these American leaders are Nikolai Tolstoy and Alex andr Solzhenitsyn. The Americans called this repatriation \"Operation Keelh aul,\" after the naval form of punishment or torture where the prisoner is hauled under the keel of a ship by a rope tied to the prisoner's body. These six million individuals were not only soldier s who had fought on the side of the Germans against the Russians, but t hey were women and children as well. 700,000 of this total were soldiers under the comma nd of Lt. Gen. Andrei Vlasov, a brilliant Soviet officer and one of the h eroes of the battle of Moscow in 1942. In April of 1945, General Vlasov led his t roops to the American lines so that they could surrender and then volunteer to return to Communist Russia and attempt to oust the Bolshevik government They laid down their arms and considered themselves to be American Priso ners of War. Vlasov was informed that permission to pass through the American lines had been refused, so he had to order his unar med men to save themselves as best they could. Most of them were forcibly repa triated back to Russia and executed. General Vlasov himself was taken from an American escort by Soviet troops and spirited to Moscow where he was l ater executed. 289"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25 COMMUNIST BETRAYAL The British government behaved no more honorably.

Many committed suicide ra ther than be repat- riated back to the Communist government in Russia. Even though it was Churchill and Roosevelt who made these incredible decisions to repatriate millions of anti-Communist Russians back to certain death, it was General Dwight Eisenhower who enforce d \"Operation Keelhaul,\" with no apparent pangs of conscience. The morality of these decisions on the part of the leaders of the victor- ious Allied governments to send millions of people to certain death in Russia was brought back into the public limelight during t he trial of Adolf Eichmann, a German \"war criminal\" who was tried for his involvements with the extermination of millions of Europeans in the concentration camps of the Nazi regime. The Israeli court that tried Eichmann observed that : \"The legal and moral responsibility of he who delivers the victim to his death is, in our opinion, no smaller, and may be greater, than the l iability of he who does the victim to death.\" 17 Another example of Russia's perfidy occurred during the war in July, 1944, when Polish General Bor-Komorowski had rallie d an army of 250,000 Polish patriots who were waiting for the Russians t o reach Warsaw so that together they could defeat the Germans. The Germans had been retreating as Russia moved west after the Battle of Stalingrad, a nd Russia had reached the bank of the Vistula River, the river flowing throug h Warsaw. The general's army, described as the best and most effective under- ground resistance army in Europe, waited for word f rom the Russians before they started the battle against the German army. The General's radio picked up a broadcast in Polish from Moscow signed by Molotov, a representative of the Russian government. It said: \"Poles, the time of liberation is at hand. Poles, t o arms! Make every Polish home a stronghold against the invader [the Germans] . There is not a moment to lose!\" The General, believing that the Russians planned on moving into Warsaw, gave the order to revolt against the German s. \"The whole affair was, of course, a typically ruthless Stalin trap.

But the war was not to end as quickly as it could have. The Japanese attempted to end the war on February 1 4, 1945, when the American government learned of their efforts to sur render through a de- coded message between their government and the Russ ian government. 1 But the American government was not ready to accept Jap an's efforts to end the war. \"Marshall [George Marshall, the Army Chief of Staff] made it clear that he had little faith in the Japanese overtures for p eace.\" 2 These peace overtures were repeated again in June, 1945, when Russia received word that Japan was ready to end the war. These messages were once again intercepted by the American government, but n othing was done. The reason for America's reluctance to end the war became clear on August 6, 1945, when the United States dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan. The American Air Force tried to w arn the people of the city that it was certain to be destroyed, as they d ropped 720,000 leaflets onto the city stating that Hiroshima would be \"...oblite rated unless Japan surrendered at once.\" 3 A good many people left the city, but it was estim ated that around 250,000 people remainded. 299"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26 THE ATOMIC BOMB The decision to drop a second bomb was made: \"No to p level meeting had been convened to discuss the necessity of a sec ond bomb, no attempt made to determine if the first bomb or Russian entr y (Russia had declared war on Japan on August 8, 1945) into the conflict h ad quickened Japan's intent to surrender.\" 4 Harry Truman, who had assumed the presidency after President Roosevelt's death on April 12, 1945, is quoted as s aying, after the first bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, that: \"... this is the gr eatest thing in history.\" 5 There are those in high places in the American gove rnment who felt that it was not necessary to drop either bomb on Ja pan. One, Admiral William Leahy, was on record as saying: \"I was of t he firm opinion that our war against Japan had progressed to the point where her defeat was only a matter of time and attrition.\" 6 There is still speculation as to why the two cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were selected as the targets for the two a tomic bombs, since neither were military targets, in the main. One author offe rs an explanation: \"Hiroshima and Nagasaki... were the chief centers i n Japan of a native Christian population.\" 7 There is some evidence that before the bombs were d ropped on Japan, President Roosevelt had some second thoughts about the use of these enormously powerful and destructive weapons on inno cent people: \"The President... prepared a speech for delivery on Jeff erson Day. Roosevelt had intended to expose openly to the world 'the danger that politicians will accept as inevitable the destruction of innocent pe ople to achieve their goals and that scientists will concentrate on the means a nd ignore the ends of their research.' \" 8 In any event, before he could deliver the address, Roosevelt passed away, so the world will never know for certain just what he intended by this speech. It is interesting to note that Japan never attacked Russia during the war. Russia was America's World War II ally and therefor e a presumed enemy of Japan. Neither had Russia attacked Japan prior to t he dropping of the first atomic bomb. This is strange as Russia was at war w ith Japan's ally Germany, and according to the terms of the Triparti te Treaty already referred to, both nations should have been at war with each other. Japan's attacking of Russia would have had dramatic results in assist ing the nation of Germany, for two reasons. 1. It would have opened up a second front for Russia, which would have been forced to move troops needed in its war a gainst Germany to the war against Japan, thereby relieving some of the pressure on Japan's ally, Germany; and 2. It possibly could have closed the Russian port of V ladivostok, where much of America's Lend-Lease war material was being 300"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26 THE ATOMIC BOMB unloaded.

August 8, 1945, was the day mat Russia finally deci ded to enter the war against Japan, and this was but six days prior to t hat nation's surrender. It has been theorized that the reason this occurred in this sequence was to rationalize the giving of Japanese property or inte rests to the Russians after the war, since uiey were then an official enemy of Japan. One of the Americans who observed the strange behav ior of the Amer- ican government was General George S. Patton. He ha d seen enough to cause him to want to resign from tbe military so ui at he could \"say what I want to\" about America's \"soft on Communism\" stance during the war. Patton knew enough about the military uiat he could n't merely retire and speak out, because military men of high rank, even though reared, are still under the control of the government. This subjectio n to government authority includes uieir ability to speak out on th e main issues of the day. Should Patton resign, he would be free to speak as he saw fit. Patton had a strong dislike for what happened as th e Russians acquired much of Eastern Europe, and it is said by many uiat he was going to speak about uiis betrayal to the American people after th e war was over. But, before he had a chance to resign, he was kille d after an automobile accident caused him to be hospitalized. In 1979, a former undercover agent for the Office o f Strategic Services, the OSS, gave an interview in which he claimed that he had been asked to kill Patton. This agent was \"... Douglas Bazata, a veter an intelligence agent, who said he received a contract on Patton's life in 1944. According to Bazata, the order for the 'hit' came down to him from none ouier than the legendary Office of Strategic Services direct from [its admin istrator] 'Wild Bill' Donovan.\" 9 When Bazata was asked why he was finally going publ ic with this admission after so many years, he said he \"... was in poor health and wanted the American people to know the truth.\" The newspaper that carried the interview claimed th at it had \"a professional analyst subject Bazata's interview to the rigors of a content analysis using a Psychological Stress Evaluator (P. S.E.) His report: Bazata gives no evidence of lying.\" It was Bazata's contention that, although he collec ted more than $10,000 for the death of Patton, he was not responsible for Patten's actual death.

But the tragic events of the war we re not to come to a close as yet. The victorious Allies had to move over sixteen mill ion Germans from their homes in Central and Eastern Europe. The reas ons for this expulsion are not presently clear, although the removal was a greed to by the Allied governments. In October, 1944, the Soviet Army was advancing wes tward through the eastern nations of Europe. This westward movement \" ... triggered a massive flight of German civilians to the West.

Helpl ess civilians were evicted from their homes with clubs, women were rap ed, men were con- scripted into slave labor, thousands were interned in camps awaiting expulsion...\" 11 After the war ended, the victorious Allies conducte d War Crime trials at Nuremburg. One of those convicted of the forced dep ortation of Germans and others into forced labor was Albert Speer, Germ any's Minister of Arms and Munitions. In his book Inside the Third Reich, Speer wrote: \"Deporta- tion of labor is unquestionably an international cr ime. I do not regret my sentence, even though other nations are now doing t he same thing we did.\" 12 Others also saw the depravity of the deportations a nd attempted to bring it to the attention of the U.S. government. One of these was Robert Murphy, U.S. Political Adviser for Germany, who wrote to th e U.S. State Department: \"In viewing the distress,... the mind reverts insta ntly to Dachau and Buchenwald. Here is retribution on a large scale .. . practiced...on women and children, the poor, the infirm.\" 13 No one listened, especially the United States, and the deportations continued. The tragedy is that \"over 2 million Germ ans did not survive their involuntary migration.\" 14 The war was now over, the Germans had been removed from their new homes, and Europe could begin to rebuild from the e normous destruction.

The second individual who apparently figured it out was James 304"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 27 THE EXPOSERS Forrestal, America's first Secretary of Defense. Fo rrestal's credentials for this position were impressive. He became a partner and P resident of Dillon, Read and Company, an international banking firm, and in April, 1944, he was appointed Secretary of the Navy. This was followed on September 17, 1947, by his appointment as Secretary of Defense. He was later asked to resign by president Harry Truman, and he did so on March 2, 1 949. Forrestal had viewed the events at the ending of th e World War with much dismay, as he saw the American government cons istently yield to the Russians in important matters. His explanation for these events was simple: \"These men are not incompetent or stupid. They are crafty and brilliant. Consistency has never been a mark of stupidity. If they were merely stupid, they would occasionally make a mistake in our favor .\" 2 Such thoughts on the part of the Secretary of Defen se were certain to make enemies of those who were subverting America. An author has summarized the situation: The Communists, both American and European, had goo d reason to hate Jim Forrestal: he hated them. He eme rged from the Second War dedicated to the destruction of Communis m. He had opposed every concession to bring Russia int o the war against Japan. He fought General Marshall's effort to force Chiang Kai-shek to coalesce with the Chinese Communists. H e battled those men in the State Department who tried to give the Mediterra- nean to Russia. 3 [He] . . . was alarmed by what he took to be Roosev elt's trust in Stalin.... Forrestal's nightmare was that capitalis m itself was under seige all over the world. During the war his personal files fattened alarming ly — filled with the names of journals and organizations and in dividuals who were \"under Communist influence.\" 4 After Truman asked him to resign, Forrestal went to Florida. Sensing that he was under emotional strain, the White House sent the chief of neuropsychiatry at the U.S. Naval Hospital at Bethe sda, Maryland to see Forrestal. Forrestal did not request that this doct or, Doctor George N. Raines, visit him. In fact, there was no reason for even the White House to send him as Forrestal was no longer in the employ o f the government and, therefore, no longer the direct concern of the fede ral government. But it was decided that Forrestal should go to the Bethesda Naval Hospital. Even before Forrestal left Florida for th e hospital, his personal diaries: \"... consisting of fifteen loose-leaf bind ers totalling three thousand pages, were hastily removed from his former office in the Pentagon and locked up in the White House where they remained fo r a year.\" 5 Before Forrestal left for Bethesda, he told a frien d that he had been 305"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 27 THE EXPOSERS followed and that his telephone had been tapped. He further discussed the impending war in Korea, a war still fifteen months from beginning. Forrestal said: \"They're going to catch us unprepar ed. American soldiers will be dying in a year.\" 6 Forrestal apparently saw the same forces at work pl anning the war in Korea a full fifteen months before it started. He m ust have felt that these were the same planners who had arranged the debacle of p ost-war Europe, where, in Forrestal's mind, the Eastern European countries had been given over to Communism. After Forrestal went to Bethesda, his brother asked Dr. Raines whether his brodier was fundamentally okay. Dr. Raines answ ered in the affirmative. But Dr. Raines' behavior in regards to not allowing Forrestal to see both his own brother and his family priest, Monsignor Ma urice S. Sheehy, was unusual, to say the least. He utterly refused to al low them to see Forrestal. (Sheehy had attempted to see Forrestal six times, a nd each time he was refused.) Finally, Henry Forrestal, his brodier, decided to t ake his brodier into the country on May 22, 1949. He then phoned the hospita l and told them he was arriving to take his brother. But only hours before Henry was due to board his train to go to Bethesda, he received the news t hat his brother was dead. It is strange that James Forrestal died the very da y his brother had planned to take him from the hospital. 7 The ex-Secretary of Defense is said to have jumped to his death from a sixteenth floor window of the hospital on May 22,19 49. His body was found sprawled grotesquely on a third floor projection of the building. The cord of his bathrobe was wound tightly around his neck and tied in a knot. The hospital issued a prepared statement that Forre stal had committed suicide. This was followed almost immediately by an almost identical coroner's verdict. It was theorized that, on the night of May 22, Forr estal had left his bed and walked across the hall to an unlocked window. I t was here that he tied one end of his bathrobe cord around a radiator and the other end around his neck. He then, according to this theory, opened the window and jumped out \"in an attempt to hang himself.\" Several things about his purported suicide do not r ing true. For instance: Forrestal left no suicide note. He was not critically ill, so he had no medical rea son to terminate his life. In fact, Dr. Raines had admitte d that he had progressed to the point that his discharge from the hospital was imminent. Not one shred of the badirobe cord or mark on the r adiator 306"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 27 THE EXPOSERS existed to indicate that the cord had ever been the re. The cord hadn't broken during the purported hanging . The cord was tightly wrapped around Forrestal's neck, b ut ex-Navy man Forrestal apparently had not ded the other end tightly around the radiator. In summary, then: Contrary to the impression given the public at the time, Forrestal had none of the usual reasons for killing himself. He had no financial worries. He had no personal wor ries. He was basically in good health. The only possible motive he could have had for taki ng his life, everyone agreed, was depression over losing his job as Secretary of Defense and/or over the smears of newspaper columni sts and radio commentators. However, Forrestal could hardly have killed himself for these reasons either. All his life he had been a fighter. He was actively planning, as soon as he left the hospital, to start a career as a newspaperman and write a book. These projects, he h ad told friends, would allow him to take the offensive agai nst his attackers and expose their real motives. As far as \"depression over losing his job\" as a pos sible suicide motive, he had intended leaving his government post soon in any event. 8 Monsignor Sheehy placed the blame on Forrestal's de ath on those who kept him from seeing his long-time friend: \"Had I b een allowed to see my friend, Jim Forrestal... and put his mind at ease w ith the oldest and most reliable medicine known to mankind [religion], he w ould be alive today. His blood is on the heads of those who kept me from see ing him.\" 9 There was a semi-official investigation into Forres tal's death. It was conducted by the medical officer in command of the Bethesda Naval Hospital and it \"did not find that Forrestal had co mmitted suicide. The word 'suicide' was not once used: the board found only t hat Forrestal had died 'as a result of injuries, muldple, extreme, received in cident to a fall... ' 10 Perhaps the key to Forrestal's death is in his diar ies. These papers were: \"subjected to censorship... from three different so urces... the White House;... the Pentagon; and, finally, they were con densed and gutted by Walter Millis under the guise of editing [for seria lization in the New York Tribune].\" 11 Millis was also responsible for the publishing of t he diaries by the Viking Press in 1951. So what Forrestal had written in his diaries will 307"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 27 THE EXPOSERS probably never be known to the American public. The three acts of censor- ship have probably eliminated the meat of Forrestal 's concerns. One possible clue of what they contained comes from Monsignor Sheehy, who is on record as saying: \"Many, many tim es in his letters to me, Jim Forrestal wrote anxiously and fearfully and bit terly of the enormous harm that had been, and was unceasingly being done, by men in high office in the United States government, who he was convinc ed were Communists or under the influence of Communists, and who he sa id were shaping the policies of the United States government to aid Sov iet Russia and harm the United States.\" 12 It is interesting to see that the opinion that Forr estal was insane at the time of his death is still the version being offere d to the American public. Take, for instance, the answer Walter Scott in his Parade magazine column called \"Personality Parade\" offered to the followin g question on May 24, 1981: Question: Did President Harry Truman ever conspire with the American press to hide the truth about the insanity of James Forrestal, our first Secretary of Defense? Answer:... the press declined to reveal to the publ ic that Forrestal suffered from a severe psychosis in the l ate 1940's. He was obviously insane at the time.... 13 Dr, Carroll Quigley voiced the same opinion in his book entitled Tragedy and Hope by informing the reader that: \"His mind collapsed under the strain and he resigned in 1949, committing suic ide shortly afterward.\" 14 The American people will probably never know what h appened to James Forrestal. Only the clues to his tragic death remain. The third individual who came to realize that there was something wrong with America's policies was Senator Joseph Mc Carthy who was to pay for this knowledge with both his reputation and later with his life. The campaign to vilify Senator McCarthy was long in duration and in fact has continued to the present. An examination o f the facts will reveal why his name is so sullied even to this day. Appropriately, it was: \"Forrestal who personally al erted the freshman Senator to the Communist menace and 'named names' t o him of key persons in our federal government who were consistently sha ping our policies and programs to benefit Soviet Russia.\" 15 The story of McCarthy begins, perhaps, on March 22, 1947, when President Harry Truman issued Executive Order #9835 , establishing a federal loyalty program that forbade the employment of loyalty risks. 16 This action was followed on June 10, 1947, by a memorand um sent to Secretary of State George C Marshall by the Senate Committee on Appropriations. The 308"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 27 THE EXPOSERS memo read, in part, as follows: On file in the Department is a copy of a preliminar y report of the FBI on Soviet espionage activities in the Unite d States which involves a large number of State Department employe es, some in high official positions... There is a deliberate, calculated program carried o ut, not only to protect Communist personnel in high places, but to reduce security and intelligence protection to a nullity. Should this case break before the State Department acts, it will be a national disgrace. 17 18 This report was completely ignored by Secretary Mar shall. This inaction caused Senator McCarthy to write the following about George Marshall in his book, America's Retreat From Victory: \"If he was wholeheartedly serving the cause of the United Stat es, these decisions were great blunders. If they followed a secret pattern t o which we do not as yet have the key, they may very well have been successful in the highest degree.\" 19 Later, on March 13, 1948, President Truman softened his position on security risks when he: \"issued an order instructin g all federal employees to withhold personnel loyalty and security information from members of Congress....\" 20 This order obviously would make it extremely diffic ult to pursue any security or loyalty risks through government channe ls, and certainly hampered the investigations by those agencies respo nsible for ferreting out those who jeopardized the security of the American government. Later, just after Thanksgiving, 1949, three men cam e to Senator McCarthy's office and: ... showed the Senator a one-hundred page summary o f Commu- nist subversion in the United States, including ser ious penetration of the State Department. The report, which had been prepared under the direction of J. Edgar Hoover [the head of the F.B.I.], had already been supplied to the White House, the Secre tary of State, and heads of other federal departments concerned. It detailed the operations of spy networks operatin g in the U.S. government and involving a large number of State De partment employees, some in very high positions. Senator McCarthy read the report and was so shocked by what it revealed that he committed himself to do somethi ng about it. 21 And so began the McCarthy saga. It was but a few months later, on February 9, 1950, that Senator McCarthy \"did something about it.\" He gave a speech to the Ohio County 309"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 27 THE EXPOSERS Women's Republican Club of Wheeling, West Virginia, in which he said: \"I have in my hand fifty-seven cases of individuals wh o would appear to be either card-carrying members or certainly loyal to the Communist Party, but who nevertheless are still helping to shape our for eign policy.\" 22 McCarthy's sensational charges began appearing in n ewspapers across the country. In Salt Lake City, he withdrew the offer to give [S ecretary of State Dean] Acheson the names. A presidential order was then in effect prohibiting the government from turning over loyalty records of U.S. employees to anyone outside the Exe cutive Depart- ment, including, of course, congressional investiga ting committees. What would be the use of giving Acheson the names o f Com- munists and their sympathizers, McCarthy argued, un less their actual records could be obtained and proof shown to the people. What would prevent the Secretary of State from simp ly accepting the list, announcing that nobody on it wa s either a Communist or a security risk, and thus end the matt er. 23 On February 11, 1950, Senator McCarthy sent a wire to President Truman: \"calling upon him to furnish Congress with a list of all State Department employees considered bad security risks and asking him to revoke the presidential order.\" Senator McCarthy was certain that the State Departm ent loyalty files would prove his case, but he never got a chance to receive them, as: \"The State Department's press officer... issued a heated denia l. 'We know of no Communist members in this Department and if we find any they will be summarily dismissed.' \" 24 Those who felt McCarthy was libelling and slanderin g innocent people now know that he was very concerned about not relea sing the names of the individuals he had on his lists, and: \"on February 20, 1950, without naming names, he gave his colleagues [in the Senate] a res ume of the facts from the files of eighty-one individuals — the fifty-seven r eferred to at Wheeling and twenty-four additional cases of less importance and where the evidence was less conclusive.\" 25 Two days later: \"... a Special Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was appointed and charged with conducting 'a full and complete study and investigation as to whether persons who are disloyal to the United States are or have been employed by t he Department of State.' Instead of investigating McCarthy's accusations, ho wever, the Committee investigated McCarthy. Millard Tydings, the Committ ee Chairman, set the tone for the inquiry when he boasted: 'Give me thre e days of public hearings 310"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 27 THE EXPOSERS and McCarthy will never show his face in the Senate again.' \" 26 The anti-McCarthy feelings in the United States sta rted rising. Even the Communist Party newspaper, the Daily Worker, of Apr il 15, 1950, added its concerns: \"Communists are keenly aware of the damag e the McCardiy crowd is doing.\" 27 Gus Hall, the head of the American Communist Party urged: \"Commu- nist Party members and all anti-fascists to yield s econd place to none in the fight to rid our country of the fascist poison of M cCarthyism.\" 28 So McCarthy had to face both the Communist Party an d the govern- ment investigating committee in an effort to force the government to rid itself of the subversives already known to exist within it s ranks. McCarthy appeared to have won a victory when, on Ma y 4, 1950, President Truman changed his mind and announced tha t the loyalty files on McCardiy's cases would be made available to the Com mittee. 29 But when they were delivered to the Committee, McCardiy char ged that they had been \"raped,\" \"skeletonized,\" and \"tampered with.\" 30 Later, on July 12, 1950, McCardiy released the documents on which he based h is charges that the files had been stripped. \"These documents are affidavits from four persons who had been employed by the [State] Department on a te mporary basis in the Fall of 1946 and assigned to a 'file project,' the purpose of which, they said, was to remove from the personnel files of Departmen t employees all derogatory information.\" 31 So McCarthy was taking on the State Department and it was countering with a concealment of the truth. McCarthy also told the American public that it was at the Yalta conference in 1945 that Roosevelt and Stalin planne d, not only the Korean War that the United States was then involved in, bu t also the Vietnamese war that was to follow some 10 toi2 years later. It was on September 23, 1950, that McCarthy charged: \"Here was signed the death warran t of the young men who were dying today in the hills and valleys of Ko rea. Here was signed the death warrant of the young men who will the tomorro w in the jungles of Indochina [Vietnam].\" He also saw that all of these machinations were the work of a giant conspiracy and he said so. He wrote: \"How can we ac count for our present situation unless we believe that men high in Govern ment are concerting to deliver us to disaster? This must be the product of a great conspiracy, a conspiracy on a scale so immense as to dwarf any pr evious such venture in the history of man. A conspiracy of infamy so black that, when it is finally exposed, its principals shall be forever deserving of the maledictions of all honest men...\" 32 \"What can be made of this unbroken series of decis ions and acts contributing to the strategy of defeat? Th ey cannot be attributed to incompetence .... The laws of probability would dic tate that part of. . . [the] decisions would serve this country's interest.\" 33 311"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 27 THE EXPOSERS (Notice the similarity of this statement and the on e made by James Forrestal about \"consistency never being the mark o f stupidity.\") McCarthy was becoming too dangerous to the conspira cy that he had begun to discover. So the smear job began that it h oped would destroy him, the smear job mat went something like: \"I like what he is doing, but I object to his methods.\" Or: \"He is smearing individuals wi th guilt by association.\" McCarthy knew that these smear jobs against him wer e inaccurate, and he wrote about them in his book, published in 1952: \"Whenever I ask those who object to my methods to name the 'objectionable methods;' again I hear parroted back to me the Communist Daily Worker stoc k phrase: 'irresponsi- ble charges' and 'smearing innocent people.' But as often as I have asked for the name of a single innocent person who has been ' smeared' or 'irresponsi- bly charged,' nothing but silence answers.\" 34 The government later substantiated McCarthy's charg es in 1953 when it published a report, on July 30, entitled Interlocki ng Subversion in Govern- ment Departments, which was written by the Senate I nternal Security Subcommittee. It read, in part: \"The Soviet interna tional organization has carried on a successful and important penetration o f the United States Government, and this penetration has not been fully exposed. This penetra- tion has extended from the lower ranks to top-level policy and operating positions in our government. Despite the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other security agencies had repor ted extensive information about this Communist penetration, little was done b y the Executive branch to interrupt the Soviet operatives in their ascent in Government...\" 35 So the decision was made to \"get McCarthy,\" as ther e were those who felt that he was getting too close to the truth. So on January 21, 1954: \"... an anti-McCarthy strategy meeting [was] held ... in th e office of the Attorney General.\" 36 Present at this meeting were: Henry Cabot Lodge, U. S. Ambassador to the United Nations; Attorney General Herbert Browne ll; Deputy Attorney General William Rogers (later President Nixon's Sec retary of State); White House aides Sherman Adams and Gerald Morgan; and Jo hn G. Adams, counselor, Department of the Army. At this meeting: \"It was decided that John Adams wo uld start compil- ing notes to be used as the basis for filing charge s against Senator McCarthy....\" 37 (One of the efforts to expose McCarthy was a book w ritten by Richard H. Rovere entitled Senator Joe McCarthy. 38 ) It has been pretty well established by America's ma jor media that the most serious charge against McCarthy is that he mal iciously \"smeared\" innocent people, by calling mem names. Mr. Rovere, certainly no supporter of the Senator, called him the following names in his book: a bully, a seditionist , a species of nihilist, a 312"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 27 THE EXPOSERS screamer, a political thug, a master of the mob, a black arts practitioner, a champion liar, a prince of hatred, possibly a homos exual, a true hypocrite, morally indecent, perhaps crazy, an outrageous four flusher, a fraud, a heavy drinker, and a demon. It is comforting to know that it was the Senator wh o smeared people by calling them names! Mr. Rovere did like certain people, however. He cal led the Socialist Norman Thomas a \"devoted champion of liberty and de cency.\" The famous Army-McCarthy hearings started a few mon ths later on April 22, 1954, after McCarthy questioned the Army' s decision to promote a suspected Communist. The next step in the destruction of Senator McCarth y occurred on May 17, 1954, when President Eisenhower, who had replac ed Harry Truman, \"issued an Executive order prohibiting testimony at the hearings from any member of the Executive without prior permission — which of course was not given.\" 39 Eisenhower himself admitted to some strong negative feelings about McCarthy. He wrote about these feelings in the Apri l, 1969, Reader's Digest: \"From the beginning, I was urged by a great many pe ople ... to 'smash' McCarthy by a public denunciation. When I refused, I was criticized bitterly in many quarters. Actually, I yearned in every fibe r of my being to do precisely what my critics were urging—but I felt su re this was the wrong tactic.\" 40 The charges against McCarthy came to a head on July 30, 1954, when Senator Ralph Flanders introduced a resolution cond emning Senator McCarthy for \"conduct unbecoming a member.\" It cont ained forty-six different counts, and a committee was appointed to investigate the charges. After hearings, it recommended that McCarthy be cen sured, not on the forty- six counts, but on only two. 41 The charges introduced by Flanders, however, were n ot written by him nor members of his staff: \"What is generally not kn own is that the speech made by Senator Flanders in introducing the resolut ion, as well as the resolution itself, were written for him by the Nati onal Committee for an Effective Congress, [which was] created by . . . Ar thur Goldsmith .... \" 42 (It is very revealing that the Arthur Goldsmith who created the organi- zation which wrote the charges against McCarthy was the same Arthur Goldsmith who had the ability to make decisions for the Communist Party of the United States. It will be recalled that it w as Dr. Dodd, a member of the Communist Party, who revealed that it was the wealt hy Goldsmith who had this incredible power.) The Senate later voted on the charges when they vot ed to \"condemn\" and not \"censure\" the Senator. (\"Condemning\" is mil der than \"censuring.\") After all of the allegations against McCarthy about his \"smearing 313"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 27 THE EXPOSERS innocent people,\" was he personally able to substan tiate his charges? Now, in retrospect, it is possible to look at the r ecord. Was McCarthy able to substantiate his allegations that there wer e at least eighty-one security risks in the State Department? 1. Fifty-seven of these cases were later summoned by a Loyalty Board and fifty-four of the accused confirmed McCarthy's charges by resigning under fire. 2. By November of 1954, all of the eighty-one persons on McCarthy's list had left government employ by dismissal or res ignation. 3. The Senate Internal Security Subcommittee revealed that, on June 27, 1956, the State Department's own security chief , Scott McLeod, drew up a list of 847 security risks in the State D epartment. It would seem that Joe McCarthy's major sin was tha t he underestimated the extent to which the Communists h ad pene- trated the State Department. 43 It is also revealing that an organization named The Constitutional Educational League of New York \"offered a $10,000 r eward for any person who could prove mat Senator McCarthy ever called an yone a Communist or a Communist Fronter who, in fact, was not. Although this offer was widely publicized from coast to coast, no one ever claimed mat reward.\" 44 How did Senator McCarthy account for, first, the sm ear and, then, the vote to condemn him? It will be recalled that he wr ote the following in his book, America's Retreat From Victory: \"How can we a ccount for our present situation unless we believe that men high in this g overnment are concerting to deliver us to disaster? This must be the product of a great conspiracy, a conspiracy on a scale so immense as to dwarf any pr evious such venture in the history of man.\" 45 He also went on to explain what he felt was the pur pose of this conspi- racy: \"to diminish the United States in world affai rs, to weaken us militarily, to confuse our spirit with talk of surrender in the Far East, and to impair our will to resist evil. To what end? To the end that w e shall be contained and frustrated and finally fall victim to Soviet intrig ue from within and Russian military might from without.\" 46 McCarthy's life came to an end on May 2, 1957, when he died at Bethesda Naval Hospital, the same hospital where Secretary o f Defense James Forrestal \"committed suicide.\" It was stated that M cCarthy died of \"acute hepatic failure.\" And it is now known that McCardiy did have infectious hepatitis. In his book, The Assassination of Joe Mc Carthy, the author, Dr. Medford Evans, examines McCarthy's death: A man with a history of infectious hepatitis could indeed succumb abruptly to toxic hepatitis, a deadly affai r in any case. 314"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 27 THE EXPOSERS Toxic hepatitis is caused, as the name indicates, b y any of several poisons, including chloroform, mercury, and snake venom, but most conveniently, perhaps, by carbon tetrachlo ride, the common dry-cleaning solvent. A scarely noticeable or quickly dissipated concentr ation might be fatal to a man already suffering from a liver co mplaint hepatitis]. 47 When McCarthy went into the hospital, he was \"immed iately placed in an oxygen tent,\" and Evans asked this question: \"Do you suppose anybody could have got any carbon tetrachloride into that t hing?\" 48 It is his theory that carbon tetrachloride easily c ould have been placed under the oxygen tent and then dissipated quickly a s McCarthy was sleeping. The breathing of a poison by a man suffering from i nfectious hepatitis would have been fatal. Dr. Evans comments on McCarthy's overall health: \". .. Joe McCarthy's health was such in the Spring of 1957 as to make it incredible that he should the so swiftly of natural causes.\" 49 In any event, no autoposy was performed on McCarthy 's body, 50 so the truth about what caused his death may never be reve aled. At Senator McCarthy's funeral, the eulogy was deliv ered by the Right Reverend Monsignor John K. Cartwright, who observed : \"... Communism is the greatest enemy of our society. . . . Not everyb ody saw from the begin- ning, and many still do not see, that the threat of Communism is domestic as well as foreign, civil as well as military. But this man saw it clearly and knew mat it is an evil with which there can be no c ompromise... \" 51 Louis Budenz, a former member of the Communist Part y, said this about the Senator: \"The destruction of Joe McCarthy leaves the way open to intimidate any person of consequence who moves agai nst the Conspiracy. The Communists made him their chief target because they wanted to make him a symbol to remind political leaders in America not to harm the Conspiracy or its world conquest designs.\" 52 But Dr. Evans notes that it was not the Communist P arty that ultimately secured the destruction of Senator McCarthy. He wro te: \"A note is necessary on the relationship of the [Communist] Party — McCa rthy's declared enemy, as he was theirs — to the American 'establishment,' which is presumably anti-Communist, and which McCarthy never attacked, but which attacked him, and was, indeed, more immediately the instrume nt of the destruction than was the Communist Party.\" 53 It was the very \"establishment\" that should have jo ined the Senator in his attack against the Communist Party that finally brought him down. It was indeed a strange partnership. But it succeeded. 315"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"Chapter 28 The Korean War In 1944, the Council on Foreign Relations prepared a confidential memorandum for the State Department that began the process of involving us in a war in Korea. It read, in part: \"The sovere ignty fetish is still so strong in the public mind that there would appear to be li ttle chance of winning popular assent to American membership in anything a pproaching a super- state organization. Much will depend on the kind of approach which is used in further popular education...\" A review of the memorandum stated that: \"a further difficulty was cited, namely that [difficulty] arising from the Constitut ional provision that only Congress may declare war. This argument was counter ed with the conten- tion that a treaty would override this barrier, let alone the fact that our participation in such police action as might be rec ommended by the international security organization need not necess arily be construed as war.\" 1 That treaty was the United Nations Treaty, created in 1945, essentially by the Council on Foreign Relations (there were for ty-seven members in the American delegation to the U.N. Conference at San F rancisco.) The Korean War had a unique place in history: \"... for the first time, 316"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 28 THE KOREAN WAR a world organization voted to use collective force to stop armed aggression.\" 2 The Korean War was made possible at the Potsdam and Yalta conferen- ces, as World War II was ending, when the Allied go vernments, represented by Churchill, Stalin, and Roosevelt, divided Korea into a North and South. North Korea quickly created an army of 187,000 men, with Russia supplying the military equipment (the artillery, tanks and pl anes, etc,) necessary to wage the war. The South only raised an army of 96,0 00 men, with sparse military equipment One of the reasons for this inadequacy of their mil itary equipment was the fact that, even though the United States had vo ted $10 million in military assistance for South Korea, only a small percentage of it reached that country. 3 General Douglas MacArthur, who was later to command these forces, wrote in his book Reminiscences: The Soudi Koreans had four divisions along the 38th Parallel [the dividing line between North and South Korea]. They had been well trained, and the personnel were brave and patriotic, but they were equipped and organized as a constabulary force, not as troops of the line. They had only light weapons, no air or naval forces , and were lacking in tanks, artillery, and many other essenti als. The decision to equip and organize them in this way had been made by the State Department. The argument advanced by the State Department for its decision was that it was a necessary measure to prevent the Soudi Koreans from attacking North Korea, a curious myopic reasoning that, of course, opened the way for a Nordi Korean attack. 4 But Nordi Korea's attack should not have come as a surprise as General Albert Wedemeyer had warned President Harry Truman that the North Koreans were preparing for an invasion. And on June 25, 1950, they crossed the 38th Parallel and started the war. The Russians could have prevented the United Nation s from getting involved had they wanted to by vetoing the U.N. eff orts: \"The Soviets, using the non-membership of Red China in the U.N. as an e xcuse, walked out of the Security Council. The Council, with Russia abse nt, then voted U.N. intervention in Korea—a decision which the Soviet U nion could have blocked with its veto if it had been present. After the vote, and with Red China still not seated in the United Nations, the S oviets returned to the Security Council.\" 5 Some have seen Russia's absence during this crucial vote as an inten- tional maneuver on the part of the Russians: \"... t he Soviets started the war themselves. This means that they knew when it would start. If they wanted 317"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 28 THE KOREAN WAR to keep us out, Stalin would have told his U.N. del egate, Jacob Malik, to forget the boycott, to take his seat at the Securit y Council, and vote nyet [no]. The fact that the Soviets didn't do this is proof, not just that they didn't want to keep us out of the Korean War, but that they wan ted to trick us in.\" 6 Two days after the invasion of South Korea, the Chi nese on Taiwan sensing that the time was ripe for them to move aga inst the Communist government on mainland China, got severely repriman ded by President Truman: \"... I am calling upon the Chinese governme nt on Formosa [Taiwan] to cease all air and sea operations agains t the mainland.\" 7 Not only did Truman declare it was against American policy for the free Chinese to reclaim Communist China, but he also ord ered the American Fleet into the Straits of Formosa to insure this. 8 General Douglas MacArthur later revealed that he sa w this action as an intentional act on the part of the American governm ent to insure the entry of Red China into the war. He wrote: The possibility of Red China's entry into the Korea n War had existed ever since the order from Washington, issue d to the Seventh Fleet in June, to neutralize Formosa, which in effe ct protected the Red China mainland from attack by Chiang-Kai-shek's forces of half a million men. This released the two great Red Chinese armies assi gned the coastal defense of central China and made them avai lable for transfer elsewhere. 9 This meant that the Communist China leaders need ha ve little worry about a possible Nationalist landing on the m ainland opposite Formosa, and that they could move Red troo ps northward to the Manchurian country above the Yalu River with perfect safety. It gave their Korean war plans a tremendous impetus , because Red China could now enter the Korean War at any tim e she chose without fear of being attacked on her flank and rea r by the National- ist troops on Formosa. 10 But this action by the American government did not deter the Taiwa- nese government of Chaing-Kai-Shek, who, less than a week after the North Koreans had crossed the 38th parallel, offered \"the State Department an advance force of 33,000 troops that could be embark ed for Korea within five days after the offer was accepted. The suggestion w as politely refused.\" 11 Formosa was, at the time, a member of the United Na tions and therefore could have been represented in the United Nations F orce, but the American government would not tolerate such a move. It was a few months later that the results of the S tate Department's tactics 318"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 28 THE KOREAN WAR began to show up. In October, 1950, General MacArth ur began sensing that the Red Chinese were building up their troops in Ma nchuria, just north of the Yalu River. This intelligence report went unhee ded by the State Department which advised MacArthur that there was n o possibility of their intervening in the war. But the State Department wa s incorrect, as the Red Chinese crossed the Yalu River, the river separatin g North Korea and Red China, on October 15, 1950. As the war against Red China and the North Koreans continued, General MacArthur continued to feel that there had been a leak in his intelligence and that his strategy was known in adv ance to the enemy. One of MacArthur's senior field commanders, General Wal ton Walker: \"... continually complained... that his operations were known to the enemy in advance through sources in Washington.\" 12 The truth is that MacArthur's strategies were indee d falling into the hands of the North Koreans who were being commanded by Russian officers. The chain of command under the United States Consti tution for any military officer leads upward through the Executive Branch of the govern- ment and ends with the President who is the ultimat e authority for military decisions. MacArthur was, of course, constitutional ly required to obey the orders of his ultimate commander, but under the tre aty binding the United States to the United Nations, the command chain wen t past the President into an office in the United Nations known as the U ndersecretary for Political and Security Council Affairs who reported directly to the Secretary General. Because of a secret agreement made by Secretary of State Edward Stetunius in 1945, this key position, the official who controlled such dungs as United Nations \"police actions,\" was to be fille d by a Communist from some Eastern European Communist country. At the tim e of the Korean War, this post was filled by Constandne Zinchenko, of Ru ssia. The North Koreans had Russian military advisors dur ing the war, and it later became known just who was in charge of the North Korean war efforts. According to a Department of Defense press release dated May 15, 1964, high-ranking Russian military officers were a ctually on the scene in North Korea directing military operations. The rele ase stated: \"A North Korean Major identified two of these Russian 'advis ors' as General Vasilev and Colonel Dolgin. Vasilev, he said, was in charge of all movements across the 38th parallel. Another prisoner... said he actu ally heard General Vasilev give the order to attack on June 25th.\" 13 General Vasilev's chain of command went through the United Nadons as well. He \"had been the chairman of the United Na dons Military Staff Committee which, along with the office of the Under secretary General for Political and Security Council Affairs, is responsi ble for United Nations 319"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 28 THE KOREAN WAR military action under the Security Council.\" 14 That meant that two Russians shared authority in pl anning the North Korean war efforts, and one of them planned the eff orts of the United Nations. \"In effect, the Communists were directing bom sides of the war!\" 15 The Russians were not only controlling both sides o f the war and supplying technical advisors for the North Korean w ar effort, they were actually supplying Russian pilots for flights again st the Americans: \"Lt. Gen. Samuel E. Anderson, commander of the Fifth Air Force, revealed that entire Soviet Air Force units fought in the Korean War for over two and a half years...\" 16 General MacArthur, aware that the Red Chinese were about to enter the war, realized that one way to prevent their massive entry was to bomb the bridges crossing the Yalu River. He: \"ordered Gener al Stratemeyer, [Chief of the Air Force] to employ B-29's on the following mo rning to destroy the Yalu bridges and cut this easy line of communication bet ween Manchuria and North Korea. An immediate dispatch came from Secret ary [of State George] Marshall countermanding my order and directing me t o 'postpone all bombing of targets within five miles of the Manchur ian border.' \" 17 In addition, MacArthur was ordered not to pursue ai rcraft fleeing North Korea into Manchuria, nor could he bomb the supply base in the town of Racin. MacArthur felt mat of these decisions the \"most inc omprehensible of all was the refusal to let me bomb the important supply center at Racin. which was not in Manchuria or Siberia [Russia] but many m iles from the borders, in northeast Korea. Racin was a depot to which the Soviet Union forwarded supplies from Vladivostok for the North Korean Army .\" 18 On November 25, 1950, the Red Chinese Army commande r, General Lin Piao, launched his full forces across the Yalu River and into North Korea. MacArthur felt that: \"... information must h ave been relayed to them, assuring that the Yalu bridges would continue to enjoy sanctuary and that their bases would be left intact.\" 19 This was, unfortunately, the truth, as even General Lin Piao later admitted that he \"would never have made the attack and risked my men... if I had not been assured that Washington would restra in General MacArthur from taking adequate retaliatory measures against m y lines of supply and communication.\" 20 General MacArthur would later write that the order not to bomb the Yalu bridges: \"was the most indefensible and ill-co nceived decision ever forced on a field commander in our nation's history .\" 21 One of General MacArthur's generals in the Air Force, George Strat emeyer, said that: \"We had sufficient air, bombardment, fighters, reconnai ssance so that I could have taken out all of those supplies, those airdrom es on the other side of the 320"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 28 THE KOREAN WAR Yalu; I could have bombed the devils between there and Mukden, stopped the railroad operating and the people of China that wer e fighting could not have been supplied.... But we weren't permitted to do it . As a result, a lot of American blood was spilled over there in Korea.\" 22 House Minority Leader Joseph Martin also expressed his dismay at the administration's apparent desire not to win the war in Korea by such tactics as not allowing the bombing of strategic military t argets: \"If we are not in Korea to win, this Administration should be indicte d for the murder of thousands of American boys.\" 23 Congressman Martin was involved in the last chapter of General MacArthur's story in the War in Korea. On March 8, 1951, he wrote to MacArthur asking for his views on foreign policy an d overall strategy in the Far East, suggesting in addition that the Free Chin ese government on Formosa should be employed in the war in Korea to t ake the pressure off the American forces. General MacArthur replied to the letter on March 20 , 1951, agreeing that the Nationalist Chinese should be allowed to enter the war. In addition he wrote: \"It seems strangely difficult for some to re alize that here in Asia is where the Communist conspirators have elected to ma ke their play for global conquest, and that we have joined the issue thus ra ised on the battlefield; that here we fight Europe's war with arms while the dipl omats there still fight it with words; that if we lose the war to communism in Asia, the fall of Europe is inevitable, win it and Europe most probably woul d avoid war and yet preserve freedom.... We must win. There is no subst itute for victory.\" 24 President Harry Truman apparently read General MacA rthur's letter and concluded that generals should not set foreign policy. He decided to relieve him of his command. On April 10, 1951, he a nnounced to the American people: \"With deep regret, I have conclude d that General of the Army Douglas MacArthur is unable to give his wholeh earted support to the policies of the U.S. Government and of the United N ations in matters pertaining to his official duties.\" 25 General MacArthur replied: \"... never in the histor y was there a more drastic method employed than in my relief—without a hearing, without an opportunity for defense, with no consideration of t he past.\" 26 Truman replaced MacArthur with a general who he fel t could be trusted to support the administration policies, General Mat thew B. Ridgeway, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. 27 Under Ridgeway, the war was allowed to run down unt il an armistice was signed on July 27, 1953. American General Mark Clark, who signed the armistice for the United States, stated that he had gained: \"... the unenviable distinction of being the first United States Army c ommander in history to sign an armistice without victory.\" 28 321"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 28 THE KOREAN WAR One of the last public utterances General MacArthur made on the subject of the Korean War was a speech he gave on D ecember 5, 1952: \"Never before has this nation been engaged in mortal comba t with a hostile power without military objective, without policy other ma n restrictions governing operations, or indeed without even formally recogni zing a state of war.\" 29 The significant results of the Korean War can be su mmarized as follows: 1. The war helped Red China solidify control of its pe ople who were becoming ripe for revolt because of famine and hars h living conditions;, 2. The United States lost considerable prestige by bec oming the paper tiger that could not even defeat tiny North Korea. 3. The United States sacrificed tens of thousands of A merican lives and billions of dollars because other nations in th e United Nations did not want America to fight back in earnest. 4.

Dr. Antony Sutton is probably the greatest writer o n this subject, having written numerous books and articles on America's in volvement in the building of the Soviet Union. His conclusions can b e summarized in one sentence: \"The United States and her NATO [North At lantic Treaty Organization] allies [some of the major countries o f the free world] have constructed their own enemy: Communism!\" In his book, National Suicide, Military Aid to the Soviet Union, Dr. Sutton has written: \"The blunt truth is that trade with the Soviet Union from [the Russian Revolution of] 1917 to the present has built the Free World an enemy of the first order. Moreover, the technologic al component of this continuing trade enables the Soviet Union to pursue its programs of world conquest...\" 2 This position, of course, is in direct opposition t o the traditional position taken by the historians of the day who cla im that the \"Capitalists\" of the \"Free World\" are detested by the \"Communists \" of the \"Communist\" world. In another of his books, in this case a book entitl ed Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution, Dr. Sutton continued his thou ghts on this trade: \"... one barrier to mature understanding of recent history is the notion that all capitalists are the bitter and un-swerving enem ies of all Marxists and socialists. The idea is nonsense. There has been a continuous, albeit concealed, alliance between international political capitalists and interna- tional revolutionary socialists — to their mutual b enefit.\" 3 This mutual relationship was illustrated by an arti cle in the December 5, 1971 issue of Parade magazine, that was captione d \"Cyrus Eaton: The Communists' Best Capitalist Friend.\" It showed a se ries of pictures of Mr. Eaton, first with Premier Kosygin of Russia, then w ith Fidel Castro of Cuba, and then with Nikita Khrushchev of Russia, Eaton's host on a trip to Moscow, Russia. In all of the pictures, each indivi dual is smiling warmly, showing that each was warmly greeting the other.

In effect, the Un ited States and the NATO countries have built the Soviet Union, its industri al and military capabilities.\" 4 This transfer of technology is not a recent phenome non: it was begun shortly after the Russian Revolution of 1917. \"Brid ge building to the Soviets began in 1918, under President Wilson, before the B olsheviks had physically gained control of more than a fraction of Russia. A s a result of this trade, the Bolsheviks were able to consolidate their totalitar ian regime.\" 5 Lenin himself wrote frequently of the need for this aid and trade. It is presumed that the reason he did so was to pacify hi s fellow Communists who couldn't understand Lenin's visible friendship with the \"Capitalists\" who other Communists considered to be the enemy. Lenin had to have some way of explaining why the \"hated Capitalists\" were now appearing in Russia to assist the Bolsheviks in Communizing Russia. He wro te the following in 1922: \"First of all, we have to stabilize the econo my. Without equipment and machinery from the capitalist countries, we could n ot hope to finish this task in the short time available to us. The most signifi cant circumstance in ensuring our continued existence... was the commenc ement of economic relations with the capitalist countries.\" 6 And once again: \"When the time comes for us to hang the capitalists, they will compete with each other for the profits o f selling us the rope. The capitalists will furnish credits and, by supplying us with materials and techniques which are not available to us, they will rebuild our war industry which is essential to our future attacks on our own suppliers. In other words, they will be laboring to prepare their own suicide. \" Later, Lenin's replacement, Russian dictator Joseph Stalin, would tell the Russian people just what the real purpose of th e aid was: \"... it is essential that the proletariat of the advanced coun tries should render real and prolonged aid to the backward nationalities in thei r cultural and economic development. Unless such aid is forthcoming, it wil l be impossible to bring the various nations and peoples within a single wor ld economic system that is so essential to the final triumph of socialism.\" 7 The Communist strategy was to use the western techn ology as a means of creating a world-wide threat of military annihil ation so that the Russians and the \"Free World\" could be merged into a one-wor ld government. To achieve this end, it was not essential for the R ussians to buy large quantities of imported technology. One item would d o; the Russians could duplicate whatever they purchased. Lenin, in 1921, established the Soviet trade policy of: \"... acquaintance with European an d American technol- ogy.... Moscow must have one specimen of all the mo st important machines from among the latest in order to learn an d to instruct.\" 8 325"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"CHAPTER. 29 AID AND TRADE A former Polish intelligence officer, Michael Cheei nski, who defected to the West said: \"Every machine, device or instrument imported from the West is sent to a special analytic group. Their job is n ot only to copy technical solutions but to adapt them to the specifications o f Soviet military production.\" 9 It was America's early plan to conceal the true int ent of their sale of technology to Russia: to build a superior Russian m ilitary power. To accomplish this subterfuge, it became their task to convince the skeptical that the technology was being sold to Russia to assist t hem in reconstructing their war-ravaged economy, and that such trade was civili an and not military. For instance, some of the first factories construct ed in Russia in the 1920's and 1930's were \"tractor\" factories, constru cted in the Russian cities of Volgograd, Kharkov, and Chelyabinsk. All three were constructed by American companies, the one at Volgograd being cons tructed by eighty American firms. These \"tractor\" factories, ostensibly constructed t o supply farm tractors to the Russian farmer, today produce tanks, armored cars, self-propelled guns, rocket launchers, missile carriers, anti-airc raft guns, and trucks. In addition, military tanks, so essential to any mi litary structure, are constructed in two key producdon plants: \"... the G orki plant and the Zil plant...\" The Gorki plant was built from scratch by Henry Ford in the 1930's....\" 10 One of the early workers at the Gorki plant in Russ ia was Walter Reudier, later to become head of the United Auto Wo rkers labor union. He visited Russia in 1933 for about eighteen months. 11 Walter and his brother Victor, both employees in this plant, later wrote a now famous letter: The daily inspiration that is ours as we work side by side with our Russian comrades in our factory, the thought th at we are actually helping to build a society that will forev er end the exploi- tation of man by man, the diought that what we are building will be for the benefit and enjoyment of the working cla ss, not only for Russia, but the enure world, is the compensation we receive for our temporary absence from the struggle in the United S tates.

The fi rst priority in Soviet industrial plants was given to the military departments. Indeed, the original drive behind Russia's industri alization was military. This objective was clearly stated in 1929 by Unasch licht, vice president of the Revolutionary Military Soviet, bef ore American firms went into Russia to carry out the Five-Year P lans: \"We must try to ensure that industry can as quickly as possible be adapted to serving military needs...\" 13 In addition to building the plants that produce the military hardware essential to Russia's armed forces, the Americans c onstructed essential industries to assist the actual construction proces ses. For instance, there are two major steel plants in Russia, one in Magnitogor sk, and another in Kuznetsk. Both of these plants were constructed by American companies, the one in Magnitogorsk by the Arthur G. McKee & Co., t he builder of the U.S. Steel plant in Gary, Indiana, and the other by the Freyn Engineering Company of Chicago. 14 The oil industry also received American attention. After the Nobel family fled Russia following the Russian Revolution , Lenin gave three oil boring concessions to three major oil companies: St andard Oil Company; the Comparre Oil Company of New Jersey, formed by W . Averill Harriman; and Royal Dutch Shell. In addition to the oil concessions, Standard Oil re ceived a concession to build a 150,000 ton kerosene plant, capable of prod ucing 100 octane gasoline. Standard Oil also concluded a deal with the Communi sts to market Russian oil in European markets. These efforts in the oil industry have paid off, as today Russia is the world's largest petroleum producer. (A newspaper ar ticle in June, 1977, said one of the reasons Russia is selling oil outside of her borders is to pay for the import of Western technology. About one-tenth of th eir oil is sold to Eastern Europe, at OPEC prices.) Dr. Antony Sutton has concluded that this Standard Oil concession to sell Russian oil has continued after 1935, 15 and Gary Allen, another researcher of merit into this subject, has stated: \"It is possible the Rockefellers still own oil production facilities behind the Iron Curtain, drawing the profits out through Switzerland. By doing this, the y would not have to share the loot with either their stockholders or the tax collector.\" 16 327"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 AID AND TRADE The Americanization of the Russian oil industry was so immense that in August, 1960\" . . . an American petroleum indust ry delegation [visiting in Russia] was shown four refineries in August, 196 0—three of them.... Lend Lease refineries [lent to Russia during World War II] and the fourth either a Lend Lease refinery or a Soviet copy of a U.S. installation.\" 17 The tragic cost to the Russian people of this aid a nd trade was made known in 1934 when Henry Morgenthau, Roosevelt's Se cretary of the Treasury: \"removed restrictions on trade with Russi a... although the U.S. Government had evidence concerning forced-labor cam ps in the Soviet Union. If forced labor was used, then production co sts would be artificially lowered.\" 18 (It goes without saying that the greatest profits a re made when labor costs are the lowest. That would tend to please the \"monopolistic capitalists\" who enjoy making large profits.) In addition to pursuing the military equipment need ed for their Army, the Russians have utilized western technology and c onstruction ability to produce a high percentage of both the Russian merch ant marine, (Russia's sea-going merchant fleet) and their Navy. For insta nce, during the Vietna- mese War, Dr. Sutton was able to identify eighty-fo ur ocean going cargo ships being udlized by Russia in transporting milit ary goods from Russian ports into the Vietnamese port of Haiphong. Sutton concluded from his research dial: \"None of the main engines in those s hips were designed and manufactured inside the USSR. All the larger and fa ster vessels on the Haiphong run were built outside the USSR. All shipb uilding technology in the USSR comes directly or indirectly from the U.S. or its N.A.T.O. allies.\" 19 Western shipbuilding efforts for Russia are illustr ated in the following statistics collected by Professor Sutton: \"68% of a ll Russian ships were constructed in the West; 80% of all Russian diesel engines were built in the West; and 20% of all Russian engines were built in the USSR but under Western licensing.\" 20 Sutton went on to identify Japan and Western German y as the largest suppliers of these ships. 21 But others are busy as well, as: \"... no less than 95 percent of all ships manufactured in Finland since World War II have been on Soviet account. 22 \"All of the 11,000 horsepower marine diesel engine s made in Russia are constructed according to technol ogy supplied by Burmeister and Wain of Denmark. 23 Japan and West Germany and Finland and Denmark are supposed to be America's allies. Western assistance to the Russian Navy is not recen t, however. For instance, in March 1939, the American State Departm ent approved a proposal by the English Boat Company of Groton, Con necticut, to send plans, specifications and construction services for the construction of a Russian submarine. But the greatest military and technological assista nce to the Russian 328"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 AID AND TRADE government came during World War II, when the Unite d States developed a program known as Lend Lease. This agreement obligat ed the Americans to supply the Russians with over $11 billion wordi of a variety of war-making goods. Included in this list were the following ite ms for the Russian Navy: 90 dry cargo vessels, 10 ocean going tankers, 46 110' submarine chasers, 57 65' submarine chasers, 3,320 marine diesel engines, 4,297 marine gasoline engines, and $2,700,000 naval guns. In addition to the military equipment cited above, Lend Lease also supplied Russia with: A $29 million petroleum refinery, Patents for bombsights, military tanks, airplanes-h elicopters, and bullet-resisting armor Five factories for synthetic rubber Locomotives TNT, dynamite, and smokeless powder Bombers and fighters Tanks, trucks and trailers. 24 Lend Lease was also the excuse for sharing some of America's other military technology as well. For instance, General John R. Deane, who was secretary to the combined Chiefs of Staff in Washin gton during part of the war, reported: \"Our policy was to make any of our n ew inventions in electronics and other fields available to Russia. E ach month I would receive a revised list of secret American equipment about w hich Russia could be informed.... We never lost an opportunity to give t he Russians equipment, weapons or information.\" 25 In addition to Lend Lease during the war, America a lso permitted the Russian government to dismantle Germany's war makin g facilities, such as factories, dry-docks, cranes, etc., after the war a s a form of war reparations. \"There is no question that there were sizable Sovie t equipment removals from occupied areas after World War II: a minimum f igure in excess of $10 billion in 1938 prices can be set for equipment thu s removed.\" 26 The Russians literally dismantled factories down to the very foundation and removed them to Russia. These reparations were agreed to by the American and British governments at the meetings in Yalta and Potsdam. The Russians also stripped Mongolia after World War II of: \"... at least 329"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 AID AND TRADE $800,000,000 of movable assets under the specious c laim that it was 'war booty.'\" 27 But the most important transfer to the Russians was the technology and material for the building of the atomic bomb. It is customarily explained by the majority of curr ent historians that the Russians received the secrets to the atomic bomb fr om convicted American spies Ethel and Julius Rosenberg who were charged w ith the giving of these plans to the Russians in 1950. When Judge Irving Kaufman sentenced the Rosenbergs to death, he said: \"I consider your crime worse than murder.... Your conduct in putting into the hands of the Russians the A-bomb years bef ore our best scientists predicted Russia would perfect the bomb has already caused, in my opinion, the Communist aggression in Korea.... Indeed, by yo ur betrayal you undoubtedly have altered the course of history to t he disadvantage of our country.\" 28 But the story of the atomic bomb occurred prior to the sentencing of the Rosenbergs. The American government had given Russi a the bomb in 1943, during the Lend Lease program. Major George Racey Jordan, an officer in the United States Army during the Second World War, was the officer in cha rge of the transfer of the Lend Lease supplies through the Great Falls, Montan a, air base. It was here that the planes were loaded with the transferable g oods prior to their being flown to Fairbanks, Alaska, where the planes were f lown into Russia by Russian pilots. Major Jordan, curious by nature, opened various bri efcases and cartons, and saw various words he was not familiar with on v arious papers: uranium, cyclotron, proton, neutron, cobalt, and plutonium. In addition, Jordan discovered various reports from \"Oak Ridge, Manhatt an District\" (it was the \"Manhattan Project\" in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the American scientists were developing the plans for the atomic bomb) containing phrases like \"energy produced by fission.\" Jordan also discovered \"... at least three consignm ents of uranium chemicals... nearly three quarters of a ton. Confir med also was the ship- ment of one kilogram, or 2.2 pounds, of uranium met al at a time when the total American stock was 4.5 pounds.\" 30 These findings meant little to Major Jordan until 1 949, when Russia exploded their first atomic bomb. It was then that he realized that he had been witness to the transfer of the materials and plans for construction of Russia's atomic bomb. And this occurred in 1943. Major Jordan's charges were corroborated by a novel written by James Roosevelt, the son of Franklin Roosevelt, in 1980. The dust cover of the book describes the contents of the novel, entitled A Fam ily Matter. 31 \"[President] 330"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 AID AND TRADE Roosevelt... makes a bold secret decision — to shar e the results of the Manhattan Project with the Soviet Union.\" The dust cover continues by informing the reader th at Roosevelt has \"written a novel of spine-chilling drama and authen ticity.\" (emphasis added.) The novel details how President Roosevelt gave Russ ia the plans for the atomic bomb in 1943 and 1944. Not only did the United States government give Russ ia the plans for the atomic bomb, plus all of the ingredients to manufac ture one, they also arranged for the Russians to secure a cyclotron at the end of the war. Life magazine detailed the circumstances in their Octobe r 3, 1949 article: \"In May, 1945 — three months before the first bomb was dropp ed — Russians beat Americans to the punch and carried off the cyclotro n in the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin.\" It will be recalled that it w as the plan of the Roosevelt administration to allow Russia to get to Berlin fir st. But even with this technology supplied by the Ameri can government, mere is still doubt that Russia exploded the atomic bomb in 1949, as it is claimed. Life magazine of October 3, 1949, carried an articl e about the supposed explosion: \"U.S. Detects Atomic Blast in Russia.\" P resident Harry Truman announced that \"We have evidence that within recent weeks an atomic explosion occurred in the U.S.S.R.\" The article reported: \"It seems probable that the b last was caused by a bomb.\" It appeared that no one was certain that the Russians had exploded the bomb, including even the Russians: \"Vishinsky, the Russian Foreign Minister, pretended ignorance, refused comment.\" It would seem probable that, if Russia had exploded an atomic bomb, it would have proudly announced it to the world, compl ete with pictures documenting the fact. Life attempted to prove their case with a: \"Picture of possible A-bomb structure [that] appeared in a Russian-zone German paper.\" The evidence that Russia had exploded an atomic bom b was a picture of a \"possible\" A-bomb, from an unspecified newspap er with no apparent reported connection with the Russian government. Life then clinched the argument: \"It is even remote ly possible that the Russians have developed a superior bomb. No one kno ws. Most information on Russian accomplishments is purely conjectural.\" But they continued the myth in a later article, in their October 10, 1949 issue entitled \"Can Russia Deliver the Bomb?\" \"Now that Russia has the bomb—and perhaps a supply of them—.\" One would have to fairly conclude that the evidence confirming the supposed explosion was not very convincing. 331"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 AID AND TRADE But America has not ended its assistance of Russia' s nuclear industry. An article in the Wall Street Journal of April 25, 1975, headlined: \"U.S. Quietly Allows Uranium Shipments to Soviet Union fo r Processing Into Fuel\" The article detailed that the State Departmen t had approved the sale of 1.4 million pounds of uranium oxide mined in Wyomin g and New Mexico to the Soviet government. It would in turn be proce ssed into pellets rich in uranium 235. \"This isotype provides the power for n uclear electric plants and for the atomic bomb.\" (emphasis added)' 2 The answer to the question as to why the State Depa rtment and the American government first gave Russia the plans for constructing the atomic bomb, and men later the materials to put into it, q uite possibly was given by the authoress Rose Martin, in her book Fabian Freew ay: \"Until such time as international control of atomic energy has been ach ieved, the threat of nuclear destruction could always be raised to gener ate that atmosphere of perpetual crisis needed to justify Keynesian spendi ng politics.\" 33 How all of this aid and trade comes together was ma de abundantly clear on September 1, 1983, when the Russain government s hot down an unarmed Korean Air Lines 747 jet over Russian waters. There were 269 passengers aboard the plane and they were all killed. The media quickly reported that it was a Russian ma de airplane that had shot at least two Russian made aircraft-to-airc raft missiles into the plane. The tragic truth was that even though the Russian m issiles and the jet were built in Russia, they were built from American technology. For instance, during the Lend Lease program of Worl d War II, America \"lent\" Russia: 3,000 pursuit planes, communication equipment, radio direction finders, altimeters, radio compasses, rad io locators, aircraft construction equipment, aircraft manufacturing fact ories; the Corps of Engineers built airports in Russia; radar, aircraft lubricating oils, gasoline, nitric acid (used in making explosives,) gyroscopes , and aluminum sheet factories. Later, in 1946, America turned over two-thirds of G ermany's aircraft manufacturing capacity to Russia. These factories a nd installations were crated off to Russia to form the nucleus of their j et aircraft industry. One of the engineers turned over to Russia later developed their MIG-15, the aircraft that was flown in Korea against American pilots. Th e MIG-15 was powered by a jet engine purchased from Rolls Royce of Great Britain, America's supposed ally. During that year, America sold Russi a boring machines, balancing machines used in balancing jet engine sha fts, and grinding machines.

In 1974, General Dynamics sent Russia technical data f or aircraft construction. And America trained Yugoslavian jet pilots (Yugosla via is Russia's Commu- nist ally.) In what can only be termed a strange arrangement, A merica sent its latest technology in jet aircraft, the F-16, on Rus sian ships to NATO countries in Europe in 1978. Technicians at Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, where the United States tests its latest airc raft technology, report that Russian generals are among its frequent visitors. Czechoslovakia is the largest supplier of jet aircr aft to Russia outside of its borders. Their largest plant, producing not onl y jet aircraft but other materials for war purposes, has an agreement with a n American machine tool company to supply them with the latest in mach ine tools. Russia's missiles also have an American background. The United States government has sold Russia accelerometers used to m easure gravitational pull on missiles, ball bearings used in missile gui dance systems, miniature ball bearings mat gave Russia the ability to place multiple warheads on their missiles, technology on high explosives, and entire chemical plants capable of making explosives. But there is something even more incredible in the story of the Korean Airlines flight 007. Diagrams in various American n ews magazines show the airplane \"wandering off course\" over the Kurile Isl ands and the Sakhalin peninsula, all within Russian territory. It will be remembered that these former Japanese territories were among the lands gi ven to the Russian government at the end of World War II by President Roosevelt. If President Roosevelt had not given these areas to the Russian govern- ment, flight 007 could not have \"wandered off cours e.\" There are some who are wondering whether the airpla ne was shot down, not because it strayed over Russian waters, b ut because one of the passengers on board was the most vocal opponent of such Russian aid and trade.

But Russia's ability to orbit an earth satellite wa s given to the Russian government by the American government at the end of World War II. General George Patton, as he moved eastward into an d through western Europe and Germany, captured the two German towns o f Peenemunde and Nordhausen, where the German scientists were develo ping the V-l and V-2 rockets. Patton was ordered by his commanding offic er, the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight Eisenhower, to turn over these two cities in their entirety to the Russians. Included in this tu rn-over were thousands of German sciendsts who were transported to Russia wit h the factories of the two towns, removed down to the last office desk. Fortunately, one of these sciendsts saw what was ab out to befall him and others involved with Germany's space efforts, and h e led 129 of them from Germany where he surrendered to the American forces rather than to the Russians.

But President Dwight D. Eisenhower turned him down . . .\" 1 The same gentlemen who arranged for Russia to orbit the first satellite by turning over to the Russians nearly the entire G erman rocket capacity, now was in a position to insure that the Russians w ere able to orbit the first satellite before the Americans. The Russians were now able to use the successful or biting of this satellite to boast that Communism was obviously sup erior to Capitalism. \"The old jesting about socialist inefficiency came to an end when the first Soviet Sputnik circled the earth.\" 2 President Eisenhower turned this Russian \"victory\" into two major defeats for the United States: 1. It was now apparent, according to the Administra tion, that America lagged behind the Russians in the field of education or in the ability to engineer such a scientific feat. It was imperative that the American government ente r the field of education to narrow the gap between the two competi ng economic systems. So the Eisenhower Administradon quickly pushed the federal government into the funding of education on a nationwide basis , completely in violation of the Constitution of the United States, which gav e no such authority to the federal government. 2. Since the American government was now behind in the \"space race,\" it was imperative that the American governme nt compete with the Russians, first by orbiting a satellite, a nd then by reaching out into distant space. In other words, the American government was taken o ut of the space race by President Eisenhower, and then put back in, at great cost to the American taxpayers. And the only way the planners f elt that they could get the taxpayer to support the tax increase, was to co nvince them that there was a \"space race\" with the Communists. A Russian writer on the subject of space research, Leonid Vladimirov, who defected to the West, has written in his book T he Russian Space Bluff: \"It is possible that, without having the fear of So viet competition, the Americans would not have been in such a hurry to la nd on the Moon and would thus have saved themselves thousands of milli ons of dollars.\" 3 Vladimirov discussed the state of the Russian missi le industry after the orbiting of Sputnik. He informed his readers that t he Russians, as late as 335"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30 TREASON 1959, had \"... proposed making a 'cluster of cluste rs'—combining together five four-chamber engines to make one giant engine. \" 4 The combining of a series of individual rockets, ea ch no larger than a captured German V-2, indicated that the Russian mis sile industry had not matured much since the days when Eisenhower provide d them with the V- 2 rocket. It also meant that these rockets were cum bersome and extremely inaccurate, because of the difficulty in getting so many rockets to fire at the same time. The state of the Russian missile industry was known to the American government, according to an article in 1980 in Time magazine: \"Three years later [1959], the overhead view (from the U-2 spypl ane overflights) of the Tyuratam site [where all Soviet missiles were then tested] gave the U.S. some needed reassurance. Determining that the rocket boo ster aperture at the base of the launch pad was 15 meters [50 ft.] in diamete r, photo interpreters concluded that the Soviets were still using missile s boosted by auxiliary rockets strapped around the circumference of the ma in rocket. Because they were so cumbersome that they could not be practical ly deployed, the U.S. strategic planners concluded that the missile gap d id not exist either.\" 5 This statement of fact is extremely revealing, look ing backwards from this 1980 article, because the \"missile gap\" that b ecame one of the main debating issues on the Kennedy-Nixon debates during the 1960 Presidential election campaign, was not a \"missile gap'' at all. It will be recalled that John Kennedy contended that the Eisenhower Administratio n, which Richard Nixon had to defend because he was Eisenhower's Vic e-President, had allowed the Russians to far exceed the then meager American rocket efforts, to the point where there was an enormous \"missile g ap,\" threatening the very safety of the American people. Nixon, it will be remembered, did not defend the position very well, and Kennedy was elec ted. And all the time, Nixon knew (or should have known) that the \"missile gap\" did not exist. Russia did not have the technol ogy it claimed it had. America knew that the Russians had not perfected th e single stage rocket but were, in essence, \"gluing\" a series of V -2 rockets to a central cluster. This clustering together of a series of ro ckets can be seen in the August 14, 1978 Time Magazine, on page 48, and in t he Santa Ana Register of September 17, 1976. These pictures reveal a tall , slender, central rocket, with a series of four clusters along side the main engine, each with four internal rocket engines. This means that, as recently as 1978, the Russians were not advanced enough to have developed the technology to construc t a single-stage rocket capable of placing large payloads into space. In fact, the Russians had been experimenting with s uch technology before, without success, according to Vladimirov: \" Friends of mine among 336"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30 TREASON the rocket engineers used to tell me how copies of all the American rocket engines then known were built in Soviet factories o n an experimental basis. The engines... all burnt out while they were being tested.\" 6 Other rocketry-related efforts of the Russians have come under question, The \"Lunik\" moon landing in 1959, for instance, has been called a \"hoax\" by an American writer, Lloyd Mallan, who has writte n: \"The Lunik, in short, was a cooly insolent, magnificent, internati onal hoax. I found no hint... of any tracking station in the Free World h aving heard with scientific certainty the radio signals from Russia's moon-or-s un rocket.\" 7 In anodier book on the same subject, Mr. Mallan rep orted that Cosmo- naut Alexie Leonov's \"walk in space\" on March 18, 1 965 \"... was faked. Four months of solid research interviewing top expe rts in the fields of photo- optics, photo-chemistry and electro-opdcs, all of w hom carefully studied the modon picture film and sdll photographs officially released by the Soviet government, convinced me...\" Mallan's conclusions were that the film showing Leo nov in space: ... was double-printed.... The foreground (Leonov) was superimposed on the background (the Earth below.) T he Russian film showed reflecdons from the glass plate under w hich a double print is made. Leonov was suspended from wire or cables.... In sev eral episodes of the Russian film, light was reflected f rom a small pordon of the wire (or cable) attached to Leonov's space suit. One camera angle was impossible of achievement. Thi s showed Leonov crawling out of his hatch into space. It was a head- on shot, so the camera would have had to have been located out in space beyond the space ship. One still photo (the clearest one) shows Leonov eme rging from his hatch standing straight up, his body still half-way inside the space ship. This contradicts the motion picture film which shows him squirming out of the hatch on his belly. If one very carefully observes the motions of Leono v as he laboriously wiggles through the extraordinarily lon g tunnel, it is obvious that he is under one 'g' (the force of norm al, earth gravity) and exerts most of his muscular force against only one side of the duct, rather than bumping from side to side and mov ing forward with the ease one would expect in the absence of gr avity. 8 The quesdon of who tracked Russian space efforts in the early stages of the \"space race,\" is still a mystery. It was thought that the U.S. North American Air Def ense Command (NORAD) did, but since 1961, they have \"had a Presi dendal order never to 337"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30 TREASON divulge any information about the tracking of forei gn space vehicles.\" And a spokesman for the Smithsonian Institute's wor ld-wide network of tracking cameras commented: \"We don't track Russ ian satellites.\" 9 What that meant was that the American government, i n the early stages of Russia's space efforts, had to believe whatever the Russians said. Additional examples of the phoniness of Russia's sp ace efforts are ample to illustrate the charge that the truth is le ss than what has passed as the evidence. The February, 1962, Scientific American magazine ca rried an advertise- ment on page 91 placed there by the Sperry Gyroscop e Company. This ad showed a drawing of a space station in orbit and in dividuals working on it in space suits. This same drawing, with the addition of certain des criptive phrases attached to identify certain parts of the space sta tion, appeared in the October 13, 1969 New York Times, on page 32, over seven yea rs later. But the New York Times used the drawing to illustra te: \"One concept of a future Soviet space station in which the crewm en in a mother ship transfer through a transit chute to help assemble a nother ship is depicted here.\" One would wonder why the New York Times had to reso rt to the use of a 1962 Sperry advertisement to illustrate a Russian space effort. The only conclusion one can draw from these facts is that th e Russians did not have a space effort. It seems logical that, if they did, t hey would make it known to the world in large, easily identifiable pictures or drawings. But that hasn't happened. Whatever space successes the Russians have achieved have been made all the easier by American technology. It is commonly k nown that ball-bearings are absolutely essential to rocket and missile guid ance systems. Dr. Antony Sutton's research into this vital industry has disc overed that: \"The entire ball-bearing production capability of the Soviet Un ion is of Western origin... All Soviet missiles and related systems i ncluding guidance systems have bearings manufactured on western equip ment or Soviet duplicates of this equipment.\" 10 Part of this technology came from a Chicago-based c ompany, which helped the Russians build a complete automodve bear ing factory in March of 1975. This factory was capable of producing 60 m illion engine bearings a year. 11 And the ability to produce miniature ball-bearings, vital to the missile and rocketry industries, came from an order filled by the Bryant Grinder Company of Springfield, Vermont. The machines, capable of producing ball-bearings ac curate to twenty- five millionths of an inch, were sold to Russia in 1972, and were approved as 338"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30 TREASON \"non-strategic trade\" by President Richard Nixon. T heir immediate use is in guidance systems for missiles, but one Congressman, William L. Dickinson, reported that these machines have another important function: \"These machines sold for $20 million. They were capable of producing high quality precision, miniature ball bearings of the type used in Intercontinental Ballistic Missile multiple warheads. As a consequen ce, Soviet missile accuracy improved dramatically to the point where 9 0 percent of our land- based ICBM force can now be destroyed in a first st rike. This was a technol- ogy the Soviets did not have, which they bought for a cheap price and which endangers the lives of millions of Americans.\" 12 How the Russians acquired these machines is an illu stration of how such sales are made. In 1960, the Soviets ordered 45 of these machines, but the export license needed for their sale to Russia was denied by Presi dent John Kennedy. Twelve years later, the Soviets ordered 164 of thes e same machines, and mis time, the export license was appproved by President Nixon. The Soviet Minister of Machine Tool Industry was quoted at the time as saying: \"We had waited twelve years to get these machines.\" 13 Whatever the Soviets have achieved in their space p rogram has been with the assistance of the American government. Wha tever programs they faked or didn't have, the American government or me dia has certified as valid. Another area that the United States has assisted th e Russians is in the field of military hardware. During the Korean war, the Soviets were supplying the Norm Koreans and the Red Chinese with jet aircraft, includ- ing the MIG-15. This airplane was similar in config uration to the F-86, being flown by the South Korean and American pilots , and supplied by the American government. Both of these planes were designed by the same man, a German who was captured at Nordhausen at the end of World War II. As discussed before, the scientist went to one nation, and his plans went to the other. But there is more to this story than mis. The MIG-15 was powered by reproductions of fifty-fi ve Rolls-Royce jet engines sold to Russia by mis English company in 19 47. These engines were immediately reproduced and supplied to the manufact urers of the MIG-15 in Russia. 14 Rolls-Royce later tried to sell larger jet engines to Russia in 1977. These engines, the largest produced at that time, provide d 50,000 pounds of thrust to the jumbo jets envisioned by the master planners in the aircraft industry in Russia. These engines were not sold to the Russi ans, apparently because of the pressure from the American government which wanted General Electric to sell its CF6 nearly identical engine to the Soviets. 339"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30 TREASON The CF6 engine is currently being used in the Ameri can airplane industry in the 747, the DC-10 and the world's larg est cargo plane, the Air Force's C-5A. Rolls-Royce was successful, however, in 1977, in se lling the Red Chinese the necessary jet engines to power their ne wly developed F-12 jet airplane. Perhaps the most extraordinary example of America's military assist. ance to the Russian government occurred during the Vietnamese war. Dr. Sutton has concluded that \"... the guns, the am munition, the weapons, the transportation systems, that killed Am ericans in Vietnam came from the American subsidized economy of the Soviet Union.\" 15 America's assistance to the cause of the North Viet namese government had an early beginning. In an ardcle endded \"When Ho Chi Minh was an Intell igence Agent for the U.S.,\" author Lloyd Shearer details how the Ame rican government assisted the early efforts of the founder of the re volution against the South Vietnamese government. Ho Chi Minh was recruited in to the American intelligence apparatus. The ardcle states: \"We had a trusted agent whom we regularly supplied with weapons, radio equipment, o perators and medicine. All of it served to reinforce his posidon and statu s.\" 16 So even before the Vietnamese war started, the Amer icans were supply- ing the guerilla army of the man who would ultimate ly lead the Viet Cong in a war against the Americans. The American people, who were beginning to sense th at something was wrong with the conduct of America's efforts in the war, started showing that concern at the polls. The aid and trade being sent to Russia during the war became a campaign issue in the 1968 Presidendal cam paign. The Republicans at their convendon that year includ ed the following plank in their party pladorm: \"Nations hostile to t his country will receive no assistance from the U.S. We will not provide aid of any kind to countries which aid and abet the war efforts of Nordi Vietnam .\" 17 Republican Presidential candidate Richard Nixon als o addressed himself to this plank when he told the American Leg ion Convention in September, 1968: \"There should be no aid or credits of any kind with any country, including the Soviet Union, that aids the enemy in Viet Nam.\" 18 Candidate Nixon's campaign literature repeated the Republican Party's concern in this matter. One of his campaign flyers covered this issue: \"The United States should not provide anything that coul d be treated as, or classified as, aid to those [Communist bloc] nation s if they persist in trading or aiding the enemy in Nordi Vietnam.\" 19 The reason that the Republican Party and their Pres idential candidate Richard Nixon could make these statements is that t he President of the 340"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30 TREASON United States has the power to control exports of c ommodities behind the Iron Curtain. The 1917 U.S. Trading With the Enemies Act forbids U.S. firms or their foreign subsidiaries from trading with enemies of t he United States except under license. The ability to grant the necessary l icenses has been given by the Congress of the United States to the President with the option to delegate this authority to such departments as he deems appropria te. In the past, presidents have delegated this authority to the Dep artment of Commerce. This means that the President has the authority to assume the direct responsibility should he (or she) choose to do so. This means mat President Nixon, after his election, had the authority to pre vent the sale of any commodity he deemed to be against the nation's secu rity interests. President Nixon could have honored both his party's platform and his campaign promises should he have chosen to do so after his e lection. The Department of Commerce publishes a listing of t he commodities licensed for export to Eastern European destination s each quarter, and this report is made available to the public. A quick rev iew of these reports will enable the skeptic to see if President Nixon delive red as he promised. For instance, the Third Quarter report for 1971 is typical of the reports and reveals that our government, in that quarter al one, shipped a series of commodities to the Russian government while Russia was supplying eighty percent of the goods and war materials to North Vie tnam. Some of the commodities listed in that report are: Synthetic rubber; lubricating grease and oil; parts for automotive ve hicles; electronic compu- ters; foundry and metalworking equipment; parts for rolling mills; ball and roller bearings; oil and gas field production equip ment; airborne navigation equipment and parts; and nearly $11 million of truc ks and parts. 20 In addition to the actual commodity sold to the Rus sians, the American government authorized the export of \"technical data relating to the com- modities and the processes indicated: Iron and stee l foundry; foundry for producing engine components; lube oil additives; an d distillation of petroleum. 21 It becomes obvious mat President Nixon did not deli ver on the promises Candidate Nixon made. But the President is not the only one assisting the Communist governments. Others are involved as well. For instance, in 1969, during the middle of the Vie tnamese war when Americans were being killed by the Russian-supplied North Vietnamese, Congressman Earl Landgrebe of Indiana introduced an amendment to the Export Control Act, the act authorizing the licensi ng of exports to the Communist Bloc nations. The amendment read in part: \"No commodities, military or otherwise, shall be authorized for ship ment to any foreign nation which sells or furnishes to Nordi Vietnam or which permits ships or aircraft 341"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30 TREASON under its registry to transport to or from [North V ietnam], any equipment. materials or commodities or gives any form of assis tance to North Vietnam.\" 22 It would be expected that the Congress of the Unite d States, the agency responsible for protecting the American fighting ma n that they had sent mere, would have overwhelmingly supported the amend ment The Landgrebe amendment was defeated. One of the reasons that the Landgrebe amendment fai led, it appears, is because our government was actively encouraging Ame rican businessmen to sell to Russia during the Vietnamese war. In August of 1966, the State Department issued a pa mphlet entitled Private Boycotts Vs. The National Interest, which s tated: \"All American citizens should know that any American businessman who chooses to engage in peaceful trade with the Soviet Union or Eastern European countries and to sell the goods he buys is acting within his righ ts and is following the policy of his government. But any organization, how ever patriotic in intention, that undertakes to boycott, blacklist, o r otherwise penalize or attack any American business for engaging in peacef ul trade with Eastern European countries or the Soviet Union, is acting a gainst the interests of the United States.\" 23 This is incredible when it is assumed that governme nt should protect the American fighting man by supporting such restri ctions on those who were trading with those nations supplying the enemy . In addition to the support of this trade by the Ame rican Congress, the Republican administration, led by the Commander-in- Chief of all armed forces, assisted by failing to block shipments of R ussian commodities and equipment into the main North Vietnamese port of Ha iphong. This neglect was pointed out by Admiral U.S. Grant Sharp, Commander-in-Chief of Naval Operations in the Pacif ic during most of the Vietnamese War. He spoke about this issue: \"From th e beginning, we should have closed the harbor of Haiphong and prevented al l of the vital imports from reaching that area. Instead, we permitted them to import all of the necessities of war without any difficulty whatsoeve r, despite the fact that we controlled the seas. This was a great mistake, of c ourse, and immeasurably increased the casualties that our side incurred.\" 24 This oversight was finally corrected by President N ixon when, on May 8, 1972, he announced to the nation: \"There is only one way to stop the killing, and that is to keep the weapons of war out of... North Vietnam. I have ordered the following... All entrances to Nort h Vietnamese ports will be mined... Countries with ships presently in North Vietnamese ports have been notified that ships will have... to leave...\" 25 These directives were, in many instances, to nation s supposedly friendly 342"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30 TREASON to the United States. The ships of Great Britain, J apan, Greece, Norway, Lebanon, Italy, West Germany, and Panama were among those delivering Russian goods to North Vietnamese ports. (Dr. Sutton, in his research, discovered one strang e anomaly. Four of the Russian ships being used to haul goods to North Vie tnamese ports still legally belonged to the United States. These four w ere \"Liberty Ships\" sent to Russia during the Lend Lease program of World Wa r II. President Nixon should have notified President Nixon to remove Amer ican ships from the North Vietnamese harbors I) One of the more tragic sales to the Russian governm ent occurred in 1966 when the U.S. government: \"... sent the Soviet Unio n the entire technical specifications which they needed to build a glycero l plant. Glycerol is used in the manufacture of explosives. Specifically, in Vietnam, glycerol is used as a detonator in booby traps. Over 50% of all America n casualties suffered in Vietnam have come from booby traps. \"26 One of those who suffered from such a booby trap wa s Sgt. Peter Stark, a young and courageous Vietnam veteran who went on a nationwide speaking tour attempting to alert the American peop le to the dangers of such aid and trade... from his wheelchair. Sgt. Stark ha d had his legs blown off because of a booby trap. One of the most recent examples of American technol ogy coming back to haunt the American people has come from their ex perience in building the Kama River truck factory in Russia in 1969. Thi s plant, capable of producing 100,000 heavy-duty trucks and 150,000 die sel engines per year, more than all U.S. manufacturers put together, cost the Russians over $1.4 billion. Nearly $1 billion of that total came from the United States in the form of computers, heavy equipment, and foundry equ ipment. These efforts to assist the Russian government paid off in 1979 when the American government was notified that these trucks, in addition to engines being installed in armored personnel carriers and a ssualt vehicles con- structed in the plant, began showing up in Russian military units in Eastern Europe. But even more incredible was the fact that these engines and trucks were being utilized by the Russians in their milita ry assaults in Afghanistan. 27 In addition to the direct assistance in the buildin g of the vehicles used in Russia's attempt to conquer the freedom fighters in Afghanistan, the American government constructed the highways, or at least a portion of them, that the Russians used to travel to that coun try. Congressman Ron Paul in 1980 released a reproduction of a photograp h of the invasion route over which the Russian Army travelled. He further r eported that the American government constructed three hundred miles of double-lane highway through Afghanistan, being careful to: \"con nect our road to the one 343"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30 TREASON that [the] Soviet Army engineers were building.\" 28 (The June 4, 1968 New York Times, on page seventeen printed a picture of one of these highways in Afghanistan with this c aption: \"New highways thread through Afghanistan, some, like this one, bu ilt with Soviet aid, and others with United States aid.\") But some of the tr ade has even far more damaging importance to America's future security: \" According to Dr. William Perry, Under-Secretary of Defense for Resea rch and Engineering, the U.S.S.R. will be able to detect and monitor the location of all U.S. submarines by the year 2000. The reason? We export as 'oil exploration equipment' the most advanced American seismological and related high technology.\" 29 The purchase of American (and Western) technology i s expensive, and the American government has provided assistance to the Communist bloc nations in an effort to increase their purchases. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, on February 2, 193 4, created the Export-Import Bank by an executive order (critics p oint out, quite correctly, that the President does not have any such authority , according to the Constitution) for the purpose of guaranteeing comme rcial loans made to foreign, including Communist, nations to increase i nternational trade. Not only does the Bank guarantee loans made, but actual ly makes loans itself. But American banking interests also participate in the making of loans to assist Communist nations in purchasing American goods. One of the first banks involved was the Chase Manhattan Bank, contro lled by the Rocke- feller interests, which opened a banking office in Moscow, Russia, in 1972, at #1 Karl Marx Square. They later opened an office in Communist China in 1973. Chase's interest in trade with Russia goes back to at least 1933, when Congressman Louis McFadden, then the Chairman of th e House Banking Committee, posed the problem: \"Find out what busine ss has been transacted for the State Bank of Soviet Russia by its correspo ndent, the Chase Bank of New York.\" 30 (Individuals also align themselves in support of th is foreign trade. In 1977, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger joi ned the international advisory committee of Chase Manhattan Bank.) Other Banks are active as well. The Bank of America in 1975 offered the Soviet Government $500 million to finance imports f rom the United States. 31 And on October 20, 1969, Rodman Rockefeller, the so n of Nelson Rockefeller, and the London firm of N.M. Rothschild entered into a partnership to form a company known as the Internat ional Basic Economy Corporadon, (IBEC,) to further Soviet-American trad e. 32 One of the most starding examples of this trade occ urred in 1977 when the American government sold Russia the world's lar gest electro-magnet, 344"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30 TREASON capable of generating a magnetic field 250,000 time s greater than that of the Earth itself. It was being utilized to: \"continue t he study of electromagnetic radiation and its application in the spheres of wea ther modification.\"\" Russia began research into the modification of the Earth's weadier in 1974, and by 1976, they had four ground-based trans mitters in Russia. That winter there was snow in Miami, Florida, for the fi rst time in recorded history. 34 One can hasten to remember the comment about weathe r modification made by Zbigniew Brzezinski: \"I think we accept the idea of a vast expansion in social regulation. It may take such forms as leg islation for the number of children, perhaps even legislation determining the sex of children, once we have choice, the regulation of weather, [emphasis a dded], the regulation of leisure, and so forth.\" 35 Brzezinski went on to amplify his thoughts about th e \"regulation of weather\" in his book Between Two Ages: Not only have new weapons been developed but some o f the basic concepts of geography and strategy have been fundamentally altered: space and weather control have replaced Su ez or Gibraltar as key elements of strategy. In addition to improved rocketry, multi-missiles, a nd more powerful and more accurate bombs, future developmen ts may well include automated or manned space warships, deep-se a installa- tions, chemical and biological weapons, death rays, and still other forms of warfare—even the weadier may be tampered w ith... Techniques of weather modification could be employe d to produce prolonged periods of drought or storm, ther eby weaken- ing a nation's capacity and forcing it to accept th e demands of the competitor. 36 (It is interesting to speculate as to which industr ies might be interested in the ability to produce severely cold, or prolong ed periods of winter. The first one that comes to mind is the oil industry, w hich would sell more heating oil than in a normal winter.) But Russia and the other eastern European Communist nations are not the only Communist countries to receive technologic al assistance from the American government. China is quickly being added t o the list of countries. For instance, in 1974, David Rockefeller formed the National Council for U.S.-(Red) China Trade. This was prior to the r ecognition of Red China as a most favored nation by the government on May 1 5, 1977, meaning that China would be eligible for U.S. Export-Import Bank credits. These agreements were made in spite of the fact that the American government recognized that at least ten percent of the Chinese people live in forced labor 345"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30 TREASON camps. Once again, the cheapest laborers are those who are not paid anything for their efforts. But such aid and trade to China continues. On May 2 9, 1980, Secretary of Defense Harold Brown announced that the Carter A dministration would allow Red China to purchase air defense radar, heli copters, and transport planes, and that they would authorize American comp anies to build electronics and helicopter factories in Red China. But perhaps the true purpose for the recognition of Red China's need for America's latest technology came in an article that reported why America was interested in opening up the China door. A New York Times release on July 20, 1978, reported: \"Four American oil compani es are negotiating with China over the establishment of off shore drilling operations.\" 37 The article identified the four companies: Pennzoil , Exxon Corp., Union Oil of California, and Phillips Petroleum. But once again, the question must be asked as to ho w the Red Chinese plan on paying for these imports of American techno logy. China had an additional supply of goods to sell the Americans th at other countries, especially Russia, do not have. Senator Barry Goldw ater identified this commodity in 1977, when he stated: \"reports from [C hinese] refugees- ... prove beyond any doubt that Red China is the ma jor source of the world's hard drugs. These reports indicate that, at a minim um, Communist China's annual income from drug smuggling is $500 million a nnually.\" 38 The American dollars received in exchange for Chine se drugs are being used to purchase American technology. This is in ac cordance with a plan set in motion by Chou-En-Lai, the Chinese premier, who described his plan to an Egyptian publisher, Mohammed Heikal, in an inter view. Chou said: \"We are planting the best kinds of opium especially for Americans.\" 39 This activity was confirmed by Ed Reid, a Pulitzer Prize winning author and crime researcher, who said: \"There is no questi on but that the youth of this country are the victims of a conspiracy. The o bject is to get the kids on drugs and effectively destroy the next generation o f adults.\" 40 Congressman John Schmitz became aware of the progra m and intended to expose the evil intent of China's drug traffic: \"... I intend to cry foul when an American President... protects the massive drug trade of an enemy nation in order to assure it the dollars necessary to buy products from a few favored U.S. corporations.\" 41 The drug traffic also had another side-effect. It w as preparing young people to quietly acquiesce when the government des troyed their rights and freedoms. This conclusion was graphically illustrat ed in an article that appeared in 1972. It quoted a young student, called a \"hippie\" in the article, who was a university graduate and who explained wha t the drug culture had done to him: \"No, drugs are not the answer, but I'v e at least blown my mind 346"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30 TREASON so I don't have to ask any questions.\" 42 The Chinese also have a purpose in expanding their trade with the United States. This was illustrated by Huang Hua, F oreign Minister of the Red Chinese government, in 1978. He said: \"We are d iscussing trade with the U.S. with a view to expanding it and opening the do or wider to take full advantage of the opportunities it presents to build socialism at home and abroad. By opening the door of China-U.S. relations , we are opening wide the door which leads to revolution in the U.S.\" 43 The significance of selling equipment and technolog y to both the Red Chinese and the Russian governments who have both i ndicated that it is their intention to destroy the American capitalisti c system, has not gone unnoticed. The founding fathers of the United States were conc erned about such trade, as they wrote the following into the Constit ution of the United States, as Article III, Section 3: Treason against the United States shall consist onl y in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and c omfort. The definition of treason includes two separate and distinct actions. Not only was treason an act of war against the United S tates, but it was also giving aid and comfort to the enemy. Notice that it was not imperative that the United States be at war with the \"enemy\" in the formal sense, at the time the act of treason was committed. This is why businessmen and members of the armed fo rces face prison sentences when they sell military secrets to the Ru ssians. For instance, four people in September, 1981, were indicted for sellin g microwave tuners and receivers used for electronic surveillance, compute r systems and components to Communist East Germany. Another seller of strategic goods or knowledge to t he Russian govern- ment, in this case some \"missile secrets,\" received a life sentence and was called a \"traitor\" by the judge who sentenced him. Observers notice that the employees of the Departme nt of Commerce approve the sale of similar items to the Russian go vernment and it is not treason. It is interesting to ask those who justify such pro grams as selling materials to the Communist countries for their reas ons. One Congressman wrote a letter in 1977 to one who asked about why h e had supported American trade with Russia. The Congressman replied : \"As you probably know, this has always been the case since the Unite d States leads the way in such technology. This is because democracy encourag es innovative thinking 347"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30 TREASON which others emulate. However, I'm not sure this is bad. The more the Soviet Union adopts to western technology, the more their society opens up and thus the more suscepdble to change they become.\" The Congressman does not completely support his the ory that govern ments become more open when they trade with the Uni ted States. When, in 1975, Congress was asked to vote to prohibit the im portation of chrome from Rhodesia, the Congressman voted in favor of the bil l. It is a fair quesdon to ask whether or not the Amer ican government knows whedier the products that this nadon sells to Russia are used in ways that kill people. Commerce Department official Lawr ence J. Brady explained: \"It is virtually impossible to insure th at the advanced technology equipment shipped to the Soviet Union is not divert ed to military uses.\" 44 The reason that the American government sells strat egic technology to the Communist nations around the world was made cle ar in a 1964 Senate Internal Security Subcommittee report entitled The Many Crises of the Soviet Economy. The report said: \"On the Communist side, however, east- west trade, despite its apparently limited dollar v olume, is not merely of critical importance: it may well be a matter of sur vival. The Communist bloc must have Western assistance... to cope with the ch ronic deficiencies of its industries.\" 45 This position has been confirmed by various Soviet dissidents who have defected to the West and have brought out the truth about the importance of this strategic aid and trade to the Russian governm ent. One, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, informed the American people on July 5, 1975: \"Our whole slave system depends on your econo mic assistance. When they bury us alive, please do not send them shovels and the most up to date earth-moving equipment.\" 46 He reiterated this view in another speech to the American people when he said: \"Why do we hand over to Communist totalitarianism more and more technology — complex, delicate, developed technology which it needs for armaments and for cru shing its own citizens.\" 47 But in spite of his warnings, the aid and trade con tinues. And the Russian government keeps \"crushing its own cidzens.\" With America's help. 348"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"Chapter 31 Science Versus Reason The world of science has not escaped the attention of the conspiracy, and its interest has been spurred of late by the su dden increase in the research into a competing theory. The basic foundation block of current scientific th ought is the theory of evolution. So important is this theory that there a re those who say that anyone finding fault with it is ignorant: \"No infor med persons doubt any more mat the many animal types mat inhabit the eart h today are the results of a process of evolution.\" 1 This position is further strengthened by those who claim that evolution is no longer a dieory: \"... evolution is not a gues s, it is an established dieory that is fully proved by known facts.\" 2 The purpose of evolution, according to the Socialis ts, at least in a book entitled Evolution of Man, published by the Sociali st Worker's Party, is clear: \"Modern Socialism is closely allied to the modern s cientific theory of evolution. If laborers understand science, they bec ome socialists.\" 3 But the dieory of evolution has another purpose, mo re pervasive than the desire to convert the reader to the theories of Socialism. Julian Huxley, a scientist, has explained that: \"Darwin pointed out that no supernatural 349"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 31 SCIENCE VERSUS REASON designer was needed since natural selection could a ccount for any known form of life. There was no room for a supernatural agency in its evolution.\" 4 So evolution has two direct, non-competing purposes : to convince the student that Socialism is the partner to evolution, and secondly that there is no creative force in the universe. Huxley further went on to point out that: \"The supe rnatural is being swept out of the universe... God can no longer be c onsidered as the controller of the universe.... \"Operationally, God is beginning to resemble not a ruler, but the last fading smile of a cosmic Cheshire cat.\" 5 The Masonic Order also places a strong emphasis on the theory of evolution, according to W.L. Wilmhurst's book endtl ed The Meaning of Masonry, which adds \"This — the evolution of man in to superman — was always the purpose of ancient mysteries. Man, who h as sprung from the earth and developed through the lower kingdoms of n ature, to his present rational state, has yet to complete his evoludon by becoming a god-like being and unifying his conscience with the Omniscient... .\" 6 So one of the purposes of Masonry is to assist man in the fulfillment of his evolutionary progess on the road to perfection. But recently, especially in the latter half of the 20th century, a compet- ing theory to evoludon was being developed. It is i mportant to understand this new theory and its effect on evoludon and scie nce. The two competing theories may be defined as follow s: 1. Organic Evoludon: the theory that all living dun gs have arisen by a materialistic, naturalistic evolutionary process from a single source which itself arose from a dead, inanimate wo rld. The Smithsonian Insdtute in Washington D.C. has def ined evoludon in this manner: Evolution is the concept that species change throug h time. Over millions of years small changes accumulate to become large differences, new species arise, others the out. Rat es of change vary greatly, and direcdons of change are unpredictable. 7 The competing theory is defined as: 2. Creadonism: the theory that all basic animal and plant types were brought into existence by acts of a Creator us ing special processes which are not operadve today. Nodce that both theories are just that: theories. N either can be proved today in the scientific laboratory. Both attempt to explain the Earth and its inhabitants from the various facts existent in the world. The creationists claim that there are two scientifi c laws that disprove 350"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 31 SCIENCE VERSUS REASON evolution. These laws are called the Laws of Thermo dynamics (Thermody- namics is defined as the science of heat exchange o r heat transfer.) These Laws are as follows: 1. The First Law of Thermodynamics: The total amount o f energy remains constant. Energy is not being created anywh ere in the universe, it is only being changed. 2. The Second Law of Thermodynamics: Energy is changin g through decay. Energy becomes less available for fu rther work. One of the world's leading creationists, Dr. Henry Morris, has stated that: \"The Second Law demonstrates that there must have been a beginning or otherwise the universe would already be dead. Th e First Law demonstrates that the universe could not have begun itself, sinc e none of the processes creates anything.\" 8 Dr. Morris continued: \"The real law of change, howe ver, is one of decay, not of growth, a change 'down' instead of a change 'up.' Thus the laws of thermodynamics sharply conflict with the philosophy of evolution.\" 9 Both of these theories look at the universe and the n attempt to explain its origin. These two theories are contrary to each other. Evoludon theorizes that the earth created life through a gradual proce ss when first lower forms of life were created and then the higher forms evol ved from the earlier. The second theory, Creationism, contends that all a nimal as well as human life was created at nearly the same moment. N either theory can be reproduced in the laboratory, and neidier is taking place now. The evolutionists explain that the first cause of l ife was chance. The creationist explain it as the act of a Creator. Perhaps a review of the creationist's arguments wil l assist those who have never examined these two theories side by side . There are at least nine strong arguments against the dieories of the evolut ionists. 1. CHANCE: The evolutionists dieorize that simple l ife originated from the creation of amino acids, which later combined i n chains to form protein, all by the randomness of chance. A simple protein would consist of a chain of about 100 simple amino acids. But not just any combination of these amino acids will give life.

They studied the probability of life occurring by chance. The two scientists, Professor Sir Fred Hoyle and Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe, independently con cluded that \"the probability of life originating at random is so utt erly miniscule as to make it absurd.\" Each found that the odds against the spark of life originating accidentally on earth was staggering - in mathemati cal jargon 10 to the power of 40,000.

THE FOSSIL EVIDENCE: The Arizona Daily Star of A ugust 17. 1981, carried a picture of a recently deceased cow decayi ng on the desert. The picture revealed that there was nothing of the anim al but some very bleached bones. There was no skin, hair, or internal organs left of the animal. These had been ravaged by the elements, by other animals, and by bacteria. This decaying animal, soon to be little more than s ome badly decayed bones, raises an interesting question: how is a fos sil made? The longer the animal lies in the elements, the les s there is to fossilize, yet the scientists tell the world that it takes mil lions of years for the required amount of dust, mud or debris to cover the animal. Yet fossils have been found nearly intact, down to the skin and wrinkles (fossilized worms, for instance). A fossilized worm, down to the little convolutions of its body, implies a sudden deposition of mud to cover it and then chemi cal exchange to make the animal hard enough to withstand the enormous pr essure of the huge amounts of dirt above the fossil. Clams have been found with their muscles intact, wh ich implies a sudden deposition of debris over them, and then rap id chemical exchange, making the muscles inside the clam shell a hard fos sil. It would be presumed that, if these clams had slowly decayed during the time it would take to slowly cover them up, the muscle would decay. The problem of how the slow accumulation of dust co vering up a carcass can account for the fossilization of a land animal is not the only problem for the evolutionists, however. The same problem exists in the fossilization of ani mals in the water. One scientist indicated that: \"when fish decay thei r bones disconnect in less than one week. [The scientist] said that means the presence of fish fossils in complete form is evidence of a catastrophe that cov ered the fish suddenly and locked their bones in place.\" 11 This problem of fossil creation is a problem for th e evolutionists but not for the creationists who believe in a worldwide flo od that had the ability to suddenly and quickly deposit huge amounts of mud an d dirt on dead animals, both on the land and in the sea. But this is not the only problem for the evolutioni sts. The theory demands numerous intermediate living things which c an be hooked together in an attempt to show an evolutionary sequ ence. \"However, the fossil record reveals a profound chan ge from reptilian host to mammals—and without any proven intermediari es\" (Emphasis in original.) 12 The evolutionists theorize that the fossil record w ill show a step-by-step development of higher to lower forms of life, the d eeper the scientist digs into the earth. 353"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 31 SCIENCE VERSUS REASON The creationists theorize that the fossil record wi ll reveal the sudden appearance of life of high and low forms at the low est strata with no evidence of lower forms changing to higher forms as the scie ntist moves upward through other strata of rock. This is because the c reationist believes that all life arose spontaneously at roughly the same time. The first identifiable life is found as fossil evid ence in the Cambrian layer of rock, supposedly 500,000,000 (five hundred million) years old. There are no known fossil evidences in the two layers und erneath. There have been billions of fossils found in this one layer alone a nd all have been of a highly complex nature. No one has found any fossil evidenc e of a development of life from a single cell, just as the creationists t heorized. One textbook agrees. Stansfield's Science of Evolut ion, published by Macmillan in 1977, says this about the Cambrian lay er: \"During the Cambrian Period, there suddenly appeared representa tives of nearly all the major groups of animals now recognized. It was as i f a giant curtain had been lifted to reveal a world teeming with life in fanta stic diversity.\" 13 Creationists have also pointed out another problem with the reasonings of the evolutionists. They question their conclusio ns that the oldest fossils are always found in the oldest rocks. One creationi st has written: The fossil evidence that life has evolved from simp le to complex forms over the geological ages depends on t he geological ages of the specific rocks in which these fossils a re found. The rocks are assigned geological ages based on the fossil assemblages which they contain. The fossils, in turn, are arranged on the basis of their assumed evolutionary relationships. Thus, the main evidence for evolution is based on t he assump- tion of evolution. 14 In other words, the reason the rocks are old is bec ause the fossils in them are old. The reason the fossils are old is because the rocks they are contained in are old. This is called circular reasoning. Another problem for the evolutionist in the fossil record is that \"anything approaching the complete geological colum n is never found at any one place on the Earth's surface....\" In fact, \"... it is not at all unusual for strata to be found completely out of the approv ed order, with 'old' strata resting comfortably on top of 'young' strata.\" 15 (The geological column is a column that shows the various layers, one on top of another. The older layers are supposed to be on the bottom, the newer layers on the top. Each layer was supposedly laid down on top of the layer just under neath. This process assumedly took billions of years.) In addition to this insurmountable problem for the evolutionists, there 354"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 31 SCIENCE VERSUS REASON is another. \"It is now known that complex plants ex isted in the Cambrian period, which, on the evolutionary time scale, is 2 00 million years or so before even simple land plants are supposed to have evolved.\" 16 And in Glacier Park, for example, \"There are numero us localities around the world where supposedly older and simple fossils have been deposited in layers vertically above layers contain ing 'younger,' more complex, fossils.\" 17 But one of the most startling discrepancies in the fossil record came to light when a tuatara lizard was found alive on some islands off of New Zealand after the animal was supposedly extinct. Be cause the scientists have not found any fossil remains of the lizard in any r ock supposedly younger than 135 million years old, they presumed that the lizard was extinct. In other words, the animal once lived 135 million years ago, but not between then and the present, as there have been no fossil remains o f the lizard found in those layers of rock above those supposedly 135 million y ears old. Finding some living tuaturas on the surface of the earth really puzzled them. Where are the fossil remains of the lizard for the last 135 milli on years? Don't ask the evolutionist. Only the creationist ha s the answer: the assumptions made in dating fossils is wrong. 18 Such anomalies are very common all over the world. For instance, one scientist became troubled when he was checking foss il remains in the Grand Canyon. He found a layer of rock containing a certa in fossil. Above that layer was a thick barren layer, indicating that the fossi l had become extinct. But the layer directly above the barren layer was a layer c ontaining the fossil evidences again. \"The evolutionary theory allows no backtracking, no renewal of a species, once it has become extinct.\" 19 The fossil record's inability to explain the basic tenet of evolution, that simple life evolved into complex life, has been not ed by some prestigious scientists. One, David Raup of Chicago's famous Fie ld Museum, has said this about the fossil record: \"We are now about 120 years after Darwin and the knowledge of the fossil record has been greatly exp anded. Ironically, we have even fewer examples of evolutionary transition than we had in Darwin's time. By this I mean that some of the classic cases of darwinian change in the fossil record, such as the evolution of the horse i n North America, has had to be discarded or modified as a result of more detail ed information.\" 20 In spite of all of these problems, the evolutionist s still continue to hold up the fossil record as the evidence proving their case. Perhaps the reason this is so lies in the rather interesting fact that \"mor e than half of the geologists in the world work directly for oil companies, and t he support for many geologists in academic [pursuits] and [in] governme nt comes from Petroleum.\" 21 3. MUTATIONS: The Arizona Daily Star of April 4, 19 81, carried a picture 355"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 31 SCIENCE VERSUS REASON of a two-headed snake. The caption underneath the p icture said that the associate professor of zoology at Arizona State Uni versity said that the snake \"wouldn't last in the wild.\" 22 The snake was a mutation and it would have difficulty surviving in nature. Evolutionists claim that mutations are the changes that account for the changes in species, yet scientists know that about ninety-nine out of one hundred mutations produce inferior creatures, such as the two headed snake that \"wouldn't last in the wild.\" If this is true, then the fossilized remains of these ninety-nine unsuccessful mutations should be in the fossil record, as well as the successful ones found so abundantly. Th e fossil record reveals no fossil remains of known mutations. 4. TIME: The evolutionists theorize that there have been millions, if not billions, of years in which man and the various ani mals have been able to evolve into higher forms of life. Certain species h ave died out and become extinct before other species, including man, evolve d. At a debate between an evolutionist and a creationi st in Tucson, the evolutionist, a professor at the University of Ariz ona, claimed that, if ever fossil records of man could be found alongside foss il records of the dinosaur, this find would seriously weaken, but not destroy, the evolutionary theory. He explained that this was because the dinosaurs ha d become extinct, according to the evolutionary dieory, around sixty million years before the appearance of man on the earth. One of the spectators at the debate hastened to poi nt out to the scientist that such fossil evidence did indeed exist at the P aluxy River near Glen Rose, Texas, south of Fort Worth. Apparently a flood in 1 900 eroded away the top layer of the mud and exposed a limestone layer unde rneath it. This limestone layer, supposedly 120 million years old, contained a rather startling discovery. The stone contained human footprints! Si nce it is theorized that man appeared on Earth about 1 million years ago, ap proximately 119 million years of time had disappeared, at least if the rock was supposedly 120 million years old. But there was even something more startling in the stone. The human footprints were side by side dinosaur footprints! The theory is that the dinosaur died out about 60 m illion years ago. That means, according to the evolutionary theory, t hat it is impossible for man and the dinosaur to have been on the Earth at t he same time. The spectator asked the professor if he had an expl anation. Did man and the dinosaur co-habitate the Eardi at the same time ? How could the rock be 120 million years old, the dinosaur footprints 60 m illion years old, and the man's footprints 1 million years old? The scientist was quick to offer an explanation. His position was that the rock was once soft, about 60 million years ago. 356"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 31 SCIENCE VERSUS REASON The dinosaur moved through the mud, leaving behind the evidence of his presence, his footprints. The mud became hard and t hen some 59 million years later, became soft once again. Man moved thro ugh the soft mud, leaving behind his footprints. Then, for some unexp lained reason, the rock became hard again, leaving both the dinosaur and hu man footprints side by side. When questioned as to why the dinosaur footprints d idn't erode when the limestone became soft again, unless man's footp rints were placed down in the soft mud precisely the same day the mud got soft and men hard again, the scientist had to admit that he had no answer. Also, what mechanism did the professor know about t hat could cause rock to become hard, then soft, then hard, men soft , and men hard again? Once again, he had no answer. The scientist was unw illing to admit that the fossilized footprints \"weakened, but didn't destroy \" his evolutionary theory, even though that conclusion was his opening stateme nt. He was bending the facts to explain his theory, rather than adjusting the theory to explain the facts. His evolutionary theory postulated that man and dinosaur couldn't have co-existed at the same time; therefore, the fo ssilized evidence must be incorrect or explained away. When confronted with t he evidence, he approached the dilemma the only way he could: he ha d to deny the facts. One scientist, when asked about some of the human f ootprints in the stone, while he was an observer to their uncovering at the site in about 1955, said that if the human footprints were alone in the rock, he would have to conclude that they were human. But since they were beside the dinosaur footprints, he wasn't sure. To further complicate the problem for the professor at the debate, other scientists have carbon dated some plants in the lim estone layer. They were found to be 38,000 to 39,000 years old, quite a bit earlier than the supposed age of the rock which is theorized to be 120,000,00 0 years old. In addition, other scientists have found another pr oblem for the evolution theory at this same site. They have found human footprints in rock layers below strata containing the footprints of th e dinosaur. All of these facts fit the creationist's dieory tha t holds that man and the dinosaur lived at the same time, not millions of ye ars apart, but thousands of years ago. This explains the footprints of both at the same site, in the same layer of limestone. 5. SEQUENCE: The age-old question of \"which came fi rst, the chicken or the egg?\" is an appropriate question to ask in the evolution versus creation debate. The world is full of examples of animals an d plants that had to appear on the scene at precisely the same moment in the past. For instance, the bee and the flower both had to ap pear at precisely the same time or the earlier would not be able to survi ve. 357"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 31 SCIENCE VERSUS REASON Another problem for the evolutionist is the questio n of when certain predators for certain animals evolved. There is a naturally occurring balance of nature wh ereby the popula- tion of one species is kept in balance by another s pecies, its natural predator. If the population of the hunted animal suddenly inc reases, the population of the second animal, the hunter, increases as well. A s the population of the hunted animal decreases, so does the population of the second animal. It is only when man artifically intervenes in the e nvironment that this system gets out of balance. Take, for example, the case of the rabbit in Austra lia. This animal is not native to this country and was reportedly brought t here as a game animal to be hunted for sport. But since the rabbit has no na tural predator in Australia and is a rapid breeder, the animal is increasing in numbers so quickly that it is starving other animals native to the land becaus e it is consuming their share of the available food. A similar problem is occurring in Oregon with the o pposum. This animal is also not native to the area, having been brought to the Northwest by Southerners who came to build ships during World War II. After the war was over, the Southerners returned to the South and they released whatever animals they had on hand at the time. These animals breed radier rapidly and have spread all over the Northwest to the point where they are eating vital food needed by other animals. The opposum has no natural predators, and it is prospering to the detriment of other anim als native to the area. (Some local wags have claimed that the only predato r of the oppossum is the '55 Chevy! It seems that the automobile is the majo r predator of this little animal because it strikes so many of them at night as they cross the roads looking for food.) It has become a real problem for those living in the Northwest. But these examples ask the question that the evolut ionists have trouble answering: the hunted animal and its predator, the hunter, had to \"evolve\" at precisely the same time, or either the world wou ld be over-populated by the hunted animal, if it \"evolved\" first, or with large quantities of fossils of the hunter if it \"evolved\" before its food supply \"evol ved.\" Man's attempts to artifically induce an animal into the environment where there is no natural predator proves that both the hunted animal and its predator had to \"evolve\" precisely at the same time. The existence of such a balance of nature strongly implies a designer- 6. MISSING LINKS: One of the areas most open to que stion by the creationists is the area of the \"missing links,\" th e humans and near humans who supposedly link man and his ancestors. A quick look at some of these \"missing links,\" or e arly men, shows how weak this evidence is for the case of the evolution ists. 358"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 31 SCIENCE VERSUS REASON a. The Zinjanthropus Man: The fossil evidence of th is early \"man\" was discovered in strata supposedly 1 and 3/4 million y ears old. Yet when the scientists carbon dated other material in the same layer, mat material was found to be approximately 10,000 years old. b. The Nebraska Man: This connecting link was cited at the famous Scopes trial in Tennessee by leading scientists to prove man man had evolved from earlier forms of existence. The fossil evidence of the Nebraska Man consisted o f a tooth mat was said to have come from a prehistoric man who suppos edly lived one million years ago. Scienusts used this toodi to reconstruct the Nebraska man's flesh, hair and family. 23 Yet when more fossils were unearthed at the same s ite, it was discovered mat the Nebraska man was only a pig. c. Piltdown Man: This man was supposed to be half a million years old and was constructed from a piece of jaw discovered in 1912. The fossilized jaw was considered to be authentic until 1953 when it w as discovered mat the jaw had turned out to be the jawbone of a modern ape. I n addition, the jawbone had been filed down and stained to look older. In other words, it was a deliberate hoax. 24 d. Neandethal Man: This connecdng link was once pic tured as a link between apes and man, but was later found out to be strictly human, just another man. One can only speculate as to why the evolutionary s ciendst is so quick to grasp at anything that appears to be a link conn ecdng man with the ape. Perhaps the question has been answered by the follo wing statement: The real reason why — after multitudes of fossil fr agments have been examined and sorted by evolutionary anthr opologists for over a hundred years — there is still no agreement as to man's evolutionary ancestry, is because he had no evoluti onary ancestry! All of the real evidence indicates that man was tru e man right from the start. 25 Maybe this is why some evolutionists are now shifti ng away from the theory that man evolved from apes or monkeys. Unfor tunately, their predetermined prejudices stay with them when they d evelop new theories. Take, for instance, the new theory postulated by Dr . Geoffrey Bourne, Director of Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center of Emory University. Dr. Bourne is an Australian born, Oxford educated A merican cell biologist, anatomist, and now considered to be one of the worl d's leading primatologists. He has declared his belief that \"apes and monkeys a re the evolutionary descendants of man!\" 26 This scientist wants man to believe that the ape an d monkey are man's grandchildren! 359"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 31 SCIENCE VERSUS REASON 7. MALE AND FEMALE: The obvious fact that so many a nimal species have evolved into male and female types is another thorny problem for the evolutionists. Both sexes are absolutely essendal to the condnued propagation of the animal species, and it is absolutely imperative tha t both evolved at precisely the same time. That means that, if one species of a nimal evolved a male into a higher form of life in the process of evolution, that animal had to have a female of exactly the same type evolve at precisely the same time, or the new male wouldn't have been able to reproduce itself. 8. THE AGE OF THE UNIVERSE: It is claimed by the ev oludonists that the Earth was created about 4.5 billion years ago. The creationists are now developing a very effective scientific argument tha t the Earth cannot be older than 10,000 years old. Some of the arguments for a young Earth are as foll ows: a. Decay of the Magnetic Field: National Aeronautic al and Space Administration orbiting satellites have been measur ing the Earth's magnetic field and have found that it is slowly decaying, or wearing down. One scientist has interpreted these scientific data and has drawn this conclusion: \"Since the Earth's magnetic field is de caying, extrapolation back into the past more than 10,000 years predicts a cur rent flow so vast that the eardi's structure could not survive the heat produc ed. Thus the Earth cannot be much older than 10,000 years.\" 27 b. Oil Seepage: It is estimated that the amount of oil that seeps into the oceans is 5 million tons per year. It is also estim ated that the total amount of offshore oil is 100 billion tons, which means that the total amount of oil would have been lost to the oceans 2500 times, if o il is estimated to be 50 million years old, or that it would only take about 20,000 years to deplete the entire quantity of offshore oil. 28 c. Helium Decay: As plant and animal life dies and then decays, a certain amount of helium is released into the atmosphere. E stimating by the rate of addition of helium to the atmosphere from radioacti ve decay, the age of the Earth appears to be about 10,000 years old, even al lowing for moderate helium escape to the space above the atmosphere. 29 d. Population Growth: Evolutionists generally theor ize that man evolved about 1 million years ago. These early huma ns have multiplied, so the theory goes, to the point where there are now a bout 4 billion people on the Earth. \"The same population statistics which su pposedly presage a serious population problem in the future also indic ate a very recent origin of man in the past... \"An initial population of only two people, increasi ng at 2% a year, would become 3.5 billion in only 1,075 years... \"An average population growth of only 1/2 of one pe rcent would generate the present world population in only 4,000 years.\" 30 e. Meteoritic Dust on the Earth: \"There is no measu rable accumulation 360"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 31 SCIENCE VERSUS REASON of meteoritic dust on the Earth's surface, but pres ent rates of influx of such dust from space would produce a layer 1/8th of an i nch thick all over the Earth in a million years, and a layer 54 feet diick in 5 billion years.\"\" f. Decay of the Sun: In 1980, two scientists discov ered the \"... sun has been contracting 0.1% per century .... \" They believed that this shrinkage was continuous an d has occurred at the same rate as in the past. If this is correct, only 100,000 years ago the sun would be twice as big as it is today; 20 million years ago, the surface of t he sun would touch the Eardi and the Eardi would have been a cinder. 32 g. Meteroritic Dust on the Moon: The scientists who planned America's lunar landing probe theorized that the moon was app roximately 4.5 billion years old. They knew that, as the moon orbited thro ugh space, meteoritic dust fell on its surface. They were somewhat able t o scientifically estimate the exact quantity of dust that had fallen during its s upposed 4.5 billion year life. The scientists theorized that the moon had large qu antities of dust on its surface because it was so old. They then concluded that the lunar landing device would sink in this dust when it landed. So t hey devised the disc-shaped feet on the landing device so that the feet would s upport its weight when it landed. Their theories were in part supported by the theory of R.A. Lytdeton of Cambridge University. He theorized that: Since there is no atmosphere on the moon, the moon' s surface is exposed to direct radiation. Thus, the strong ultra-violet light and x-rays can destroy the surface layers of exposed rocks and reduce them to dust at a rate of a few thousandths of an inch per year. If a layer, say 0.0004 inch thick in pulverized mat ter, is formed per year, then, in 10,000 years a layer of about fo ur inches in depth would be produced; in 100,000 years a layer of 40 i nches; in 1,000,000 years a layer of 3.3 feet; in 1,000,000,0 00 years a layer of 6.3 miles; and in 4,500,000,000 years (4.5 billion year s, the supposed age of the moon) a layer of about 28 miles in depth wou ld be formed. Yet when the lunar landing device landed on the moo n, they measured the dust layer to be \"1/8th inch to 3 inches in thi ckness.\" 33 So if Professor Lyttleton's dieories are correct, t he moon is no older than about 10,000 years, or less, and certainly not 4,50 0,000,000 years in age. 9. Symbiosis: Symbiosis is defined as: \"the intimat e living together of two dissimilar organisms in a mutually beneficial r elationship.\" And the existence of several symbiotic relationship s presents real problems for the evolutionists. For instance, the Nile crocodile allows a small bir d, called the Egyptian 361"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 31 SCIENCE VERSUS REASON plover, to enter its mouth to clean its teeth of ha rmful bacteria. If the plover does not remove these intruders, the crocodile can be seriously harmed. The parasites are the Plover bird's sole source of nutr ition. In other words, the two animals need each other and had to occur at precisely the same time or one would not have been able to survive to wait for the other. But symbiosis is not confined to the animal kingdom alone. Frequently the plant and animal kingdoms join toget her in a symbiotic relationship, mutually beneficial to both parties. Such is the case of the yucca moth and the yucca plant. The moth collects a ball of pollen, stuffs it into a seed chamber of the yucca plant, and then lays a fe w eggs inside the seed. Since the larvae that hatch can feed only on develo ping yucca seeds, their growth is provided for; and since some seeds are le ft and this yucca cannot otherwise pollinate itself, the plant also benefits . Neither the plant nor the animal would have been ab le to survive if both didn't occur at precisely the same time. The occurrence of such design demands a designer! But even in view of such problems in the field of e volutionary science, the evolutionists persist in their theories. Why is it so important that the theory of evolution be defended in view of the enor mous evidence against it? Does it have a purpose that demands its defense? Several have attempted to answer that question. One, the scientist Julian Huxley, already quoted on this subject, informs the student: \"It is clear that the doctrine of evolution is directly antagonistic to that of creation.... Evolution, if consistently accepted, makes it impossible to believe in the Bible.\"' 4 The author of a book on the subject of Humanism, Cl aire Chambers, has stated the following in answer to this question : \"Before man can be enslaved, his state of mind must be reduced from sp irituality to carnality. He must learn to think of himself as basically an anim al with no spiritual purpose. Once man is freed from his obligations to God, the way is cleared for his ultimate obedience to the Communist State a s his master.\" 35 Another, writer H.L. Mencken, an observer at the fa mous Scopes evolution trial that tested the right of the state to limit school curriculums, said this: There is, it appears, a conspiracy of scientists af oot. Their purpose is to break down religion, propagate immoral- ity, and so reduce mankind to the level of the brut es. They are the sworn and sinister agents of Beelzebub (the devil) who \"yearns to conquer the world... .\" 36 362"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":" Chapter 32 Abortion and Laetrile When a woman takes the life of her unborn child on the theory that she may do what she wishes with her own body, she receives the sanction of the Federal Supreme Court.

Perhaps the major reason for this shift from natura l to synthetic or chemical foods is because of the cartel agreements signed between the giant chemical cartel, I.G. Farben, and the following Ame rican companies: Borden, Carnation, General Mills, M.W. Kellogg Co., Nestle's, and Pet Milk. 2 And I.G. Farben either owns outright or has had a s ubstantial financial interest in, or has had other cartel agreements wit h the following: Owl Drug, Parke Davis & Co., Bayer Co., Whitehall Laboratorie s, Chef-Boy-Ar-Dee Foods, Bristol Myers, and Squibb and Sons. 3 The importance of these cartel agreements between I .G. Farben and some of America's largest food and drug suppliers b ecomes all the more evident when the claims of those supporting the use of Laetrile as a cancer cure or suppressant are studied. Laetrile has an interesting history: \"Dr Ernst T. K rebs Jr., a bio- chemist . . . had advanced the theory that cancer . .. is merely a deficiency disease aggravated by lack of an essential food com pound abundantly in nature in over twelve hundred edible plants and [wa s] found virtually in every part of the world.\" 4 Laetrile is found in such nuts, berries and foods a s: bitter almonds, buckwheat, apricot seeds, alfalfa, cherry seeds, pe as, grasses, berries, maize, macadamia nuts, sorghum, lentils, millet, linseed, and apple seeds. 5 Some nutritionists have felt that the American publ ic was not eating those grains, berries and foods high in Laetrile, a nd was therefore experienc- ing an increasing rate of cancer. They noticed that most of the grains consumed by the food consumer were hybridized and t hat Laetrile had been removed by genetic engineering. This meant that the grains high in Laetrile, such as millet and buckwheat, those that were the g rain staples consumed by America's early pioneers, had either been eliminate d or replaced by those hybridized grains containing little or no Laetrile. In addition, some nutritionists have discovered ent ire societies where there is little or no cancer. One group, living in the remote recesses of the Himalaya Mountains between West Pakistan, India and China, known as the Hunzas, has never had a case of cancer in their society. These people 364"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 32 ABORTION AND LAETRILE consume the apricot and its Laetrile-bearing seed a s the main staple of their diet. (The eating of seeds for nutrition is a Biblical co ncept. Genesis 1:29 reads: \"And God said: 'Behold I have given you ever y herb bearing seed upon the earth, and all trees that have in themselves se ed of their own kind, to be your meat.'\") Other societies, also cancer free, consume large qu antities of Laetrile- bearing grains and grasses as main staples of their diet. Laetrile is a natural, non-toxic, water-soluble sub stance entirely normal to and compatible with human metabolism. The proper name for a food factor that contains these properties is a vitamin. But every time the proponents of the use of Laetril e in cancer cases attempt to secure permission to conduct official te sts in U.S. hospitals, they are turned down. When famed chemist Linus Pauling, twice a Nobel Pri ze winner, tried to secure research funds from the National Cancer I nstitute for medical research on Vitamin C as a possible cancer cure, he was told that \"The road to a vitamin answer to cancer is of no medical inte rest.\" 6 Other researchers, especially those testing for che mical solutions to cancer, are far more successful. For instance, the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, in New York, is financed in part b y: \"... the federal government and the Rockefeller Foundation.\" 7 But in 1981, according to the U.S. News and World R eport, the govern- ment relented to pressure from those suggesting tha t Laetrile be tested as a possible cure to cancer, and agreed to a series of tests in four major medical centers. After running their tests, they concluded that it was not effective. 8 The results brought charges from the Laetrile propo nents. For instance, Robert Henderson, a spokesman for the pro-Laetrile Committee for Freedom of Choice in Cancer Therapy, charged that the tests were neither honest nor fair and were \"probably des igned to fail.\" Mr. Henderson said: \"... the researchers did not contin ue the intravenous injections of amygdalin, another name for Laetrile, long enough, and they used an 'impure form' of the compound.\" 9 A few months later, in July, 1981, Robert Bradford and Michael Culbert of the Committee issued a joint statement charging the National Cancer Institute with: \"gross fraud and deceit on the Amer ican public and of murder (negligent homicide) in the matter of cancer patien ts enrolled in the so-called 'Laetrile clinical trials'...\" 10 One author, G. Edward Griffin, in his book World Wi thout Cancer, Part I, informed the reader why he felt that the me dical establishment wanted the tests to fail: \"There are far more people makin g a living from cancer than 365"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 32 ABORTION AND LAETRILE are dying from it.

One nation, Mexico, after years of testing in Army hosp itals, legalized its use, and in fact Dr. Ernesto Contreras at his Good Samaritan Cancer Clinic, in Tijuana, Mexico, has been effectively treating canc er with Laetrile for over 17 years. But, in the U.S., those who want to take Laetrile a s a treatment for their cancer can't, because the individual's body does no t belong to the individual.

The solution to the problems of the world lies in the changing of man himself. The liberal position: The liberal appeals to the ma terialistic nature of man, believing that man's problems arise because of the environment.

On May 18, 1972, Roy M. Ash, from the Office of Man agement and Budget during the Nixon administration, laid down t he time frame, as far as he could see it, for the world government: \"Within two decades [sometime before 1992] the institutional framework for a Worl d Economic Community will be in place...\" when \"aspects of individual so vereignty will be given over to supernational authority. 1 James P. Warburg in his book The West in Crisis, al so went on record of supporting the need for a world government: \"A world order without world law is an anachronism; and that, since war now means the extinction of civilization, a wor ld which fails to establish the rule of law over the nation-states cannot long continue to exist. We are living in a perilous period of transition from the era of the fully sovereign nation-state to the era of world government.\" 2 Warburg once told a Senate Committee, on February 1 7, 1950, how the peoples of the world would receive this world-gover nment: \"We shall have world government whether you like it or not, if not by consent by conquest.\" 5 The world government envisioned by these seers incl udes plans for a world police force. One who has described the need for such a constabulary is historian Arnold Toynbee: \"We are approaching th e point at which the only effective scale for operations of any importan ce will be the global scale. The local states ought to be deprived of their sove reignty and subordinated to the sovereignty of a global world government. I think the world state will still need an armed police [and the] world governme nt will have to command sufficient force to be able to impose peace.\" 4 To convince the people of the world to give up thei r national sover- eignty and turn it over to a world government is a monumental task. However, the planners do not feel it is insurmounta ble. One of those who foresaw the problem has also offered the solution. Dr. Brock Chisolm, director of the World Health Organization, is on re cord as stating: To achieve world government, it is necessary to rem ove from the minds of men their individualism, loyalty to fa mily tradition, national patriotism and religious dogmas.... We have swallowed all manner of poisonous certainde s fed us by our parents, our Sunday and day school teachers, our politi- cians, our priests, our newspapers and others with vested interests in controlling us.

The standard of living of those in the afflue nt nations must be reduced. This will be done by a slow, gradual process of con ditioning the citizens of the rich nations to survive on less than they produ ce. This position was made clear by John Knowles, the P resident of the Rockefeller Foundation, in its annual report for 19 75: \"I am sure of only one thing—more is not necessarily better. The web of in terdependence is tightening. We are one world and there will be one future — for better or for worse — for us all. Central to a new ethic of makin g less more is controlled economic growth which conserves scarce resources, p rovides more equitable distribution of income and wealth...\" In addition to controlling the supply of goods, Mr. Knowles also urges the control of the demand for goods: \"It is also ne cessary to control fertility rates at the replacement level and to achieve zero population growth as rapidly as possible... .\" 6 Once the people in the more productive nations have been conditioned to live with less, they can be conditioned to share their excess wealth with the less productive nations. This sharing of the wealth is called the New International Economic Order, a phrase that was def ined by Senator Charles Percy, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations : The philosophy behind the new international economi c order is based on the fact that the developed wealthier n ations use a substantially greater share of the earth's resource s... than do the less developed poor nations. The new order calls for a more equitable distributi on of the earth's resources among the earth's people and redi stribution of wealth among rich and poor nations. 7 In keeping with this program, on March 30, 1979, Se cretary of State Cyrus Vance, (also a member of the CFR), promised t hat the United States would step up its economic aid to the developing na tions of the world in order to hasten \"progress toward a more equitable a nd healthy new interna- tional economic order.\" 8 The progress towards this world government has been steady, not because the people of the richer countries have fre ely chosen it after hearing the arguments on both sides, but because they have been lied to. A good case in point is the article written by Richard Gardner, a top advisor to President Jimmy Carter, who was also Ambassador to Italy, in the April, 1974, issue of Foreign Affairs, the monthly journal of the Council on Foreign Relations. He wrote that \"the 'house of world order' will have to be built from the 369"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 33 WORLD GOVERNMENT bottom up rather than from the top down.... An end run around national sovereignty, eroding it piece by piece, will accomp lish more than the old fashioned frontal assault.\" 9 The United States government has presented its blue print for the transfer of America's military forces to the one-wo rld government, in this case, the fledgling world government, the United Na tions, in a document published in 1961. This document, entitled Freedom From War—State Depa rtment Publication 7277, was strangely removed from public ation a couple of years after the American people had had a chance to read it for themselves. It proposed the gradual surrender of all of the Americ an forces to a world police force in a three-phase program: The first stage would significantly reduce the capa bilities of nations to wage war by reducing the armed forces of the nations; 2: the nuclear capabilities would be reduced by treati es; and 3: U.N. \"peace-keeping\" powers would be strengthened. The second stage would provide further substantial reductions in the armed forces; and the establishment of a per manent interna- tional peace force within the United Nations. The third stage would have the nations retaining on ly those forces required for maintaining internal order, but the United States would provide manpower for the United Nation s Peace Force. This transfer would mean that the Secretary General of the United Nations would become the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces of the United States, completely in violation of the Const itution of the United States. The Secretary General would, in turn, place the command of this new peace-keeping force over to the Under-Secretary in charge of all military affairs, the Under-Secretary in charge of the Depar tment of Political and Security Council Affairs. This key position has bee n held by a Communist from either the Soviet Union or a Soviet controlled Communist state since the inception of the United Nations. (This position is the same one that General MacArthur had to report to during the Korea n War.) Since the American people were not completely ready to surrender to the United Nations, this report, as indicated above, wa s pulled out of circulation and declared to be out of print. But those in charg e of having the United States become part of a one-world government have n ot rested. The next step in this program occurred on January 30, 1976, when the World Affairs Council announced the Declaration of Interdependenc e.

I would defend the proposition that tiiis expansion is good — not bad. Surely, we have reached the point where we can say- ... that Jefferson was wrong: that government is no t best which governs least [Jefferson had written: that governme nt is best which governs least]. The fallacy in Jefferson's argument is the assumpti on mat the expansion of government leads to the curtailment of individual freedoms. That just is not true. 10 The Declaration supported by Senator Clark read, in part: Two centuries ago, our forefathers brought forth a new nation; now we must join with others to bring forth a new world order. To establish a new world order... it is essential t hat mankind free itself from limitations of national prejudice. .. We affirm that the economy of all nations is a seam less web, and that no one nation can any longer effectively m aintain its processes of producdon and monetary systems without recognizing the necessity of collaborative regulation by intern ational authorities. We call upon all nations to strengthen the United N ations . . . and other institutions of world order . . . . 11 One of those Representatives who chose not to sign the Declaration was Congresswoman Marjorie Holt, who said this: \"It cal ls for the surrender of our national sovereignty to international organizat ions.

This question was discussed in great detail by thos e who wrote the Report From Iron Mountain. These individuals foresa w the day when they would have to intentionally design special programs as a means of control- ling people during the period of peace. This was an alien thought to them, since they reasoned that man had always operated to control other men by causing wars for mat purpose.

First, these \"surrogates,\" or substitutes for the r eal purpose of war, must meet two principal criteria: 1. They must be wasteful, and 2. They must operate outside the normal supply-demand system. The second criterion means that the \"surrogates\" mu st not be accessible to the whims of the people. In other words, the peo ple must not be able to demand that the government stop spending their tax money in a wasteful manner. These are the substitutes that the writers of the R eport From Iron Mountain came up with: 1. Complete government guaranteed health care for all; 2. Making available for all a professional degree thro ugh education; 3. Providing spacious living space for all; 4. Mass public transportation; 5. A guaranteed annual income; 6.

Education has far more important functions. In 1979, the mother of a San Francisco high school graduate sued the district because her son, after twelve years of pub lic \"educadon,\" was barely able to read and write. An appeals court ruled that the district was not negligent, however, because: \"The science of pedago gy [teaching] itself is fraught with differences and conflicdng theories.\" 1 Therefore, since no one knows what education is or what it is supposed to do, the district couldn't be held responsible fo r not teaching a child to read and write or anything else, for that matter. One of the reasons for the sad state of the \"scienc e\" known as education has been the gradual introduction into the school s ystem of the religious philosophy known as Secular Humanism.

He testified about the trustees of the Carnegie Endowm ent for International Peace who realized that \"... they must control educ ation in this country. So they approach[ed] the Rockefeller Foundation with t he suggestion that the task be divided between the two of them. The Carneg ie Endowment takes on that aspect of education that has a tinge of intern ational significance and the Rockefeller Foundation takes on that portion of edu cation which is domestic in this relationship.\" 3 Congressman Eugene Cox confirmed Mr. Dodd's conclus ions when he testified: \"The Rockefeller Foundation's funds have been used to finance individuals and organizations whose business it has been to get communism into the private and public schools of this country ...\" 4 But the planners faced an immense problem. The Amer ican public was not ready to accept the introduction of communism i nto the school systems of the nation. The plan was to change the name, but not the basic philo- sophy, so that the American people would allow it t o be taught in their schools. The new name of the communist philospophy became Se cular Humanism. Secular is defined by the dictionary as being: \"of or relating to worldly things as distinguished from things relating to chu rch and religion; worldly.\" Humanism has been defined by the American Humanist Association as: \"the belief that man shapes his own destiny. It is a constructive philospohy, a non-theistic religion, a way of life.\" Notice that Humanism, according to its own publicat ions, is also a religion, a new way of living in and looking at the world. Karl Marx was one of the first to link the philosop hy of Communism with the philosophy of Humanism, when he said: \"Com munism as a fully developed naturalism is Humanism....\" 5 And again: \"Humanism is the denial of God, and the total affirmation of man.... Humanism is nothing else but Marxism.\" 6 And in 1970, the New Program of the Communist Party , U.S.A., stated that: \"Marxism is not only rational, it is humanist in the best and most profound meaning of the term.\" 7 Sir Julian Huxley, a leading scientist, wrote: \"I u se the word humanist 376"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 35 HUMANISM to mean someone who believes that man is just as mu ch a natural pheno- menon as an animal or plant; that his body, mind, a nd soul were not super- naturally created but were products of evolution an d that he is not under the control or guidance of any supernatural being or be ings but has to rely on himself and his own powers.\" 8 The Humanist philosophy and religion is not new, bu t it took a formalized step in 1933 when a group of scientists, educators, ministers, authors, and others published The Humanist Manifest o. This document contained three introductory paragraphs and then a series of 15 planks detailing the position of their new philosophy and religion. A partial reading of this manifesto reveals just wh at the Humanists believe in: The time has come for widespread recognition of the radical change in religious beliefs through the modern worl d. Science and economic change has disrupted the old b eliefs. Religions the world over are under the necessity of coming to terms with the new conditions created by a vastly i ncreased knowl- edge and experience. In every field of human activity, the vital movemen t is now in the direction of a candid and explicit Humanism. We therefore affirm the following: First: Religious humanists regard the universe as s elf-existing and not created. Second: Humanism believes that man is part of natur e and that he has emerged as a result of a continuous pro cess. Sixth: We are convinced that the time has passed fo r theism (a belief in a Creator.) Fourteenth: The humanists are firmly convinced that the existing acquisitive and profit motivated society h as shown itself to be inadequate. A socialized and cooperative economi c order must be established to the end that the acquisitive dist ribution of the means of life be possible. 9 A brief review of each of these statements reveals the nature of the Humanist philosophy and religion. The first plank details the position that the unive rse has always existed and was not created. Therefore there is no need for a Creator. The second plank states the belief in evolution as the history of man; that man has arisen from nothing as the result of h is constant battle with his environment. The sixth plank states that the Humanists believe t hat the time for theism [a belief in a God or Gods], has passed. The refore, the Humanists 377"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 35 HUMANISM believe, since there is no Creator, that there is n o need to believe in one. The Humanists are atheists. And the fourteenth plank states their belief that t he free-enterprise system is inadequate and that it must be replaced w ith the communist system of forced sharing of all goods produced by the soci ety. Therefore, the Humanists in 1933 who signed this Ma nifesto placed their philosophy and religion squarely on a three-l egged platform. The Humanists were Evolutionists, Atheists, and Communi sts. Their beliefs are in complete agreement with the ph ilosophies of Weishaupt, Marx and Lenin. But the most significant impact of this Manifesto i s the fact that one of the thirty-four signers in 1933 was John Dewey, the so-called \"father of Progressive Education.\" Mr. Dewey's place in the fi eld of education was made clear in 1974 when Saturday Review celebrated its 50th anniversary. The magazine polled the leading individuals in the various fields of endeavor, including education, and asked them to id entify the most important individual in their respective field. The leading educator during those 50 years, 1924 to 1974, according to those educators polled by Saturday Review, was John Dewey, the Humanist. One of those polled by the magazine said this about Professor Dewey: \"No individual has influenced the thinking of Ameri can educators more.\" John Dewey made his views known to the observer in a series of books and publications during his days in education. One of his proclamations contained his basic philosophy about God and religi on. He wrote: \"There is no God and no soul. Hence, there are no needs for t he props of traditional religion. With dogma and creed excluded then immuta ble truth is also dead and buried. There is no room for fixed, natural law or permanent absolutes.\" 10 Here is Dewey expressing his views on two subjects of interest: 1. The question of truth, and 2. The question of moral absolutes. Dewey's position that \"immutable truth is dead\" def ies human logic. The word \"immutable\" means, according to the dictio nary, \"unchangea- ble,\" and the word \"truth\" means an \"established fa ct.\" Just how an \"unchangeable,\" \"established fact\" can be \"dead\" is apparently not considered relevant to Dewey. When Dewey took this second position, on the absenc e of fixed, moral absolutes, he aligned himself further with Communis t thought. Lenin himself also spoke similarly on the issue of morali ty when he stated: \"We, of course, say that we do not believe in God. We do no t believe in eternal morality. That is moral that serves the destruction of the old society.\" And further: \"Everything is moral which is necessary fo r the annihilation of the 378"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 35 HUMANISM old exploiting social order and for uniting the pro letariat.\" 11 Lenin identified the source of man's concepts of mo rality as religion. He wrote: \"We must combat religion. Down with religion . Long live atheism. The spread of atheism is our chief task. Communism abolishes eternal truths. It abolishes all religion and morality.\" 12 The question of how something that is fixed, absolu te, or eternal can be abolished escaped Lenin, as it apparently did Dewey . The only thing possible is for these two to abolish those human ag encies that teach morality: the family and the church. Once that is done, it is then possible to offer mankind an alternative: the \"new morality.\" This thinking slowly emerged and evolved into what today is called \"Situation Ethics\" which teaches mat what is moral is determined by the individual and the situation in which the individua l is involved. It is expressed as follows: \"What is good for me may be e vil for you; what is right to do at one moment may be wrong the next.\" 13 And \"... whatever is the most loving in the situati on is the right and good thing. It is not excusably evil, it is positiv ely good.\" 1 * Professor Joseph Fletcher, an Episcopalian theologi an, wrote a book on the subject of situation ethics which includes the following statement: \"For me, there are no rules, none at all. Anything and e verything is right and wrong according to the situation. What is wrong in some cases would be right in others. And this candid approach is indeed a revolution in morals.\" 15 It was indeed a revolution in morals. It was the ne w morality that was consistent with the economic theories of Communism, the scientific theories of evolution, and the religious theories of atheism . A little twist to the morality of Situation Ethics was expressed by by Ernest Hemingway, the noted author. He has been quo ted as saying: \"I know only what is moral is what you feel good after and what is immoral is what you feel bad after.\" 16 (It was not explained by Hemingway how he would att empt to rational- ize the actions of a mad killer who killed because it gave him \"pleasure.\" It would also be interesting to see what Hemingway wou ld do if one of these \"pleasure\" seekers attempted to take his life.) The morality known as Situation Ethics has also per vaded the teaching of sex education in the schools of the United State s. One of the many lawsuits challenging what was taught in those courses was th e one brought in San Francisco by an ad hoc committee of parents and tea chers suing the State of California Board of Education to bar the teaching o f sex education when it teaches that there are no right and wrong values. The attorney for the plaintiff told the court: \"Thi s kind of teaching is summed up by the comment in a teachers' guide that says: \"We hope you have learned that there are no right and wrong answ ers. Each person has a 379"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 35 HUMANISM viewpoint that is right for them.\" 17 There are some who blame the high suicide rate amon g the young with the teaching of \"no-values\" sex education. The youn g student is taught that whatever he desires and believes will give him plea sure is proper to take, and when he does, the same society that he thought had taught him these values comes to punish him. This poses a frequently insurm ountable dilemma for the student who can see no other way out but suicid e. But such sexual freedom is not inconsistent with th e plans of the great planners. Aldous Huxley in his 1948 book entitled B rave New World explained the plan: \"As political and economic free dom diminishes, sexual freedom tends... to increase. And the dictator... w ill do well to encourage that freedom. In conjunction with the freedom to da ydream under the influence of dope, the movies, and the radio, it wi ll help to reconcile his subjects to the servitude which is their fate.\" 18 So Humanism has become the new religion to replace the traditional Judaic-Christian religions. In fact, the president of the American Humanist Association, Lloyd Morain, has stated that Humanism is \"... a religion without God, divine revelation or sacred scriptures .\" 19 The position that Humanism is a religion was confir med by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1965, when it ruled in the case of U.S. vs. Seeger: \"A humanistic... belief that is sincerely professed as a religion shall be entitled to recognition as religious under the Selective Ser vice Law.\" 20 And again, in the case of Torcase vs. Watkins, the Court ruled that: \"Among religions in the country which do not teach what would generally be considered a belief in the existence of God are Buddhism, Taoism, Ethical Culture, Secular Humanism and others.\" 21 So when Madlyn Murray O'Hair got the Supreme Court to remove the right of the children to open their school day with a simple prayer because she wished to separate \"Church and State,\" what she was doing was substituting one religion for another: a belief in God with a belief in Humanism. Mrs. O'Hair knew this because she had bee n the editor of the magazine, The Free Humanist, and was elected to the Board of the American Humanist Association in 1965, and was elected in 19 73 for a second four-year term. 22 Other humanists, or others who have expressed a fai th in the Humanist religion, include Walter Mondale, President Jimmy C arter's Vice President and the 1984 Democratic nominee for President. He i s on record as saying this about his religious beliefs: \"Although I have never formally joined a humanist society, I think I am a member by inherita nce. My preacher father was a humanist, and I grew up on a very rich diet o f humanism from him.

The Humanist Manifesto II, published forty years af ter the first Manifesto, basically reiterated the beliefs of the first Manifesto, but this time the Humanists called for \"... the building of a wor ld community,\" based upon: \"the development of a system of world law and a world order based upon transnational federal government.\" 24 The world government would need a world religion, a nd the Huma- nists were volunteering. 381"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"Chapter 36 Education Education is an important tool for training childre n in the knowledge of the past. The Bible, in Proverbs 22:6, tells why this is so: \"Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he wil l not depart from it.\" The Communist Party has also decided mat education is important to the furthering of their philosophy. Education becam e one of their concerns in the United States when they adopted the followin g as a party slogan in 1919: \"Give us one generation of small children to train to manhood and womanhood and we will set up the Bolshevist form of the Soviet Government.\" 1 Even Hitler of the National Socialist Party in Germ any sensed the importance of education. In a speech delivered in 1 939, he proclaimed: \"When an opponent declares: 'I will not come over t o your side,' I calmly say, 'Your child belongs to us already. What are you? Yo u will pass on. Your descendants, however, now stand in the new camp. In a short time they will know nothing else but this new community.' \" 2 Earlier, in 1937, he told the German people: \"This New Reich will give its youth to no one, but will itself take youth and give to youth its own education and its own upbringing.\" 3 382"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 36 EDUCATION This dedication to the training of the young in the ways of the collecd- vist was confirmed in 1932 when William Z. Foster, then National Chairman of the Communist Party, U.S.A., wrote a book entitl ed Toward a Soviet America in which he observed: \"Among the elementary measures the American Soviet government will adopt to further th e cultural revolution are the following: the schools, colleges and universiti es will be coordinated and grouped under a National Department of Education an d its state and local branches. The studies will be revolutionized, being cleansed of religious, patriotic and other features of bourgeois ideology. \" 4 Foster had aligned himself with the teachings of Ka rl Marx who wrote this plank in the Communist Manifesto to assist the Communists in communizing the \"most advanced countries:\" 10. Free education for all.... Marx, like Hitler, Lenin, and the Communist Party, U.S.A., realized that, if they could control the education of the yo ung, they could control the economic and social life the young would live under , and if all believed the same things, there would be no opposition to the st ate. This was confirmed by Bertrand Russell who wrote ab out an educator, Johann Fichte, who, Russell claimed: \"laid down tha t education should aim at destroying free will so that after pupils are th us schooled they will be incapable... of thinking or acting otherwise than a s their school masters would have wished.\" 5 Russell went on to explain elsewhere: \"Diet, inject ions, and injunctions will combine from a very early age to produce the s ort of character and the sort of beliefs that the authorities consider desir able, and any serious criticism of the powers that be will become psychologically i mpossible. Even if all are miserable, all will believe themselves to be happy, because the government will tell them that it is so.\" 6 The new pattern of using the schools to mold the ch aracter the govern- ment wants has been furthered by a national union o f school teachers, the National Education Association, (the NEA.) In one o f their reports, entitled \"Education for the 70's,\" the NEA wrote: Schools will become clinics whose purpose is to pro vide individualized, psycho-social treatment for the stu dent, and teachers must become psycho-social therapists. This will include biochemical and psychological med iadon of learning, as drugs are introduced experimentally to improve in the learner such qualities as personality, concentr ation and memory.

But it wasn't always this way. The Americans did not turn their children over to t he state to be educated by them in the beginning. In fact, the original schools in America were priva te, basically Christian schools where the children were taught by the paren ts or by teachers hired by the parents. The original textbook was the Bible, a nd all expenses were paid for by the parents who wished their children to be taught as the parents wished. Even America's founding fathers feared for the safe ty of their children by keeping the original government from the education of the young. James Madison, for one, voiced his opposition to th e use of government to teach children: \"If Congress can employ money in definitely to the general welfare... they may appoint teachers in every State ... The powers of Congress would subvert the very foundation, the ver y nature of the limited government established by the people of America.\" 8 But even then there were forces at work designing s tate or national educational plans for the American people. The firs t law of such a nature was passed in 1642 by the Massachusetts legislature whi ch required parents to teach their children to read the English language a nd to teach the principles of religion. 9 This law was followed by another in 1647 requiring cities of over 50 householders in population to teach chilren to read and write. Those communities with over 100 families or householders had to set up a grammar school, the first public schools in the United Stat es. 10 Thomas Jefferson, certainly a man of mixed principl es, submitted a bill to the Virginia legislature in 1779 that would have established a compulsory statewide public school system, but the Virginians were not accepting his proposal and refused to vote for the bill. But the remainder of the states, with the exception of Massachusetts, continued allowing the parents to teach their child ren without laws and public schools. There were those who persisted in their efforts to involve the federal (or state) government in the process of educating the c hildren of the nation. One of these was the \"father of modern socialism,\" Robe rt Owen. Mr. Owen, a supporter of the voluntary method of pr oving that socialism would work, started a special school for the children of the mill workers at his socialist experiment known as New La nark, Scotland. He started the education of these children at the age of one, but his attempts to teach socialism to the children of his workers fail ed when his socialist experiment failed. Mr. Owen came to the United States and in 1825 star ted another socialist 384"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 36 EDUCATION experiment, this time in New Harmony, Indiana. He c alled it \"the focus of enlightened atheism.\" 11 Owen, who believed that man's character had been \"d eformed by religious brainwashing,\" once again started his sch ool for the children of the millworkers, and once again, in 1826, the experimen t failed. The great lesson learned by Owens and his followers was that education had to precede the creation of a socialist society. In other words, the American people were not yet ready to accept socialism, and from that moment on, they decided that they would promote national public edu cation as the prelimi- nary step to socialism. 12 The Owenites realized that the children had to be separated from their parents so that they could be taught the merits of the socialist system. The educational process started a s soon as possible — age two was suggested — after they were removed from th eir parents. Owen realized that the parents were the primary force in teaching children the values of the society, and this practice had to cea se if socialism was to succeed in the United States. In 1829, one of Owens' supporters stated: \"The grea t object was to get rid of Christianity and to convert our churches into ha lls of science. The plan was to establish... national schools from which all religion was to be excluded, in which nothing was to be taught but suc h knowledge as is verifiable by the senses, and to which all parents were to be compelled by law to send their children... .\" 13 It was in 1829 that the \"Owenites went underground and organized their activities nationwide in the form of a secret socie ty in order to attain their goal of universal public education.\" 14 Whether or not it was due to the efforts of the Owe nite supporters or because of the efforts of others, the state of Mass achusetts created the Board of Education and appointed Horace Mann as the first Secretary of the Board in 1837, only eight years later. Mr. Mann toured the state, continuously preaching t he need for public education. His efforts were successful, so successf ul that he became known as the \"father of American public education.\" 15 Mann wrote: \"What the church has been for medieval man, the public school must become for democratic and rational man. God would be replaced by the concept of the public good.\" 16 In March of 1840, a bill was introduced in the Mass achusetts legislature to abolish the Board of Education. One of the suppo rters of the legislation told his fellow legislators: \"The idea of the State controlling education- .... seems ... a dangerous precedent [that] is grea tly to be feared, that any attempt to force all of our schools and all our tea chers upon one model would destroy all competition, all emulation, and even th e spirit of improvement itself.\" 17 385"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 36 EDUCATION The bill was defeated. Today the critics of public education are saying th ings like: \"The aim of education is no longer to impart facts and knowl edge.... The aim... is to change the social values of the child away from values that have tradition- ally been considered fixed, permanent or absolute.\" 18 John Dewey agreed with this assessment when he said that the schools: \"Take an active part in determining the social orde r of the future as the teachers align themselves with the forces making fo r social control of economic forces.\" 19 Dewey started his educational career in 1894 when h e was hired at the University of Chicago. It was here that he started his \"experimental or laboratory school.\" He worked here until 1904, when he resigned and moved to the Teacher's College at Columbia University. It was here that he was to have his greatest impact on the field of education. Dewey apparently never taught the young student him self but concen- trated on teaching the teachers. Today, twenty perc ent of all American school superintendents and forty percent of all teacher co llege heads have advanced degrees from Columbia where Dewey spent many years as the Department head. Dewey had the pleasure of teaching four of the five Rockefeller brothers, including David and Nelson. David also went to the University of Chicago to obtain a doctorate degree. Their grandfather, John D. Rockefeller, started the General Education Board, the forerunner to today's Rockefeller Founda tion, as a means of introducing the world of education to the wealthy. The Board's chairman, Frederick T. Gates, wrote: \"In our dreams, we have limitless resources and the people yield themselves with perfect docility t o our molding hands. The present educational conventions fade from our minds and, unhampered by tradition, we work our good will upon a grateful an d responsive rural folk....\" 20 Dewey's personal philosophy about atheism, socialis m, and evolution had their effect upon the entire campus of Columbia , not just through the school of Education. One student at Columbia, Whitt aker Chambers, who later became a member of the Communist Party, wrote this about his student days at the school: \"When I entered, I was conserva tive in my view of life and politics, and I was undergoing a religious experien ce. By the time I left, entirely by my own choice, I was no longer a conser vative and I had no religion.\" 21 Dewey's committment to socialism and communism beca me more real when, in 1905, the British Fabian Society opened an American branch known as the Intercollegiate Socialist Society. Joh n Dewey was one of its founders. In 1921, the Society changed its name to the League for Industrial 386"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 36 EDUCATION Democracy, and announced its purpose as \"education for a new social order based on production for use and not for profit.\" 22 Dewey later became the organization's president. Later, in the late 1920's, Dewey went to Russia to help organize a Marxist educational system. But even the Russian Co mmunist dictator Joseph Stalin couldn't tolerate Dewey's \"progressiv e education,\" and Dewey had to return to the United States. Dewey's student s in Russia were not so lucky, however, as Stalin banished all of them to S iberia. 23 Dewey's ideas have been accepted by the American go vernment, however, for in 1969, the Commission of Mental Heal th and Children issued a report which stated: \"The school as the major soc ializing agency in the community must assume a direct responsibility for t he attitudes and values of child development.\" 27 In the United States, the family or the church has been the traditional agency for the teaching of the values to the child. It was apparent that the family unit and religious teaching had to be destro yed so that the school could become the new teacher of the values to the c hild. The Communist Party in 1968 stated the problem precisely: \"In car rying the burden of tending for the children, individual mothers bear a respons ibility that properly falls on society and government.\" 25 The problem for the planners then became one of rem oving the mother from the home so that the child could be taught by the state. One of the greatest tools that the planners have is inflation, which causes the husband to ask his wife to join in the money-making endeavo rs of the family. This men poses the additional problem for the parents: h ow do they tend for the child who is now at home without the mother? The government then steps forward with the solution to the problem that it created: it offers the struggling family a day care center for the child. And the child becomes the ward of the state at an e ven earlier age than before. Others assist the destruction of the family by enco uraging the mother to leave the home. The new move to \"liberate\" the wife from the tedious tasks of homemaking are intended to leave the young child at home without parental supervision. The \"women's liberation\" move ment is sometimes even unwittingly supporting the intentional movemen t of the wife out of the home. In addition, the planners also put pressure on thos e parents who decide to place their children in private schools which do not teach atheism, humanism or evolution. These parents cause the plan ners many problems, one of which was pointed out by former Harvard Univ ersity President James B. Conant, who stated: I do believe, however, there is some reason to fear lest a dual system of secondary education may in some states, a t least, come to 387"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 36 EDUCATION threaten the democratic unity provided by our publi c schools. I refer to the desire of some people to increase th e scope and number of private schools.... To my mind, our schools serve all creeds. The great er the portion of our youth who attend independent schools , the greater the threat to our democratic unity. 26 Mr. Conant apparently didn't explain how the public schools could serve all creeds when in America's public schools t oday one party has the right to have the schools exclude something that th ey feel is in violation of their religious or non-religious beliefs. Take, for instance, the deletion of prayer in schools because it offended the atheist M adlyn Murray O'Hair. The situation that allows someone to remove a teach ing from the schools because it offends the values or a religiou s belief of either the family or an individual was written about by a minister na med A.A. Hodge, in 1887: It is capable of exact demonstration that, if every party in the state has the right of excluding from the public wh atever he does not believe to be true, then he that believes most must give way to him that believes least, and then he that believes least must give way to him that believes absolutely nothing, no matter how small a minority the atheists or the agnostics may be. It is self-evident that on this scheme, if it is co nsistently and persistently carried out in all parts of the countr y, the United States system of national popular education will be the mo st efficient and wide instrument for the propagation of Atheism whic h the world has ever seen. 27 The government is assisting those who wish to elimi nate the option that remains to the objecting parents: the private schoo l. For instance, on May 20, 1979, the Supreme Court struck down legislation tha t gave parents a tax break should they opt to send their children to a p rivate school, hence requiring those parents to pay for their children's education twice: once to the public schools and then again to the private sc hool. The next problem for the planners is to decide just when the education of the child should begin. In 1974, N.E.A. President James Harris urged in an editorial that \"money now spent... must be quadrupled in order... to provide for public education at the age of 3.\" 28 The N.E.A.'s Forecast for the 70's indicated that t he age that education should start should be moved to an earlier date. Th ey stated: \"As non-school, pre-school programs begin to operate, educators wil l assume a formal responsibility for children when they reach the age of two.\" 29 Dr. Robert C. Wood, a member of the Council on Fore ign Relations, 388"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 36 EDUCATION and the President of the University of Massachusett s, urged that the age be moved even lower: \"The state educational system [mu st] expand its teaching to children between the ages of one and five, becau se the family is failing to perform its function. Wood said that the family is continuing to fail in its responsibility to prepare children for schools and urged more early nursery schools and day care programs.\" 30 Not wishing to be outdone, President Richard Nixon moved the date even further. He \"declared the first five years of a child's life to be a period of special and specific federal concern.\" 31 It could very well be that those who wish to get th e children away from their parents will use the discoveries of an organi zation called the Educa- tional Resource Services Center. They have conclude d that children between the ages of four to six months can learn to read be fore they can talk or walk. 32 Parents who believe that their children belong to t hem had best be concerned about this information before the educato rs decide that they should start teaching young children to read by tak ing them away from their parents at the age of four mondis. The question of what happens to the parents who ref use to send their children to schools that teach values other than th ose that they want taught is the next logical question that must be asked. In the fall of 1970, six children were removed from their parents and placed in a foster home because the parents refused to send them to a public school teaching \"sex education\" in conflict with th eir religious beliefs. 33 In 1972, a father lost his daughter when he refused to allow her to be bussed into what he perceived was a high crime area . The judge fined the father. 34 And recently, in August of 1981, a pastor's childre n were forced to go back to the school he had taken them out of because he felt the school was exposing his children to homosexuality and drugs in violation of his religions beliefs. 35 These actions seem to be in accord with the positio n taken by German White, an official with the U.S. Office of Child De velopment who said: \"Parents don't mean to be incompetent but they are, and the remedy is federal establishment of acceptable standards of child-rais ing.\" 36 If the parents are thought to be incompenent they t hen are not capable of bringing up the children, and the state must rep lace them with state- approved parents. These new parents are called teachers. These state-approved parents also have two unions. They are called the National Education Association (the NEA) and the Am erican Federation of Teachers (the AFT).

Local financing of public schools; 3. Parental supervision of textbooks; 4. Taxation programs that remove the obligation for pa yment of taxes from the homeowner; and 5.

A former N.E.A. president,. Katherine Barrett, has said that \"the teacher will be the con veyor of values, a philo- sopher. Teachers no longer will be victims of chang e; we will be agents of change.\" 40 Lenin certainly agreed with this position when he s aid: \"Only by radically remolding the teaching, organization and training of the youth shall we be able to ensure that the efforts of the younger generation will result in the creation of a society that will be unlike th e old society, i.e., in the creation of a communist society.\" 41 The N.E.A. has an answer for the teachers who figur e this out and try to stay within the system to change things.

They might find fulfillment as tap-dance instructors... but they da mage teaching, children, and themselves by staying in the classroom.\" 42 The other teachers' union is called the American Fe deration of Teachers (the A.F.T.). This organization received early support from the C ommunist Party of the United States in May, 1937: \"It can be seen fro m this how important it is to build the American Federation of Teachers,\" and again: \"The task of the Communist Party must be first and foremost to arous e the teachers to class- consciousness and to organize them into the America n Federation of Teachers.... The American Federation of Teachers mu st concern itself primarily with the immediate problems of the teache r (salary, tenure, acadamic freedom, etc.).... The American Federation of Teachers is now launching a broad legislative campaign for federal aid to education [in 1937]...\" 43 The total essence of education and its connecdon wi th Humanism was summarized by Charles Francis Potter in his book Hu manism, a New Religion: \"Education is thus a most powerful ally o f Humanism, and every American public school is a school of Humanism. Wha t can the theistic Sunday-schools, meeting for an hour once a week and teaching only a fraction of the children, do to stem the tide of a five-day program of humanistic teaching.\" 44 But there is even a more sinister purpose behind ed ucation today. This was detailed by Dr. Medford Evans, who wrote that \" ... government schools make it a matter of policy to spend as much money a s possible, and impart as little knowledge as possible since spending demo nstrates power while keeping the scholars ignorant monopolizes power in the hands of the government insiders.\" 45 391"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"Chapter 37 Victories On November 16, 1956, Russian Communist Nikita Khru shchev spoke to the American people.

These defeats were: 1. The Soviet Negro Republic in America: The first attempt to establish a separate republic for the Negro in America within t he borders of the United States came with the publication of a small pamphle t entitled American Negro Problems in 1928 by John Pepper, an alias for a Russian representa- tive named Joseph Pogany. Stalin saw the possibilit ies of causing such a situation to exist where the United States governme nt would have to deal with a separate nation inside its borders, and he s ent Pogany to America to start the move towards a revolution to establish th is republic. A second pamphlet was published in 1935. It was cal led The Negroes in a Soviet America and was published by the Communist Party. It too called for the establishment of a Soviet Negro Republic, a nd a revolution to expropriate the lands of the capitalists. This Repu blic was to include major cities in Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabam a, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee. After the Republic was created, it w ould then apply to the Russian government to recognize its right to self-d etermination. One of the Negroes who saw through this revolution was Manning Johnson who had been a Communist for ten years befo re he resigned. He had risen to the highest position inside the Communist Party that a Negro could rise to, a position on the National Negro Commissio n of the Communist Party, U.S.A. He became concerned that the Party was not interest ed in helping the black people but was attempting to involve them in a bloody revolution in which as many as five million blacks would the. He wrote a book entitled Color, Communism and Commo n Sense, in 1958, as his way of warning the negroes of the dang er of the plans the Party had for them. Mr. Johnson paid for his attempt to w arn the American people with his life, as he died under rather questionable circumstances less than one year later. Another Negro Communist, Leonard Patterson, testifi ed on November 18, 1950, that he saw a bigger stake involved in th e Party's attempts to establish a Soviet Negro Republic. He warned: \"I le ft the Communist Party because I became convinced... that the Communist Pa rty was only inter- ested in promoting among the Negro people a nationa l liberational movement that would aid the Communist Party in its efforts to create a Proletarian revolution in the United States that wo uld overthrow the government by force and violence through bloody ful l-time revolution, and substitute it with a Soviet form of government with a dictatorship of the proletariat.\" 4 In any event, the Communists were not allowed to pu ll off their 393"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 37 VICTORIES revolution and the South still belongs to the Unite d States. 2. Civilian Police Review Boards: It was the intent of the conspiracy in this country to start a program to move the control of A merica's police depart- ments to a central police force controlled by the n ational government. The vehicle to be used for this transfer of control was the charge of \"police brutality\" artificially created around the nation b y the Communists and Communist sympathizers. The plan was to encourage various cities around the nation to take control of the process whereby the police themselve s investigate the charges against them and place that control in the hands of a group of government- appointed citizens. This then would ultimately tran sfer the investigation of these charges into the hands of the federal governm ent, and they would ultimately control the local police forces around t he nation. These efforts to centralize the control of the loca l police forces were diwarted by a nationwide organization called the Su pport Your Local Police Committee, which organized small chapters all over the United States to promote the concept of keeping the local police for ces independent. This organization created the bumper sticker \"Support yo ur local police and keep them independent\" as a means of educating the Ameri can people. 3. Martin Luther King: One of Martin Luther King's purposes was to foment civil strife in an attempt to divide the Ame rican people. Dr. King's effectiveness in these efforts was sever ely damaged by the courageous efforts of a Negro woman named Julia Bro wn. She had spent more than nine years inside the Communist Party bef ore she had surfaced to speak out about Dr. King's connections to the Commu nist movement in the United States. Mrs. Brown was saying: \"We [in the Communist Party] were also told to promote Martin Luther King to unite Negroes and whites behind him — He was taking directions from Communists. I know fo r a fact the Commu- nists would never have promoted him, financed him, and supported him if they couldn't trust him. I am certain as I can be t hat he knew what he was doing!\" 5 A nationwide organization of local committees was f ormed called the Truth About Civil Turmoil (TACT) and it promoted Mr s.

In fact, her speeches in the South were arranged to precede those of Dr. King, and because of the charges she was mak ing, Dr. King began cancelling his appearances all over the South whene ver she was to speak before him. 4.

Senator Jesse Helms identified this source in 1973: \"At cru cial stages in its develop- ment, AIM has been given material and moral assista nce from the very federal government it is attacking.\" 8 AIM had received at least $400,000 in grants from t he Federal Office of Economic Opportunity. 9 To explain just what AIM's purposes were, Mr. Durha m went on a speaking tour of some sixty engagements in South Da kota and surrounding states. AIM never disrupted the Bicentennial in 1976. Mr. Durham told the people the truth about AIM, and AIM withered. 5. Reies Lopez Tijerina: Mr. Tijerina, with a heavi ly armed revolutionary band, seized control of a town in Northern New Mexi co in 1967. His purpose was to create an independent nation of Mexican Amer icans and Indians and then appeal to the United Nations. As in the case o f the Negro Soviet Republic, the plan was to separate out a part of th e United States and create an independent nation. A speaking tour was arranged for the author Alan St ang for the area around Northern New Mexico, and about one million o f his articles on the subject were distributed to the citizens of the are a. Once again, a courageous speaker exposed the truth about a program, and Mr. Tijerina's plans didn't materialize. 6. Cesar Chavez: Cesar Chavez' purpose was to \"...u nite American agricultural workers in a single union under the co ntrol of revolutionary leaders — known Marxists and identified Communists. The goal, simply put, [was] control of America's food supply.\" 10 Once control of the food supply was obtained, Cesar 's union could strike during the picking season, forcing America t o agree to nearly any 395"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 37 VICTORIES terms or face the alternative of starvation. The Los Angeles Times reported from whom Chavez was receiving his operating funds: \"So far most of the Mexican-Americ an civil rights activities have been tunneled through War on Poverty [a progra m of the United States government] programs and through such organizations as the Ford Foundation.\" 11 Chavez's union specifically received over $250,000 from the Federal Office of Economic Opportunity. 12 In fact, Chavez had received at least ten million dollars during his twelve years of organizi ng efforts. 13 Someone thought his efforts were worth supporting. Some of the others that supported Chavez were the \" labor unions controlled by Walter Reuther, Black Nationalist cof fers under the control of Stokely Carmichael, the Communist Party, the Nation al Council of Churches... and the Federal Office of Economic Oppo rtunity.\" 14 The corollary purpose of Chavez's union was to spre ad the cause of revolution. His National Farm Workers Association ( NFWA) had issued a Worker's Manifesto, which read, in part: \"We shall strike. We shall pursue the revolution we have proposed. We are sons of the Mexican revolution, a revolution of the poor seeking bread and justice. O ur revolution will not be armed, but we want a new social order... We say tha t we are going to continue fighting until we the or we win. We shall overcome.\" 15 In June, 1966, a speaker's tour was arranged for Me l O'Campo, one of Chavez's lieutenants who broke from the organizatio n to expose Chavez' activities. And copies of an article by Gary Allen entitled \"The Grapes — Communist Wrath in Delano\" were distributed in larg e quantities wherever Mr. O'Campo spoke. Mr. Chavez' efforts quickly became fruitless. 7. Gun Registration or Confiscation: One of the maj or victories in the fight against the Conspiracy is the continuing success ag ainst those who wish to disarm the American public. There are many who beli eve that one of the reasons that John Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King were assassinated by gunfire was to dev elop popular support for legislation to either register or confiscate the we apons of the American citizen. Each time, however, these efforts have fai led, primarily because of the lobbying efforts of an organization called the Nati onal Rifle Association. The reason that this organization has become the la rgest lobbying organization in the United States is primarily beca use these gun owners fear government, the only agency that can violate human rights. They take the position that the Second Amendment to the Constitut ion (\"A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free S tate, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,\") mea ns exactly that: Congress shall pass no law confiscating the weapons of the c itizens. 396"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 37 VICTORIES 8. The NRA was to become an \"Ecology\" organization: Because of the success of the NRA, efforts have been made to chann el their lobbying efforts into some other area. The effort to move the NRA into the ecology movemen t and out of the lobbying movement occurred in 1977. One of those wh o fought the change in directions said: \"The organization was trying to dump and-gun control activities in exchange for financial support from s everal foundations, including the Ford Foundadon.\" 16 One of the prime movers for this move into the area of support for ecology legisladon was Robert O. Anderson, Presiden t of ARCO (Atlantic Richfield Company) and a Director of the Council on Foreign Relations. 17 These efforts to move the NRA failed because enough members and other concerned citizens put pressure on the proper authorities in the organizadon to make certain that they did not chang e their direcdon. 9. The Equal Rights Amendment: This Constituional A mendment, feared by some of its opponents as one of the greatest gra bs of federal power in the history of the United States, is nearly through. It quickly sailed through the legislatures of twenty-two states the first year (t hree of which later rescinded their action by a vote of the state legislature) bu t since 1975 only one state has ratified. The Amendment died when the time allotted to ratify it expired in June of 1982. It got into trouble when some of the women it was supposedly intended to help read the Amendment and discovered that it had some very serious defects in it. These women organized, becam e active in lobbying against it, and were successful in keeping their re spective state legislatures from ratifying the Amendment. There were some who voiced their opposition to the Amendment because they came to believe that its true purpose was to effectively shut down those American industries that traditionally hired more males than females, such as the mining industry. This line of thinking contended that after the pass age of the Amend- ment, the male dominated industries would have to h ire the correct percen- tage of female workers: if fifty percent of the wor kers in the community were women, the mines would have to have the same percen tage. If they had less, it would become prima facie evidence that the mines were guilty of past sexual discrimination, and they would have to shut down until they reached the correct percentage. If the industry had difficulty in securing the addi donal female workers, it would not consdtute reason enough to re-open. Am erica's industry would have to find them. This \"quota system\" would effecdvely shut down Amer ica's normally male dominated industries.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administrati on (OSHA): This Federal agency, created by Congress in 1973, had th e ability to enter the premises of any American business ostensibly to mak e a safety inspection to protect the working public. Those who have studied the law that created OSHA cl aimed that the law not only violated at least three amendments of the Constitution, it also granted the agency, a part of the Executive branch of government, the ability to make and interpret law. This power violated the separation of powers doctrine of the founding fathers who granted only C ongress the power to make laws and only the Judicial branch the power to interpret them. It took the courageous effort of one American busin essman, Bill Barlow of Pocatello, Idaho, to challenge OSHA's right to i nspect his business place. Mr. Barlow contended that the Fourth Amendment to t he Constitution (\"The right of the people to be secure in their per sons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, su pported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized,\") required that OSH A must first secure a court- issued warrant before they could enter his premises . Mr. Barlow took his case all the way to the Supreme Court and won! The Court correctly agreed with him. OSHA had lost its bite! 11. Miscellaneous Laws or Treaties Not Passed or Si gned: Some of the laws and treaties that weren't passed or signed, but whi ch were deemed to be important to the Conspiracy, were The Genocide Trea ty, The Child Care Bill, Atlantic Union, Post Card Voter Registration, The Consumer Protec- tion Agency, and The Common Situs Picketing Act. The majority of these bills were defeated by a seri es of letter-writing campaigns to Congressman and Senators urging that t hey vote against the proposed legislation. But the greatest victory of all has yet to be consi dered. 398"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"Chapter 38 The Greatest Victory The greatest victory of all in the battle between t he Conspiracy and those who love their freedoms was the failure of the Cons piracy to impose total government down on the American people on either Ma y 1, 1976, (the two- hundredth anniversary of the founding of the Illumi nati,) or on July 4, 1976, (the two-hundredth anniversary of the founding of t he United States.) The foundations for this revolutionary act were lai d down in a plan made public in the February, 1946, issue of the New World News, a publica- tion of the Moral Re-Armament of England. It has been claimed mat what has been called the \"D usseldorf Rules for Revolution\" were first discovered in Dusseldorf, Ge rmany, in the headquar- ters of a revolutionary organizadon by some Allied soldiers after World War I. However, these claims have never been verified, at least to the satisfaction of many historians. In any event, these rules laid down an incredible p lan to bring about the condidons that would lead to a revoludon: A. Corrupt the young; get them away from religion. Get them interested in sex. Make them superficial; destroy t heir ruggedness. B. Get control of all means of publicity, thereby: 399"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 38 THE GREATEST VICTORY 1. Get people's minds off their government by focusing their attention on athletics, sexy books and plays and ot her trivialities. 2. Divide the people into hostile groups by constantly harping on controversial matters of no importance. 3. Destroy the people's faith in their natural leaders by holding the latter up to contempt, ridicule and disgrace. 4. Always preach true democracy, but seize power as fa st and ruthlessly as possible. 5. By encouraging government extravagence, destroy its credit, produce fear of inflation with rising prices and ge neral discontent 6. Incite unnecessary strikes in vital industries, enc ourage civil disorders and foster a lenient and soft attitude on the part of the government toward such disorders. C. Cause the registration of all firearms on some pretext, with a view to confiscating them and leaving the population hel pless. 1 The Conspiracy apparently felt that these programs had succeeded in the main and mat it was time to move towards their goal of total government. One of the requirements for the plan to succeed, as envisioned by the planners, was a generation of young people, not onl y turned off by the establishment, but trained in guerilla warfare and the desire to rebel against the system. The major factor in creating this attit ude amongst the young people of America was the Vietnamese War, created a nd controlled by the Conspiracy to create the conditions required for it s plan to succeed: the war was to create first a drug culture in America and, secondly, a young society willing to rebel against the American government. Jerry Rubin, one of the young rebels created by the establishment and the founder of a group called the Yippies, has writ ten a book entitled Do It!, in which he details his interest and concerns about the rebellious age in which he lived. He dedicated his book to: \"Nancy, Dope, Color TV, a nd Violent Revolution\" and admonished his readers to: \"Read th is book stoned [high on drugs]\"! Rubin admitted that the Vietnamese war was phony: \" The Amerikans [sic] are fighting for nothing you can see, feel, t ouch or believe in. Their deaths are futile and wasted. 'Why the on Hamburger Hill?' asks the pot- smoking Amerikan [sic] soldier, as he points his gu n at the head of the captain who ordered him to take a hill.... Vietnam is a symbol. The real Viet Kong [sic] are in San Diego.\" 2 He realized that the real war was being fought, not in Vietnam, but in the cities and towns of America. 400"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 38 THE GREATEST VICTORY He commented about the real purpose of the drug cal led marijuana- \"Marijuana is the Communist drug.\" He wrote this about the new morality called Situati on Ethics: \"Yippies say if it's not fun, don't do it. We see sex, rock 'n roll and dope as part of a Communist plot to take over Amerika [sic]. The Yipp ie idea of fun is overthrowing the government. Yippies are Maoists.\" (supporters of the Chinese Communist Mao Tse Tung). It is revealing that even though Jerry's book is in opposition to the establishment, it was published by a major publishi ng company that is part of the establishment: Ballantine Books, by arrangem ent with Simon & Schuster. The beginning of the end of the Conspiracy's plans occurred during the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago. Viewers of t hat event will recall a small group of hippies-yippies turned to the street s, getting arrested for violating Chicago's laws. Jerry Rubin admitted that he was disappointed by the small turnout of these young people: \"We once d reamed 500,000 people would come to Czechago [Jerry's spelling of Chicago ]. We expected 50,000. Maybe 2,000 to 3,000 freaks... made it.\" It is very revealing that Mr. Rubin used the figure of 500,000 as the number of protestors he hoped would respond to the call in Chicago. This was the exact number of people needed in two relate d incidents. Colonel Edward Mandell House needed a 500,000 man a rmy to enable Philip Dru to take over the Presidency and impose a dictatorship on the American people in his book Philip Dru, Administrat or. And 500,000 was the number of soldiers that Major G eneral Smedley Butler was to command as he imposed a dictatorship on America in 1933. Apparently those who believe that America should ha ve a dictatorship instead of a Presidency feel it will take 500,000 p rotestors to convince the American people to accept the change at the top. It is the theory of some that Chicago was a test to see how many people could be drawn to an event where mere were going to be protests and in this case, the young people disappointed the Conspiracy: not enough of them came to Chicago. It is the theory of some that it w as here that the Conspiracy started revising its plans. Rubin admitted that the events at Chicago were plan ned: \"We wanted disruption. We planned it. We were not innocent vic tims. We worked our plans for a year before we came here. We made our d emands so outrageous because we wanted the city to deny us what we were asking. We did all of this with one purpose in mind — to make the city react a s if it were a police state.\" 3 The use of students for disruptive purposes was not new. The eleventh edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, published in 1911, described one 401"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 38 THE GREATEST VICTORY attempt to use the young radicals for particular pu rposes, in Russia: Among the students of the universities and the high er techni- cal schools, Turgenev [a Russian writer] had notice d a new and strikingly original type — young men and women in s lovenly attire, who called in question and ridiculed the ge nerally received convictions and respectable conventionalities of so cial life and who talked of reorganizing society on strictly scientif ic principles. They reversed the traditional order of tilings in t rivial matters of external appearance, the males allowing their ha ir to grow long and the female adepts cutting it short, and adding sometimes the additional badge of blue spectacles... Their appearance, manners, and conversation were ap t to shock ordinary people, but to this they were profou ndly indifferent, for they had raised themselves above the level of s o-called public opinion, despised Philistine respectability and rat her liked to scandalize people still under the influence of what they considered antiquated prejudices. For aesthetic culture, sentimentalism and refinemen t of every kind they had a profound and undisguised contempt. Among the antiquated institutions which had to be a bolished as obstructions to real progress, were religion, fa mily life, private property and centralized administration. Religion was to be replaced by exact sciences, fami ly life by free love, private property by collecdvism, and cen tralized adminis- tration by a federation of independent communes.... \" 4 But even this example was not isolated. Economist L udwig von Mises, who was in Germany prior to World War I, wrote: In the decade preceding the First World War, German y... wit- nessed the appearance of a phenomenon hitherto unhe ard of, the youth movement. Turbulent gangs of untidy boys and girls roamed the country, making much noise and shirking their school lessons .... 5 In other words, even the outlandish garb of the mod ern hippie or Jerry Rubin's Yippies was something that was used to caus e divisions among populations in earlier times. These radicals, in pr e-revolutionary Russia and pre-World War I Germany, were being used by the est ablishment to condi- tion the people to radical change. Such was the cas e in 1968, in the United States. Rubin admitted as much, that he knew the young peop le were being used. He wrote: \"Revolution is profitable. So the c apitalists try to sell it.\" 402"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 38 THE GREATEST VICTORY And: \"The hip capitalists have some allies within t he revolutionary community: longhairs who work as intermediaries bet ween the kids on the street and the millionaire businessmen.\" Rubin also knew that there was another group who kn ew the young people were being used. He identified that group as well: \"The hippies see us as politicos and the politicos see us as hippies . Only the right wing sees us for what we are.\" One of the groups making up the \"revolutionary comm unity\" was a group known as the Students for a Democratic Societ y. It was well known by the establishment that they were Communist in natur e. In fact, an article in March 1969 reported: \"'Our primary task is to build a Marxist-Leninist revolutionary movement,' declared Michael Klonsky, executive secretary of the Students for a Democratic Society.\" 6 The government through the House Internal Security Committee's Report on SDS' plans for America's High Schools, st udied the SDS in great detail. The Chairman of the Committee, Congressman Richard Ichord, stated that: \"The aims of the SDS were spelled out in an SDS position paper printed in June, 1969: 'The goal is the destruction of US imperialism and the achievement of a classless world: world communism.' \" 7 In 1980, an FBI agent said the group was bent on co mmitting \"arsons, bombings, assassinations — with the goal of overthr owing this country's democratic form of government, with the objective o f establishing world Communism.\" 8 Yet in spite of all of this evidence about the natu re of the SDS, they continued to receive money from the establishment t hey were supposedly out to overthrow. In 1970, a group of Ohio legislators received a briefing on campus upheavals in which they heard: \"... an Illin ois commission report on that state's rioting said that $192,000 in Feder al money and $85,000 in Carnegie Foundation funds were paid to [the] Studen ts for a Democratic Society... during the fall of 1969.\" 9 Another similar report came from a former undercove r police intelli- gence operative who had participated in SDS demonst rations, David Gumaer, who reported that he had: \"wondered where t he money was coming from for all this activity, and soon discovered it came through radicals via the United Nations, from the Rockefeller Foundation, th e Ford Foundation, United Auto Workers, as well as cigar boxes of Amer ican money from the Cuban embassy.\" 10 Another student, James Kirk, confirmed Gumaer's rep ort. Kirk, while a student at the University of Chicago, and on behalf of the FBI, became active in the SDS, the W.E.B. DuBois Club, the Black Panth ers, and the Commu- nist Party. In 1969, Mr. Kirk broke from the Party and the following year testified before the House and Senate Internal Secu rity Committees. His testimony was as follows: \"Young people... have no idea that they are 403"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 38 THE GREATEST VICTORY playing into the hands of the Establishment they cl aim to hate. The radicals think they're fighting the forces of the super-rich , like Rockefeller and Ford and don't realize that it is precisely such forces which are behind their own revolution, financing it, and using it for their ow n purposes.\" 11 Still another student, James Simon Kunen, in his bo ok entitled The Strawberry Incident, tells about a SDS strategy mee ting he attended in which a student was giving a report on an SDS convention that he had recently attended. The student reported that \"... men from B usiness International Roundtables,... tried to buy up a few radicals. The se men are the world's industrialists and they convene to decide how our l ives are going to go. They're the left wing of the ruling class. They off ered to finance our demonstrations in Chicago. We were also offered ESS O [Rockefeller] money. They want us to make a lot of radical commotion so they can look more in the center as they move more to the left.\" 12 Even the Black Panther leader Eldridge Cleaver star ted to figure it out, that the wealthy were buying themselves a revolutio n. In the introduction to Rubin's book Do It!, Mr. Cleaver wrote: \"There is a danger to the healthy development of the American Revolution in the fact that often revolutionar- ies are manipulated by the ruling class to appear t o be a bigger threat than they really are.\" 13 Jerry Rubin further amplified Mr. Cleaver's thought s about how the establishment made the revolution appear to be larg er than it actually was. In chapter ten of his book, enutled Every Revolutio nary Needs a Color TV, Rubin says: \"Walter Cronkite is SDS's best organize r. Uncle Walter brings out the map of the U.S. with circles around the cam puses that blew up today. The battle reports. Every kid out mere is thinking, 'Wow, I wanna see my campus on that map.' TV is raising generations of k ids who want to grow up and become demonstrators. Television proves the dom ino theory: one campus falls and they all fall. The media does not report 'news,' it creates it.'\" But even though it appeared that the Establishment would not be able to gather an army big enough to disrupt the Bicente nnial, the plans continued. In 1971, an organization was formed that later chan ged its name to the People's Bicentennial Commission (the PBC.) Jeremy Rifkin became its director. Later, the Senate Internal Seurity Subcommittee inv estigated the PBC They reported: \"The New York Times, for example, on May 26, 1975, earned an article by Jeremy Rifkin on the subject of econo mic freedom. This article was basically a rewrite of the PBC's declaration of economic independence which calls for the elimination of the free-enterpr ise system or the 'corporate system' as they call it.\" 14 404"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 38 THE GREATEST VICTORY Rifkin had made his views known to the public when he wrote the following in a radical newspaper in November, 1971: \"A genuine under- standing of the revolutionary ideals is what links Thomas Paine, Sam Adams, Benjamin Rush and the American people with L enin, Mao [Tse Tung], and Che [Guevara], and the struggle of all o ppressed people in the world.\" 15 A further warning that the nation appeared to be pr eparing for trouble on July 4, 1976, was given by FBI director Clarence Kelley who reported on November 4, 1975, that: \"terrorism will increase in connection with the nation's Bicentennial celebration.\" The PBC continued, however, with its plans and issu ed an eight-page tabloid newspaper calling for 150,000 patriots to j oin with them in Washing- ton D.C. on July 4, 1976, to \"Declare your independ ence from big business.\" They advised the reader that the PBC was \"planning a birthday party America will never forget.\" Other individuals lined up in support of the PBC de claration. The tabloid reported that Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter, Jan e Fonda, Rev. Jesse Jackson, and Dr. Benjamin Spock, among others, woul d be speaking at the PBC rally on that day. The costs of these activities were being met, at le ast in part, by the establishment once again, as, according to Human Ev ents in its issue of October 11, 1975, the federally funded National End owment for the Human- ities had provided the PBC with nearly $400,000. But the PBC did not make much of a ripple on July 4 , 1976, as it was unable to draw nearly the number of people it would have taken to cause the incident that the establishment wanted. In addition to the plans to disrupt the Bicentennia l, there was a movement inside the United States to call a constit utional convention. One of those urging a re-write of the Constitution was Zbigniew Brzezinski, who wrote the following on page 258 of his book Between Two Ages: \"The approaching two-hundredth anniversary of the Declar ation could justify the call for a national constitutional convention to re -examine the nation's formal institutional framework. Either 1976 or 1989 could serve as a suitable target date...\" Confirmation that something was planned to happen w as supported, in part, by the John Birch Society, which printed the following in the October, 1977, Bulletin to its members: \"There came into our hands several months ago, through the kindness of some friend who eviden tly wanted to remain anonymous, one of [Clarence Douglas] Dillon's thin papers mat apparently are quietly issued now and then to members of the e chelons below him, who need such information and guidance as a basis of su pport.\" 16 The Birch Society reasoned that whatever Mr. Dillon knew was impor- 405"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 38 THE GREATEST VICTORY tant enough to be known to those who were trying to expose the Conspiracy Mr. Dillon, they reasoned, was one of the those who should know the plans of the conspiracy, as he was the head of the intern ational banking firm of Dillon, Read and Company, and Chairman of the Rocke feller Foundation. In addition, Mr. Dillon had served as Secretary of the Treasury, certainly one of the positions in the American government control led by the Rockefeller interests, for a period of four years in the Kenned y and Johnson administra- tions, as well as being a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Mr. Dillon's letter, according to the Birch Society , revealed two very important facts: \"One was that up until about 1970 many of the Insiders (although he did not call them that) had kept on ho ping to make 1976 the successful target date for the ceremonial inaugurat ion of their new world order. But, Mr. Dillon then proceeded to point out, by 1970 this schedule had been conceded by the top command to be impracticabl e. And he went on to lay down the new schedule, already in effect, which would require about fifteen years for completion.\" 17 This meant that the Conspiracy was planning for som ething to occur on or about 1985, fifteen years, give or take a year o r two, from the change in their plans in 1970. The specific date of 1985 seemed to be in accord wi th the date being given by the Russian Communists. For instance, Sovi et Communist Party chief Leonid Breshnev, in 1973, said this about the year 1985: \"We Commu- nists have got to string along with the capitalists for a while. We need their credits, their agriculture, and their technology. B ut we are going to continue massive military programs and by the middle eightie s (1985?) we will be in a position to return to a much more aggressive fore ign policy designed to gain the upper hand in our relationship with the We st.\" Emphasis added.) 18 He was more precise about the choice of years in a speech he made in Prague in 1973 to the Warsaw Pact leaders: \"Trust u s, comrades, for by 1985, as a consequence of what we are now achieving with detente, we will have achieved most of our objectives in Western Europe. We will have consoli- dated our position. We will have improved our econo my. And a decisive shift in the correlation of forces will be such that, com e 1985, we will be able to exert our will wherever we need to.\" 19 Breshnev didn't say just how they were going to exe rt their will, but one version of what they might attempt came from Senato r Barry Goldwater in August, 1971, according to the Los Angeles Herald E xaminer, which headlined the article: \"Goldwater Warns of Nuclear Blackmail by Russ. The article went on: \"Senator Barry Goldwater said Saturday the world balance of power has shifted to the Soviet Union to such an extent that international nuclear blackmail is no longer imposs ible. 'The only conclu- sion is that the Soviet Union is out to establish a strategic military superiority 406"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 38 THE GREATEST VICTORY so vast that it cannot be challenged and so that an y policy the Soviet Union may decide upon can be backed with overwhelming str ength.'\" 20 So, according to the scenario just described, it wo uld appear that the Russians, who have been slowly but steadily buildin g the most potent military machine in the world and a nuclear superio rity over the forces of the free West, (with the assistance of the United State s,) could threaten the United States with a nuclear war This would force the Amer ican government into a position of having to decide whether they wished to go to war or accept some Russian ultimatum. Other indications that 1985 might be the year for s uch a confrontation come from a variety of sources. One is the book entitled The Third World War, Augus t, 1985, by General Sir John Hackett and six of his colleagues, all retired NATO officers. This book was written in 1973, and contai ns the \"dramatized game- plan for the next World War.\" 21 The book details how the Soviet Union started the w ar on November 11, 1984, after \"the initial workers' riots in Poland.\" 22 The war develops and ultimately the Soviet Union is defeated, less than a month after it started. There were warnings that the United States has been so strategically depleted to the point where it is in great danger. One such warning came in 1980 from fifty retired admirals and generals who w arned that America was \"in greater danger today than at any time since Pea rl Harbor.\" In fact, one individual, Henry Kissinger, is report edly on record as saying that it probably was too late anyway, and th at the United States should get the best deal it could in the struggle a gainst the Soviet Union. In 1976, when Kissinger was Secretary of State, nation ally syndicated columnist Ernest Cuneo wrote: Unimpeachable sources state that Dr. Henry Kissinge r's model has shifted from 19th century Metternich to 2 0th century Spengler. What that means is that Kissinger has abandoned the Balance of Power policy to accept Spengler's position that the West is through and must accept a subordinate role because it is useless to resist the 'wave of the future.' The 'wave of the future' of course means Communist ascendancy. Kissinger's new position assumes that the American people do not have the courage or the strength to stand up to the Communists if it means war. Therefore, Kissinger is attempting to get the best terms possible as a competing world power. 23 407"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 38 THE GREATEST VICTORY It seems to fit that the American government is bei ng maneuvered into a position of not having the ability nor the means to resist Communist pressures so that, when the Russian government thre atens America with nuclear war, the American people will demand that t heir government accept any solution other than a war. The American preside nt will ask the Russians if mere is any option they will accept other than n uclear war. Their response will be mat the merging of the two countries into a world government will suffice, and the American people will breathe a sig h of relief when their offer is accepted by the American government. An additional item would be needed to make the scen ario and theory really work. That would be a president that would not be afraid to stand up to the Russians, even though he knows that he does not hav e the military means to succeed. He would have to be a Republican who has l ong stood up against the Communists, one that would have sent military t roops into a small island (Grenada) when he believed the nation was ab out to go Marxist. He couldn't be a member of the Democrat Party which ha s been consistently against any confrontation with the Communists on a face to face basis. It appears that the Americans are playing two sides of the same coin: appearing to get tough with the Russians, and then not having the ability to withstand any offense put forward by the Russians. Another piece of the puzzle that fits is the fact m at America is being told that the government does not have the military or n uclear power to compete with the Russians in a military showdown. One evide nce of this strategy was revealed in an interview with John Tower, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee that reaffirmed the position of the retired admirals and generals who felt that America was in serious dange r because of its reduced military strength. The headline to the article read : \"U.S. Faces Nothing Less Than Military Inferiority.\" The article was accompanied by graphs showing how d angerously behind the United States was in the numbers of bomb ers and missiles, warheads, and estimated megatonnage of warheads. Two articles, about two months apart, revealed that the fear of a third world war concerns the American people, who feel th at a nuclear war was possible within the next ten years. 24 And all of the stories that are in the news about t he ineptness of America's military forces (plane crashes because pi lots are on drugs; fifty percent of all enlisted men are on drugs, etc.) are slowly convincing the public that, not only does America not have the mil itary and nuclear power, but the military isn't ready to resist any aggressi ve act as well. It is not difficult with this scenario, then, to un derstand why the American hostages in Iran were released shortly aft er the 1980 election (to 408"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 38 THE GREATEST VICTORY unify the American people behind national patriotis m) and why the military allowed the hostage rescue attempt to be so badly b otched (one weekly newsletter mailed around the United States reported that friendly Arabian leaders are frightened and disillusioned about that bungled mission because they now see the United States as a weak ally.) Another call to America's patriotism was the 1984 O lympics when, after Russia decided not to compete, America won an unpre cedented number of medals. America's response to the medal winners was an unabashedly pro- American display of national patriotism (one flag m anufacturer reported that his demand for flags was outpacing the supply) . Americans have got to love their country enough not to have it blown apar t by a nuclear war with Russia. Another evidence that this scenario is correct is t hat President Reagan seems to be tarnish-proof (the press is calling him the \"teflon president,\" nothing seems to stick to him). This is unusual bec ause the conservative right has long stated that it never seems to get a good press, and that everything it does do is wrong in the eyes of the m edia. It is not too long ago that Americans should have forgotten the commercial s and the media treatment of the conservative of the 1960's, Senato r Barry Goldwater, when he ran for the presidency in 1964. In November, 1981, two events occurred that were cr eated to scare America's NATO allies against a nuclear war. One wa s President Reagan's then Secretary of State Haig's statement that NATO had contingency plans for firing a nuclear weapon for \"demonstrative purp oses\" to demonstrate to the enemy that they were exceeding the limits of to leration in the conven- tional war. Presumably the bomb would be dropped in Europe, and this tended to frighten the citizens of America's allies . The second event that served to alarm the NATO coun tries was the intrusion of a Soviet submarine into Swedish waters . The question of whether or not this submarine carried nuclear weapo ns was never made completely clear, but if the ship had the weapons a board, the Swedish military did not know about the sub's presence unti l it was inside a restricted military zone. This activity tended to further frig hten the NATO allies into fearing a nuclear war in Europe. Both activities, o ccurring so close to each other, were intended to convince the NATO allies th at both sides could spring a nuclear attack easily without the European s knowing anything about it. Another major block in the scenario wall was put in to place on June 19, 1978, when President Jimmy Carter, by an unconstitu tional Executive Order, created an organization known as the Federal Emergency Manage- ment Agency (FEMA). This organization is a civilian agency which has the capacity to administer a totalitarian government in the event of domestic or international crisis. 409"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 38 THE GREATEST VICTORY FEMA has the authority to: Relocate millions of workers, reorganize national i ndustry and banking, and distribute all economic resources and transporta- tion access; Operate every level of government, through personne l currently in place throughout Washington and the rest of the cou ntry; Institute total energy rationing; and Order mass evacuation of residents in the perimeter of nuclear power plants. It is an interesting coincidence that the Three Mil e Island incident occurred just one day after FEMA became operational . FEMA arrived on the scene of the nuclear plant accident and according t o Fusion magazine: \"... fostered an atmosphere of panic, and lobbied f or mass evacuations that would have given FEMA authority over all other fede ral, state and local governmental bodies, with the exception of the gove rnor's office.\" 25 There is some evidence that the nuclear event that occurred at Three Mile Island was an act of sabotage. One bit of evidence is the fact that an anti-nuclea r power article appeared in 1978 in a radical magazine called Harri sburg which envisioned an accident at the nearby Three Mile Island facilit y on March 28, 1979, the exact date on which the nuclear accident occurred. 26 Another is the fact that the investigators who were studying the incident were unable to identify the individual who closed t he valves of the backup cooling pumps which would have kept the reactor fro m overheating. 27 In any event, the Three Mile nuclear incident was c ertainly a \"non- event.\" The charges that large amounts of radiation were re leased into the nearby environment were fraudulent. Dr. Petr Beckmann, the distinguished editor of Acce ss to Energy, and a professor of Electrical Engineering at the Universi ty of Colorado, set the matter into perspective: The sum total of radioactivity released in the Harr isburg Grand Disaster was 80 millirems (official testimony by HEW Secretary.) That is as much additional radiation as a certain p erson would receive by moving from Pennsylvania into the editor ial offices of this newspaper (elevation 7,200 ft. in the ore-rich Rockies) for less than a year. What kind of person? The kind that stood naked near the plant 24 hours a day for the entire episode. 28 410"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 38 THE GREATEST VICTORY In an attempt to quiet the furor about the immense danger to life from nuclear plants around the country, Dr. Edward Telle r, a scientist who worked on the hydrogen bomb and on the safety of nu clear energy, placed a full-page advertisement in the Wall Street Journal on July 31, 1979. This advertisement carried answers to some of the main q uestions about Three Mile Island. Some of those questions and answers were as follows : Q. How dangerous is the release of low-level radiat ion from a nuclear power plant? A. If you sat next to a nuclear power plant for a y ear, you would be exposed to less radiation than you would receive du ring a round- trip flight in a 747 from New York to Los Angeles. Let me put it another way. The allowable radiation from a nuclear plant is five mrems (an appropriate unit us ed to make comparisons) per year. In Dallas, people get about 30 mrems per year from the natural background of buildings, rock s, etc. In Colorado, people get as much as 130 mrems per year from the natural background. Therefore, just by moving from Dallas to Boulder you would receive ten times more radiation per year than the person gets who lives next to a nuclear power p lant. Q. How much radiation were the people around Three Mile Island exposed to during the accident? A. Let me put it this way. Your blood contains pota ssium 40, from which you get an internal dose of about 25 mre ms of radiation per year. Among the people not working on the react or, a handful may have gotten as much radiation as 25 mrems. The timing of the creation of FEMA and the apparent ly sabotaged nuclear incident is indeed unusual. Is it possible that the Three Mile Island episode was created to test the incredible powers o f FEMA? FEMA's other crisis interventions include the reloc ation of the Cuban boat refugees in 1980. This episode allowed FEMA to test its ability to relocate thousands of people all over the United St ates. Is it possible that Cuba allowed the boat people to leave Cuba as a tes t of FEMA's ability to find new homes for these refugees? Apparently President Ronald Reagan agreed that FEMA had done an excellent job. When he outlined his $3.4 billion, s even-year program to relocate the U.S. metropolitan population from pote ntially high risk areas after a nuclear war started, he designated FEMA as the agency to carry out the program. 29 FEMA has an interesting history behind its creation . The 1979 Execu- tive Order that created it was based on Presidentia l Review Memorandum 32, 411"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 38 THE GREATEST VICTORY prepared by Samuel Huntington. The guiding assumpti on of PRM-32 was that constitutionally mandated institutions would n ot be able to deal with the scope of crises forseen for the 1970's and 1980 's. Three years earlier, Huntington had elaborated this assumption in his position paper for the Trilateral Commission, title d The Crisis of Demo- cracy. Emergencies of the nature of Love Canal, the Cuban boatlift opera- tion, and the Three Mile Island incident would requ ire levels of austerity and social control impossible to achieve through democr atic institutions, so Huntington recommended a series of national and sup ranational \"crisis management\" forms of government. These were put int o effect by President Carter in June, 1978, after they were published in the Federal Register. 30 One more evidence that the American people might pe rmit their government to violate all of their Constitutional R ights because of some real or alleged emergency that was created by the govern ment, occurred on October 16, 1970, in Canada. This power grab occurred when Canadian Prime Minist er Pierre-Elliott Trudeau, using the kidnapping of two officials by t he Communist F.L.Q. \"invoked the War Measures Act, suspended the Canadi an Bill of Rights, and imposed a dictatorship on Canada. TrudeaU now had t he power of censor- ship, for instance, and could search without warran t and arrest without trial.\" 31 It will be recalled that the Canadian people allowe d these violations of their rights almost without a whimper, almost prais ing Trudeau for taking that action to stop the F.L.Q. Two other indications mat the Conspiracy plans on g rabbing all of the power in the United States in 1985 come from two bo oks, one written by- Herman Kahn, the founder of the Hudson Institute, a nd possibly one of the principals in the writing of the Report From Iron M ountain, and the other by Allen Drury. The book by Herman Kahn is called Things to Come: T hinking About the 70's and the 80's. Mr. Kahn, who calls himself \"one of the 10 most famous obscure Americans,\" attempted to answer these quest ions by his book (co- authored with B. Bruce Briggs). They have written: \"What are the chances of a nuclear confrontation in the next decade? How wil l the rising influence of Japan affect the world's balance of economic and po litical power? Is America's two-party system on the verge of collapse ? These are some of the questions Herman Kahn and B. Bruce Briggs answer in this challenging new book, a discussion of what might happen from now un til 1985.\" 32 Notice that the scenario, even though the book is i ntended to examine the 70's and 80's (that means the period that shoul d have been reviewed would have been until the end of 1989) the book end s with the year 1985. In fact, the year \"1985\" appears forty-one times in pr int, and the term \"the decade 1975-1985\" appears five times. 412"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 38 THE GREATEST VICTORY Are Mr. Kahn and Mr. Briggs trying to tell the Amer ican people something?

It appears that 1985 is the year. The author wishes to add a footnote about this last statement. There are several possibilities about the prediction that the planners will make their long-awaited move in 1985. If the Conspiracy wants to discredit those who have exposed the Conspiracy, there wouldn't be a better way than to have all of the exposers point towards the year 1985. Then, if they wished t o further conceal their efforts toward another year, they could postpone th eir plans for one more year, say, to 1986, so that those exposers would be made to look ridiculous. The reader's attention is directed to the comment p reviously referred to by Zbigniew Brzezinski in his book Between Two Ages that discusses a re- writing of the Constitution in either 1976, a date obviously in the past, or in 1989, a date still in the future. Maybe the date is 1989. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say mat someth ing is planned for the period between 1985 and 1989.

His subject was co rruption in high places: This Administration has proved that it is utterly i ncapable of cleaning out the corruption which has completely er oded it, and re- establishing the confidence and faith of the people in the morality and honesty of their government employees.

We have had corruption de fended by those in high places. If they don't recognize or admit uiat corruption ex ists, how can we expect them to clean it up? 1 To understand the events of the Watergate episode, it becomes impor- tant to understand the plans of the Conspiracy and the counter-plans of the Nixon Administration. In January, 1964, newsmen asked Nelson Rockefeller when he had first thought about being president of the United States. He replied: \"Ever since 414"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 39 REMOVAL I was a kid. After all, when you think of what I ha d, what else was there to aspire to?\" 2 Nelson Rockefeller was committed to the aspirations of the Conspiracy about creating the New World Order. He is quoted as saying on July 26, 1968, according to the Associated Press, that as presiden t \"he would work toward international creation of 'a new world order' based on East-West cooperation instead of conflict.\" 3 But even though Nelson Rockefeller was close to the inner circles of the Conspiracy, he was never inside those circles. It i s the present author's contention that he was never scheduled to become th e president of the United States, at least since the election of 1968. That means that the Conspiracy promised Nelson the presidency but knew that it would not deliver it as promised. So t here were four cross- currents at work in the years between 1964 and 1976 . They were: 1. One was to make Richard Nixon the president of the United States; 2. The second was to remove Richard Nixon from office after his first election in 1968; 3. The third was to promise Nelson Rockefeller the pre sidency in 1976; and 4. The fourth was not to deliver what had been promise d to Nelson. The events at the Watergate building were intended to achieve three of these objectives after the first had succeeded. But to understand Watergate, one must understand Ri chard Nixon and why the Conspiracy wanted him in office in 1968, on ly to want him out of office in 1973 and 1974. Mr. Nixon has had an interesting career. It began i n 1946 when he defeated incumbent Congressman Jerry Voorhis in Cal ifornia after World War II. Congressman Voorhis was a champion of those who wer e fighting the Federal Reserve. He had written a book entitled Out of Debt, Out of Danger, in which he advocated the paying off of the nationa l debt. Voorhis had also introduced legisladon to repeal the Federal Reserve Act. This behavior did not make the Congressman a favori te of the banking fraternity. In a pamphlet he had written endtled Dollars and Se nse, Congressman Voorhis stated that: \"... the representatives of th e American people in Congress should speedily proceed to transfer the ow nership of the 12 central Federal Reserve banks from the private ownership of the member banks to the ownership of the nation itself.\" 4 Suddenly out of nowhere, a candidate named Richard Nixon came forward to oppose him. It has been reported that th e Eastern establishment 415"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 39 REMOVAL had poured huge amounts of money into Nixon's campa ign. In any event, Richard Nixon defeated Congressman Je rry Voorhis and replaced him as the Congressman from that district The next step in Nixon's ascendancy to the presiden cy occurred in 1952, when Nixon assisted Dwight Eisenhower in stealing t he Republican presidential nomination from \"Mr. Republican,\" Robe rt Taft. It is com- monly felt that Mr. Taft would be the Republican no minee for president, and that he would be able to defeat the Democratic candidate, whoever that nominee might be. Mr. Taft was a \"conservative\" and true anti-communist. He had to be defeated, and the man chosen to defeat him was Dwight David Eisenhower who had been held out of the election in 1948 for this purpose. The control of the California delegation to the Rep ublican National Convention was the key to the selection of the pres idential candidate, and it appeared that Mr. Taft would carry California. Rich ard Nixon along with Earl Warren, then the governor of California, worke d behind the scenes to secure the votes of the delegates from California f or Eisenhower. When Eisenhower was rewarded with the nomination, h e rewarded those who had assisted him in securing it for him. He selected Nixon as his Vice-President, and later named Earl Warren to the Supreme Court. Eisenhower later betrayed Nixon in 1960, when as pr esident he told the American people that he couldn't think of a single thing that Nixon had done to assist him in the eight years of their admi nistration. Nixon's chances in the 1960 election against John Kennedy were sign ificantly damaged by that single comment. It is conceivable that that statement was intended to keep Nixon away from the presidency in 1960, because it had been pr omised to him in 1968, and Nixon preferred that year over the year 1960 fo r reasons that will be discussed later. In spite of Eisenhower's \"non-support,\" there are t hose who felt that Nixon had actually won the 1960 elecdon and was the duly elected president of the United States, but that vote fraud in Texas and Illinois gave the elecdon to John Kennedy. Nixon had the opportunity to once and for all expose the nearly perpetual vote fraud suspected to exist in these two states, but he refused to contest the vote count and the el ecdon was won by Kennedy. There are some who feel that the reason Nixon did n ot contest the elecdon was that he had been offered the presidency in 1968. Nixon, it is felt, quickly reasoned that, even if he had won the elect ion of 1960 and had been re-elected in 1964, his eight-year term in office w ould only get him to 1968, still short of the 1976 target date of the Conspira cy that he had understood and acknowledged. (Nixon was a member of the CFR). This would also explain why he decided not to run in 1964, leaving the Republican nomina- don to Barry Goldwater. 416"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 39 REMOVAL In 1962, Nixon returned to politics to run for gove rnor of California. His basic intent was, not to defeat the incumbent G overnor Pat Brown, but to defeat his fellow Republican, the conservative J oe Shell. It was also Nixon's desire to keep the California delegation to the 1964 Republican convention out of the control of the conservatives led by Mr. Shell. It is well known that Nelson Rockefeller had wanted to win the 1964 Republican presidential nomination, and it was gene rally agreed that the California delegation was once again the key to his nomination, just as it had been in 1952. So if Nixon defeated Shell in the primaries, he cou ld assist the presiden- tial aspirations of Nelson Rockefeller. Nixon did d efeat Shell in the primary, thereby insuring at least temporarily that Shell wo uld not control the 1964 California delegation. Nixon went on to lose to Pat Brown in the general election, an election that Nixon did not care to wi n. Rockefeller's plans for the presidency had succeeded so far. After he was defeated in 1962, Nixon told reporters that \"you won't have me to kick around anymore,\" (or words to that effec t), because he was leaving the political scene. He went to New York and moved into the first floor of an expensive apartment building, (the rent was $100,000 a year), in New York. The occupant of the top floor of this building was Nels on Rockefeller, who also became his landlord, as Rockefeller owned the build ing. In addition, Nixon went to work for the law firm representing the Rock efeller interests and became a full partner at a salary of $200,000 a yea r. 5 It was here that Nixon basically sat out the 1964 p residential election. It is not known if Rockefeller completely understoo d the 1964 \"Draft Goldwater\" movement among the young people of the c ountry, especially the young in California. But it is known that this movement was indeed a concern of the Conspiracy around Rockefeller. The C alifornia Young Republicans had swept control of their state organi zation away from the Rockefeller supporters and were booming Senator Gol dwater for the presidency in 1964. It appeared that Rockefeller would lose the key Cal ifornia delegation to the 1964 convention, and because of this loss, ulti mately the nominadon of the Republican Party. And this is precisely what happened. The California Young Republi- cans assisted the Goldwater supporters to control t he California delegadon, and this key delegation led the remainder of the de legations in giving the nomination to Barry Goldwater. Rockefeller had lost his best chance at the preside ncy. The next step in the ascendancy of Richard Nixon oc curred in 1968 when he won the presidency of the United States.

H e must have known that this all-powerful position had been offered first t o Woodrow Wilson and then to Franklin Roosevelt, and mat both had been u nable to assume this office because of the concerns of the American peop le. Nixon \"selected\" Spiro Agnew as his vice president in 1968. By strange coincidence, Governor Agnew had been Nelson Rockefe ller's 1968 campaign manager. It is hard to presume that those who selec ted him did not know about his \"skeleton in the closet,\" allegations mat Agnew had taken some money from certain contractors while he was governo r of Maryland. (Agnew later wrote a book entitled Go Quietly or Else, in which he vehemently denied the allegations against him. That is interes ting, because, if Agnew was innocent, then he was framed. He claims that he was forced out under veiled threats to his life made to him by Alexander Haig, a member of the CFR.) The door to this \"closet\" was later opened, a nd Agnew resigned. That poses the question: was Agnew selected because they knew that they could remove him later, either with the truth about his alleged \"kickbacks\" or with their knowledge that the press would convince the American people that the false allegations were tru e? If the previously detailed scenario is correct, tha t the Conspiracy altered its plans about the 1976 target date, and that the plans were changed in 1970, men the next quote that appeared in the New York Ti mes makes sense. It appeared on May 21, 1971, and was written by James Reston, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. It is presumed that i t was a tip-off to the supporters of the Conspiracy around the nation who read the New York Times, owned and controlled by members of the CFR, that Nixon had been told of the change in the plans and that he was goi ng through with plans of his own. The article read, in part: \"Mr. Nixon woul d obviously like to preside over the creation of a new world order, and believes he sees an opportunity to do so in the last twenty months of h is first term.\" 6 It was during the last twenty months of his first term tha t the details about the Watergate break-in were being formulated. Robert Welch, founder of the John Birch Society, lo ng an exposer of the Conspiracy, wrote the following in the October, 197 1, Bulletin to all of the Society members: \"The record seems to me to indicat e quite clearly that, since at least 1960, Richard Nixon has had the all-pervad ing ambition, and the unshakable determination, to use the presidency of the United States as a stepping stone from which to become the first ruler of the world.\" 7 Welch went on to reveal, in the same Bulletin, the precise date he anticipated that these plans would come into fruiti on: \"And mere are many reasons to believe it is their intention to achieve this goal, and have their regime sitting on top of a subdued and enslaved wor ld, by the first of May, 418"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 39 REMOVAL 1976.\" 8 (The first of May, 1976, would be the two-hundredt h anniversary of the founding of the Illuminati.) Unknown to the Society at that time, though, the Co nspiracy had apparently revised its timetable, as was explained in the preceding chapter. But, Nixon, sensing that he was to be removed from office, apparently decided that he could do this himself, and he surro unded himself with a group of individuals whom he felt he could trust, a ll non-members of the CFR. There were only two major exceptions, however, who were members of the CFR: Alexander Haig and Henry Kissinger. Bot h of these individuals had connections to the Rockefeller interests, and i t is doubted that Nixon had any control over their selection for his Administra tion. So on June 17, 1972, James W. McCord, (non-member o f the CFR) and four Miami Cubans broke into the Watergate complex and were later arrested. Watergate is an interesting building complex. A Par ade magazine article revealed that the complex was owned by Gene rale Immobiliare, a giant construction company which was in turn owned by the Catholic Church. The same article further revealed that the Vatican had \"major investments in such Banks as Chase Manhattan... and the various Roth- schild banks in France.\" 9 One thing is for certain, however. The break-in int o the Watergate building has made this the most well-known office c omplex in Washington D.C outside of the buildings occupied by the federa l government. The Watergate break-in was perhaps the most bungled break-in in the history of crime. One author, Victor Lasky, has wri tten: \"Rarely has there been a more inane caper. Everything went wrong—as i f by design. It was almost as if they had been deliberately dropping cl ues.\" 10 Those who have studied the break-in in any length h ave discovered incredible circumstances that surely indicate that the break-in was indeed intended to be discovered. Take, for instance, the following facts: 1. One of the burglars alerted a guard by replacing th e tape over the door locks after the guard had discovered and remov ed the first one. 2. Even though their efforts had been discovered, the boss of the operation, G. Gordon Liddy, sent the burglars back to the Watergate. 3. The man posted as lookout saw the police enter the building but either failed to alert the men inside or his warnin g was ignored. 11 The theory that Watergate was indeed intentionally bungled was offered in an article by Jim Hougan in Harper's mag azine. The contents of that article were reviewed by Victor Lasky in Human Events. Mr. Lasky reports: \"its basic finding is that the June, 1972, burglary... was not only bungled... but was most deliberately sabotaged.... What is alleged is that 419"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 39 REMOVAL the Watergate caper was sabotaged by none other tha n James McCord, the FBI-trained employee of the U.S. Central Intelligen ce Agency who later blew the whistle on his fellow burglars. In other words, Jim Hougan argues that McCord was actually a double agent.\" 12 That is not surprising, according to a book entitle d The Rockefeller File, by Gary Allen, that claims: \"The incredibly b ungled Watergate break- in... was written and directed by Rockefeller front men.\" 13 Allen identifies the \"Rockefeller front men\" as Ale xander Haig and Henry Kissinger, the two members of the CFR who wer e Nixon's advisors. It is also interesting that there was one individua l who knew nothing about the Watergate break-in when it first occurred : \"As it turned out, the one person who had absolutely no advance knowledge of t he Watergate break-in was Richard M. Nixon.\" 14 Another link in this incredible chain of events is an article that claims that \"Deep Throat,\" the \"mystery man\" whose news le aks helped bring the Watergate scandals to a shattering climax, was iden tified in a new book as Richard Ober, a CIA counterintelligence agent. It was the theory of Deborah Davis, in a book she a uthored, that Ober: \"became a double agent in the White House for those who wanted the President of the United States to fall.\" John Dean, a Nixon staff member involved with the W atergate affair, claimed that \"Deep Throat\" was Alexander Haig, a ch arge that General Haig quickly denied. Another of the puzzling circumstances in the entire Watergate scenario was the tapes of the various conversations made bet ween Nixon and his many advisors in the White House. These tapes were not under the control of Nixon himself as: \"Voices automatically started the tape recorders spinning. Keep in mind that it was not Mr. Nixon wh o turned the recorders off and on.\" 15 It is interesting how the tapes came to be in the W hite House in the first place. \"While LBJ's (Lyndon Baines Johnson's) recor ding system had been installed by the Army Signal Corps, the Nixon monit ors were installed by the Secret Service.\" Newsweek magazine of September 23, 1974, added this revealing link in the chain: \"While former White House chief of staff H.R. Haldeman awaits trial for his part in Watergate, the Secret Service chief he ousted from the White House last year has landed a plum job. Robert H. Taylor, 49, who tangled with Haldeman over Nixon security procedure s, is now head of the private security forces of all of the far-flung Roc kefeller family enterprises.' 16 The main question never adequately answered by thos e covering the Watergate story was why President Nixon never destr oyed the tapes that were in his sole possession that were so indicting of hi s Administration. One 420"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 39 REMOVAL answer, perhaps the most plausible, is: \"Either Nix on did not control the tapes, or he knew there was more than one set. In a word, he did not destroy them because he could not.\" 17 Evidence for this conclusion seems persuasive. For instance, when the prosecuting judge John Sirica asked President Nixon to turn over the tapes he had in his possession, he asked for them in the following manner: \"January 8, 1973 from 4:05 to 5:34 P.M. (E.O.B.) at approximately 10 minutes and 15 seconds into the conversation, a seg ment lasting 6 minutes and 31 seconds.\" 18 The only way the judge could ask for certain tapes, specifying just when during the tape he wanted the conversations recorde d therein, was if he knew exactly what was on the tapes beforehand. That was impossible unless the judge and the prosecution had a second copy of the tapes. There are two more rather puzzling circumstances ab out those tapes. One is that: \". . . no tapes contained his [Henry K issinger's] advice, which is strange as he was Nixon's top advisor on n ational security.\" 19 Apparently the public was being asked to believe th at Kissinger never was in the Oval office so that he could be taped by the automatic taping machine talking to the president. The second was the fact that it was: \"... Alexander Haig who had control of the vault where the Watergate tapes were kept. Since it is perfectly clear that the subpoenas for the tapes were written by persons already possessing a detailed familiarity with their conten ts, it is painfully obvious that Haig had already provided them with copies of the pertinent excerpts.\" 20 In summary, then, it was Kissinger and Haig that ar ranged for Nixon to be removed from office. And if Spiro Agnew is right , it was Alexander Haig that forced him to resign. The coup d' etat that knocked President Nixon out o f the White House was carefully engineered by the two age nts of the House of Rockefeller. It is now known that Henry Kissinger was responsibl e for creating the Plumbers squad the group that broke in to Watergate) in the first place, while... Alexander Haig made su re that the most incriminating evidence on the tapes was given in ad vance to the men investigating (Nixon). Together, the two men forced... Nixon to resign, th us paving the way to get Rockefeller into the White House—wit hout risking an election Rocky would surely lose. 21 So Watergate had two purposes: One was to remove Ni xon, and the other was to make Nelson Rockefeller the president of the United States. At least these were the surface motives. 421"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 39 REMOVAL The next step became the removal of Spiro Agnew as vice president of the United States. This occurred on October 10, 197 3, after the door to his \"closet\" was opened. In Agnew's book, he explained that he had resigned from office following \"veiled threats on his life relayed by Ni xon's chief lieutenant, Alexander Haig.\" He claimed that Haig \"desired not only to move me out, but in the course... to move Mr. Nixon out, too.\" He concluded that Haig \"knew enough about discrepan cies in the Watergate tapes and that the truth about Nixon's in volvement in the Watergate cover-up to be convinced that eventually the President himself must go. And Haig did not want me in line of succes sion.\" 22 He added that \"Haig might have him murdered if he h adn't [resigned].\" The possibility that Haig might have been able to h ave someone kill Agnew was confirmed in 1980 when G. Gordon Liddy, a Nixon aide, admitted mat he had proposed the killing of columni st Jack Anderson to me White House in 1972 and that he had waited for Whit e House approval which never came. So there was at least one person on the Nixon staff who would have killed had he been asked to do so. With Agnew out as vice president, Nixon now had to appoint a successor. There was widespread concern around the nation that Nixon was going to appoint Nelson Rockefeller. Now would have been the time to make certain that Rockefeller became president, if that was the promise of the Conspiracy. But Nixon did not select Rockefeller, h e chose Gerald Ford instead. This choice was amazing if the Conspiracy had promi sed Nelson the presidency. The only conclusion that fits is that t hey did not want him to become president, and therefore told Nixon to appoi nt Gerald Ford, who certainly had been groomed for such a task by the C onspiracy. (Gerald Ford, it will be recalled, had attended numerous Bilderbe rg meetings and person- ally knew Prince Bernhard, the organization's early leader. It is presumed mat Mr. Ford knew that a centralized conspiracy exi sted.) Nixon's choice of Ford is also startling when it is remembered that the basic intent of Watergate was to remove Nixon. That meant that the Conspiracy knew mat the person whom Nixon chose wou ld later become the president of the United States. If the Conspiracy h ad wanted Nelson Rockefeller, mis would have been the dme to make it s move. Once again, the only conclusion that fits is that N elson Rockefeller was not to become the president of the United States as he had been promised. However, to condnue the illusion that Nelson would become president, Ford chose Nelson as his vice-president when he bec ame president after Nixon resigned. 422"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 39 REMOVAL (One interesting sidelight to the resignation of Pr esident Nixon. It will be recalled that President Nixon was suffering from a swollen leg during the time he was preparing to resign. He made the statem ent mat, if he had gone to Bethesda Naval Hospital to have it attended, he would \"never come out alive.\" Is it possible that Nixon knew about Senato r Joseph McCarthy and Secretary of Defense James Forrestal who both went to Bethesda Naval Hospital \"never to come out alive?\") The next step came when two assassination attempts were made on President Ford's life, the first by Lynette \"Squeak y\" Fromme on September 5, 1975, who pointed a .45 caliber pistol at Ford, and the second on September 22, 1975, when Sara Jane Moore shot at Ford. Her at tempt also failed. One of the interesting facts about the Moore shooti ng is that she admitted that she had intended to make Nelson Rocke feller president of the United States. She said that she tried to shoot For d to expose the nation's \"phony system of government.\" She claimed that: \"Fo rd is a nebbish... It was the office of the presidency I was trying to at tack. Killing Ford would have shaken a lot of people up. More importantly, i t would have elevated Nelson Rockefeller to the presidency, and then peop le would see who the actual leaders of the country are.\" 28 Miss Moore consented to an interview in the June, 1 976, Playboy magazine wherein she hinted that there was a conspi racy involved in her attempt on President Ford's life. Excerpts from the interview reveal this point: Moore: I had done something very valuable for them (the FB I) in the fall of 1974. I will intrigue you a little with thi s: That was the point at which the seed of what finally happened on Septe mber 22, 1975, was planted. That was the one time when my politica l beliefs, what I wanted to have happen, coincided with something t hat the Bureau and the Secret Service wanted. Playboy: You have intrigued us. What was it? Moore: Maybe somedme I'll tell you about it. Not now. 24 Later on in the interview, she partially amplified her remarks: Playboy: At what point did you decide, 'Aha, now I've got a gun, I'm going to use it on Ford?'

So it appears mat the Conspiracy accomplished its f our goals: 1. Richard Nixon became the President of the United St ates; 2. Richard Nixon was removed from office; 3.

Conspiratorial Assistance: There are two groups that know that an internationa l Conspiracy exists: those that are members of the Conspiracy, a nd those that are trying to expose the Conspiracy. The strategy of the conspiracy has always been: \"Ne ver try to refute the accusations, but always destroy the accuser.\" J. Edgar Hoover, the late director of the Federal B ureau of Investigadon, has been quoted as saying: \"The best yardstick of t he effecdveness of the fight against Communism is the fury of the smear attacks against the fighter.\" Perhaps the greatest test of the effectiveness of t he strongest exposer of the Conspiracy is that this group has survived the greatest onslaught of smear tacdcs in the history of the Conspiracy. The charges that the John Birch Society was \"anti-s emitic, pro- communist, crazy, secret, hysterical or connected w ith the Ku Klux Klan\" 427"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 40 ASSISTANCE have all been proven false. But the ferocity of the attack against the Society shows that they were indeed correct in their assert ions that the Conspiracy exists. The Society was founded in 1958 by Robert Welch who sensed, quite correctly, that there was indeed a master conspirac y active in the major affairs of the United States and the world. Mr. Welch was born in Chowan County, North Carolina in 1899. He graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1916 and attended the U.S. Naval Academy and Harvard Law School. He was a n officer of a large company manufacturing candy from 1956 and was activ e in the campaign to elect Robert Taft as President in 1952. He served a s a director of the National Association of Manufacturers during the years 1951- 57 and was a vice- president of the Association from 1955 to 1957. He founded the monthly magazine American Opinion in 1956 and is the author of hundreds of published articles and essays. Books written by Mr. Welch include May God Forgive Us, The Life of John Birch, The Blue Book of the John Birch Society , The Politician, The New Americanism and The Romance of Education. Mr. Welch became an instant celebrity when his book entitled The Politician was made public in 1963. The book, about Dwight David Eisenhower, made the charge that President Eisenhow er was a \"dedicated, conscious agent of the Communist conspiracy.\" What Welch said in the book caused perhaps the greatest controversy of the early 1960's. Mr. Welch never intended for the book to be published, at lea st that early, but to protect himself and to make it clear just what he had said in the book, he published it in 1963. The book has had repeated reprintings, as the American people became first curious and then, after reading it, sh ocked by its contents. Some, however, knew that Mr. Welch was correct in h is views about the existence of the Master Conspiracy. One of these su pporters came from an unlikely individual, Jerry Rubin, who wrote in his book Do It!: \"The right wing is usually right too.... The John Birch Societ y understands the world we live in better than fools like Arthur Schlesinge r Jr. and Max Lerner who don't know what... is happening.\" 1 The Society has stated its position quite clearly: \"The John Birch Society holds that the freedom, prosperity, moral c haracter and very existence of the United States are threatened by a Conspiracy whose Insiders include men with power of decision not only in government b ut also, Big Business. \" 2 They feared that the Conspiracy was a machination o f evil people inside the American government, as Cicero felt of the Roma n government. Cicero said: \"You [the Roman Senate] have encouraged treas on and have opened the gates to free the traitors. A nation can surviv e its fools, even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within.\" And Pet rach, a great Italian poet, who wrote: \"Behold, the relics of Rome. Neither tim e nor the barbarian can 428"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 40 ASSISTANCE boast the merit of this stupendous destruction; it was perpetrated by her own citizens, by the most illustrious of her sons.\" In other words, Mr. Welch agreed with those observe rs of the past who feared an internal conspiracy more than the armies of a threatening conquerer. So it was in 1958 that Mr. Welch met with eleven ot her American patriots in Indianapolis, Indiana, and formed the J ohn Birch Society, as an educational organization to awaken tbe American peo ple to the internal conspiracy sensed by others of the past. Mr. Welch chose to name his new Society after the y oung John Birch, who was killed by the Chinese Communists on August 25, 1945. Mr. Welch felt that Captain Birch, who was in China in the Am erican Army at the time and on a mission when he was killed, became the fir st casualty of the undeclared Third World War, the final war between c apitalism and communism. Mr. Welch, as he researched the buried story of Joh n Birch, discovered mat the American State Department had kept the circ umstances of his death a secret, and he decided to break the true story to the American people. Mr. Welch found the circumstances of his death to be ra ther strange, as America was not at war with the Chinese Communists and coul d not imagine why his death had been covered up by the American governmen t. His story about John Birch became the book entitled The Life of John Birch. Mr. Welch also thought that the moral virtue s and the values of Captain Birch also exemplified the traditional Amer ican values that were being eaten away by the new moral values of the \"mo dern\" American. So, Mr. Welch was proud to name his newly created s ociety after the American patriot, John Birch. The Birch Society, in keeping with the high moral v alues that Birch himself embodied, offered the world a positive prog ram: \"We can never win unless both leadership and following have a positiv e dream which is more important as a hope than the negative nightmare is as a fear; unless the promise of what we can build supplies more motivati on than the terror of what we must destroy, and unless this faith in the future is based on a deeper faith in eternal trudis.\" 3 Mr. Welch became aware that the trudis that the org anization supported were far more important than the distortions that h ad to be opposed, so he constructed an organization based on positive value s. He wrote that these included: 1. A belief in a divine creator; 2. Belief in morality; 3. A belief in truth and honor and mercy and compassio n; 4. In reverence and tradition as components of our spi ritual environment; 429"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 40 ASSISTANCE 5. In the freedom and responsibility of every individu al; 6. In good will towards all men, and the application o f the Golden Rule; 7. In those loyalties to God and Country and Family; 8. And in love and trust as primary motivations of our thoughts and of our actions in our relationships to God and Gove rnment and our fellow men. 4 The basic belief, then, of the Birch Society was su mmed up in this short paragraph: \"We have to be for something; we must kn ow what that some- thing is; and we must believe it is worth a fight t o obtain. Reduced to its simplest and broadest terms, that something is: Less Government, and More Responsibility, and With God's Help, a Better World. 5 Whom was Mr. Welch asking to join? Merely being patriotic or anti-Communist is not suf ficient qualifications for membership. We must have associa ted with us, now and in the future, only men and women of good w ill, good conscience, and religious ideals. For we are strivi ng to set an example, by dedication, integrity, and purpose, in word and deed, which our children's children may follow without he sitation. 6 Because Mr. Welch saw this as a world-wide battle: \"the first in history, between light and darkness; between freedom and sla very;... for the souls and bodies of men,\" 7 he was not optimistic unless freedom loving indivi du- als had a greater vision: \"We have no chance unless the specific battles are fought as part of a larger and more lasting movemen t to restore once again an upward reach in the heart of man.\" 8 Mr. Welch not only was forming an organization but, in the Blue Book of the John Birch Society, which was a verbatim tra nscript of the speeches he delivered to the founding members of the Birch Soci ety, he also made some rather prophetic statements. Here is what he wrote about Richard Nixon: \"[He is] an extremely smart man. He is one of the a blest, shrewdest, most disingenuous [not noble or honorable] and slipperie st politicians that ever showed up on the American scene.\" 9 And this is what he said about the future Vietnames e War (once again, this was written in 1958:) \"Others, like the very p retentious American Friends of Vietnam, in my opinion, form major parts of a wh ole plan and drive for gradually turning some country over to the Communis ts, while pretending to be leading the opposition.\" 10 Because the Birch Society became successful at an e arly stage of its career, it became the subject of a vicious smear attack. In fact, Cleon Skousen, not a 430"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 40 ASSISTANCE member of the Society, wrote that \"A former member of the Communist party National Committee personally told me: \"The C ommunist leaders look upon the stamping out of the John Birch Societ y as a matter of life and death for the Party.\" 11 Mr. Welch was correct. There was a conspiracy, and the forces quickly aligned against him and the Society. The smear tactics started on July 29, 1960, when th e Communist Party in Moscow told the Party in America to \"destroy and -Communism.\" This tactic was picked up and repeated by a manifes to of eighty-one Communist Parties in December, 1960, and they were also told to destroy \"anti-communism.\" And in January, 1961, the Communist Party of the Un ited States singled out the Birch Society, as they were told to \"render it ineffective.\" Later, on February 25,1961, People's World, the official news paper of the Communist Party, printed an article entitled: \"Enter From Sta ge Right: The John Birch Society.\" In this article, the Birch Society was ca lled \"secret,\" and their members were called \"fascists,\" and they met in \"ce lls.\" And within a matter of weeks, the news magazines of the United States picked up on these stories and they began their own smear jobs, in many cases using the same smear words as the People's Wo rld ardcle. On March 22, 1961, Mr. Welch sent Governor Pat Brow n of California a telegram asking the California Senate Subcommitte e on Un-American Activides to investigate the Birch Society openly t o determine if these charges were correct. His request was granted, and after th e open hearings were conducted, the Subcommittee issued its report in 19 63. This is what it concluded about the Society: The John Birch Society to be a right, anti-communis t funda- mental organization. We have not found the Society to be either a secret or a Fascist organizadon. Nor have we found the great majority of its members in California to be mentally unstable, crackpots, or h ysterical about the threat of Communist subversion. We believe that the reason the John Birch Society h as attracted so many members is that it simply appeared to them to be the most effective, indeed the only, organization through wh ich they could join in a national movement to learn the truth abou t the Commu- nist menace, and then take some positive concerted action to prevent its spread. Our investigation and study was requested by the So ciety, which has been publicly charged with being a secret , Fascist, subversive, un-American, anti-Semitic organization. We have not found any of the accusations to be supp orted by the evidence. 12 431"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 40 ASSISTANCE In other words, after fair and open deliberation by this Subcommittee, and after hearing both proponents and opponents, th e only conclusion that could be drawn was that the vicious smear job was j ust that: a vicious smear job. The Society approached the problem of the Conspirac y's existence in the only way a moral organization can counter lies and deception. They simply told the truth. The plan was to offer the Am erican people the truth through a campaign of educadon. The Birch Society w ould have to become the largest university in the world to educate the American people on a one- to-one basis through a group of amateur professors. The leadership of the Society realized that they wo uld need their own book outlets so they quickly organized over 400 boo kstores, the largest bookstore chain in the United States. They realized that they would have rather limited access to the public through the maj or media, so they organized a speaker's bureau (on the average, three times a night somewhere in the United States there is a paid speaker speaki ng on some aspect of the Conspiracy.) It was the Birch Society that organized the speakin g tours of Julia Brown, Mel O'Campo, David Gumaer, Sgt. Peter Stark, Douglas Durham, and the others who explained the nature of the Cons piracy to groups of willing listeners. It was the Birch Society that in spired authors, like Gary Allen, Alan Stang, G. Edward Griffin, Herman Dinsmo re, and others, to write the books and pamphlets that were awakening t he American people. It was the Birch Society that printed the bumper st ickers which reminded the American people to \"Support Your Local Police and Keep Them Independent.\" It was the Birch Society that helped expose the Cou ncil on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, and the Bilde rberg group. It was the Birch Society that formed the TRIM (Tax Reform Imme- diately) Committees to inform the American people o f the intentional waste in Congress and to expose the voting records of the ir congressmen to the voting public. It was the Birch Society that, after the death of its nadonal chairman, Congressman Larry McDonald aboard the Kor ean Airlines flight 007, formed the Larry McDonald Crusade to Stop Fina ncing Communism, a national educational committee of citizens trying to stop the aid and trade that is keeping worldwide Communism alive. It was a member of the Birch Society, Bill Barlow, of Idaho, who took on the gov ernment in the issue of OSHA, and won. It is the Birch Society that has eig hty paid Coordinators in various congressional districts or states to contin ue its educational efforts. It was the John Birch Society that circulated peddons among its fellow ciuzens to stop the aid and trade going on between the Amer ican and Russian governments. These petitions have been signed by ov er four million Americans. 432"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 40 ASSISTANCE The Birch Society, concerned about the influence of both the Commu- nist Party and the Council on Foreign Relations in the magazines of America, publishes a weekly magazine, called The Re view of the News, and a monthly magazine, called American Opinion, to con tinue their educa- tional efforts and to present the other side of the various issues. (Those who wish to receive either or both of these well resear ched and topical magazines may subscribe to them through the John Birch Societ y, Belmont, Massachu- setts, 02178.) They have developed the largest publishing house of conspiratorial literature in the nation. It was the John Birch Soc iety that published Anastosio Somoza's book, entitled Nicaragua Betraye d, that exposed President Carter's betrayal of that country. That b ook has been printed in both English and Spanish and is being widely circul ated in Latin America to assist those countries in their fight against Co mmunism. Members of the Society meet twice a month and pay d ues at the rate of $4.00 per month for men and $2.00 for women. They r eceive a monthly bulletin that explains the projects that all member s work on together. In summary, then, and in the words of the Society: It was the John Birch Society, taking the point on the hard issues and leading the way, that made possible the victories cited above. For more than two decades, the Society has labored assidu- ously to create an understanding among the American people of free market economics, of constitutional principles of government, and of dangers posed to the preservation of our Rep ublic by the existence of a Master Conspiracy. We have taken matters of great import, little under stood by our fellow citizens, and made them the overriding i ssues in an increasing number of political campaigns. We have helped many good citizens look beyond the s urface gloss of media hype to question the basic principle s underlying pieces of proposed legislation and to ask tough que stions of political candidates to determine where they really stood on the issues... There is no other organization in the Americanist m ovement with the track record, the battle-tested membership , or the expe- rience necessary to wage and win the critical campa igns ahead in the climactic fight for America. 14 These words beg the final quesdon: If the John Birch Society does not play the leading role in stopping the Communist Conspiracy, just who is ther e to do so? 15 433"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"Chapter 41 The man in the street does not notice the devil eve n when the devil is holding him by the throat. Thus wrote Johann von Goethe. The apathy of the American people, and for that mat ter, those around the world as well, is legend.

The American people can see that something is wrong in their nation. It is that most feel there is nothing they can do about it. Because many feel tha t the problems are so immense they conclude that they are powerless to ch ange what is happening. And this is exactly the thought that the Conspiracy wants the American people to have. Those who have taken the time to read this study ar e now aware of just how serious the problem really is and they are the ones who must take up we truth and disperse it to others.

Let's create that understanding and build that resistance, with everything mortal men can put into the effort — while there is still time. 1 There are those, of course, who will see this as an obligation. Someone once wrote: To be born a free man is an accident; to live a free man is a responsibility; to the a free man is an obligadon. In conclusion, those in Hungary who opposed the Rus sian slavemasters in October of 1956 understood the obligadon of all free men to oppose slavery in every form. All they needed was the assistance o f other freedom-loving people around the world and they, too, would have p ossessed the freedom that all men aspire to. As one of the last acts of the uprising against the Russians, a group of freedom-fighters got control of a radio station and broadcast this message to the rest of the world: People of the world... help us! People of Europe, whom we once defended against the attacks of the Asiatic barbarians, listen now to the alarm bells ring. People of the civilized world, in the name of libe rty and solidarity, we are asking for you to help. The light vanishes. The shadows grow darker hour by hour. Listen to our cry. God be with you and with us. And with that the radio station went off the air. T he Russians were the only ones listening, and they shut the stadon off t he air.

The original research for this book was for a ten-w eek course I have been teaching since 1973, called a variety of things, fr om \"Proofs of a Conspiracy,\" to \"History Over-Easy,\" to \"Who Rules America?\" If the reader wishes to become more acquainted with the machinations of the Conspiracy in a classroom setting, the audio r would like to cordially invite each reader to participate in these classes. They are offered three times a year: winter (starti ng in September,) spring (stardng in January,) and summer (stardng in July,) and any time a small group of at least four people wish to make th e commitment for either the ten-week, two hours a night, weekday-night clas s, or the five-week, four- hour Saturday-morning class. The class fees are nom inal. The audior is also available for speaking engagemen ts should the reader feel it would be appropriate, or for weekend semina rs anywhere in the country. QUESTION I am frequently asked by students or friends who ag ree with me that the Conspiracy exists, why I believe I am allowed to co ntinue teaching and writing about its existence. They cite the deaths o f Abraham Lincoln, James Forrestal, Joseph McCarthy and Louis McFadden, amon g others, as evidence that those who expose the Conspiracy do so at their own risk. I have no answer to that quesdon. I can only say that I am absolutely convinced that the Conspiracy exists and that they have a great deal to gain by the deat h of one who has figured it out. I live in Arizona where a few years ago an invesdga dve reporter had his car blow-up as he started it because he was repordn g on corrupdon in that state. Why his enemies picked on him, and why mine have chosen not to pick on me, I do not know. I will emphatically say this: if you hear about my car exploding because I rigged it so that it would explode, or that I sud denly \"attempted to fly\" from the top of a sixteen-story building, please accept my pre-death statement: I didn't do it!
