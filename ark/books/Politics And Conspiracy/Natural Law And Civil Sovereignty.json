Perhaps it is this state’s lack of historical baggage thatmade it possible for scholars from a wide variety of national and intellec-tual backgrounds to interact on something like neutral territory. Whateverthe reason, for three days in July, some of the world’s most important his-torians of political thought – experts on the role of natural law in configu-ring political authority – discovered that travelling the globe brought intocontact schools of thought normally kept at a distance. For a brief periodthen, representatives of the most important contemporary approaches tothe history of political thought – from the French history of law and state to the Cambridge School history of political discourse, from German political history to Finnish and American intellectual historiography – foundthemselves in the closest of exchanges in the most distant of places. Thisbook captures the freshness of that moment, bringing new insights to long-standing questions – on the nature of sovereignty, the distinctiveness ofpost-scholastic natural law, the crucial character of the church–state relation– while making accessible the key contributions of continental thinkersscarcely known to Anglophone audiences.The editors are indebted to a number of benefactors.

Yet sovereignty also remains, as it hasalways been, a deeply and sometimes violently contested concept.2Since itsinception, the sovereign territorial state has been subjected to a whole seriesof criticisms, rebukes and repudiations, whether in the name of a commu-nity it fails to express, an economy it threatens to stifle, the individual whoserights it curtails or the cosmopolitan humanity it divides and immures. Most recently, the criticism has been conducted under the auspices of globalisation, understood as a phenomenon both economic and moral.Transnational flows of capital, ideas and people will, it is said, progressivelyweaken the governmental powers of the sovereign state, while simulta-neously opening its moral borders, to a humanity seeking unity above it orto peoples seeking self-determination within it.3Whether globalisation represents a novel challenge to the sovereign stateor the recirculation of older hostilities and dreams, it is premature to judge.4One can scarcely avoid noticing, however, the resurfacing here of Kant’s ideaof a global humanity and of neo-Thomist conceptions of self-determiningmoral community, both of which trace their roots to the battles over sovereignty first fought within early modern natural law doctrines. Today’srenewed attention to these doctrines – in which this volume’s authors haveplayed a key role – is thus in part driven by the political need to understandthe current (and recurrent) questioning of sovereignty in the name of ahigher moral principle, whether this be invested in humanity or society, self-governing individuals or self-determining peoples. Yet it is also driven bythe historical need to understand why early modern natural law doctrines1"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"became the intellectual terrain on which the struggle to configure sover-eignty would be fought out.Almost the entirety of post-scholastic natural law was elaborated in northwestern Europe during the seventeenth century. In Holland HugoGrotius (1583–1645) set things in motion, while in England Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679), Richard Cumberland (1631–1718) and John Locke(1632–1704) elaborated significant doctrines. In Germany Samuel Pufendorf(1632–1694) made perhaps the most fundamental contribution of all, to befollowed by Christian Thomasius (1655–1728), and thence by the religiousrefugee Jean Barbeyrac (1674–1744) who, at the beginning of the eighteenthcentury, translated and adapted Pufendorf’s natural law to the perspectivesof the Huguenot Diaspora. Concern with natural law did not arise in avacuum. Intellectually, it was a reaction against Catholic scholasticism, particularly the Thomist natural law doctrines refurbished in the so-called‘second-scholastic’ of the sixteenth century by Vitoria, de Soto and Suárez.5Thomas Aquinas (1224–74) had posited a law that is natural in two senses– in being given in man’s nature, and in being acceded to through naturalas opposed to revealed (biblical) knowledge – and which thus establishesmoral criteria for judging the ‘positive’ law of the civil sovereign. ForAquinas, however, natural law takes its place in a hierarchy of laws organ-ised by a theological metaphysics. Aquinas thus subordinates natural law toeternal law, the law by which God rationally wills the existence of creatures,imprinting them with a purpose which, as for Aristotle, is the law that completes or perfects them.6As a rational creature man not only bears a purposive nature, he is also capable of ‘participating’ in God’s creative thinking of such natures, thereby perfecting his own. Aquinas, therefore,constructs natural law as man’s mode of accessing supernatural eternal law.Unlike God’s revealed or ‘divine positive law’, natural law is known throughself-declarative universal principles, these being the form in which humanreason rises to meet God’s creative thinking of all the purposive natures,including man’s. Conceived as the third and lowest level of this hierarchy,human laws emerge when human reason is forced to apply natural law prin-ciples to particular circumstances. Human laws thus lack the self-certifyingand universal validity of natural law.7As the form in which human reasonhas access to God’s imprinting of purposive nature, natural law is rationallyand morally superior to the civil law of states, which is only a species ofhuman law. Such a construction supports the claim that Catholic naturallaw and its custodian, the universal church, have the capacity, the right andthe moral duty to determine the legality of positive civil law. According toAquinas, ‘we can only accept the saying that the ruler’s will is law, on theproviso that the ruler’s will is ruled by reason; otherwise a ruler’s will is morelike lawlessness’.8During the sixteenth century, the Thomist claim to establish the naturalmoral grounds and set the limits of civil rule was rendered problematic by2Ian Hunter and David Saunders"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"two shattering developments: the splitting of the ‘universal’ church intoseveral rival confessions, and the emergence of a series of territorial statesbent on asserting their sovereignty against the supranational structures ofthe Holy Roman Empire and the Papal Church.9Under these circumstances,in which states and estates began to divide along confessional lines, theThomist claim to determine the legitimacy of a state’s civil law on the basis of a higher natural law assumed a threatening aspect, particularly when applied to Protestants. If, as turned out to be the case, the natural law‘reason’ required to make the ruler’s will into just law was in fact determinedby Catholic theology and metaphysics, Protestant rulers could be denouncedas heretics incapable of legitimate rule. In attacking England’s (Protestant)James I (1566–1625), Suárez’ Defence of the Catholic and Apostolic Faith(1612)argued that natural law justified the pope in authorising the overthrow orassassination of heretical kings.10Under circumstances of confessional con-flict, the metaphysical and ‘global’ character of scholastic natural law madeit a powerful political weapon, pre-eminently in the propaganda war wagedby international Catholicism against the sovereignty of Protestant states.The intellectual reaction against scholastic natural law was thus driven bythe concrete difficulties encountered in establishing secular political author-ity under conditions of confessional division and religious war. Despite thepersistence of nineteenth-century presumptions to the contrary, it was noteconomy and society that lay at the heart of these problems, but religionand politics.11Further, they would not be solved through a universal philo-sophical reason backed by a globalising economy. Rather, it was a matter ofreworking the specific theological, juridical and political instruments usedto configure the grounds and limits of sovereignty. This was the task under-taken by those thinkers who reconstructed natural law doctrine during theseventeenth century. Despite the varied and sometimes conflicting charac-ter of the new doctrines, we can identify three broad characteristics sharedby all to some degree.First, while remaining attached to various theologies, post-scholasticnatural law doctrines were de-transcendentalised, in the sense of rejectingscholastic accounts of the metaphysical basis of civil law and politicalauthority, together with the clericalism associated with such accounts.12Drawing on a variety of sources – a reborn Stoicism and Epicureanism, theo-logical voluntarism – seventeenth-century natural jurists turned from thetranscendentalism of Christian-Platonic and Christian-Aristotelian naturallaw to seek in man’s ‘observable’ nature and historical circumstances a newbasis for politics and law. This would be found in man’s condition in the‘state of nature’.13Here, stripped of his capacity to participate in divine intel-lection, man faced just those exigencies whose resolution would call fortha particular version of the sovereign state. Moreover, this state would emergenot through a transfer of divine right, nor necessarily through a delegationof popular sovereignty – although some would see it in this way – but fromIntroduction3"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"a contract or pact in which sovereignty was tied to purely worldly circum-stances and purposes, notably those associated with security.Second, the anti-scholastic doctrines were juridified and politicised.Thomist natural law was itself juridical, using the language of law and right,legislation and law-giver. Yet this was the language of Romano-canonical law and, ultimately, it was grounded in the disciplines of metaphysics andtheology. In transforming the language of right, the post-scholastic naturaljurists sometimes juridified it in the sense of granting greater independenceto positive law, which might stabilise political authority by blocking appealsto natural right and conscience.14At other times they politicised this lan-guage by treating the whole domain of justice as a prerogative of sovereignty.This was to be exercised in accordance with natural law, but a natural lawwhose non-transcendental character would now make the civil sovereign itssole authoritative interpreter.15Third, post-scholastic natural law was secularising in the specific sense ofseeking to partition law and politics from theology and religion and therebyeffect a desacralisation of sovereignty. That certain forms of theology them-selves played a role in this process – typically the anti-sacramentalist or ‘spiritualist’ theologies of Protestant piety – in no way controverted the secularising effect. To desacralise politics was an aim quite compatible withprotecting the Church, particularly the true invisible one.16This dual strat-egy resulted in a certain autonomising of politics, because a sovereignty oriented solely to security is neither capable nor in need of a higher moralgrounding. Yet it simultaneously issued in a strict demarcation of the political sphere, since the condition of the state’s being absolute in its ownsphere is that it cede the desire to rule all the others (religious, familial, commercial), precisely the desire incited by a universalising theology andmetaphysics. If therefore post-scholastic natural law gave rise to doctrinesof religious toleration, this was not because it had suddenly recognised a natural right, but because toleration was purposive, serving both to auto-nomise politics and to protect religion in its now privatised sphere.17Ratherthan indicating a sharp incision made by a secularising Enlightenment philosophy, the separation of church and state thus refers to a complexdouble strategy – the simultaneous autonomising of politics and privatisingof religion – designed to allow sovereign states to govern multi-confessional‘societies’.These three features of the seventeenth-century natural law – the de-transcendentalising of natural law’s foundations, the juridifying and politi-cising of its objects, and its dedication to the desacralisation of politics andthe privatisation of religion – represented not a single theory but a set ofinterlocking strategies. As a result, the natural law doctrines developed tosupport these strategies display significant variety. Focusing in part on theintellectual formation and choices of particular writers, and in part on theconcrete religious and political circumstances their doctrines were intended4Ian Hunter and David Saunders"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"to address, the following chapters offer insights into the variety of post-scholastic natural law. Even at their most theoretical – indeed, especially attheir most theoretical – seventeenth-century natural law doctrines repre-sented a series of attempts, made in desperate times, to provide politicalauthority with a normative basis capable of withstanding the shatteringimpacts of confessional division and civil disorder.The first set of chapters, grouped under the heading of natural law andpolitical authority, offer three angles on the reworking of the foundationsof natural law. Couched in the accents of French political philosophy, Blandine Kriegel’s chapter is one of the few to address directly the relationbetween post-scholastic natural law and its Thomist predecessor. If the sev-enteenth century witnessed the exhaustion of Thomist transcendentalism,then an alternative basis for law and right had to be found. While the archi-tecture of the sovereign state played a necessary role in providing the secu-rity on which political rights depended, Kriegel argues that something morewas needed to anchor these in humanity. This supplement was provided by the philosophical linking of law and nature, variously achieved in thenatural law doctrines of Hobbes, Locke and Spinoza. Knud Haakonssen’sargument moves in a quite different direction, treating the anchorage ofright in nature as indicative of a streak of moral conservatism in some ofthe new doctrines. Aiming to question the view that ‘modern’ natural lawis characterised by the advent of subjective rights, Haakonssen argues thatat least some natural law doctrines remained grounded in objective duties.Indeed, in the case of Grotius and Burlamaqui these duties remained tied toa moral ontology, indicating that the break with scholasticism was neitheras sudden nor as complete as is sometimes imagined. The question ofwhether Pufendorf’s reconstruction of political obligation also remains tiedto a moral ontology is central to Thomas Behme’s chapter. According toBehme, it does, not in the full-blooded form of scholasticism’s Aristotelianself-perfecting natures or essences, but via the distinctively Pufendorfiangrounding of duties in ‘imposed’ moral personae. While acknowledging that their imposed or instituted character denies Pufendorfian personae thestatus of essences, Behme argues that one of these personae – the ‘natural’one imposed by God – remains substantial enough to establish the moralgrounds and limits of the adventitious ones man imposes on himself, speci-fically the personae of sovereign and subject.Conal Condren’s discussion of Hobbes’ use of the natural law topos is thefirst of three chapters focusing on the problematic relation between churchand state. Writing in the thick of England’s religious civil wars, Condren’sHobbes is above all concerned to deny the clergy access to the oppositionalpowers of natural law by, in effect, placing the interpretation of the latterfirmly in the hands of the civil sovereign. While this buttressing of politi-cal authority was inseparable from its secularisation, the latter was in turninseparable from a certain form of theology – the insistence that God’s willIntroduction5"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"was inscrutable, especially to priests – which, as Condren observes, wouldpose residual problems for Hobbes’ attempt to make the sovereign into itseffective conduit in the political domain. By the 1670s, Jon Parkin arguesin his chapter, the church–state accommodation was assuming a concreteshape – in the form of the Anglican settlement – which required enoughHobbesian statism to force the church to accommodate its dissentingbrethren, yet not so much that the church would become a mere creatureof the sovereign. This was the difficult balance that Richard Cumberlandsought to strike in his natural law treatise, arguing, on the one hand, thatit was impossible to have metaphysical insight into God’s willing of naturallaws (thereby keeping priestcraft at bay), yet, on the other, that humanreason could acquire ‘probable’ knowledge of their contents (thereby pre-venting the transfer of all moral authority to a Hobbesian sovereign). IfParkin’s Cumberland shows how directly natural law doctrine was reshapedin order to address specific religious and political circumstances, thenThomas Ahnert’s discussion of Christian Thomasius confirms this lesson in the German context. In striking contrast to all those histories of theEnlightenment focused on the need to free reason from faith, philosophyfrom religion, Ahnert argues that Thomasius’ central concern was to protect religion from philosophy – particularly from Greek metaphysics,which allowed simple faith to be converted into abstruse doctrines wieldedby power-hungry priests. While Thomasius’ anti-clericalism is here reminis-cent of Hobbes’, Ahnert reminds us that if the partitioning of church andstate was the condition of a desacralised politics, it was no less the condi-tion of a pietistic religion.With Petter Korkman’s discussion of Jean Barbeyrac, we step briefly intothe eighteenth century, and also into the first of three chapters that examinethe role of natural law in establishing the moral limits of the state and thepolitical or legal limits of morality. In adapting post-scholastic natural lawto the needs of the refugee Huguenots, Barbeyrac faced the conflict betweenPufendorf’s construction of political authority – regarded by many as anunstable amalgam of obligation and coercion – and Leibniz’s critique of thisconstruction, which presumed that obligation was founded in reason alone.Barbeyrac negotiated this conflict via the notion of ‘Creator’s right’ – thedoctrine that God has the right to rule that which he creates – which,Korkman argues, is not so much a (modern) justification for obligation asan early modern means of regarding ourselves as creatures always alreadyobligated. Yet this doctrine also functions as a means of limiting the moralclaims of the state, by showing that our obligations to the civil sovereignare much narrower than those owed to the ‘maker’. If the duties imposedby God through divine or natural law outstrip those of the civil sovereign,then it is but a short step to invoke a right of resistance to the latter. Yet, asFrank Grunert argues in his chapter, this was a step that the early modernnatural law writers could not take, owing to their ‘absolutist’ conception 6Ian Hunter and David Saunders"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"of sovereignty – as the imposition of law by a sovereign authority above the law. By the time we reach Kant, arguments for the division of powersand the independence of the judiciary have diminished the need for a right of resistance; yet, Grunert observes, Kant denies citizens a legal trumpagainst the sovereign, referring the matter to the court of public reason. In discussing Hobbes’ reconstruction of justice, Dieter Hüning’s chapterapproaches the problematic border from the side of law rather than moral-ity. With Hobbes’ uncompromising rejection of Thomist natural teleology,Hüning argues, the religious and moral conception of justice in terms of theexercise of natural virtues was discarded, to be replaced by one in whichjustice concerns only the status of actions in a positive legal order createdby the sovereign state. Hüning concludes, somewhat surprisingly, by notingthe resemblances between Kant’s division of law and morality and Hobbes’political construction of the legal order.Clare Jackson’s chapter is the first of two showing how closely the spillingof ink in natural law arguments over sovereignty responded to the spillingof blood by those seeking to attack or defend a particular form of politicalauthority. In 1670s Scotland, the restored monarchy of Charles II remainedunder attack by radical Presbyterian Covenantors committed to taking Scotland into a Calvinist international federation. Under these circum-stances natural law was invoked by the radical Presbyterians as the sourceof a supra-political right of resistance and rebellion, yet also by leading statejurists who sought to harness it to the positive legal order, understood asthe true source of right and duty. Presbyterianism was not the only inter-national phenomenon. Throughout the seventeenth century, the centralworks of post-scholastic natural law and political philosophy criss-crossedEurope, often acquiring new meanings and functions as they did. In hischapter, Robert von Friedeburg focuses on the fortunes of two such works –Henning Arnisaeus’ De jure maiestatis(1610) and Johannes Althusius’ Poli-tica(1603) – as they passed from Imperial Germany into the settings of pre-and post-civil war England and Scotland. Central to Friedeburg’s argumentis the ‘dual’ character of the sovereignty fashioned in the setting of Im-perialStaatsrecht– its existence at both the imperial and territorial levels –which made it possible to combine a strong defence of sovereignty with alimited form of resistance, understood as a right of the imperial states andestates. Translated into the English and Scottish settings, however, this rightof resistance lost its legally demarcated form and bearers, appearing insteadin the far more radical form as a universal moral right grounded in the stateof nature.In discussing the relation between early modern natural law and modernpolitical thought the final four chapters bring into focus an issue implicitin much of the collection. Kari Saastamoinen’s chapter is a timely reminderthat early modern categories – here of civil equality – often elude modernunderstandings, yet, historically interpreted, they can transform our Introduction7"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"understanding of modernity. Hobbes and Pufendorf, Saastamoinen observes,are interpreted as precursors (or betrayers) of the modern egalitarian con-ception of equality, understood in terms of a common capacity for rationalautonomy and its associated rights. Their conceptions, he argues, were quitedifferent: grounded in the notion of the absence of power hierarchies in thestate of nature, and elaborated either in terms of an amoral natural equal-ity (Hobbes) or in terms of the equality imposed by the imperative to culti-vate sociability (Pufendorf ), both conceptions of equality aimed to place thestructuring of social hierarchies at the disposal of the civil sovereign. WithPeter Schröder’s chapter we pass from the law of nature to its partner, thelaw of nations. For Schröder, by identifying natural right with the civil sovereign’s commands – and thereby equating interstate relations with thestate of nature – Hobbes established the problem-horizon for modern inter-national law. Despite Kant’s prospecting of a world federation, Schröderobserves, he failed to move beyond this horizon, adopting a surprisinglyHobbesian view of the legitimacy of sovereign states. In his concludingremarks, Schröder argues that whereas Carl Schmitt’s conception of sover-eignty grasps the Hobbesian nettle – making the sovereign into the finalarbiter of the political question – John Rawls evades the issue, assuming thatthe Hobbesian question of ‘who decides’ can be answered by reason. DuncanIvison approaches the question of sovereignty from a less familiar angle, that of sovereignty’s territorial dimension. Beginning with two modern chal-lenges to the sovereign territorial state – those posed by the globalisation ofeconomy and society, and by the secessionist claims of sub-state ‘identity’groups and peoples – Ivison interrogates early modern justifications forborders. After casting doubt on the two main justifications – defence of prop-erty rights and the provision of political security – Ivison concludes by intro-ducing the notion of a group’s cultural well-being as a better alternative.Michael Seidler’s concluding chapter also begins with the challenges to statesovereignty posed by modern multiculturalism and identity politics, butthen heads in a quite different direction. Taking Pufendorf as his exemplar,Seidler argues that the modern concept of sovereignty was in effect fash-ioned in order to cope with the problem of exercising political authorityover multi-confessional or multi-cultural societies. To this end it was neces-sary that the state should not be the expression of any particular ‘identity’group (principle of desacralisation or neutrality), and that its authority overall sub-state groups should be unchallengeable (principle of sovereignty).The lesson Seidler draws from Pufendorf, then, is that in the face of all claimsfor the moral value of local cultures and identity groups, the sovereign ter-ritorial state retains a pre-eminent value, as the condition of these groups –and their individual members – enjoying civil rights and freedoms, includ-ing those of cultural self-determination. We could scarcely ask for a morestriking instance of the continuing relevance of the early modern naturallaw writers.8Ian Hunter and David Saunders"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Notes1.

The sovereign state and its lawHow should we understand the development of modern politics? Accordingto the main school of German historiography and philosophy – as repre-sented by Ernst Kantorowicz, whose works can serve to summarise a centuryof German thought – there has been only one way of building modern statepower. This way, beginning in medieval times, would eventually mark offthe Ancients from the Moderns. In the course of this development, theancient philosophy of Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas would have beentotally cast into question, replaced by the philosophy of the Moderns: ametaphysics of the subject would substitute for ontology, displacing the philosophy of Being. Given the catastrophic events that emerged in thetwentieth century in western political development – Nazism, the Sovietsystem – some contemporary thinkers, not the least important Leo Straussor Hannah Arendt, have advocated a return pure and simple to the Ancients.According to them, modern philosophy, characterised by its Machiavelliandefining moment, is purported to have entirely separated politics and ethics,and, on a deeper level, to have rendered obsolete the traditional concept ofnatural law. Hegel, as a matter a fact, was a precursor on that path, dedi-cating an entire essay to the critique of natural law as an erroneous abstrac-tion, the working of which is detrimental to an affirmation of the positiveliving right of the various peoples of the earth.In this chapter I shall defend a substantially different thesis. To begin, Iwould like to demonstrate that there is no single exclusive path of politicaldevelopment and no single theory of the state in modern Europe. Rather,at least two great dividing lines, of variable importance, have torn Europeanpolitical theory into separate interpretations.The first dividing line runs between those modern powers of WesternEurope that recovered for themselves the ancient republican doctrines, andthose that did not. After the Italian city-states of the Renaissance, and theSpanish theorists of the sixteenth-century neo-Thomist Salamanca School,13"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"it will be essentially in France, England and Holland that the republican doctrine of state power evolves. Jean Bodin, Thomas Hobbes, Baruch Spinozaand John Locke are the principal and best-known theorists of this develop-ment. The republican doctrine confronts head-on the imperial conceptionthat continued its course in the German Empire. This same republican doctrine also reinstates the opposition – devised by Aristotle – betweenrepublican and despotic regimes. The former aim at fostering the publicinterest, with authority exercised through due process of law on free andequal individuals; the latter aim at maintaining private interest, with author-ity exercised through force on subjected individuals.The republican thinkers benefited from the backing of English and Frenchjurists who consistently refused, in the English kingdom as in the French,to accept the validity of imperial Roman law, heralded at the same periodby the imperial ‘glossators’ in Germany and Italy as the principal source oflaw. Instead, the English and French jurists – together with the politicaljurists of the emerging German territorial states – engineered an entirely newpolitical jurisprudence, for which modern political philosophy took up thetask of establishing theoretical foundations.Reception or, conversely, rejection of Roman law thus marked two distincttypes of political development: on the one hand, the imperial developmentwhich was to penetrate deep into our times, especially in Central and EasternEurope, through the Habsburg Counter-Reformation and the Holy Allianceand through Tsarist autocracy; on the other hand, the republican develop-ment which slowly made its challenge, first in the city-states, then in themonarchical republics of Western Europe, doubtless not without hesitationsand unforeseen reversals.With this republican development as their horizon, the two fundamentaldoctrines of modern power were born: the doctrine – essentially French – ofsovereignty; and the doctrine – essentially British – of the separation ofpowers. Here lies the second dividing line. Each doctrine relies on a differ-ent type of state: the administrative or financial state for the doctrine of sovereignty; the state of justice for the doctrine of the separation of powers.I shall concentrate my discussion on sovereignty. I intend to show thatmodern political jurisprudence relies on a dual foundation that, in theevent, proved capable both of accommodating and rejecting individualrights, in fact the rights of man. But I shall also try to show that these rightsare necessarily based on natural law.The early modern doctrine of power can be summed up in a word: sov-ereignty. Since the Renaissance, the law of the sovereign state has served asa foundation stone for every development in the law of modern states. Therepublic, or the state ruled by law – we could also define it as a state whoselegitimacy derives from a society organised for the good life, the generalinterest of the common good – confers a decisive role on law. Already in thesixteenth century – in the midst of the most strident of the civil wars against14Blandine Kriegel"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Henri III – Jean Bodin defined the principle of sovereignty: ‘A common-wealth (or republic) may be defined as the rightly ordered government of anumber of families, and of those things which are their common concern,by a sovereign power.’1A century later, the principle was dramaticallyrestated by Charles Loyseau: ‘Sovereignty is the defining moment and cul-mination of power, the moment when the state must come into being.’2Theconcepts of legitimate power and of beneficent power are present in theseearly definitions. Supreme power, as Bodin defined it, is also, as Loyseauemphasised,the very essence of the state: ‘Sovereignty is the form which gives being to the state; it is inseparable from the state; without it, the statevanishes.’According to these early modern political theorists, sovereign power wasthe antithesis of feudal power, in the sense that it was neither imperiumnordominium.It was not an imperium, because it was not based on militarypower; and it was not a dominium,because it did not institute a relation ofsubjection, in the manner of the relation between a master and a slave.Theimperiumwas the totality of civil and military powers possessed firstby the Roman kings, then under the republic by the consuls and (duringtheir tenure) the dictators, and finally by the Roman emperors. Their powersincluded the right to command the army, the right to wage war and makepeace (jus belli ac pacis), and the right of life and death (jus vitae necisque).In itemising the attributes of the imperium, one will have itemised the royalpowers. But the imperiumis also the empire, the Roman conception of power that the Germanic Holy Roman Empire would seek to resurrect,beginning with Otto of Swabia in the tenth century. The early modern juristssought to distinguish sharply between sovereign power and imperial power,in order to show that the sovereign state is not a creature of war but ratherof peace, and that it prefers the peaceful negotiation of rights to the clamourof arms.Believing that feudal power militarised politics and individualised justice,the early modern jurists concentrated their attack on two of its principles.First, they attacked the principle that power is essentially force. Legitimatesovereign power, conversely, is grounded in the law of nature rather thanthe law of the gun or sword. Second, the jurists attacked the assimilation ofjustice to struggle and of order to equilibrium in a battle. They supportedthe statist project of attaining a monopoly of justice and of punishment,which involves eliminating both the private feudal wars and the ecclesias-tical tribunals.Feudalism is war, jus vitae necisque, conscription of human life; sovereignpower is peace, security and prohibition of the taking of human life. Sovereign power substitutes law for force and order for death. It consists ofa powerful constraint on the Roman patriae potestas, on the right to deter-mine who shall live and who shall die. It pacifies society, guarantees indi-vidual security and makes the maintenance of life its chief aim. SovereignThe Rule of the State and Natural Law15"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"power is the product of a negotiation of rights rather than an expiation ofarms. The jurists are careful to disqualify domination as a definition ofpower; they reject the feudal relation of dependence and criticise servitudegenerally. Feudal domination was direct: it vassalised the individual, natu-ralised men and privatised politics. This raised three questions to which thestatists sought to reply in the negative.Must subjects be treated as slaves?‘[Feudalism] governs its subjects as thefather of a family does his slaves,’ writes Bodin.3Two doctrines – that ofproperty and that of the appropriation by each individual of himself – ruleout domination as a definition of politics. The relation between governedand governing is understood here as a compromise; only later, with thenatural law philosophers, will the model shift to that of a contract. But thecompromise model suffices to eliminate a series of traditional references:master and servant, commander and soldier, father and son. Most impor-tantly, the classical model of the social relation as that between freeman andslave is decisively broken with. Henceforth, the sovereign who abstains from taking the life or property of his subjects is no longer acting as master.The jurists invoke Christian principles in order to align feudalism with Greekslavery.Must human beings be treated as things?Should the relations betweenhuman beings in society be modelled on the relations between humankindand nature? Medieval natural law defended social microcosms by appeal tophysical macrocosms and viewed human beings as a form of nature amongother forms of nature. The early modern jurists, by contrast, view the lifeand possessions of each individual as the unbreachable limit of politicaldependence. Bodin defines these individual rights in terms of ‘natural libertyand the natural right to property’.4This nominalist view privileges sub-jectivity and interprets the political animal as the product of a culture thatis opposed to nature. Moral beings, writes Pufendorf, are not things likephysical beings: ‘they only possess each other by means of institutions’.5Within the res publica, the individual himself is no longer a thing of whichone can become master and owner. The techniques of governing a res cogi-tanscannot be derived from the rules for possession of a res extensa.Do political relationships derive from property relationships?In a definitionthat would obsess the historiography of the nineteenth century, Loyseaucalls feudalism ‘power by means of property’. This deep and pithy truth leads to a fundamental objection against feudalism: treating people as goods,feudalism confuses public relationships among individuals with the privaterelationship between a human being and a thing. In reacting to this con-fusion, the early modern political jurists developed a double agenda: first,to undo the amalgamation of power and property; second, to secure theautonomy of both the governance of human beings and the possession ofthings. The major premise of this line of reasoning is its claim that publicoffices belong neither to lords nor to a prince, nor even to the state, for they16Blandine Kriegel"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"arethe state itself. We can observe in passing that this dissociation of powerfrom property – giving rise to the autonomy of politics – is responsible forthe fundamental difference between the early modern political and legaltheory on the one hand, and nineteenth-century social philosophy on theother, for the latter continues to tie power firmly to economics.For the early modern political and natural jurists, then, sovereignty is firstand foremost the absolute autonomy of the state. The law of the sovereignstate aims at two targets simultaneously: externally, it fights against theimperial idea; internally, against the feudal world. In its double animosity,it strives to establish a modern state and to rationalize the work of politicsin two main directions.First, the sovereignty principle recognises the necessary plurality of statesand, hence, of an international order which is opposed to the notion of a single universal Empire. This recognition early prompted the search inEurope – no later than the second half of the seventeenth century – for acontinental balance of states. The law of the sovereign state is associatedwith the appearance of modern international law that, from 1625 onwards,found definite expression in Grotius’ Law of War and Peace. Here the basicequality and inherent plurality of sovereign states are clearly stated. Theirrelations must, henceforth, be regulated by consent and peace, putting anend to all conceptions of a universal empire. Within these relationshipsbetween states, la bella diplomatica– in the wonderful Italian terminology,a war waged through display of ‘diplome’, i.e. titles and documents – replaceswar as we know it. One no longer fights with soldiers and muskets, but with legal briefs and documents. The ambassador replaces the mercenary.Times are ripe for protracted negotiations, for the frantic search for juridi-cal memories, for the editing and revision of law codices; times are ripe forthe triumph of legists and constitutions, for the ascendancy of states ruledby law.Second, the law of the sovereign state increasingly affirms the priority ofdomestic politics over foreign policy, the supremacy of civilian rule over themilitary factor. The first duty of the state becomes good administration, the delivery of good justice across the whole ‘square field’ or ‘pré carré’inthe formula of Vauban, at first military and civilian adviser to Louis XIV butlater his opponent. Arbitration of conflicts through law directly underminesthe pre-eminence of the dominium; it leads to a complete severance of thelinks between power and property. This rationalising of the state alreadyentails an elementary enunciation of individual rights. Thus, Bodin beginshis doctrine of sovereignty by establishing that it is limited, from its incep-tion, by divine and natural law; that it encompasses fundamental rights,such as liberty, full property in goods acquired – these are the first histori-cal formulation of the rights of man – and, then, the fundamental laws ofthe realm. In this way the rights of man are introduced through the estab-lishment of the republican state.The Rule of the State and Natural Law17"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Yet, at the very heart of this theory of the sovereign state that fought sostrenuously against empire and feudalism, there remains something stillbelonging to a different and more ancient world. To recognise this imperialresiduum will assist our understanding of the inherent contradictions of sovereignty. For sovereignty remains welded to power, public power perhaps,but still power. Its strength comes from a sheer decision of will-power. Bodin,once again, devised the mechanism in his Six Books of the Republicof 1576,when he adamantly refused to adopt the model of common law jurispru-dence with its debates, controversies, precedents and deliberations, to whichhe opposes administrative decision-making, established a priori throughdecrees and commands. Henceforth, sovereignty will rely on will-power, initially the singular will of a monarch in a monarchy, but, quite soon, the‘general will’ of the people under a republic, following the system of calcu-lus elaborated by Rousseau, two centuries later. But the ruler, whether indi-vidual or collective, will none the less remain legibus solutus, liberated fromthe laws, absolute. From this slow development of the power of will, whichin the event becomes the will of power for a subject relentlessly called tostrike heroic attitudes, we can easily retrace the early re-emergence of abso-lutist deviations and imperial temptations under the absolute monarchy ofLouis XIV, in ancien régimeconditions or, in nineteenth-century France,under the First and Second Empires.The problem raised here is how one imposes limitations on sovereignty.The original limits, as conceived by Bodin for the moral, religious and juridi-cal realms, will tend to become eroded, if not forgotten. Sovereignty withinthe state will tend to become sovereignty of the state, a state now unbound,recognising no authority or constraint other than its own positive right torule. Such a state has entered into conflict with all other political rights –most conspicuously, the rights of man.II. Human rightsThe rights of man were born and raised within the realm of the rule of thestate, but soon they had to break away from their place of birth. A mistakeis frequently made when defining them: it is widely believed that the rightsof man have been inscribed in positive law from time immemorial. Nothingis further from the truth. Everyone knows, of course, the two great declara-tions of the Enlightenment (the American Declaration of Independence of1776 and the French Declaration of 1789), and it is assumed that from thattime onwards, the rights of man entered the realm of modern politics. Butthis is to commit not one, but two mistakes.First mistake: it is necessary to distinguish between America and Europe.If the delay in the principles becoming institutionalised was rather short inthe United States – they appear in the US Constitution by 1787 – it has takenthe French Declaration so much longer. Not until 1946, and the victory 18Blandine Kriegel"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"over Nazism, did they appear in the preamble to the Constitution of theFourth Republic.But one can also commit a second, and opposite mistake, by under-estimating the antiquity of their genesis. If we consider the philosophicalprinciples implicit in human rights, one has to go much further back, atleast one century before the Declarations, to discover them in the doctrinesof political philosophers. Here, we must slightly change our geopoliticalsetting. If the law of the state can be retraced essentially to a French origin,human rights – despite the influence of the Declaration of 1789 – clearlyderive from an English cultural setting or, more precisely, an Anglo-Dutchsetting. Three philosophers – Hobbes, Spinoza and Locke – deduced the fun-damentals. In this field their legacy is paramount, for they have bequeathedto us the complete list of these rights, together with their philosophicalfoundations.The complete list first. To Hobbes, we owe the demonstration of the rightto safety: every single man has a right freely to possess his own body; everyman has a right to preserve his own life. As a correlate, a necessary conse-quence, no one can be a slave or possess a right of life and death oversomeone else (in other terms, this is the end of the old Roman imperial rightof life and death over the soldier-citizen). To Spinoza, we owe the liberty ofconsciousness: every man has the right to think the way he wishes, nobodyshould constrain a judgement of consciousness. All civil liberties of opinionand expression derive from there. To Locke, we owe the freedom of prop-erty: every man has a right to appropriate for himself a part of nature underthe guise of objects, which he owns. The correlate is here that only indi-viduals and not governments may claim the right to dominate nature; economics must remain separate from politics. To all of them, finally, weowe that fundamental conception, the equality of individuals, which restson the idea that humankind is fundamentally one.The rights of man. The unity of humankind. This set of ideas does not stem from pagan times, as that subtle expert on Roman law, the lateProfessor Michel Villey, established long ago. The rights of man have littlein common with the rights of Rome. How could the former have been con-ceived when homoas opposed to civis– the citizen – designated a manwithout any right, a slave, as Hannah Arendt once pithily remarked? Butfurthermore, it is impossible to inscribe any right of man in law until youhave expressed the philosophical or theological notion that humankind isone. This very idea is incompatible with a pagan world where cities and evengods are different by nature, heterogeneous in principle. The notion of onesingle humankind is limited to monotheism, in our tradition, to the Bible.That is why all thinkers on that subject have sought it in the Scriptures or,to adopt Spinoza’s terminology, in the model-state of the Hebrews.Can the rights of man find a foundation other than biblical revelation?All the theorists of the rights of man have answered affirmatively. Where,The Rule of the State and Natural Law19"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"to the minds of the seventeenth-century rationalist thinkers, does the foun-dation of these rights lie? The philosophical foundation is to be discoveredonly in ‘natural law’.But, here, confusion and misunderstandings have to be avoided. NeitherHobbes nor Spinoza nor Locke, nor any of the early theorists of the rightsof man, are medieval nostalgics, not to mention Torquemada-style inquisi-tors. They believed adamantly that man possesses a nature, that it is sheerfolly or stupidity to deny its existence, to reject or refute its working. Sowhat do they think is the essence of human nature? They answer, precisely:human nature entails nature combined with law, natura cum lege. Ourphilosophers do not think like Aristotelians, they do not think that humannature reflects a hierarchical cosmos ordained by inequality, but, conversely,as contemporaries of Galileo and Newton, they borrow from modern sciencethe concept of a nature combined with law. This concept is closely relatedto the notion of the infinite universe, where mathematical constraints lead,at the same time, both to a rigorous definition of the relationship betweenobjects, and to a description of these objects of the world as fundamentallyequal.What is common to the definitions devised by all three philosophers,Hobbes, Spinoza, Locke? The rights of man do not stem from a violent break with nature. Hobbes insists: the right to safety is not a liberty, it is anobligation. It is a law of nature discovered by reason that implies that noone should ever attempt to harm his own life. Let us not misunderstand ourphilosophers here. They were not naïve to the point of believing that mendo not kill, rob or oppress consciousness, as everyone can experiencemurder, theft and manipulation of the mind in daily life. Their point issimple: with each transgression of what the Decalogue forbids, the inevitableconsequence will be the withering of human society into barbarity. If menwant to live together in societies, they must abide by these laws, or risk thedestruction of what is specifically human in their societies.Reformulating the whole problem at the end of the eighteenth century,Kant will simply state that nature has taken care of instituting man, andman alone, as the keeper or the trespasser of the law, his own law. But ifthere exists such a thing as a law of nature, it also means that the rights ofman are not English, French, Dutch, European or western, as non-Europeanconservative thinkers, opposed to the rights of man, have always stated.Rather, their value may be considered as universal since all men are endowedwith a single identical name: humanity. Here, Kant has himself drawn theultimate consequence: the rights of man cannot be properly institutedwithout a humankind finally unified through the peaceful coexistence ofstates ruled by law, that is to say by a universal republic.The political rights embedded in the rights of man are thus linked withhumankind itself, and although their formulation appeared in the devel-opment of the modern state, their foundations are entirely different, anthro-20Blandine Kriegel"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"pologically and philosophically, from the doctrine of state sovereignty. Thatdoctrine relies on two bases: first, uniformity, because – as Bodin maintains– the sovereign acts only by establishing rules; second, will-power, becausethe rules the state proclaims are decreed by a decision. Hence one can easilyground the anthropology and the philosophy of the sovereign state on adoctrine of will-power and decision-making, fundamentals that may beunearthed in the metaphysics of Descartes. But one can do no such thingwith the doctrine of human rights, since it is, from its inception, based onrelationships between individuals. Its universality is vastly different from theuniversality of empire, based on conquest. It belongs, rather, to the univer-sal ambition of a modern universal republic.What are the metaphysical foundations of theory resting solely on thestrength of the ego cogito? The dualisms of mind and body, will and under-standing, are the guiding forces behind the modern project to make man‘master and possessor of nature’. From this point onward, nature is deliv-ered up to the brute force of ‘animal machines’ and to the eternal silenceof the infinite spaces that filled Pascal with dread. Nature is dispossessed ofvalues and qualities. Man’s only remaining connection to nature is quanti-tative, lying in the clear and distinct mathematical ideas of number, figure,extension and time that make up his ratio.Viewed in this light, nature isthe object of finite knowledge but it cannot be the object of infinite moralengagement. Of mind and world, thought and reality, subject and object,something has fallen by the wayside, and something else has come to thefore. The concept of natural law is gone. The order of human nature is nowconceived in terms of art and making, a product of convention and intel-lection. Man is now set on the path to discover being anew through a hardand complicated demand. The adventures of modern subjectivity begin, asman sets himself to inventing new possible worlds.This is the conception of human nature held by a good many thinkers of the modern natural right school. Hugo Grotius, for example, explicitlyformulated the idea that law is founded, above all else, on reason: ‘The lawof nature is a dictate of right reason.’ Echoing Gregory of Rimini’s hypoth-esis, he adds that ‘everything we have just said would hold true in one wayor another even if one granted – what one cannot grant without commit-ting a horrible crime – that God did not exist, or that he exists but takes nointerest in human affairs’.6For Grotius, legal acts are to be measured not byan external standard of natural law or the will of God, but by the rationalnature of man, by what human consciousness deems reasonable. The forceof law has ceased to be natural and objective; it has become rational andsubjective. Natural right now receives rational foundations that areautonomous and secular, severed from natural law. A similar view of naturedevoid of values and spirit is at the root of Pufendorf’s hostile, almost hor-rifying account of the state of nature. For both Grotius and Pufendorf, civilsociety is founded on man’s natural need for sociability, and the common-The Rule of the State and Natural Law21"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"weal is only a human invention. If God no longer exists or has no concernfor human affairs, if the state of nature is a state of war where lawless pas-sions are unleashed, then one must imagine a conventional foundation forlegitimate power. Civil right must stem from a contract of submission orassociation promulgated by an act of free will, and civility must be recon-stituted through the will of the human subject.It is not at all unreasonable to observe that the fundamental inspirationat work in this theory’s juridical subjectivism is the essential division inCartesian psychology between the nature of things and the nature of man.It is just as pertinent to note that this theory’s conception of the equalityand natural freedom of individuals also reinforces the part played by consentand contract in the establishment of political society, and thereby finds aplace for particular civil rights. But the fact remains that the voluntarism ofthe school of natural rights is simply too weak to provide a juridical basisfor human rights. In the end, Grotius and Pufendorf are nothing more thantheorists of voluntary servitude and absolute monarchy.Even among the voluntarists, however, there is disagreement, especiallyregarding their recognition or rejection of natural law. Everyone in theschool recognises natural right, but natural law is another matter. This difference in viewpoints is linked to different conceptions of human natureand the relation of man to the world. Grotius and Pufendorf stop short ofHobbes’ theory of human right. In Leviathan, Hobbes deems those rightswholly alienable in so far as personal safety is not legitimately submitted toa contract. He had established, previously, a distinction between natural lawand natural right: ‘Because right, consisteth in liberty to do, or to forbeare;whereas law, determineth, and bindeth to one of them: so that law, andright, differ as much, as obligation, and liberty.’7What is natural law?Hobbes gives a clear answer: ‘A law of nature is a precept, or general rule,found out by reason, by which a man is forbidden to do, that, which isdestructive of his life.’8On this fundamental natural law the first humanright is established, the right to safety, inalienable and unchanging from thestate of nature to civil society.There is an alternative path, suggested by Hobbes, Spinoza and Locke.Despite widespread confusion about juridical subjectivism, the rights ofman, and the school of natural right, I suggest that a distinction be made.There are, it seems to me, significant divisions that must be examined withinthis school, which is far from a homogeneous entity. The divisions can beseen quite clearly in the different conception of the state of nature held bynatural right theorists from Hobbes to Rousseau. To one, the state of natureis sociability; to another, solitude; to others, either instinct or morality, waror peace.In fact not all the natural right thinkers are Cartesian; neither Spinoza norLocke holds the voluntarist views about nature, man, natural right andnatural law that were sketched above. In his Ethics, Spinoza writes explicitlyof the problematic alienating of individual natural right in the process of22Blandine Kriegel"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"constituting civil society: ‘In order, then, that men may be able to live inharmony and be a help to one other, it is necessary for them to cede theirnatural right, and beget confidence one in the other that they will donothing by which one can injure the other.’9This does not mean that mencede their right to a superior whose mere will determines justice. Convincedthat the doctrine of final causality turned nature on its head, Spinoza didnot take up the idea of a geometrical expanse devoid of immanent law.Instead, he showed the following: that at the heart of nature, essence andexistence have equal value; that all is necessity and there is no contingency;that because nature is immanent there is but one world, since God couldnot have fashioned things other than they were made nor in any otherorder; and that there is thus no free creation. In Book 2 of the Ethics, Spinozaadds that there is no real distinction between mind and body becausethought and extension are equal attributes of nature, and that there is nodistinction between concept and nature because ‘the order and connectionof ideas are the same as the order and connection of things’.10In Book 4,he then maintains that there are no insurmountable contradictions orunbridgeable gaps between nature, man and the city:Reason demands nothing which is opposed to nature, it demands. . . thatevery person should love himself, should seek his own profit – what istruly profitable to him – should desire everything that really leads manto greater perfection, and absolutely that every one should endeavour, asfar as in him lies, to preserve his own being.11Reason is rooted in natural law, which seeks our conservation and utility inthe affirmation and full blossoming of life. It is natural for man to live byreason and to live with other men:In the same way, the rational association of men is founded on naturallaw: For that is most profitable to man which most agrees with his ownnature, that is to say, man (as is self-evident). But a man acts absolutelyfrom the laws of his own nature when he lives according to the guidanceof reason, and so far only does he always necessarily agree with the natureof another man.12Natural law has thus not been eliminated since the realm of nature hasnot been left behind. As Spinoza suggests, one cannot escape nature; itencapsulates society and culture. The full range of sentiments suited to civillife can be deduced from within the natural order itself. What is morenatural than a sentiment? Instead of opposing the natural right of individ-ual force with the conventional and voluntarist character of civil legislation,Spinoza speaks of civil laws finding their roots in natural law. A naturalmovement governs the progress achieved in establishing the body politicand civil society. Nature’s movement does not consist in an exercise of theThe Rule of the State and Natural Law23"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"will, but in attaining the knowledge that man needs nature and other indi-viduals, and that nothing affirms and preserves his life more than other menwho have made the same discovery.Unlike other modern natural right theorists, then, Spinoza does notground legal theory in the subjectivity of the will. He writes that ‘a manwho is guided by reason is freer in a state where he lives according to thecommon laws than he is in solitude, where he obeys himself alone’.13Civilsociety for Spinoza does not rest on subjective individualism. Instead, hekeeps a place for the idea of a legal standard that is also a natural need fora natural being. More than anything, Spinoza gives man’s right to securitya natural foundation by making the individual right to self-preservation andself-determination the immanent law of civil association.Locke’s foundations are no more Cartesian than Spinoza’s. Of course,along with everyone else in the natural right school, Locke recognises theexistence of a state of nature, distinct from the state of civil society. Thenatural state is a state of perfect freedom and equality but in no way a stateof licence, being subject to natural law. As it is for Spinoza, natural law for Locke is first and foremost the right to life: ‘[B]eing all equal and inde-pendent, no one ought to harm another in his Life, Health, Liberty, or Possessions.’14Man may freely dispose of his person and his property, buthe must not destroy himself since life itself does not belong to him. Like-wise, the possibility of seeking compensation against aggression is foundedon the right to self-preservation, the ‘right of preservation of the humanrace’. Matters of natural law – life, the body, security – cannot be the objectof despotic determination because they are divine gifts flowing from man’smembership in the human race. For Locke, the state of nature is in no waya state of war wherein life is laid bare to enmity and destruction. On thecontrary, the state of war is the opposite of the state of nature, since naturallaw and justice are lacking in war. As Locke puts it: ‘[H]e who attempts toget another Man into his Absolute Power does thereby put himself into aState of War with him.’15The state of war forges a bond of servitude and domination. To bring anend to that state and to rediscover order and natural justice was preciselythe ‘one great Reason of Mens putting themselves into Society, and quittingthe State of Nature’.16The establishment of political society does not appearto Locke, any more than to Spinoza, as an escape from the rule of naturallaw. It is rather an attempt to fulfil natural law by other means and thusovercome the state of bondage and war that disrupted the state of nature.Locke similarly denies that the bond of paternity is a model for society. Thebeginning of political society is the union of man and wife in their pro-creative destiny to continue the species. The law of nature is still bindingin society, ‘as an Eternal Rule to all Men, Legislators as well as others’.17Political society is established wherever people associate in a body politicand appoint for themselves judges to settle their differences in accord with24Blandine Kriegel"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"explicitly declared laws. But in doing this, civil society does not abolish thenatural law. What men abjure, what individuals relinquish in civil society,is only ‘the executive power of the laws of nature’, that is, the natural rightof justice. Natural law itself never disappears. When legislators make laws,‘the rules that they make for other men’s actions must, as well as their ownand other men’s actions, be conformable to the law of nature – that is, tothe will of God, of which that is a declaration – and the fundamental lawof nature being the preservation of mankind, no human sanction can begood or valid against it’.18In short, the Moderns are divided. Some follow Descartes’ concept ofnature and subjectivity. For them, nature is remote and separated from thesubject, right resides within reason alone, and society is founded on an actof calculating will. The entire legal structure is reconstructed on the basis ofindividuals who make up its indivisible elements, while the civil order isreconstituted on the basis of geometry, as if human beings were lines andpoints. At times, these natural right thinkers see men forming associationsbased on conventions and rights granted to individuals, at times they seethem agreeing to voluntary servitude. Real human rights, however, are con-signed to oblivion, obliterated by the civil rights to which they give way.But other natural right thinkers oppose division between man and theworld. When an individual renounces his natural right, he does not therebyremove himself from the natural law. When he surrenders his right to actalone and so seek revenge, he delegates his initiative to a larger body andthereby establishes a more complete form of justice. This preserves his lifeand perpetuates his species, for the sake of life itself. As a being created byGod and existing in nature, man preserves his own life, but he can neithersever himself from life nor seize complete control of it. The sole foundationof society and the only legitimation of the political order do not lie in delegating the executive power of the natural law that founds sovereigntyand justice, so as to guarantee the conservation of life and to ensure humanrights to security, freedom, and equality. Human rights determine civilrights, but natural law remains an abiding principle.This brief investigation teaches an important lesson about the develop-ment of human rights. If these rights have their origin not in subjective idealism and legal voluntarism, but rather in those works of modern legaltheory which preserve a link with natural law, then it is essential for thosewho believe in human rights that these rights be rooted in the idea ofnatural law.Notes1.

The idea that it is as bearers of rights that people lend legitimacyto and seek protection from political authority is taken to be the legacy of a chequered history of political theory and practice. In this history Protestant natural lawyers played a significant early role and, consequently,it is to these thinkers that one is often led when searching for the originsof the idea of rights. However, I want to suggest, not for the first time, thatit is a misconception of early modern natural law to think that one of itsprominent features was to be based on a theoretically significant theory ofindividual rights. While all natural lawyers operated with a notion of rights,and while there were politically important invocations of rights, the systemsof Protestant natural law from the sixteenth to the late eighteenth centuriesmade the concept of rights theoretically subordinate, not foundational, and, in general, politically impotent. The reason for this is that these rightstheories harboured a deep-seated moral conservatism.This is a case where the undoubted exceptions confirm the general rule. The question is how extensive and important such exceptions were. In a bold and inspired interpretation of political thought from the latescholastics to Kant, Richard Tuck has suggested that it was not a matter ofexceptionalism at all; rather, Locke, Rousseau and Kant, followed by lesserluminaries, were the appreciative heirs to Grotius’ and Hobbes’ reworkingof the individualism and rights theory which they found in the humanistscholarship of Gentili and others.1Tim Hochstrasser and others have drawnattention to the distinctive rights theory which was worked out by Jean Barbeyrac under the influence of Grotius; this was again developed by JeanJacques Burlamaqui, who has been seen by Morton White and others,including myself, as of considerable significance for the American foundingfathers.2James Moore and Michael Silverthorne have suggested that theScottish moral philosopher Gershom Carmichael worked out a coherent27"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"rights theory at the turn of the seventeenth century.3I have tried to connectHobbes’ notion of rights with conventionalism in morals, by which I meanthe idea that morality is entirely a contingent product of the interactionbetween individuals. I see this idea brought to fruition in Hume and Smithagainst the dual background of Hobbes’ reduction of rights to mere claimsor demands and the wide variety of contract theories. My basic conclusionhas been that Hume and Smith between them transformed both the rightstheory and the contractarianism found in their predecessors and a greatmany of their successors. In other words, I have been at pains to show thatmoral conventionalism has been a much greater rarity in the history ofmoral and political thought than is often thought.4This general conclusionmight be difficult to maintain if early modern political theory was domi-nated by the notion of individual rights, depending on what this notionmore precisely means.It is this last question that I want to address below by concentrating onjust two of the people mentioned above: Grotius and Burlamaqui. Whilereadily acknowledging that these thinkers proposed important ideas ofrights which were in some measure novel, I want to suggest that their ideasare not quite what they have been made out to be – neither theoreticallyfundamental nor morally or politically radical. By looking at these two, wehave both the early seventeenth-century ‘founder’ and a mid-eighteenth-century conveyor of the modern theory of rights. What is more, we havethinkers who wrote on either side of the great European debate in the lastquarter of the seventeenth and first half of the eighteenth century about themetaphysical status of morality. This was a confrontation between, on theone hand, protagonists for a variety of scholastic and ancient ideas of moral-ity as inherent in the structure of the world and accessible to human reasonalong with the rest of the world, and, on the other hand, people who sawmorality as somehow superadded to the world through acts of will – divineand human – perceptible only through their empirical manifestations.5I willsuggest that both Grotius’ and Burlamaqui’s theories or rights belong in theformer of these schools of thought and that this accounts for their lack ofphilosophical radicalism.6I. GrotiusHaving indicated the field within which we are moving, I turn to thefounder of the modern school of Protestant natural law, Hugo Grotius. The question has often been raised whether Grotius founded anything newat all. Thus, to take just two of the commonest points, Grotius’ famous assertion, that the laws of nature would hold ‘though we should even grant,what without the greatest Wickedness cannot be granted, that there is noGod, or that he takes no Care of human Affairs’, has been ascribed to several earlier thinkers, the most obvious direct source for Grotius himselfbeing Suárez’s paraphrase of Gregory of Rimini in words closely resembling28Knud Haakonssen"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Grotius’ own.7Second, Grotius’ fundamental concept of iusas a subjectiveright has been put further and further back, at present at least to the twelfthcentury.8So what was new about Grotius and what sense does it make totalk of a modern school of natural law founded by him, as his younger con-temporaries and followers did?Richard Tuck suggests that the crucial point is Grotius’ concern to refutemoral scepticism.9Tuck has argued that Grotius set up his main work as,among many other things, a refutation of the kind of moral scepticism socommon in his time and perhaps best known in Montaigne and Charron,according to which it was impossible to find any common moral standardsin humanity, in other words, what we would call moral relativism. Againstthis Grotius maintained that there was one moral standard common to allpeople – the concern with self-preservation – and that this concern meantin practice the laws of nature, for only an adherence to these laws couldsecure self-preservation. The laws of nature are, however, to be understoodin terms of rights; it is only through the recognition of and respect for each other’s rights that people can be preserved. All our positive moral andcivil institutions serve this purpose. Grotius goes on to argue for an abso-lutist state by suggesting that we must understand people to have given uptheir rights to the state for the sake of protection. Tuck has, however, arguedthat Grotius appreciated the possibility of a different line of argument,namely that we must charitably presume that people have reserved certainbasic rights which may be held against any ruler. The novelty of Grotius incomparison with earlier rights thinkers is thus, on Tuck’s reading, not onlythat he meets moral scepticism with his doctrine of the universality of self-preservation through the recognition of individual rights, but also that forhim these rights are prior to any relationship of justice. A succession ofearlier thinkers, such as Ockham, Gerson and Suárez, had a clear notion ofiusas something subjective or belonging to the individual, but they pre-supposed that such iurawere related to each other in terms of rules of justice.In Grotius, according to Tuck, the rules of justice arise from men’s relatingtheir individual iurato each other for the sake of self-preservation. Tuck goeson to suggest that this subjective rights theory is radicalised by Hobbes,through whom it becomes the core of the most significant form of liberalindividualism up to and including Kant.My concern here is not to dispute the suggestion that Grotius provides ananswer to scepticism, nor that he and Hobbes have a significant role in whatwe have come to recognise as a liberal and individualistic line of thought.My purpose is to show that the type of rights theory employed by Grotiusand continued by most modern natural rights thinkers, here represented byBurlamaqui, is not a suitable means to individualistic purposes. We maybegin from the fact that in the voluntarist controversies which Pufendorf’swork gave rise to, Grotius was commonly taken to be a realist, asserting theinherent validity or undeniability of the laws of nature. Prima facie thereappears to be some incongruity between this standpoint and the idea of theThe Moral Conservatism of Natural Rights29"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"absolute primacy of subjective rights. If subjective rights are prior to anyrelations of justice, and if self-preservation is a universal value, it is a littledifficult to see why Grotius should not universally have been considered aHobbesian.Grotius approaches his definition of iusas follows:as in Societies, some are equal, as those of Brothers, Citizens, Friends andAllies. And others unequal . . . as that of Parents and Children, Mastersand Servants, King and Subject, God and Man: So that which is just[justum] takes Place either among Equals, or amongst People whereofsome are Governors and others governed, considered as such. The latter,in my Opinion, may be called the Right [ius] of Superiority, and theformer the Right [ius] of Equality.(Rights of War and Peace I. 1. iii, 2)In other words, iusis determined by relations of justice, and it is only de-rivative from this that we have another sense of the word, as Grotius goeson to explain:There is another Signification of the Word Right [ius] different from this,but yet arising from it, which relates directly to the Person: In whichSense Right is a moral Quality annexed to the Person, enabling him tohave or to do something justly [juste habendum vel agendum].(I. 1. iv)Finally, Grotius acknowledges that:There is also a third Sense of the Word Right [ius], according to which itsignifies the same Thing as Law [lex], when taken in its largest Extent, as being a Rule of Moral Actions, obliging us to that which is good andcommendable.(I.1.ix)By way of summary, he says that:Natural Right [ius naturale] is the Rule and Dictate of Right Reason,shewing the Moral Deformity or Moral Necessity there is in any Act,according to its Suitableness or Unsuitableness to a reasonable Nature,and consequently, that such an Act is either forbid or commanded byGod, the Author of Nature.(I.1.x, 1)It seems clear that what Grotius means is that subjective iuraare to be under-stood as set or defined by objective relations of justice stated by laws of30Knud Haakonssen"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"nature. A person’s claim is not in the proper moral sense a ius, unless therelation between the claimant and the object or state of affairs claimed is ajust one. A iusis not simply something we have, but something we havejustly.There are additional considerations. As we saw in the second of the quotations above, iusin the subjective sense is taken to be a moral qualityof the person, ‘enabling him to have, or do, something justly’. Now this, tous strange, doctrine is also a clear echo of older ideas. Thinkers like Gersontalk of iusas a power of the soul, which I take to be the ability to judge inmatters of justice and to act accordingly. Seen in this light, the subjectivityof Grotius’ notion of iusis that of an active power, rather than that of own-ership. In fact, by so clearly taking up this aspect of the concept he is ineffect helping to transform a traditional medieval idea into the modern ideaof a moral power or a moral sense as at one and the same time a cognitiveand a motivating faculty, a point we will return to below. In other words –words that are deliberately anachronistic – we can see that Grotius, in tryingto sort out the concept of ius, is approaching both the realist thesis that iuraare constituted through objective relations of justice, and the cognitivistthesis that iusis a faculty adequate to perceive these relations, and the moralagency thesis that iusis an active power enabling us to establish individualinstances of these relations.We can throw further light on these matters by looking more closely atthe suggestion that the concept of self-preservation is at the heart ofGrotius’s enterprise. Tuck quotes Grotius’ words, that ‘the first Impressionof nature’ is ‘that Instinct whereby every Animal seeks its own Preservation,and loves its Condition, and whatever tends to maintain it’, and goes on to say that this ‘instinct may be governed by rational reflection on the needs of society, but social life itself is to a great extent the product of man’snecessity’. In support he quotes the following passage from Grotius:Right Reason, and the Nature of Society . . . does not prohibit all Mannerof Violence, but only that which is repugnant to Society, that is, whichinvades another’s Right: For the Design of Society is, that every oneshould quietly enjoy his own, with the Help, and by the united Force ofthe whole Community.Grotius’ two basic principles are thus, according to Tuck, those of ‘self-preservation and the ban on wantoninjury’.10We are left with the sugges-tion that our instincts of self-preservation are our rights, honed a little by reason to make society possible as a more effective vehicle for self-preservation.This, however, does not seem to capture Grotius’ point, which is a Stoictheory of the following sort. A person is first of all issued with certain ‘primanaturae’, which the eighteenth-century English translator renders as ‘firstThe Moral Conservatism of Natural Rights31"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"impressions of nature’, or instincts of self-preservation or desires. Secondly,man is provided with:the Knowledge of the Conformity of Things with Reason, which is aFaculty more excellent than the Body; and this Conformity, in whichDecorum [honestum] consists, ought to be preferred to those Things,which mere natural Desire at first prompts us to . . . we must then, inexamining the Law of Nature [jure naturae], first consider whether thePoint in Question be conformable to the first Impressions of Nature, andafterwards, whether it agrees with the other natural Principle, which, tho’posterior, is more excellent, and ought not only to be embraced when itpresents itself [like the first impressions], but also by all Means to besought after.(I. 2. i, 2)This, I submit, can be taken to mean only that an act of mere natural self-preservation can be accorded only the status of a ius, when it has passed thetest of right reason. This is clearly shown in the sequel, where Grotius saysthat it is only within the honestumestablished by right reason that we candistinguish between, on the one hand, justice in the strict sense as con-cerned with iuraand, on the other hand, all other moral actions which aremerely ‘commendable’ (laudabile) and not required and enforceable. Againstthis background he maintains that ‘Among the first Impressions of Nature[i.e. as far as our instincts for self-preservation are concerned] there isnothing repugnant to War; nay, all Things rather Favour it’; but once rightreason is applied to such matters, questions of justice or of rightfulacts ofself-preservation arise. This is exactly the way Francis Hutcheson, a centurylater, read Grotius on this point:he [Grotius] deduces the notion of right from these two; first, the initianaturae, or the natural desires, which do not alone constitute right, tillwe examine also the other, which is the convenientia cum natura rationaliet sociali[the suitableness to a rational and social nature].11I think we can now see that Grotius’ notion of the subjectivity of iuswasnowhere as radical as has been claimed. He is clearly not suggesting thatmen approach life issued with natural rights which establish relations andinstitutions of justice. He is, rather, suggesting that we approach life withmanifold claims and desires, which are accorded the moral status of rightsin the light of judgements of justice. It is thus not simply as seekers of self-preservation but also as moral judges and agents that men cometogether in society. This combination of self-preservation and moral judge-ment is Grotius’ answer to the moral sceptics. It is in effect a statement ofthe sort of doctrine which, in its eighteenth-century formulations, was oftentermed rational self-interest and which was fiercely maintained in opposi-32Knud Haakonssen"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"tion to the ‘selfish’ systems of Hobbes, Mandeville and the like. Rationalself-interest of this sort is not simply a more cunning egoism aiming at thelong, rather than the short term – à laHobbes. Rather, it assumes that theself in which we are to be rationally interested is the image of God and assuch to be found in every other person. So when we look after ourselves,we must remember that we have a similar reason, morally speaking, to lookafter our neighbour. Herein lies the real significance of Grotius’ doctrinethat, in addition to our simple need for other people and society, we havean independent liking for society and for our neighbour.When we turn to the obvious question of the notion of justice in termsof which rights are accorded, we appear to come close to a circle. Grotius’theory is that justice in the strict sense consists in the abstaining from injuryto the rights of others. This, however, presupposes a prior judgement todetermine what such rights are. If the considerations above are correct, thisjudgement cannot be simply a prudential one to the effect that others haveto be left with certain things in order that they may leave us alone with ourthings. It must be a moral judgement to the effect that it is morally correctthat we each be left with certain things as our rights; and this is, as far as Ican tell, exactly what Grotius is saying. Beyond this it is difficult to go withGrotius’ text. He does not say that such judgements are intuitive; he doesnot say clearly that the rightness, which is their object, is a quality in theagent and/or the action; and he does not say that the moral character of themaintenance of rights arises from the equal recognition of such rights inothers. All of this seems to lie around the corner and it is tempting to readit into Grotius. What he does say is that, as a matter of fact, it is almost uni-versally considered right reason to recognise certain things as rights, namelyrights of liberty, property and contract. What he does not say is that this isonly for prudential reasons of private self-preservation. In short, it is notpossible to detach the concept of subjective right from the idea of an inde-pendent moral judgement.Grotius’ real novelty is not a radically subjective concept of iuson the pro-prietary model, that is, as something each individual has command of inthe service of his self-preservation. It is, rather, the subjective concept of iusas a moral power to judge what we, meaning everyone, rightfully shouldhave. The reason for this novelty is that Grotius’ idea entirely confoundedthe traditional way of thinking about obligation. Both before and for a longtime after Grotius, obligation primarily meant the binding of the will by asuperior power. We find this concept not only in voluntarist thinkers suchas Pufendorf, but in those of a realist inclination like Suárez. This is particu-larly difficult for the modern mind to accept because in effect it denies the implication between goodness and obligation. We may be able to seethe moral goodness of a certain line of action but it is only made obligatoryin the strict sense when commanded by a superior. Those thinkers who pre-ceded Grotius in maintaining that the laws of nature would hold even inabstraction from God were in fact only saying that humans can see that theThe Moral Conservatism of Natural Rights33"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"laws of nature are good, but God would still be needed in order to makethese laws obligatory. In Grotius this is very different. He clearly saw thatthe idea of the human person’s moral power of judgement meant that that person could be obligated by what was judged to be good, such as thelaws of nature. God’s imprimatur was thus a consequence of, rather than aprecondition for, the obligatory nature of these laws:Natural Right [ius naturae] is the Rule and Dictate of Right Reason,shewing the Moral Deformity or Moral Necessity there is in any Act,according to its Suitableness or Unsuitableness to a reasonable Nature,and consequently, that such an Act is either forbid or commanded byGod, the Author of Nature. The Actions upon which such a Dictate isgiven, are in themselves either Obligatory or Unlawful, and must, con-sequently, be understood to be either commanded or forbid by Godhimself; and this makes the Law of Nature differ not only from HumanRight, but from a Voluntary Divine Right; for that does not command orforbid such things as are in themselves, or by their own Nature, Obliga-tory and Unlawful; but, by forbidding, it renders the one Unlawful, andby commanding, the other Obligatory.(I. 1. x, 1–2)Tuck may be right in his general proposition, that one of Grotius’ maindesigns was to combat scepticism. However, it is clear that to do so by main-taining the sort of efficacy of humanity’s moral powers that I have outlinedhere led directly to something at least as ‘dangerous’. The implication ofGrotius’ notion of obligation is that God in effect is dispensable, a criticismraised time and again through the seventeenth century and beyond. Whatis more, by maintaining such moral powers, Grotius appeared to reject allaccounts of the doctrine of original sin and its deleterious effects on human-ity. Further, his suggestion that the laws of nature were undeniable even byGod was taken to imply a moral community between God and humanity.12However, the apparent radicalism of these ideas is clearly Janus-faced, forthe basis for them is that there is an objective moral order of which human-ity in principle, if not in practice, can have cognitive certainty and of whichthe exercise of individual rights is a part. At this very basic level, therefore,Grotius is much closer to the neo-scholastic natural law of Leibniz and Wolffthan he is to Hobbes, Pufendorf and Hume for whom morality was a humancreation, in some sense of that word, generated in the absence of adequateknowledge of God’s intentions.II. BurlamaquiTurning now to Jean Jacques Burlamaqui, one is astounded by the similari-ties in philosophical theory and mode of argument that cut across the inter-34Knud Haakonssen"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"vening century and a quarter and across the differences in context andgeneral outlook. While I cannot here go into Burlamaqui’s context, it shouldbe remarked that it indicates a remarkable political versatility, in somerespects comparable to that of Grotius. Not only was he part of the repub-lican governing elite in Geneva, he was also an appreciated teacher of ruling princes – thus both a professor for and private tutor to the Landgraveof Hesse-Cassel, Frederick II – while Gustav III of Sweden was fond of his work.13A fuller interpretation would also locate Burlamaqui in the Swiss Enlightenment and, first of all, provide a detailed analysis of his debts to Barbeyrac.14None of this can be attempted on the present occasion.Burlamaqui’s work is lucid and exhibits the systematic qualities one mightexpect from a text that derives from lectures.15Furthermore, it is presentedwith such detailed references to Pufendorf’s two main natural law works that it nearly falls into the category of the copious commentary literature.However, the attention paid to Grotius is nearly as minute and in both casesBarbeyrac’s commentaries are constantly invoked. This conveniently pre-sents our central question: where does Burlamaqui belong in the divisionsover the central issues of modern natural law and, especially, over the issueof rights? My answer is, as already indicated, that he is a Grotian – on the reading of Grotius outlined above. That is less than obvious, however,and has been less than obvious to most interpreters, because Burlamaqui re-peatedly presents his standpoint as a synthesis of voluntarism and realism.What makes human beings into moral agents is the following of rules,and rules are hypothetical imperatives pointing out the necessary means to ends. Quanatural persons, as distinct from family members, citizens andso on, our end is the good, which is defined as the happiness of perfection,and the rules guiding us in this regard are the laws of nature.16We shouldnote here, of course, that humanity has an end, perfection, that is set bythe legislator, whether human or divine. Burlamaqui underlines the fullmeaning of this by applying a notion of real self-interest that would haveappealed directly to the other Genevan Jean-Jacques of the day. ‘[L]aws,’Burlamaqui says, ‘are made to oblige the subject to pursue his real interest,and to choose the surest and best way to attain the end he is designed for, which is happiness’ (I: 70). And with the clarity often allowed only the epigoni, he goes on to draw up a contrast to Pufendorf who, in a well-known passage, had suggested that while ‘counsel’ (i.e. advice) may beaiming at the interest of those to whom it is given, lawis characterised byaiming only at the interest of the legislator who gives the law. Polemicallyoblivious to the basic Pufendorfian point that the realm of public interestis defined by its blindness to the divisive concerns of private happiness andperfection, Burlamaqui asserts that the proper goal of law is the harmonybetween public and private happiness, ending with the lament that‘Puffendorf [sic] seems here, as well as in some other places, to give a littleThe Moral Conservatism of Natural Rights35"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"too much into Hobbes’s principles’ (I: 71, referring to Pufendorf, Law ofNature, I.6.i).Burlamaqui operates with an idea of liberty as a condition in which aperson is undetermined by any reasons for action, that is, not guided by anyrule. This is a purely limiting notion put up in order to achieve a generaldefinition of ‘obligation’. Obligation is the limitation in our ‘liberty’ thatarises from rational insight into the connection between means and ends aspointed out by a rule, natural law being the most basic rule imposing themost fundamental obligation.17This idea of obligation as a matter of reasonsfor actions and of such reasons as a matter of insight into the means to ends,enables Burlamaqui to see obligation in a more nuanced way than manynatural lawyers. Seen in a less kind way, it allows him to obscure for theunwary exactly where he stands on the question of obligation that haddivided the previous two generations. He distinguishes between internal andexternal obligation, meaning by the former the guidance that mere insightinto the rationality of an action provides and by the latter the guidance pro-vided by the authority of the giver of a rule of behaviour. A rule of the formersort obliges as nothing but ‘counsel’; but a rule of the latter sort obliges onlyto the extent that the legislator is rational in giving it. Mere will, or power,obliges not. However, when will and rationality meet, we have completeobligation and thus law in the proper sense. This theme, that reason in itself provides some degree of obligation while reason and authoritative willtogether constitute perfect obligation, is run through many times and withmany variations, and every time the historically minded reader feels that itis a poignant moment. For Burlamaqui is with great clarity facing up to thatconundrum of early modern moral thought, whether good implies ought;that is, whether rational insight into the good provides the necessary andsufficient reason for concluding what one ought to do – which is to say,whether morality without authority is conceivable. As he puts it in a typicalpassage:It is already a great matter to feel and to know good and evil; but this isnot enough; we must likewise join to this sense and knowledge an obli-gation of doing the one, and abstaining from the other. It is this obli-gation that constitutes duty, without which there could be no moralpractice, but the whole would terminate in mere speculation. But whichis the cause and principle of obligation and duty? Is it the very nature ofthings, discovered by reason? Or is it the divine will? This is what wemust endeavour here to determine.(I: 143)Burlamaqui’s determination ends, predictably, with a strongly rationalistreading of Grotius’s ‘etiamsi daremus’ passage in the Prolegomena to Rightsof War and Peace, to the effect that the Dutchman certainly did not meanto ‘exclude the divine will from the system of natural law’. Rather,36Knud Haakonssen"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"All he means is, that, independent of the intervention of God, consid-ered as a legislator, the maxims of natural law having their foundationin the nature of things, and in the human constitution; reason aloneimposes already on man a necessity of following those maxims, and layshim under an obligation of conforming his conduct to them.(I: 151)18What is more, reason similarly imposes on God, once he has chosen human-ity for his creation, and this is just as well, for if the laws of naturewere not a necessary consequence of the nature, constitution, and stateof man, it would be impossible for us to have a certain knowledge ofthem, except by a very clear revelation . . . But agreed it is, that the lawof nature is, and ought to be, known by the mere light of reason. To con-ceive it therefore as depending on an arbitrary will would be attemptingto subvert it, or at least would be reducing the thing to a kind of Pyrrhon-ism; by reason we could have no natural means of being sure, that Godcommands or forbids one thing rather than another.(I: 129)In order to establish the reality of morality against scepticism everythingdepends, therefore, on ‘the nature, constitution, and state of man’. Ournature is, as already mentioned, to seek the happiness of perfection. By our constitution is meant that composition of the mind that enables us tofollow the rules of perfectibility. And the state in which we follow rulesdepends on our relations to other beings and ourselves. Let us look at ourrule-following constitution and our states in turn.As intimated in our discussion of obligation, there are two kinds of rule for our behaviour, internal and external – that is, those we prescribe to ourselves and those prescribed to us by legislators, divine or human. Theformer, the internally generated rules, again divide into two, namely thefunctions of the moral instinct and of reason. Reason means, as we haveseen, the rational understanding of the connection between means and ends in life. By moral instinct Burlamaqui intends, he says, the same asFrancis Hutcheson means by the moral sense, that is, the intuitive appre-hension of the inherent moral quality of human action.19This associationwith Hutcheson is suggestive, for it indicates that Burlamaqui has taken over the Scotsman’s idea of the moral sense as not only a source of knowledge but also as a motivational power. And this is the core of Burla-maqui’s aforementioned idea that morality carries its own obligation independently of any ‘external’ obliging authority, such as God. He under-lines his acceptance of this idea by firmly suggesting that it is possible toimpose obligation on oneself, a point on which he clearly goes against Barbeyrac (I: 146–7).20In other words, it seems reasonable to assume thatHutcheson has helped Burlamaqui along the way to internalising obligationThe Moral Conservatism of Natural Rights37"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"by giving it a source that, in one sense, is subjective, namely a power of themind.Closely associated with this development is Burlamaqui’s formulation ofhis idea of right. As we have seen, he considers our moral power to be amoral instinct checked by reason, or, perhaps more in keeping with his priorities, rational inference informed by moral perception or intuition. It is this idea of moral power that is the core of Burlamaqui’s concept of ourbasic right. Right, droit, is the moral power we have over our actions (or our‘liberty’) by referring them either intuitively by instinct or rationally byinference or, ideally, in both ways to our set goal of happiness or perfection,a goal to which our actions are possible means (I: 48–9). In other words, justlike Hutcheson, Burlamaqui picks up the Grotian idea of right as a moralpower but develops it in some detail.21It is an ambivalent idea of right. On the one hand, there is no doubt about its subjectivity since it is a quality or qualification of the subject; on the other hand, this subjectivity of right quickly turns out to be rathermuted when we consider its moral function. Our basic right of moral judgement is in fact a right that requires a right use, namely the use that is determined by the divinely instituted aim of perfection. It is not aliberty to act or forbear; it is, rather, a power to act rightly. It is, in otherwords, not a right that can be laid off; it is, in fact, a right the exercise of which is a duty. This is what Burlamaqui means by the inalienabilityofhumanity’s basic right of moral judgment; we cannot alienate what is a duty (I: 52; II: 43, 94).The basic right of moral judgement does not introduce any moral inde-terminacy, its subjectivity does not imply a plurality of uncoordinatedvalues, and it is not a bargaining chip in contractual relations between indi-vidual moral agents. As for all other, more specific rights, they have the samestatus as in most natural law systems; that is to say, they are the means tofulfil duties and they are, accordingly, alienable when they are not the bestmeans. In this regard Burlamaqui is completely traditional. In fact, he specifies the states of humanity in terms of the types of duty relations weare capable of, dividing these into the traditional three areas, namely dutiesto God (piety), duties to ourselves as God’s creatures (the duty of self-love)and duties to others (the duty of sociability) (I: 107–21).It is true that Burlamaqui, like most natural lawyers, operates with anotion of indifferent actions, that is, actions which are undetermined byreference to some rule (I: 82–3, 124–5). However, it seems that nothing but trivial actions could be indifferent by reference to natural law, since just about anything conceivably could come to play a role in a person’s perfectibility.22As for the law of political society, the range of indifferentbehaviour depends on what is required to fulfill the sovereign’s fundamen-tal duty – which is no less than the preservation, tranquillity and happinessof the state (II: 52).38Knud Haakonssen"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"In the end, the inalienable right to moral judgement justifies resistanceto totally arbitrary tyranny of the sort that negates the personhood of citizens and reduces them ‘to utmost misery’ (II: 43–4 and 94). In fact, such resistance is a moral duty, as we might expect. Cautious though thisis, it is notable, in comparison with older Calvinist resistance theory, thatBurlamaqui sees it as a right (or duty) that may be exercised by ‘the greatestand most judicious part of the subjects of all orders in the kingdom’ (II: 95).However, before such sentiments excite liberal hearts excessively, it shouldnot be overlooked that resistance and compliance both are but means to amoral perfection. Furthermore, we can appreciate the possibility of moralperfection only if we see that the law of nature is not simply based on theneed for sociability in this life, as asserted by Pufendorf, but is metaphysi-cally guaranteed by natural theology (I: 215).ConclusionIn sum, whatever the liberal credentials of Grotius and Burlamaqui were intheir respective contexts, these credentials did not rest on their theory ofrights. In fact, these brief reflections on two historically distinct but con-ceptually connected episodes in the history of natural jurisprudence suggesta wider perspective, namely that the use of the concept of natural rights inliberal political theory often was morally conservative. Rights were a meansof showing that the political demands based upon them were part and parcel of an objective, metaphysically or religiously based moral order. Thisleft a question mark over the liberality of rights theories which, perhaps, isindelible.Notes1. R.

I do not wish thereby to deny the modernaspects in his theory that may justify such a valuation. In separating naturallaw from moral theology, Pufendorf excluded the concept of man’s divineimage and the concern for his eternal felicity as something unattainable by human reason. This also entailed a tendency to restrict law to externalactions,1leading to a separation of the political realm from the realm ofinner conscience in order to render the former absolute in relation to moralcritique and clerical interference. My concern is to show the features inPufendorf’s thought that fall out of this picture. In particular I shall be con-cerned, first, with the persistence of a teleological conception of nature, itsremaining importance for Pufendorf’s understanding of man’s nobiliores facultatesand the relation of these faculties to the moral and civil obliga-tion; and, second, with the persistence of a theonomic form of natural lawobligation in the civil state and its importance for the obligative force and ‘Amtsverständnis’ (understanding of office) of sovereign power.IIn accordance with all leading political theorists of the seventeenth century,Pufendorf sees sovereigntyas the essential feature of state-power. Beingauthority over the persons of others, who are thereby enjoined legitimatelyand efficaciously to do or supply something,2its legitimisation takes place – thus following Hobbes3– by a fictitious dissolution of the state into thebasic features of the human condition. These are taken as starting-points ofa (hypothetical) generation of authority showing its necessitas & ratio, its aim and its fundamental relations of right and obligation.4In (re-)constructing the state and sovereignty, Pufendorf does not startfrom human nature quanature, but from the natural state of man. Stateor43"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"statusis the most basic of the moral entities. In contradistinction to physi-cal entities, which are qualities and processes resulting from the inner prin-ciples of natural substances, moral entities are instituted by the impositionof reasonable creatures to give their freedom of acting a certain rule ofbehaviour. Their author is God on the one hand, who does not want ‘thatmen should spend their lives like beasts without civilization and moral law’, on the other hand man, according to convenience and human requirements.5Despite their separation from the entia physica, however, Pufendorf’s divi-sion of the entia moraliais ‘according to the system of physical entities’which means, according to Aristotle’s table of categories,6‘because our intel-lect, immersed as it is in things material, can scarcely comprehend moralentities without the analogy of physical’.7Statusis thereby conceived inanalogy to space. Just as space is the medium in which physical objects existand exert their movements, so status– as a configuration of duties and rights– is a kind of moral space for persons and their actions. Even when callednatural,statusis not understood as an immediate result of human essence,but as a product of (divine) willed imposition.IIAccording to a widespread view among modern interpreters, Pufendorf’sdoctrine of entia moraliaintroduces a separation of the moral sphere as a realm of liberty from the natural world.8It thereby establishes a moralscience, the certainty of which is no longer based – as it remains in HugoGrotius9– in an objective order of essences, but confirmed in a pure method-ological manner through the mathematical mode of demonstration. In thisway Pufendorf is said to have broken the metaphysical nexus between physi-cal and moral nature characteristic of Aristotelian substance ontology, thathad found its classical formulation in the Thomistic dictum ens et bonumconvertuntur(being and the good coincide).10As a matter of consequence the moral actions of man no longer appear as a realisation of his immanentessence, but as actions according to rules resulting from voluntary imposi-tion according to convenience.In my opinion this point of view has to be corrected to a certain extent.Pufendorf claims to have developed his theory of law as a universallybinding natural law. This law is recognised by human reason in contem-plating the human condition,11and has ‘an abiding, and uniform standardof judgement, namely, the nature of things’,12even in the natural state.Pufendorf reconciles this claim with his separation of entia physicaandentia moraliaby tracing back nature and moral law to God the creator andlawgiver, who guarantees the harmonious conformity and ultimate identityof both realms. As a result of its contingent creation by God, human naturenecessarily conforms to the moral law, because a rational and social nature,as ascribed to man by God, is impossible without such a law.13In this way44Thomas Behme"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"actions enjoined by the law also have the ability to promote the (non-moral)good of man; but this ability is not the formal reason of their (moral) good-ness, which solely consists in their conformity to the divine will.14As long as created human nature remains unchanged according to divinewill, God’s consistency also guarantees the eternity and unchangeability of natural law.15In another passage Pufendorf refers to this thought in order to defend the certainty of moral science against the objection of theconventional origin of its objects, tracing back the most basic entia moraliato divine imposition and arguing for their ‘necessity’ by showing their con-formity to (unchanged) human nature.16Surely this indicates a deviationfrom the aim of a merely methodologically based moral science of the kindthat Pufendorf had proposed in the introductory parts of the ElementaandDe Jure Naturae et Gentium.17In contrast to Hobbes, who had determined theobject of science by the method of science, defining its object as ‘every bodyof which we can conceive any generation’,18Pufendorf bases the necessityof the moral science on the immutability of its object, thus returning againto an ontological foundation of science.19This close union of nature and morality based on the integrity of God’soriginal act of simultaneous creation and imposition also enables Pufendorfto reintroduce a kind of natural teleology. To be sure, he does not conceiveit in the sense of natures containing (and being constituted by) their im-manent ends (entelechies), but in the sense of divinely imposed ends beinginseparably connected to certain natures because of their common origin inthe divine original act. In this latter sense he speaks of socialitasas a naturalend of man, ‘a sociable attitude . . . agreeable . . . to the nature and end ofthe human race’.20Such a teleology is predominantly suggested by Pufendorf’s description ofthe splendid faculties reasonandwill, that constitute the special humandignity,21and their relation to law,obligationandsociety. Both faculties arefundamental to human or moral action, that is, to voluntary action in sociallife ‘regarded under the imputation of its effects’: ‘We call voluntary actionsthose actions placed within the power of man, which depend upon the will, as upon a free cause, in such wise that, without its decision setting forth from the same man’s actions as elicited by previous cognition of theintellect, they would not come to pass; and, indeed, according as they areregarded not in their natural condition, but in so far as they come to passfrom a decision of the will.’22Only human actions of that kind can be sub-jected to the directive force of laws and the obligations imposed by them.23Now, from the existence of these faculties and the resulting capacity formoral actions, Pufendorf derives the obligation of living a social, decorousand godfearing life, which makes it possible to put these faculties into practice:Now the more splendid the gifts which the creator has bestowed uponman, and the greater the intellectual qualities with which he hasPufendorf’s Doctrine of Sovereignty45"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"endowed him, the more base it would be for such qualities to waste awayin disuse, to be expended at random, and to be squandered without orderand without seemliness. And surely it was not for nothing that God gaveman a mind which could recognize a seemly order, and the power to har-monize his actions therewith, but it was of a surety intended that manshould use those God-given faculties, for the greater glory of God and hisown felicity.24There is no doubt that Pufendorf founds natural law and society in thenecessities of self-preservation,25of checking man’s evil desires26in order to secure peace as a minimal requirement for a social life, which is of outstanding importance in his exposition of the impelling causes for theestablishment of states.27None the less, in arguing for the centrality ofhuman dignity, Pufendorf continues to treat man as a reasonable and moralcreature, destined and obligated to a social life suited to his specific humanfaculties. This argument shows a certain similarity to the Aristotelian doc-trine of man as a zoon logon echon(rational living being), realising the rea-sonable part of the soul – representing the specific human virtue – in societywith other men as the zoon politikon(political animal).28But according toPufendorf – in contrast to Aristotle – this telosdoes not immediately pertainto political society. For Pufendorf regards the state not as a means for therealization of man’s splendid gifts, but a means to check the destructive con-sequences of his less splendid gifts, channelling them according to the aimof a peaceful social life, that his splendid gifts have revealed as obligatory.IIIThe natural state of man imposed by God conforming to man’s endowmentwith these splendid gifts – Status naturalis in ordine ad Deum creatorem29– isone that distinguishes him from the state of the brutes. It is a state charac-terised by the recognition of his author and an obligation to worship him,to live a decorous life in society with others of his kind. In consequence, itis a state of peace:This further point should be carefully observed, namely, that we are notdiscussing the state of some animal, which is directed only by the forcesand tendencies of the senses, but of one whose chief adornment andmaster of the other faculties is reason. Now this reason in a state of naturehas a common, and, furthermore, an abiding and uniform standard ofjudgement, namely the nature of things, which offers a free and distinctservice in pointing out general rules for living, and the law of nature; andif any man would adequately define a state of nature, he should by nomeans exclude the proper use of that reason, but should have it accom-pany the operation of his other faculties.3046Thomas Behme"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Empirical man, however, being characterised by a diversity of inclinationsand judgments31and an inconstancy in pursuing ends,32often fails to meetthe requirements of that state. The resulting condition of inter-human rela-tions, when conceived outside the civil state, but having regard to humandepravity, is a state of precarious social relations under the obligation of thedivinely imposed state, but under permanent threat of dissolution by mutualinjuries and resulting war.33In order to meet the divinely imposed end ofsociality suited to human nature in all its (splendid and less splendid) facetsand to secure human survival under these aggravated conditions, naturalreason and natural duty do not suffice. In addition to the moral bonds con-stituted by natural obligation it is necessary to limit man’s external libertyby sanctions imposed by civil authorities.34Given man’s natural equality, the establishment of these authorities cantake place only with the consent of those persons who are to be ruled.Natural equality is characterised as an equality of law resulting from the universally binding obligation to cultivate human society,35while the ideaof the universality of law presupposes the axiom of equality.36The resultingreciprocity of obligation already contained in Pufendorf’s definition ofsocialitas37is a basic requirement of each society. This equality of obligationis correlated with an equality of right, containing in the first place an equal-ity of liberty, which is an equality of the right of self-determination: ‘every-one situated in a natural state has an equal right and authority to preservehimself and to direct his actions according to his own choice enlightenedby sound reason’.38In consequence, no one can claim a right to rule others before havingsecured their consent, which puts them under obligation.39Equality ofliberty already presupposes Pufendorf’s concept of anthropological libertywhich is integral to his concept of human dignity. As we have seen above,to be obligated presupposes the capacity for human, voluntary actions, theeffects of which may be imputed to the agent as a moral cause. In short,obligation presupposes the agent’s ability of self-direction. Now there is noreason – according to Pufendorf – why someone should without further adobe obligated to obedience, if he considers his own ability of self-direction as sufficient for taking care of himself.40In contrast, agents, who fall shortof this capacity, cannot be bearers of obligations at all. In consequence,imperia, and the correlated obligations of obedience, must be based in theconsent of agents, who are equal at least insofar as they are morally free andresponsible agents: ‘And not have all men been born fit for blind obedience:everyone wants to obey in the best way, but as a man, not as a beast.’41IVFollowing Hobbes, Pufendorf conceives the contractual formation of thestate as a union of wills and strengths of independent single persons into aPufendorf’s Doctrine of Sovereignty47"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"compound moral person (persona moralis composita).42But the more detailedsteps of contractual construction reveal decisive differences, which havetheir impact on the relation of rulers and citizens. According to Hobbes:acommonwealthis said to be instituted, when a multitudeof men do agree,andcovenant, every one with every one, that to whatsoever man, or assem-bly of men, shall be given by the major part, the righttopresentthe personof them all, that is to say, to be their representative; every one, as well hethat had votedfor it, as he that voted against it, shall authorizeall theactions and judgements, of that man, or assembly of men, in the samemanner, as if they were his own, to the end, to live peaceably amongstthemselves, and be protected against other men.43In consequence, the sovereign bears the person of his subjects without limitation, which means that his injuring them is a priori excluded as (logically) impossible.44The contract only binds the (future) subjects among each other, but not the future sovereign. As a result, he remains inthe state of nature, so that his continuing ius in omniaabsorbs all right ofthe subjects or transforms it into precarious sovereign indulgences.In contrast to the Hobbesian solution, Pufendorf’s contractual construc-tion consists of three steps: a pact of union, a decree concerning the formof government and a pact of submission. The pact of union does not yetconstitute a union in the sense of a collective person. Rather, it contains adeclaration of will dictating that the intended union should be governed byone and the same sovereignty,45whose establishment remains unaccom-plished until the final pact of submission.46This pact of union is enteredinto either absolutely or on condition that a certain form of government isintroduced in the second step. The last step, the pact of submission, con-stitutes the sovereign, being either an individual (monarchy) or a corpora-tion of a few (aristocracy) or of all citizens (democracy). By this pact theruler binds himself to provide for common security and safety, while therest pledge obedience.47From this there results the union of wills constitut-ing the persona moralis compositaof the state.I omit the question what is meant by the restwho promise obedience(individuals or an already existing collectivity), because this matter has beentreated elsewhere.48But even if we presuppose individuals as the contract-ing partners of the future sovereign, the difference from the Hobbesian con-struction can be clearly seen. The contractual relation betweeen sovereignand citizen emphasises the limitation of sovereign power according to theend of civil society and the correlativity of the respective rights and obliga-tions of both sides: ‘But we maintain that the legitimate power of a kingand the duty of citizens exactly correspond, and we emphatically deny thata king can lawfully command anything which a citizen can lawfully refuse.For a king cannot command anything more than agrees, or is supposed toagree, with the end of instituted civil society.’49Admittedly, the mutuality48Thomas Behme"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"of this relation is limited by the fact that a rulership is to be established.This entails that the rights of the ruler (and the respective duties of thecitizen) are enforceable, while the rights of the citizen (and the respectiveduties of the rulers) are not.50But even the latter constitutes a strong moralbond, being traced back to God the lawgiver, who commands that promiseshave to be kept51and being capable of specification in fundamental lawstransforming it into written constitutional law (see below).VBy remaining contracting partners of the sovereign in the civil state, the citizens do not lose their legal capacity in the act of subjection.52This legalcapacity is part of the ‘natural’ moral personality constituted by the naturalstate – ‘a moral person is a person considered under that status which hehas in communal life’53– and is based on the corresponding natural capac-ity to perform human, imputable actions.54This natural state consists of thebasic natural obligation of socialitas, the derived absolute offices (of non-violation,55respecting the equality of others,56humanity57), and the corre-sponding natural rights (of self-preservation, natural liberty58). It continuesto underlie the civil state with its imposed adventitious obligations, beingnot derogated, but specified by the latter. Its corresponding ‘natural’ moralpersonality remains fundamental to all adventitious personae, enabling theircreation by its legal ability of contracting (and its obligation of keepingpromises) and (in theory) limiting their legal capacities by its own naturallaw-framed circuit.59In contrast to Hobbesian absorptive representation, where subjects losetheir (moral) personality because the sovereign personates them all withoutlimits, Pufendorfian sovereign power personates them only in matters con-cerning its end as defined by the pact of subjection or even by adventitiousfundamental laws. These contractual limitations of sovereign representa-tion, together with the still valid natural obligations, offer at least a theo-retical basis for the discernment of lawful and unlawful sovereign actions.This makes it possible to determine when the sovereign’s actions are injuri-ous, to judge these morally, and to justify (under certain circumstances) aright of resistance.60This critical ability of the natural persona moralis, which can even beunderstood as divinely backed because of the theonomic character of naturallaw, continues to underlie the adventitious personaeof rulers and citizensand qualifies their relation as a strong moral bond between (morally) freeand responsible agents (see above). Their natural law obligation remains fundamental to the state even as a precondition for the possibility of civilobligation:states could never have been formed, and when once formed could nothave been preserved, had not some idea of justice and injustice existedPufendorf’s Doctrine of Sovereignty49"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"before that time. For it is certain that pacts intervened in the establish-ments of states. Yet how could men have been able to persuade them-selves that pacts were of any use at that time, had they not knownbeforehand that it was just to observe pacts and unjust to break them?And if it is not just to observe pacts before civil laws are defined, what isthere to prevent subjects from throwing off obedience and destroying astate at their pleasure, and by that act doing away with the distinctionof justice and injustice?61In the post-war situation of the second half of the seventeenth century,however, requiring a reaffirmation of political authority as a guarantor oforder and stability,62the natural persona moralisand the concept of naturalstate became no more than fictive starting-points for reconstructing poli-tical authority. In fact, the actual form of this authority – as an estate-bound monarchy with absolutist tendencies on the central governmentallevel63– left little room for individual moral judgement, or even individualparticipation.One of Pufendorf’s key devices for negotiating this situation was theconcept of tacit consent, taken from Roman law.64Applied to political theoryit enabled him to interpret existing authorities as consent-based, includinglords of the manor65as well as usurpers.66The individual’s natural law-basedcapacity to pass moral judgement on sovereign actions was also significantlyrestricted. State power ascribed decision on concrete requirements of thesalus publicato sovereign discretion,67on whose part ‘there is always a pre-sumption of justice’.68For its part, the theoretical possibility of the right ofresistance resulting from the community of natural law between ruler andcitizens and the reciprocity of their mutual obligations69was reduced to anindividual’s right of self-defence. Having regard to the ‘pax et tranquillitassocietatis’ – which had first priority in the post-war reconstruction periodfollowing the Westphalian treaties – this right could be exercised only passively, through flight or emigration.70Having once established the sovereign by the abovementioned pacts, thepeople (in the sense of the sum of individuals) retain no more power overhim, that being excluded by the nature of sovereignty. As a result of the actof submission, the sovereign is vested with all the rights and functions vin-dicated for him by the current concept of sovereignty derived from Bodin.71The sovereign’s power is supreme, that is, ‘not dependent in its exerciseupon any man as a superior, but according to his own judgement and discretion’,72unaccountable, and not bound to civil law.73It has a special‘sanctity, so that not only is it wrong to resist its legitimate commands, butalso the citizens must patiently bear it with its severity . . .’.74Lastly, it is indivisible, because all its rights can work for peace and security only whenunited in one subject. Division, conversely, leaves different bearers of particular rights bound by consent alone, and thus fails to meet an essen-50Thomas Behme"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"tial feature of state-power, which is constituted by pact andsovereignty(pactum and imperium).75VIPufendorf’s theory of the immediate creation of sovereignty in the pact of submission distinguishes him both from theorists of immediate divineright, such as Johann Friedrich Horn, and from theorists of popular sover-eignty, such as Johannes Althusius. According to Horn, states are foundedby pacts, but not sovereigns, whose authority can only be immediatelyvested by God, because the people, who neither own maiestasindividuallynor collectively, cannot confer it.76For Pufendorf, however, this is an ineptconcept of majesty, equating it to a physical entity that has to exist beforethe transfer. For as an ens moralesovereignty may be produced by the unitedaction of those who individually did not possess it beforehand.77The sameargument also plays a certain role in Pufendorf’s criticism of popular sover-eignty. While consent is a precondition for the establishment of legitimatesovereignty, this does not mean that the people retaining a maiestas realisremains superior to the ruler. As power of commanding, sovereignty comesfirst into existence when rule is established. It never pertains to the people(as a multitude), who neither owns it before the pact of submission whenrule does not yet exist, nor afterwards when the established authority rulesas sovereign over the people, precluding a coercive power and responsi-bility of the latter.78Popular sovereignty exists only where sovereignty isvested in the popular assembly ruling over the population as a multitude of individuals.Following Bodin79and opposing Hobbes, however, Pufendorf’s concept of undivided sovereignty vested in one body does not exclude limitationsby pacts, contracts and fundamental laws. This pertains in the first place toorders of succession remaining the unquestionable basis of (monarchical)sovereignty according to Bodin and Pufendorf, while Hobbesian sovereigntyalso includes the disposal of the succession.80In addition to such funda-mental laws, which only bind qua pactumand are not enforceable becauseof their imperfect mutuality (see above), further limitations are possible bycouncils or assemblies either appointed by the sovereign or established byfundamental law.81In the latter case, in particular, sovereignty is limited,when decision in certain spheres of action depends on the approval of suchcouncils as a negative condition (cognitio concomitans).82Such an imperiumceases to be absolute, but remains supreme, as long as these limitations donot transcend the boundaries of pure negative limitations (conditiones sinequa non) and do not challenge the sovereign’s monopoly of action (politi-cal initiative) as the unique will of the state. For this reason the right to calland dissolve such councils and to fix their agenda has to be left to the sovereign.83All these limitations, which are ultimately based in imperfectPufendorf’s Doctrine of Sovereignty51"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"mutual pacts, are also subject to the proviso: ‘provided the public safety,which is the supreme law . . . does not require otherwise’,84of which the sovereign – even in the case of a limited sovereignty – remains the principalinterpreter.VIIDespite his opposition to immediate divine right theorists like Horn and his emphasis on pacts as the principal source of sovereignty, Pufendorf stillretained the idea of ‘divine right’ in an altered, remote form. Given that the divinely imposed end of peaceful sociality cannot be attained by fallenmankind without civil sovereignty: ‘it is held that states also and supremesovereignty came from God as the author of natural law. For not only aresuch things as God established by His intervention immediately, andwithout any deed of men, due to Him, but also what men have contrivedunder the guidance of sound reason, with due regard for times and places,in order that they might fulfil the obligation enjoined upon them by God.’85Pufendorf thus retains the Lutheran concept of the worldly regimentimposed by God as a necessary remedy for depraved human nature,86vestedwith its own legitimacy independent from the spiritual one, but beingderived from the same author.87The divine source of the natural law obligation still enables Pufendorf toconceive the reciprocal duties of rulers and citizens as divine offices, therebybacking the sanctity of sovereignty88and presenting the ruler’s obligation asan office in the sense of the traditional ethic of the ‘mirror for princes’. Thiscan clearly be seen in the chapter ‘On the Duty of Supreme Sovereigns’.89Following the genre of the Prince’s mirror in structure and content,90andciting their most famous examples (for instance, Xenophon’s Cyropaideia,King James’ Basilikon Doronand several writings of Isokrates), this chapteremphasises the sovereign’s obligation of self-perfection and cultura animitogive an example to the people (§. 2). Further, it mentions the cura religionisas one of his most noble offices pertaining not to religion or Christian faithindifferently, but ‘in so far as it is pure, purged of the false inventions ofmen . . .’ (§. 4), that is to Pufendorf’s own Lutheran conviction.Thiscura religionis, covering all the rights of the ‘landesherrliche Kirchenregiment’ including investment and maintenance of ministers andteachers, visitation, reformation of church statutes and church discipline91is not presented as an integral part of sovereign power. Rather, it is derivedfrom an original independence of state and church92as a fictitious starting-point, which methodologically recalls the role of the natural state in deriv-ing sovereign power in its contemporary extension. The state, governing theexternal conduct of its citizens by civil law, has been instituted for the endof worldly security and does not include a competence in matters of reli-gionper se.93But ‘the kingdom of Christ’ is ‘a kingdom of truth’ spurningviolent means, and the Christian religion, aiming at eternal felicity that52Thomas Behme"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"cannot be enforced by coercive measures, is to be offered by peaceful meansof teaching.94The original constitution suited to that end is that of a demo-craticecclesiaexercising all the abovementioned rights contained in the cura religionisin its own right.95It is subject only to the sovereign’s direc-tion exercised in all subordinate collegia, in order to ensure their non-interference with the rights of sovereign power.96But when the rulerbecomes Christian, the conjunctio officiorumof Christian and ruler grantshim a peculiar claim to certain functions,97and the fiction of a right transfer by the church elders98leads to the ‘landesherrliche Kirchenregiment’in its contemporary extension.99But even the abovementioned demarcation of the ‘kingdom of truth’ fromthe ‘civil kingdom’ is partly challenged by Pufendorf’s emphasis on the con-formity of ‘true politics’ with ‘true religion’, already present in his naturallaw works. When treating the sovereign’s right in examining doctrines and enacting penalties in order to ensure their compatibility with the end of civil society, he sees no ‘danger for any true doctrine from the enactmentof such penalties, for no true doctrine disturbs the peace, and whatever does disturb peace is not true, unless it be that even peace and concord areopposed to natural laws’.100In addition to such defensive measures the stateshall ‘openly profess . . . such beliefs as agree with the end and use of states’,leading to a preference for Lutheranism even on the natural law level.101While the Catholic Church by its spiritual jurisdiction and its exemption ofthe clergy from worldly jurisdiction and taxation detracts from the rights ofsovereign power,102in denying human freedom of will and responsibility by its dogma of absolute decree, Calvinism destroys the foundation of civilobedience.103But Lutheranism suits the principles of true politicsin all respects.in submitting the clergy with their lives and fortunes to the sovereign,104and vesting him with the external direction in church matters,105it guaran-tees the rights of summum imperiumas defined by Pufendorf’s natural lawdoctrine, and strengthens its sanctity by obliging the people to respect itsbearers as God’s vicegerents on earth.106Finally, even on the theoretical level Lutheranism best suits Pufendorf’snatural law system. By emphasising human liberty in resisting the divineoffer of grace, Lutheranism supports the anthropology of man as a free andresponsible moral being, which has been proved fundamental to Pufendorf’stheory of moral entities, his theory of imputation and his system of naturallaw as a whole. Pufendorf articulates this position in his Jus Fecialebyintroducing the Calvinist concept of covenant107and turning it into an anti-Calvinist weapon.108He does this by interpreting it as ‘a way of fixing adimension of human liberty in the absolute realm of faith’,109which char-acterises the human–divine relation as a moral one.110The covenant thusfulfils a similar function in the theological context, as pacts had done in thepolitical context, namely: to express the continuity of human liberty andmoral consent in the civil obligation – a parallelism that is also expressedby the simultaneous use of the word pactumin both contexts.111WhenPufendorf’s Doctrine of Sovereignty53"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Pufendorf treats the doctrine of predestination as the main hindrance to aunion of Lutherans and Calvinists,112its rejection for theological reasonsmust be looked upon as inseparably connected with its rejection for politi-cal reasons as articulated in his earlier writings.Notes1.

In this regard I cannot follow Ian Hunter’s view, according to which Pufendorfian individuals ‘must recognize their duties in the array of offices orpersonaeimposed on them for the purposes of civilising governance’, becausethere is no ‘transcendent moral personality anchored in the nature of man . . .that might permit individuals to unify and rank all their offices from a singlepoint of rational insight’ (Rival Enlightenments, p. 167). Admittedly, Pufendorf –as a jurist – does not offer an elaborate philosophical account of personal iden-tity; and his separation of physical and moral entities forbids him directly toreduce moral personaeto human nature. But his concept of the natural personamoralisbased on the natural state, which has been divinely imposed in accor-dance with the faculties of created human nature, still adumbrates such a uni-fying point for all adventitious personaein the concept of man as a responsibleand (morally) discerning being.60.JNG7, 8, § 4 ff.61.JNG8, 1, § 5.62.

Yet, because we must proceed by classifying and because there is often warrant for conceptually distinguishing discursive system fromexamples of use, it is easy to remain too (un)critically tied to questionsfixated on the intellectual ‘object’ into which the writings are supposed tofit. The pattern of identified rules in a practice first becomes a separate objectof study, then a realm with its own autonomy, finally ceasing to be what itneeds to remain for the historian, a contextualising heuristic abstraction.The logical need to distinguish, say, semantics from pragmatics, becomes apractical impulse towards separation and even disciplinary independence.The popularisation of Saussure has a lot to answer for – hence Davidson’sargument that metaphors do not have meanings only uses, because they are a part of pragmatics not semantics.6We need to think past this sort ofreasoning if we are to see the full resonance of Hobbes’ use of natural law.Supporting our propensities to system reification remains the robustassumption that serious thought-patterns should be coherent and con-sistent. Even when correctly identified, systems thus become straitjacketsnot resources. Traditions acquire a reified philosophical solidity of their own, their contents displayed as disembodied talking texts. The conspicu-ous whiggery of histories of philosophy has, for example, effectively mar-ginalised philosophical eclecticism, a mainstream seventeenth-century formof philosophy untroubled by failings of propositional rigour. And rhetoric,which furnished strong arguments against too much consistency, has beenneatly quarantined in opposition to real philosophy. As Thomas Hobbes isseen as a philosopher, and indeed, rest assured, was one, it is all too easy 61"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"to assume he must stand here or there on philosophical issues we thinkimportant, or must comply with contemporary conceptual formulationssometimes only approximating to the language he used.In this chapter, however, I hazard some metaphysical modesty. Neitherassuming natural law to be a coherent doctrine, tradition or intellectualobject, nor constraining Hobbes to the confines of philosophical decency, Isimply look at the natural law topos in his works. How and to what endsdoes it function? How far does his use of the expression natural law and its field of associated terms illustrate his philosophical insistence on ex-purgating equivocation from argument? How far does it also illustrate his Valla-esque inclusion of rhetoric in philosophy? And how far might non-philosophical contexts of debate cast light on the philosophicallyintriguing?Aubrey remarked that Hobbes’ mind was never still,7and examination ofthe works he produced reveals a darting back-and-forth on interrelatedthemes more than a clear directional development. And it shows a deter-mination to defend old positions against all attack with changing for-mulations being polemically driven and involving strategic deflection ofcounter-arguments and ad hominem riposte. Progressive change mightoften be sought in Hobbes’ work but, when the evidence of a long andvibrant intellectual life is examined, it is less easily found. With respect to natural law, however, we can see something tidier. For, although there isnothing startling in the claim that Hobbes used the natural law topos tosupport a theory of sovereignty, his mode of doing so provides one of thosemuch looked for but rarely sustained patterns of lineal change in his work.He was engaged, it seems, in a process of foreclosing on any possibility thatmight allow natural law to be used for any purpose contrary to the inter-ests of embattled sovereignty. His pragmatics was an enterprise of semanticappropriation. All this can be read against three entangled backgrounds: law,philosophy and, perhaps of most explanatory salience, religion. Hobbes’ useof the topos was in full awareness of its multidimensionality and contestedcharacter.With respect to law, he had to deal with natural law in the context of claims concerning also the nature and status of custom, right, justice,rationality, reason and the limits of human knowledge. These in turn entan-gled the vocabulary of law with religious discourse which had an invest-ment in an overlapping battery of terms. In the ambit of religious debate,appeals to natural and divine law (often synonymous) had a greater impor-tance than in common law where the natural was apt to be elided with thecustomary.In England, by the early seventeenth century, there was a discernibletension between the claims of common and civilian law. What becamecrucial were the increasingly differentiated relationships these idioms of lawhad to the Scottish sovereign of the realm. By the death of James VI and I,62Conal Condren"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"as common lawyers could plausibly maintain, their law provided a rationalsystem for understanding the polity; it was a growth from, and an expres-sion of, the customs of the society. Declared or discovered from principlesaccording to need, but always needing the special knowledge of thoseinducted into its mysteries, it was held to be at once consistent with naturallaw and infinitely flexible in practice. It was close to being a theory of sovereignty because, as common lawyers claimed, English law was subordi-nate to no foreign law.8Conversely, common law might seem to threaten the legitimate office ofthe sovereign and, in this context, civilian law provided a legally-mindedriposte. The conception of law entertained by the civilians was one thatmust needs be legislated by a sovereign source and be codifiable. This toowas posited not as hostile to but as expressive of natural law. Nor was it necessarily antithetical to custom. It was, however, highly conducive to thestrengthening of the sovereign’s position in the state.9Lest we start think-ing in simple dichotomies, the Inns of Court versus Doctors Commons, itis to be noted that Coke himself attempted his own version of codificationin the Institutes, a resonantly co-optive title for one trying to head off‘foreign’ civil law. Indeed, the whole debate about law and sovereignty hadbeen greatly complicated by the succession of James (consider the signifi-cance of Bates’ and Calvin’s Cases, 1608) who descended from a countrywhose law and legal expectations were more civil than common.10Mani-festly aiding James in this respect was the common lawyer Francis Bacon,whose vision was to put a codified body of English law at the foot of a legislating monarch.11To men like Justice Coke, Bacon’s project came froma viper’s mouth; law was there to limit sovereign and exclude foreign power.Fear of Rome provided a backdrop to the patriotic defence of the authenti-cally English.12Hobbes would eventually turn his mind to such matters with character-istically reductive panache, but in what are putatively his earliest writings,there is no sign of the legal tensions concerning the polity or, incipiently,the religious implications of legal theory. In his ‘Discourse of Laws’ (1620),he writes with seeming complacency about the forms of law. All humanactivity is law-bound, but law must be understood with varying degrees ofstrictness. There is divine, natural law, the laws of nations and municipallaw; all are governed by rationality, natural law being a clearly independentfont of justice, and custom being a rational form of law only by anothername.13By the time he came to write the Elements of Law, the vision was decid-edly changed, but we now need to enhance the legal background with a religious and a philosophical context of argument. By 1640 Hobbes had for-mulated his grand philosophical project which involved not just a philoso-phy of the human and natural world but, reflexively, a decisive doctrineabout the limits of the philosopher’s enterprise. This was to seek ubiquitousNatural Law and the Sovereign in the Writings of Hobbes63"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"laws of causation, and to make prospective, unequivocal, universally truestatements through analysis and synthesis, on the basis of definition ofsalient terms and judged with reference to self-examination and the coher-ence of the propositions. The philosopher’s quest was for a sort of naturallaw, the laws of nature. Hence Hobbes posited a minimal and indeed literalmaterial object for philosophy. Yet direct access to material nature was neverpossible. Philosophical truth, he would come to insist, no matter how universal, was of propositions not of realities. This was no denial of realitybut an acknowledgment of human limitation. It was at once an expressionof deep scepticism and a response to a general culture fostering indiscrimi-nate doubt and controversy. More specifically, it was Hobbes’ counter to theextremities of different types of scepticism that would destroy any notionof truth and any practical criterion for judgment and action.14The criteriaprovided by self-examination and propositional coherence were a defenceagainst the formal but trivially true emptiness of pyrrhonism and the prob-abilism of Jesuitical authority citation, a defence developed in sympathywith Montaignesque uncertainty. For Hobbes, the responsibility of thephilosopher was, I believe, to rescue truth from the likes of pyrrhonists and Jesuits, Ciceronians, Schoolmen and Aristotlty in general.This endeavour required sensitivity to the limits of philosophy no less than to its conceptual vocabulary. As philosophy was the activity ofphilosophising, over-reaching was self-destructive. The understanding ofphilosophy in terms of office, the philosopher’s responsibilities and theirlimits would get its most masterly statement in De corpore(1655), but isalready a major theme of the Anti-White(1643), an attack on ThomasWhite’s De mundo, largely couched in terms of White’s overstepping thelimits of philosophy, not least for claiming to understand the nature of God.This pattern of assertion, Hobbes believed, made philosophy vulnerable and insecure. God, he would later reiterate against Bramhall, was not onlyunknowable but, being uncaused and immaterial, was a priori no subject forphilosophy. Hobbes’ image of the philosopher as the only adequate artifi-cer of truth, as holding a clearly delineated responsibility for authoritativemediation of what is really natural, indicates how close the homology canseem at times between the offices of sovereign and philosopher. What makesthe analogical relationship so resonant is the metaphorical suggestivenessof the notion of nature and its laws providing a common semantic ground-ing for the different pragmatic evocations of the ‘natural’. In differing ways,a relationship with ‘nature’ is central to each authoritative office. As sover-eignty was in need of conceptual refounding, so too was philosophy. In fewof its dimensions was it robust, certain and constructive; Hobbes’ grandproject was thus extraordinarily ambitious. More than bravado, his claimthat civil philosophy was no older than De cive– his first printed section ofthat vision – was simultaneously about both the civil and the philosophi-64Conal Condren"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"cal. However, as I shall conclude, the homologous imagery of office is undermined by the contrasting content of philosophical and sovereignresponsibility.The second probable reason for Hobbes’ shift from his early sanguine con-spectus of law lay in his increasingly troubled recognition that sovereignauthority was threatened. . . by conscience more than custom, by priestsmore than lawyers. Regardless of whether he is seen as having a secularis-ing effect, his concern with the social causes and consequences of cultushad, as it would for Thomasius, great explanatory power. For both writers –and they hardly stood alone – religion was a central problem, theologicaldiscourse at once a restriction and a necessary resource. In reading both, wemust not impute an indifference to religion as a precondition for the secu-larising consequences of their work, quite the contrary.15In fact, the notion of religious discourse, opposed simpliciterto secular dis-course, is itself misleading. Religious discourse covers a multitude of sins inthe early modern world, from the abstruse and interdenominational realmsof divinity definition, through eschatology, Christology, soteriology andecclesiology, to the casuistry of pastoral care, and the polemics of ‘priest-craft’ and heresy. We cannot expect Hobbes’ thought to be neatly containedin any one sub-field. None the less, the conceptual agenda of debate established by scholastic logicians and followed through ecumenically byProtestants and Catholics, scientists, poets and mystics concerning the statusof what might be said about a concept of supreme divinity was importantto him. In a more mundane yet socially urgent sense, so too were the socialconsequences of religious belief and practice. In none of his writings didHobbes exhibit to lawyers or any other class of people (save occasionallyphilosophers) the hostility that came to mark his treatments of priests. Hisexpressed anger and despair at their abuse of office culminated not inLeviathan, but in the detailed private ruminations on heresy and in the Historia ecclesiasticawritten during the Restoration. Further, it is priests whocarry the greatest burden of his forensic wit and satiric spleen, which if fullyexplored would threaten a hermeneutic nightmare for the modern reader.Hobbes the philosopher is sometimes simultaneously a writer in the idiomof Lucian and as he rarely misses a chance to attack ‘unpleasing priests’,16getting the right balance of gravitas in patterns of argument is no easymatter. Nevertheless, it is above all relevant that access to natural or divinelaw was fundamental to priestly claims to be arbiters of right and guides to conscience. Natural law might be a ubiquitous notion, but was arguablymore prominent in the forms of religious discourse available beyond thestrict confines of common or civil law. Additionally, a point not lost onHobbes, the more doctrine that could be seen as necessary to salvation,hence a matter of divine command or law, the greater the latitude for priestlyauthority to interpret such law; ipso facto, the less scope for anyone toNatural Law and the Sovereign in the Writings of Hobbes65"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"control or legislate for human affairs independently of priestly mediation.There was, in short, a perceived limit to human sovereignty coextensive withthe limits of adiaphora.From 1640, what Hobbes wrote about natural law would be bound up withhis anti-clericalism, itself an expression of his understanding of sovereignty.In the Elements, however, he was less thorough than he would become, forthe focus is more on Protestantism producing an anarchy of biblical mean-ings than on priests as subverters of sovereignty.17Hobbes shifted betweentwo meanings of the word conscience: as an inner and totally impenetrablerelationship of the soul to God, or as a settled and vehemently heldopinion.18In either case, the point was identical: an appeal to consciencecould not justify disobedience to law. The realm of adiaphora, or whatHobbes called superstructural belief, is strikingly extensive. A Christian isrequired to believe little more than that Christ is the saviour; for the restthe sovereign may amend, enforce public compliance, or leave mattersalone. Regardless of policy, conscience in the first sense can never betouched; in the second, it can have no sway.19Natural law itself is largely mediated by a sovereign authority; priestlyclaims to disclose or arbitrate as to its meaning are spurious and disruptive.The exceptions are natural law injunctions that may be seen as additionalto positive law, like the requirement to be charitable.20What mattered forHobbes was not the existence of natural law – this seems never to have been an issue – but the uses to which it was put and by whom. What mattered was not system but practice, a point consistent with his theory oflanguage.In the Elements, however, Hobbes gives credence to the claim to apostolicsuccession.21This was firm grounding for an episcopal authority indepen-dent of the sovereign because derived directly from Christ’s mission. Hewould later deny this doctrine as a thin end of a subversive papal wedge.King James might well have said that no bishop meant no king; Hobbeswould come to join those who held that no bishop meant no pope. He beganto change his mind, and focus more on priests shortly after the Elementswasin circulation. Reflecting on protests against Charles I’s bishops to WilliamCavendish (Earl of Devonshire) in a letter of July 1641, he surprisinglyexpresses sympathy for the protesters. Even the sovereign’s priesthood canget out of hand and damage the peace of the commonwealth. Ministersshould minister, not try to rule. It may, he remarked, be considered but afancy of philosophy, yet he believed priestly contestations for civil power tobe the root cause of civil war in Christendom.22Such philosophical fancieshe would reiterate in Behemoth, specifically recollecting Archbishop Laud,thebête noireof those early petitioners.23InDe cive(1642), his position is hardened from the Elements, though hestill stops short of making all priests mere creatures of the sovereign. He doesnot reject a doctrine of apostolic succession and accepts that priests may66Conal Condren"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"provisionally act on their own and then have their acts ratified by sovereignauthority.24But it must have been difficult to allow priestly independencewithout also allowing scope for reading natural laws independently of thesovereign: authority to act and then enjoy ratification required, as it were,some surplus of natural law’s meaning. The course of the civil wars and their aftermath in England which, for Hobbes, exhibited a cacophany ofpriestly voices clamouring for authority, inciting violence and rationa-lising mayhem, must have made De cive seem insufficiently adamantine inits defence of sovereignty.Hobbes alludes to the nexus of priestly incantation and violence in hisAnswer to The Preface before Gondibert, the unlikely context illustrating thedepth of preoccupation.25The decisive doctrinal shift from De cive, however,as Tuck notes, is in Leviathan, a work which as he also remarks introducesan elaborate eschatology to support sovereign power.26Here the very pos-sibility of developing a balletic rhetoric of destabilisation upon the pinheadof ratification was emphatically denied. Thereafter the position is remark-ably stable, in both published and unpublished works. In some respects itrecalls the principles of the French politiques, and was at one with some ver-sions of latitudinarianism in its sensitivity to ecumenical adjustment andpriestly irenicism.27Between 1646 and 1649 Hobbes had become a consist-ent Erastian: he came to deny the propriety of an appeal to natural or divinelaw, any priestly authority over conscience, and to dismiss the rhetoric ofconscience itself. He so emphasised the extent of superstructural beliefs thatalmost all Christian doctrine was in the hands of the sovereign. Like lawyers,priests were the creatures of sovereignty and therefore the servants of peace.As the sovereign is the arbiter of natural and divine law, Hobbes was requiredto envisage two rather different notions of God: one unknowable, consist-ent with the Anti-Whiteand the sceptical delimitation of the nature of phi-losophy and, indeed, a restatement of the apophatic conceptions developedby the medieval scholastics; the other, a joey in the pouch of the sovereign.28In a sense, the arguments of the Anti-Whiteagainst philosophical hubris are revisited in the unpublished Narration Concerning Heresy (c. 1666).29AsGibbon would also maintain, it was the unfortunate mix of early Christianpiety with Greek philosophical doctrine that provided the foundation for priestly domination. A philosophical preoccupation with nature whichleads to combative schools of thought becomes destructive of peace andintellectual integrity when co-opted by an ambitious priesthood, ministerswho would rule. Whenever they do, heresy and unorthodox opinion endup as crime.Leviathanshows just how far arguments from natural law could be usedto nullify its political efficacy as an oppositional rhetoric. But complicatingHobbes’ use of the topos is the language of contract used to four distinctbut related ends: to explain the origin of sovereignty, and the functions of its office, to urge acceptance of its universal necessity, and recognition ofNatural Law and the Sovereign in the Writings of Hobbes67"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"its fragile character.30In effect, contract became the mechanism through which natural law was collapsed into the sovereign’s law which, in turn,functionally defined the extent of the commonwealth.A correlate to this was the treatment of natural rights and civil rights.Again the point is to foreclose on the rhetoric of rights, putatively derivedfrom natural law, being used against sovereign authority. In singular fashionHobbes insisted on the dichotomous relationship between rights and duties,the conjunction of which was such an effective aspect of anti-sovereignargument and a clear feature of arguments from natural law.31For Hobbes,rights exist in the absence of law or effective law.32In the natural conditionthey are thus ubiquitous, useless and part of the problem, shortening andbrutalising an already nasty life. His point is to argue how intolerable is aworld populated only by such individualistic natural rights bearers. Thus the shift from the natural condition to the commonwealth is to a world that severely constrains the very notion of a right. Once law is established,rights can take on meaning as the contingent correlates of law and the at-tributes of subordinate offices. It is only with the office of the sovereign thatrights and, in some sense, duties are again brought fully into conjunction –the rights of the sovereign are expressions of the responsibility to keeppeace.33Naturally, the Hobbesian sovereign appears awesomely powerful, butbecause sovereignty is explicitly an office this is not an unlimited power. Itis an absolute authority existing purely for a purpose. This, formally, doesleave the subjects with certain rights, however socially inoperative they areand are designed to be. Modern scholarship has attempted to squeeze theHobbesian argument into the terms established by a concept of obligation.Either a given agent is, or is not, obliged. Although there are passages where,as noted, Hobbes writes in such terms, his vocabulary of responsibility andfunction is resistant to such an analytic dichotomy and was probablyemployed to ameliorate the disadvantages for his own argument of such astark conceptual bifurcation. On the one hand, Hobbes was determined toavoid the sort of contract language that left the sovereign as a party to acontract and so accountable to the subjects. Being a consequence of a con-tract the sovereign cannot be obligated to those becoming subjects at thesame time as sovereignty is created. On the other, sovereignty, being aneffect of a cause, just as clearly exists for a given reason, and is defined interms of it, so sovereigns exist in their responsibilities despite lack of con-tracted obligation. Thus Hobbes’ language of moral economy provides apassage between a controlled sovereign of conventional contract theory, anda monster of uncontrolled power, which those hostile to absolute sover-eignty feared and persuasively projected. The dichtomising of liberty andobligation, then, functions to undercut contractarian limits on sovereignty,the co-opted language of office and responsibility being employed to reas-sure that sovereign rule is not what many might call tyranny and slavery.68Conal Condren"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"The development of a theory of contract to a complex of persuasive andexplanatory ends was clearly important to Hobbes, but its metaphorical resonance made it a difficult motif in debate on all sides. Hobbes himselfproduced three main variations on the theme. In all versions, however, themotif of contract is partly what he would call in De corpore an act of priva-tion, the conceptual endeavour of trying to imagine empirical reality awayinto order to hypothesise the lineaments of cause and effect that might haveuniversal saliency.34In this context of Hobbes’ sovereignty theory, one needs to keep in mindnot just origin and function but also natural faculties or capacities (forreason and language) and natural propensities such as aggression whichstand in different relationships from what he formally calls natural laws asa series of divine commands.In the natural condition, human propensities are in a sense at odds withnatural law. Appetite and aversion in a situation of unlimited freedom createa war of all against all; but our natural capacities for self-recognition andlimited reasoning reveal certain natural laws that if followed would ame-liorate our situation. Here again, as with right and obligation, Hobbes’ penchant for Ramistic dichotomy has rubbed off on modern commentary.Are the laws really laws or just prudential maxims? This seems to me a falsedichotomy. As law for Hobbes was strictly that which was authoritativelycommanded or was a reliable operative causal abstraction in a given realm,the implicit field of reference is important when Hobbes writes of law. Inthe afterlife where God can be taken to command directly, natural laws arestrictly laws; conversely, a natural condition, defined by the individualisticreading of these laws, is a realm in which they are only potentially laws.35But as the term law is associated with such statements enjoining peaceregardless of its precise or proleptic status, Hobbes accords himself room tomanoeuvre.As I indicated at the outset, Hobbes the philosopher was also a rhetori-cian. He followed the conventional injunctions handed down from Ciceroto combine with variable emphasis appeals to honestasandutilitas. So, heinsists, it is right to follow natural law, because it is a command of God. Thecommand may be ignored, but ignoring a law does not undermine its legalstatus. What might qualify the fully legal status of natural law for Hobbesis the absence of punishment, the sovereign’s sword, which in the case ofGod’s law means punishment in another world of which we know nothingand so must be silent, or providential wrath on earth. Hobbes had strongreasons, both philosophical and polemical, for not allowing a notion ofprovidence into his arguments. And so the status of God’s commands onearth remains less than fully legal, and the argument from honestasis but-tressed by a persistent consequential emphasis. It is in our own self-interestto obey natural laws.

In the Elements of Lawit seemswe don’t even have a sufficiently uncontested language to help us escape –a nugatory line of argument he later quietly drops.36All we can do is reasonin our own way and apply what glimpses of natural law we have. We canbut do what we think is right and in our interests, yet these are apt to seemthe same, good and evil being solipsistically understood.The agreement between the rights-bearing victims of a natural conditioninvolves (the language changes) giving up power, then in Leviathanautho-rising one or a group to act for all.37It is this process of sovereign creationthat invents two reciprocal offices, of sovereign and subject. The result is a deliberately draconian employment of the complex language of office: the whole office of the subject lies in obedience, that of the sovereign inprotection, though not just bare protection.38Hobbes set up the thoughtexperiment not just to explain that the sovereign is an effect of causes, butto persuade us that escape from the natural condition was the preconditionfor whatever might make life tolerable. His critics were apt to see how dif-ficult any escape might be if Hobbes’ depiction of humanity was accepted.Either way escape entails a significant sacrifice of judgement and liberty, notthe least of which is the right to interpret natural law for ourselves, preciselybecause it involves us in a contradiction. The logic of this is central to thedrastic simplification of the language of office.If the principal natural law is to seek peace, then creating a sovereign isobedience to natural law; retaining a right to interpret it for ourselves under-mines the sovereign whose office it is to maintain the peace we cannotensure for ourselves. In this way the rabbit from the hat, the sovereign quasovereign, can do nothing against natural law. For if it undermines peace,ignores or perverts the responsibility of maximising or maintaining our pro-tection, then the commonwealth dissolves; there is no sovereign and thereare no subjects, a claim reiterated in his last fragment on such matters c. 1678. In the meantime, a point most clearly expressed in that final frag-ment, while there is a sovereign even its officers are touched by ‘divine law’as they are agents of the sovereign who alone represents it, their specificrights deriving from their duties to act for the sovereign.39To the modern reader there might seem to be a good deal of verbal con-juring or issue avoidance in Hobbes’ argument; but Hobbes was hardly alonein paying such attention to the semantics of sovereignty. Grotius before himand Lawson shortly after recognised like Hobbes that the issues of sover-eignty were tied to its language. Hobbes’ argument, like their discussions, isan attempt to establish protocols for the practice of language in a polity. Asmade clear in De cive, words like tyranny have no meaning in the contextof sovereignty – any more than rebellion can have meaning beyond sover-70Conal Condren"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"eignty.40The significance of this (for Lawson and Grotius as well) is lost ifwe presuppose the limits of sovereignty to be marked by a theory of resis-tance, and the absence of such a theory to exhibit some kind of failure, presumably to avoid ‘absolutism’.41But what if people in the early modern world had not necessarily failedto have theories of resistance? What if for them resistance functioned almostas an empty or underdetermined classifier? The issue was how, in any givencase, to specify exceptional behaviour directed against a sovereign. It was in this highly contentious and more discriminate vocabulary that justifica-tion and condemnation were housed. Resistance as rebellion was wrong; asself-defence, it was a justifiable response to the wrongs associated withtyranny. The problem, then, became to provide criteria to control such re-descriptions.42Whereas Locke suggested criteria to justify communal self-defence where there has been a dissolution of government through tyranny,an argument designed to keep tight control on any executive power, Hobbeshad moved to the other extreme. To deny the meaningfulness of the wordtyranny was to remove a criterion for self-defence; to deny organised self-defence as anything but rebellion was similarly semantic succour for anysovereign.43As a corollary, the sovereign must be the law’s sole source and mediator.It follows for Hobbes that the word justice has no independent area of operation. If it did, it would allow by default a re-specification of naturallaw independent of sovereignty and so a re-introduction of the rhetoric oftyranny, a communal inflation of ‘self-defence’. Justice is consequent upon the law, an argument that amounted to a drastic re-working of the Aristotelian conception of distributive justice; the sovereign is the source ofdistribution.44InLeviathanhe allowed an independent appeal to equity buthad changed his mind by the time he wrote Behemoth(another loopholeclosed).45Law is only an authoritative and effective command from theoffice of a law-giver, a sovereign. The extent of a commonwealth is thusdemographically and geographically a function of the scope of the law and,definitionally, an application of natural law. Pragmatically, it is the extentof the semantic order the sovereign allows.Certain non-semantic paradoxes also become apparent. Vitally, absolutesovereignty, regardless of form, so far from being inimical to liberty, is a necessary condition for it. Liberty of the natural state is intolerable and, inits proper signification, almost meaningless as a ubiquitous feature of exis-tence.46Again, custom has no authority, but this is no denial of cultural vari-ance. Quite the contrary, as the sovereign is the only mediator of naturallaw, everything acceptable to a given sovereign is touched by the kudos ofa natural law: exactly the sort of move the common lawyers made, but withrespect to the authority of legally understood custom. Neither, as becomesapparent in the Dialogue between a Philosopher and a Student of the CommonNatural Law and the Sovereign in the Writings of Hobbes71"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Laws, can legal reason mean anything or rescue the independent authorityof custom: there is but reason and the sovereign’s law. Another source ofindependent appeal against the sovereign is cut off.Over all, Hobbes gradually crafted a position that could scarcely be moreunsatisfactory for those who want any means of theoretical defence againstsovereign power. Yet, a supreme irony, it is Hobbes’ view of the content ofphilosophy that at once made his enterprise urgent and undermined it. Theirony is not obvious in as much as both philosopher and sovereign is a solerepresentative of a dimension of the natural. To demand a right to opinionsabout justice and natural law independent of the sovereign is a little likedemanding a right to opinions about truth and nature independent of philo-sophical reason: it is unreasonable; each is to invite a sort of anarchy. Ineither case, for Hobbes the untutored appeal to nature is a mechanism forreturning us to it.Yet if we turn from analogous image to philosophical content, tensionsemerge. Hobbes’ relentless scepticism cuts us from nature as it really is, pro-hibits us from grasping uniformly and directly any form of natural law orany truth about God. We are locked epistemologically always in a world ofsigns, opinions, phantasms, motions of the mind and propositions. ForHobbes – and he had even endorsed Aristotle on the point in A Briefe of theArt of Rhetorique– it was belief that drives the world, and in gaining it liesvictory.47Consequently, any sovereign’s maintenance of objective peace isof less significance than a belief that the office is being fulfilled. This, as itwere, is a sovereign victory and represents a position closer to Gorgias andThucydides than to Aristotle. So too, the Philosopher can but gain belief inthe truth of propositions, a victory over error. If we accept the rules of a given activity, this is a process of teaching, a top-down authoritativeprocess of ‘demonstration’ in contrast to persuasion. Hobbes’ use of the term demonstration is, however, neither so narrow nor so stable that itcoherently excludes persuasion.48Yet, unlike the arithmetician, who is ableto demonstrate as few other philosophers can, the sovereign must perforcerely on rhetoric – as indeed does Hobbes the philosopher. This means, inturn, that the act of authorisation which in Leviathancreates the sovereignoffice, is not so much psychologically implausible but, philosophicallyspeaking, a chimera.The full consequences of Hobbes’ epistemology are to render inadequatethe sovereign’s armoury even when it includes the duty of representingnatural law to the represented. Because of how we are naturally made, sov-ereignty is a fragile and fugitive achievement, therein the need to co-opt thelanguage of natural law, made desperate by his own sceptical epistemology.It is this polemical emergency that might help explain the residual tensionsbetween Hobbes’ offices of sovereign and philosopher: the sovereign repre-sents a knowable God which the philosopher says is not; the sovereign controls a reductive reason which the philosopher had insisted was modal.72Conal Condren"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Hobbes the theorist of sovereignty says that sovereignty begins with thealienation of judgement and willing which Hobbes the sceptic metaphysi-cian – who in the Elementshad argued that the notion of willing to will wasabsurd – concluded was literally impossible.

Fragile political stabilityoften coexisted with problems of religious pluralism. In these contextsnatural law theory offered a useful means of sidestepping intractable reli-gious conflict while at the same time offering new resources for the legiti-macy of the early modern state.This process can be seen clearly in England, where writers seeking toresolve the legacy of religious and political conflict embraced Grotiannatural law theory. At the same time, these efforts were complicated byThomas Hobbes’ controversial association with natural law ideas, apparentlyassociating them with atheism and absolutism. Some of the most creativedevelopments in seventeenth-century natural jurisprudence emerged fromnatural law theorists’ attempts to disentangle their positions from those ofHobbes’Leviathanin the face of practical political problems.Richard Cumberland’s natural law treatise De legibus naturae(1672) offersa useful case study of this process in action. Cumberland’s work emergedfrom the debate over toleration in Restoration England. Anglican theoristsdeployed natural law ideas to reinforce the sovereign’s power to arbitrate in matters of religious controversy. Their opponents inevitably associatedthis position with Hobbism. Cumberland sought to vindicate the Anglicannatural law argument by refuting Hobbes and demonstrating that naturallaw and a powerful account of sovereignty could coincide. He did so throughan unusual combination of science and scepticism that marks out his novelapproach to natural law theory. In so doing he not only made a significantcontribution to natural jurisprudence, but he tailored his work in such asway as to make his apparently abstract theory directly relevant to the reli-gious and political circumstances of the period.176"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"IThe immediate occasion for Cumberland’s work was a domestic contro-versy over religious toleration in the later 1660s. The religious politics of theperiod revolved around a search for a solution to the problem of those religious dissenters who had been frozen out of the established church bythe Act of Uniformity in 1662. Their dissent was based upon their refusal to accept the requirements of the church in matters of public worship. Dissenters felt that to acquiesce in rules that the church imposed as adi-aphora, or things indifferent, was scandal.2For some moderate Anglicans, or Latitudinarians as they came to beknown, the solution to the problem lay in redefining the requirements ofthe church to allow dissenters to conform, thereby restoring a comprehen-sive Church of England. Latitudinarians tended to be younger clergymeneducated during the Interregnum period to distrust religious extremism infavour of a revived neo-scholastic emphasis upon the role of nature andreason. Cumberland was typical of this group and closely connected withleading Latitudinarians, including John Wilkins, Edward Stillingfleet andJohn Tillotson.3Their moderate position on church reform was based on thesceptical assumption that although God required the establishing of somekind of worship, the precise nature of that worship might be varied becauseScripture and reason gave no authoritative judgement upon its form. Thedifficulty of defining exactly what should and should not be required by the church suggested that the settlement should be as wide as possible. How-ever, in cases of irreconcilable conflict over the form of the settlement, theLatitudinarians proposed that the final decision should be left to the civilmagistrate for the common good.4This sceptical attitude attracted suspicion from both high church Anglicans and dissenters for whom Scripture did provide authoritative andobligatory information about the form of church government. If the formerinsisted upon the requirements of conformity protected by the existing law,the latter sought a political solution in demanding a legal toleration. In theearly years of the Restoration period, the Earl of Clarendon’s government,together with Parliament and the church, were naturally opposed to a plu-ralist solution in spite of Charles II’s personal preference for toleration. AfterClarendon’s fall from power in 1667, the new Cabal administration revealedthemselves to be more sympathetic to the idea of toleration. At the sametime, with the church and Parliament resolutely opposed to the idea, pro-toleration dissenters appealed to the King to use his prerogative power togrant toleration.With the established church under threat Gilbert Sheldon, the Archbishopof Canterbury, mobilised a group of propagandists to attack the case for toleration. The most infamous of these Anglican writers was Samuel Parker,Archdeacon of Canterbury.5Parker’s Discourse of Ecclesiastical Polity(1670)Cumberland’s Sceptical Science of Sovereighty77"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"accused dissenters of reviving a Hobbesian argument in promising obedi-ence to the king in return for protection of their right to worship as theypleased. In response to what he perceived to be a pure rights theory, Parkerdeployed the sceptical Latitudinarian position, but in a rigidly intolerantdirection. Parker asserted that because natural law demanded sociability itwas therefore necessary to give up one’s natural rights, particularly the rightto worship as one pleased, for the sake of peace and the common good. Incases of controversy the sovereign’s word should be final, a position thatParker deduced from natural law. The outcome of the argument was thatthe dissenters should conform to the Church of England as currently definedby the law.6Although Parker had attacked Hobbes during the course of hisassault upon dissent, many felt that Parker’s own theory yielded so muchpower to the magistrate that it was really Hobbism in disguise. Althoughnatural law constituted an excuse for an absolute sovereignty, it was notclear where the obligation to the magistrate ended and the obligation tonatural law began.Parker’s book and the controversy over his Hobbism caused severe embarrassment to Latitudinarians who had tried to use natural law as ameans of resolving the problem of dissent in a more moderate fashion.Indeed, during the later 1660s, Cumberland’s patron Orlando Bridgeman,the Lord Keeper, had sponsored efforts by John Wilkins to promote the idea of religious comprehension using similar arguments.7They too hadappealed to the power of the magistrate as a means of shortcircuiting theo-logical divisions, but they had always stressed that the justification for thiswas an obligatory natural law. Parker, by contrast, had pushed his accountof sovereignty to the point where it seemed to swallow up any independentobligation to natural law – in effect, the sovereign became the sole arbiterof what the natural law required, a position closely identified with Hobbes’Leviathan.The association with Hobbes led many Latitudinarian writers to reassesstheir position.8Their problem was as follows: was it possible to keep a strongand in some ways partially Hobbesian account of sovereignty while at thesame time being able to demonstrate the divine obligation of the law ofnature? The Latitudinarians needed to legitimate a strong account of sover-eignty to justify their virtually Erastian ecclesiology, but at the same timethey needed to show that this did not reduce to Hobbism. Several writersattempted to flesh out an answer to this question and their argumentsmostly took the form of responses to Hobbes.9There were good reasons fordoing this. If it could be proved that Hobbes’ account of moral and politi-cal obligation was wrong, then there was no need to suppose that a strongaccount of sovereignty should necessarily conflict with a divinely ordainednatural law. Solving this problem was Cumberland’s exercise in the De legibusnaturae.78Jon Parkin"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"IIThis brief examination of the historical context allows us to turn to Cumberland’s theory with a clearer idea of what he was trying to do. At the very beginning of the work Cumberland announces that his main opponents are those sceptics and Epicureans who deny the idea of a uni-versally applicable and obligatory law of nature.10The main sceptic thatCumberland has in mind is Hobbes, and Cumberland fights a running battlewith Hobbes throughout the text. The really dangerous feature of Hobbes’theory for Latitudinarians like Cumberland was that he had used the lan-guage of natural law theory to subvert the idea that natural law providedthe basis for any practical moral and political obligation at all. Hobbes’ sub-versive move compromised the legitimacy of many subsequent natural lawtheories.The original and partly satirical purpose of Hobbes’ move was to make it clear that an appeal to natural law could never justify resistance, as some of the king’s opponents in the 1640s had tried to claim.11Reason,Hobbes had argued, could identify theorems concerning individual self-preservation, and he was happy to call these theorems ‘laws’ of nature.However, at the end of Chapter 15 of Leviathanhe denies that these theo-rems carry the obligation of laws by themselves.12Hobbes takes the volun-tarist position that a law is the will of a superior. In the case of natural lawthis should be God. Hobbes pays brief lip-service in the De civeandLeviathanto the idea that the divine obligation to these laws comes from God’s willas declared in Scripture, but it is very soon apparent that he is deeply scep-tical about the capacity of Scripture to act as a source of divine obligation.13The practical source of moral and political obligation cannot be a God ofwhom we have virtually no knowledge. As a consequence, natural ‘laws’remain theorems with no external obligatory force until they are authorisedby the will of the superior created by individuals, the state. This careful argu-ment ensured that it was technically impossible for the sovereign to violatethe ‘laws’ of nature, because the sovereign authorised obligatory natural lawin the first place. There could never be an independent external obligationto God that might be used against the sovereign.Cumberland’s problem was how to respond to this deeply sceptical ac-count of moral and political obligation. His dilemma was complicated bythe fact that he shared Hobbes’ understanding that law was the commandof a superior. To save natural law from Hobbism, Cumberland had to showthat the law of nature could be identified and that it was the will of Godthe legislator. Hobbes had explicitly rejected the former assertion. He couldacknowledge that God was an omnipotent first cause, but the idea thathuman reason could give an accurate or useful account of God’s reasons orpurposes was an impossibility.14Cumberland’s Sceptical Science of Sovereighty79"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Cumberland, like many Protestant theologians, shared Hobbes’ distrust ofreason as an infallible guide to God’s will, but he sought to rescue the ideaof divine obligation through a residual faith in gleaning probable or morallycertain ethical knowledge from nature. The role of probability and moralcertainty in overcoming scepticism during the seventeenth century has beencommented upon before,15but this aspect of Cumberland’s project has neverbeen discussed at any length, even though he devotes lengthy passages oftheDe legibusto discussion of the importance of probability. Cumberlandoffers an account of how one can derive practical propositions that indicate,with a high level of probability, that they are laws. He acknowledges thatwe have only partial knowledge of the laws of nature due to the limitationsof the human condition, but this partial knowledge is enough to allow usto avoid Hobbes’ scepticism, his state of war and its necessarily political solution. We can glean enough information to take a calculated risk on verydifferent and much more sociable forms of behaviour.16Discovering evidence of moral obligation had been a key problem for theGrotian tradition of natural law theory. Grotius had adopted Cicero’s argu-ment that natural law could be identified from human practice.17Hobbeshad ridiculed this argument from consensus in De cive, but Cumberlandsought to improve upon it.18He argued that in the newly developed experi-mental and theoretical sciences the Grotian tradition had new and betterweapons to combat the sceptic. ‘It is sufficient for us to have admonishedthe reader,’ wrote Cumberland in the first chapter, ‘that the whole of moralphilosophy, and of the laws of nature, is ultimately resolved into naturalobservations known by the experience of all men, or into conclusions ofnatural philosophy’ (1.3, 40–1). It was true, Cumberland conceded, that thecommon observations of all men had not been enough to answer the scep-tical objections of writers like Hobbes, but the new sciences offered a moreprecise route to establishing the existence of moral obligation. Cumberland’soptimism about the new science was a product of his early study of mathe-matics and its revolutionary application to physics. Cartesian analyticalgeometry had been developed by Cumberland’s Latitudinarian colleagues toexplain complex physical relationships. The physical component of moralaction convinced Cumberland that morality could be analysed in the samefashion, either literally or metaphorically (1.17, 57–8). This new form ofknowledge constituted a mode of discourse that could be used to challengethe conclusions of the sceptic, and possibly expand the boundaries of moralknowledge beyond the narrow view offered by Hobbes.Cumberland’s strategy in the De legibusis to use these new skills to beat Hobbes on his own terms. Hobbes’ apparently scientific approach tohuman nature, morality and politics had done little to improve the reputa-tion of natural philosophy and Cumberland wanted to show that evenworking from Hobbes’ own premises the evidence simply did not justifyHobbes’ sceptical conclusions. The weak link that Cumberland identified in80Jon Parkin"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Hobbes’ position was his acknowledgement that God could be consideredas a first cause of a mechanistically determined universe (1.10, 49). AlthoughHobbes felt that this could tell us nothing useful given the limitations ofhuman understanding, Cumberland inflated the account to establish a linkbetween the first cause of motion and human sense experience. If God wasthe author of all motion then it followed that he could also be consideredas the author of all sense impressions received by man. If ideas or con-clusions derived from sense experience appear to form some kind of relationship then there is a chance that this relationship may be one thatis willed by God.Hobbes rejected this assumption because there was no necessary connec-tion between human perception and God’s will, but Cumberland respondsin his deployment of scientific observational discipline. Cumberland arguedthat scientific observation offered an improved probability that regularitiesin nature might be said to constitute natural laws (2.9, 107–8). It is im-portant to note that Cumberland’s argument did not suggest that scienceoffered an infallible means of identifying objective natural relationships.Rather he was suggesting that, if observed correctly, it was unreasonable toexclude the possibility that such relationships might actually be naturallaws.Cumberland takes Hobbes’ scientia moralisas his starting point and seeksto prove that Hobbes’ conclusions do not necessarily follow from hispremises. Cumberland starts with the natural right to self-preservationwhich Hobbes had made the beginning and the end of his moral and political philosophy. Cumberland argues that Hobbesian self-preservationprovides only a partial account of human motivation. Individuals mightwell start off being self-interested and this is blameless (5.22, 225; 9.3, 347).However, for Cumberland self-preservation is only the basis for discoveringthe necessity of wider social obligations.Cumberland pursues this point in two ways in the first two chapters ofDe legibus. In the first chapter he argues that, even on Hobbes’ account,instinctive self-preservation leads us to recognise our interdependence with others. Human neediness compels self-interested actors to be sociablebecause the goods and security required to live happily are unobtainable toisolated individuals (1.21, 63–4; 5.17, 216–17).If natural necessity suggests that it would be unwise to act selfishly, Cumberland makes a more positive case in Chapter 2, where he cites awealth of scientific evidence to show that human nature seems to bedesigned for a sociable existence. The human brain is too complex if self-preservation is its only function; language is a social skill (2.4, 99–104). Thiskind of observation was an important part of Cumberland’s approach. Theminimal sociability constructed by Grotius and taken up by Hobbes took only a few features of human nature as the basis for ethical theory.Cumberland sought to base his ethics upon a broader range of observedCumberland’s Sceptical Science of Sovereighty81"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"characteristics and his basic message was that, paceHobbes, sociable andbenevolent behaviour was the norm in the natural world. What was more,this could be demonstrated scientifically rather than anecdotally, suggestingthat it should be this benevolent characteristic, rather than Hobbes’ under-standing of self-preservation, which should be taken seriously as the foun-dation for ethics (5.8, 218–19).Cumberland’s accumulated evidence is designed to show that the natureof things makes it clear that the good of the individual is bound, both bytheir limitations and their potentiality, to a common social good. Reasonshows that pursuing the common good should become a priority for indi-viduals because their own good is thereby enhanced. This accumulation ofnatural evidence allows Cumberland to formulate what he terms a ‘practi-cal proposition’ emerging from a consideration of nature. At its most basicthis consists of the proposition that we should always pursue the commongood because our own good is contained therein. Naturally, we should tryto identify the greatest common good because this is the highest ethical endfor ourselves. This turns out to be the common good of the whole systemof rational agents, which includes God, who embodies reason in perfection.Man’s proper action is therefore ‘an endeavour, according to our ability, to promote the common good of the whole system of rationals’ (Intro. sect. xv, 20–1; Intro. sect. ix–x, 16–17).Whereas Hobbes sought to divorce rights from a divine order, Cumberland’s account indicated that individuals are, in fact, bound up inthe workings of a systematic law-bound universe. We might be only dimlyaware of this, but there was sufficient evidence to show that Hobbes mightbe wrong. However, although Cumberland had derived his practical propo-sition, he still needed to prove that it was in fact a law. He needed to giveevidence that his proposition was, in fact, the will of God the legislator.Cumberland’s solution to this problem constituted his most distinctivecontribution to natural law theory. He argued that his practical propositionwas a law because it was possible to find evidence that natural rewards and punishments were attached to its observance and its dereliction (Intro.sect. xv, 20–1). As Cumberland noted, Hobbes had actually discussed theexistence of natural rewards and punishments in Leviathan. For Hobbes, the‘chayne of consequences’ linking a man’s acts to their outcomes was beyondthe perception of, and therefore irrelevant to, mankind in anything otherthan a general sense.19For Cumberland, however, this information was available for scientific analysis.At a simple level, rewards and punishments included happiness andmisery, moving on to a conventional stress upon the punishments inflictedby a guilty conscience. But Cumberland also deploys his mechanistic under-standing of the world to offer novel analyses of natural justice at work. Ifthe system of rational agents is like any other physical system then anyaction contrary to the harmonious motion of the whole will damage the82Jon Parkin"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"offender through the harm caused to the common good. In addition, otherrational actors will perceive the threat to their own good and be moved topunish offenders who damage the common good. If Hobbes doubted therelevance of any of this, Cumberland used this idea to demolish Hobbes’analysis of the state of nature as a state of war. Hobbes was right, arguedCumberland, to suggest that a policy of self-interest results in a state of war.What Hobbes had not noticed, however, was the simple fact that violenceand war were God’s punishment for selfish behaviour. In other words,Hobbes’ model did not illustrate the natural state of man but rather the consequences of acting against natural law (5.25, 228–30).We might feel inclined to be sceptical about the claim that natural rewardsand punishments somehow demonstrate the divine obligation behind thelaws of nature and, indeed, many commentators have seen Cumberland’sfaith in this mechanism as offering little more than a cosmetic voluntaristcover for an account that is essentially deistic and ultimately utilitarian inthe suggestion that rewards and punishments motivate moral obligation.20But this is to misunderstand Cumberland’s position, and to grasp its sig-nificance we have to take his own scepticism more seriously. Cumberlandmakes it clear that rewards and punishments in themselves constitute noform of moral obligation (5.22, 224–6).21They merely act as a clue that Godmay well legislate the position that they support. The second point is thatCumberland’s rewards and punishments were not designed to offer an easyshortcut to decoding God’s will in nature. They were designed to add to theprobability that there was a divinely ordained principle of justice at work inthe world. This more provisional sense of natural law allows Cumberland toexplore the idea, without undermining the rewards and punishments of theafterlife; indeed, Cumberland felt that he was actually underpinning them.The assumption that there was a universal principle of justice in operationencouraged the individual to assume that where there was no earthly pun-ishment for wrongdoing, they could expect that it would be supplied byGod in the afterlife (5.19, 221; 5.25, 230).Cumberland’s project offered sufficient evidence to reject Hobbes’ deeplysceptical account of natural right. We can know enough to grasp that be-nevolent behaviour is more likely to result in a beneficial outcome than itsopposite. The result is that natural law does constitute a practical obligationwhich needs to be taken into consideration. If we recall the debate over the status of natural law in Parker’s political theory, this is exactly what was needed to demonstrate that the Latitudinarians were not disciples ofHobbes.IIIWe can see how Cumberland’s natural law argument supplies political needswhen we consider the political theory of the De legibus. Here Cumberland’sCumberland’s Sceptical Science of Sovereighty83"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"scepticism comes to the fore and it is here that he demonstrates his con-nection to the Latitudinarian cause. He turns his attention to political theoryin Chapter 9 of the De legibus. Much of Cumberland’s account of sovereigntydovetails very closely with Samuel Parker’s discussion in the Discourse ofEcclesiastical Polity. Civil government, Cumberland claims, is prescribed bythe law of nature because it is necessary for the common good. As he writesin Chapter 9: ‘a law being given which commands us to promote the end,a law is likewise given preserving the settlement and preservation of so necessary a means as society with sovereign power’ (9.5, 348). Sovereignpower exists to further the common good and is a feature of all societies.Cumberland’s account of sovereignty is about coordination in the first in-stance. Where there is one end in view there needs to be order and subordi-nation. He sees this scheme supplying the underlying logic to the historicaldevelopment of human societies, even to the point of legitimating patriar-chal government, as Parker had done in his Discourse(9.6, 350).22The firstfamilies were the first communities and they found it necessary to establishthe authority of the father and from this all government is derived. Ashuman societies became more sophisticated they developed new forms ofsubordination in line with the requirements of the common good. But what-ever the type of society, the law of nature always required the existence ofa unitary sovereign authority.Cumberland is obviously wary of any comparison with Hobbes and as aconsequence he is keen to stress that this sovereignty is not without limits.As all right is subject to law, so the right of the sovereign is subject at alltimes to the law of nature. As Cumberland comments:the government of civil power is naturally and necessarily limited by thesame end for which it was established. It is therefore evident, that for thehonour of God, and the happiness of all nations, no government can beestablished that can have a right to destroy these.(9.6, 350)This argument is not designed to act as a resistance theory. Cumberlandmakes it plain that there is no right of resistance, because to resist the sov-ereign is to attack the basis of ordered society and to violate natural law.God provides the only punishment for errant sovereigns and the only le-gitimate recourse for suffering subjects is passive obedience, a point alsostressed by Parker (9.7, 351–2).Cumberland’s scepticism allows him to inflate the potential power of thesovereign. He argues that those things absolutely necessary for the preser-vation of the common good are in fact ‘but few and very evident’ (9.6, 351).This means that sovereignty is only really limited by these few and veryevident things and, as a consequence, the limits of the civil power ‘stillremain very extensive’. I shall return to these few and evident things later,84Jon Parkin"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"but it should be noted that because Cumberland feels that as natural lawoffers only general rules and principles, it is legitimate to grant the sover-eign considerable discretionary power. Parker had made the same point intheDiscourseto justify his expansion of sovereign right. In Cumberland’scase natural law requires only that sovereigns do not ‘overturn the founda-tion of their happiness and dominion, nor to destroy themselves along with others, by opposing such things as are necessary to the common good’(9.6, 351).Cumberland’s argument creates theoretical space for considerable sovereign power and his intention in doing this becomes clearer when hethickens up his account of sovereign right. He argues that the sovereign’sauthority extends ‘universally to things divine and human, of foreigners andfellow-subjects, of peace and war’. One consequence is that the magistrate,in order to pursue the common good, must be constituted the guardian ofboth tables of the Decalogue (9.8, 352). Cumberland’s sovereign possessesextensive rights over the church and this was obviously important for thecontemporary debate over toleration. The shape of Cumberland’s argumentabout the state closely resembles the Latitudinarian attitude towards thegovernment of the church. The details of natural law did not indicate withprecision which means are appropriate for securing the common good. Thenature of church government thus became a matter of prudence and thedirection of the sovereign, whose judgements were at least no worse thanthose of anyone else. As Cumberland writes in Chapter 9:because the public happiness of all mankind, and of every single state,may (as far as men may judge) be almost equally procured by constitu-tions, manners and laws very different; and the welfare of society permitsa various distribution of honour and advantages . . . it is evident thatinnumerable articles may be (as they usually are) with safety permittedto the discretion of rulers.(9.8, 352)Rulers are, of course, always obliged to act with an eye to the common good,but the exact form of government, for Cumberland, is adiaphora.This position, however, confronts the same objections as Parker’s Dis-course. If rulers are permitted such an extensive right, then there is no dif-ference in outcome between the theories of Hobbes and the Latitudinarians.Cumberland tries to spell out the differences, probably with Parker’s Discoursein mind. His case fastens upon Hobbes’ rejection of a commonconception of justice in the state of nature. Once the Hobbesian sovereignis established, it then becomes the arbiter of what constitutes just andunjust. The popular reading of this Hobbesian move was that the sovereigneffectively decided right and wrong for want of an objective natural stand-ard. This was what Cumberland wanted to avoid, and what his argumentsCumberland’s Sceptical Science of Sovereighty85"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"about obligation were designed to attack. That said, Cumberland did notwant to jettison every aspect of the Hobbesian case. He did want to acknowl-edge that there could be disputes where the principles of natural law didnot provide a detailed answer (such as the disputes over church govern-ment), and here an arbiter was required to pronounce an authoritativejudgement. Cumberland’s claim was that it was actually a dictate of the lawof nature that this should occur. It did not follow, however, that this wasHobbism. As he argues in a revealing passage:Upon this head he [Hobbes] is certainly so far in the right; in controver-sies which it is necessary to end, it makes for the common good that thecontending parties willingly relinquish their decision to the reason of thecommonwealth and fully acquiesce therein. And this common and rightreason persuades because it is certain that this decision will either beright, or that right cannot be had consistently with the common good.(9.9, 355)To refer controversial issues to the state was not, therefore, Hobbism.Because of the inability to see exactly what natural law required, it was necessary, for the common good, to refer the decision to an arbiter. Theexample was highly relevant to the religious politics of Parker’s Discourse.Latitudinarian theorists had argued that in the case of intractable theologi-cal disputes it was necessary for the common good that the state shoulddecide. Cumberland returns to this theme several times in Chapter 9, stress-ing the ability of the sovereign to choose between indifferent actions. Wherethe same good end can be obtained by actions of many kinds, Cumberlandargues that the sovereign does not have to give any particular reason for his choice of means. ‘It is sufficient,’ he writes, ‘that the proper end may be obtained by the method commanded. For such a command is truly rational; nor is obedience to such a command less rational, whether in affairsecclesiastical or civil’ (9.13, 367). The last sentence indicates the thrust ofCumberland’s points: to follow the sovereign’s prescription in ecclesiasticalmatters does not necessarily equate to Hobbism and such a command canbe reconciled with natural law.There are many other examples of this reasoning scattered throughout thetext. One of the most interesting occurs in chapter three where Cumberlandemphasises why the role of the magistrate is so important:For it evidently conduces more to the public good, that the opinion ofthe magistrate should prevail in things indifferent and doubtful, and thatsubjects should take that for good, which seems such to the supremepower, rather than eternal broils should continue among them which are,without all question, evil.(3.3, 171)86Jon Parkin"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"If conflict is a natural punishment for violating the law of nature, it there-fore accords with natural law to accept the judgement of the magistrate indoubtful circumstances. It seems likely that Cumberland was making thesearguments with the debate over Parker’s Discoursein mind. Although themoral theory of the De legibuswas designed to emphasise the obligatorycharacter of natural law, Cumberland’s practical scepticism ensured that heretained a role for sovereignty sufficient for the resolution of the religiousconflict that still persisted in Restoration society. Cumberland may haveattacked the basis of Hobbes’ deep scepticism, but he needed to retain thispartially Hobbesian account of conflict resolution for his own theory.IVAlthough the religious politics of the 1660s may have required a scepticalscience of sovereignty, there were other political dangers associated with anextreme account of absolutism. Not the least of these was the threat to prop-erty rights. One of the main problems with accepting a Hobbesian analysiswas Hobbes’ uncompromising position on property. Hobbes’ propertytheory was carefully designed to exclude the idea that there might be somekind of absolute natural right to property, a position developed to refuteopponents of royal taxation policy.23For Cumberland, by contrast, propertyrights, or the ‘division of dominion’, constituted the only serious limit tosovereign power. Although the supreme power has an extensive jurisdiction,the sovereign was forbidden to violate ‘the necessary division of dominion,by which rights are distinctly assigned to God and men’ (9.6, 351).There are two major discussions of property in the De legibus, in Chapters1 and 7. The first treatment seeks to emphasise Cumberland’s distance fromHobbes’ account. For Cumberland, property rights develop because the useof things and even labour is physically restricted (1.21–2, 62–4). Individ-uals cannot use more than they are physically able to and this leads to theidea that there must be some natural division of property. If only one personcan make use of something in a productive fashion, then natural justice dictates that that person should have a natural right to that object whilethey are able to use it.Cumberland’s natural right to property, however, is far from being uncon-ditional and absolute. All natural rights are dependent upon the law ofnature that recommends pursuit of the greatest collective good (1.23, 65–8).Individuals therefore have a natural right to hold property only so long astheir holding it contributes to the common good. This position entails aright to subsistence and also to some limited forms of redistribution, butCumberland is not keen to explore the radical potential of this argument,for obvious reasons. The difficulty of identifying the requirements of the lawof nature would expand the role of the magistrate in determining rightfulproperty distribution. Although Cumberland was keen to emphasise theCumberland’s Sceptical Science of Sovereighty87"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"right of the magistrate in other matters, he shies away from allowing thestate extensive rights to interfere with property. Instead, he suggests thatthere is a prudential case for entrenching property rights.Cumberland argues that if the initial distribution of property rightsfavours the common good and if, as he suggests, the conditions under whichthat distribution was made persist, then this leads to men settling ‘a plenarydominion over things, and at length also over persons, or such labours of persons as are necessary to the common happiness’ (7.2, 313–14). Cumberland adduces various arguments to suggest that stable and legally entrenched property rights contribute to the common good by virtueof their existence. New land may well have to be divided up for the commongood and in some cases redistribution may be required in the case of con-flict. Nevertheless the common good is best preserved by maintaining thenetwork of property rights developed from the first distribution, a distribu-tion that predates the sovereign authority (7.2, 313–14). In the case of prop-erty, Cumberland’s sceptical approach suggests that if the distribution ofproperty is not causing social dysfunction (an obvious sign of natural pun-ishment), then it is better to leave it alone.This argument makes an interesting contrast with Cumberland’s moreradical position on sovereignty, and I would argue that it reveals a great dealabout his intentions in composing the De legibusin the way that he did.What Cumberland needed above all was an account of sovereignty power-ful enough to resolve the kind of conflict experienced in the debate overdissent. On the other hand, he also needed to make it clear that his abso-lutism faced practical limitations, and this was the purpose of his defenceof entrenched property rights, a position designed to differentiate his argument from Hobbes’. Cumberland’s scepticism worked to legitimate apowerful account of sovereignty in the former case, and at the same timewas deployed to defend the status quo when discussing property rights.In practical terms Cumberland’s political theory was profoundly influ-enced by his scepticism about determining the detailed requirements of thelaw of nature. His refutation of Hobbes gave highly probable evidence thatGod’s will operated in the world, but when it came to matters of practicalpolicy there still needed to be room for practical and prudent judgementbased upon probability. Cumberland’s sceptical science of sovereignty wasdesigned to show how these ideas could be made to cohere in such a wayas to make them relevant to the political issues of his day, especially withregard to the debate over religious toleration.It could be suggested that this did little in practice to separate Cumberland from Hobbes, but I would suggest that this is to misunderstandthe significance of Cumberland’s contribution. Seventeenth-century naturallaw theorists after Hobbes developed their ideas in contexts where the prob-lems associated with religious pluralism coexisted uneasily with the recon-struction of the state. In these circumstances theorists like Cumberland88Jon Parkin"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"needed to preserve a role for Hobbesian sovereignty without embracing theproblematic implications of Hobbes’ deeply sceptical approach.

It is oftenargued that one of the reasons for the notoriety of Thomasius’ views washis use of a secular natural law in defining this relationship. It is the use ofsecular argument to define the status of the church that is often regarded as one of the main ‘enlightened’ characteristics of Thomasius’ philosophy.Natural jurisprudence is, of course, an important part of Thomasius’thought. It is my contention, however, that his conception of the relation-ship between prince and church is also based on theologicalarguments,which have so far received relatively little attention in secondary literature.It is even possible, I will argue, to emphasise theology rather than secularthought in explaining Thomasius’ ideas on the question of church andstate.1One reason for the relative neglect of Thomasius’ theological argumentsis that they often seem unnecessary to understanding Thomasius’ secularpolitical and legal thought. Thomasius, throughout his academic career, was highly critical of all clerical interference in politics. Many clergymen,he declared, were domineering, corrupt and greedy, and influenced the decisions of their secular ruler in their own favour. Thus it appears as ifThomasius had been intent on isolating politics from religion and on for-mulating a purely secular political theory.2It is also argued that this desireto separate theology and politics is something to be expected in the HolyRoman Empire after the confessional strife in the first half of the seven-teenth century. In 1648 the Peace Treaties of Westphalia concluded theThirty Years War, which had largely, though not exclusively, been a warbetween different Christian confessions. The experience of this war, it isargued, produced a desire to prevent future theological disagreement fromleading to armed conflict. To this end, it is said, political power was increas-ingly deconfessionalised, that is, separated from the ruler’s particular religious loyalties.391"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"I will argue, however, that Thomasius’ critique of clerical interference inpolitics is not so much an argument from secular political theory as a critique of particular conceptions of Christian faith and the structure of thechurch. The problem, Thomasius argues, is not a wrong conception of thestate, but a corrupt theology, which allows the clergy to justify its influenceon politics and in jurisdiction.The clergy’s influence on politics is not direct. It is exercised through thepower of the clergy within the church. Although clergymen do not pass lawsor command armies, they have the power to excommunicate and can per-suade laymen that their salvation depends on the clergy’s approval of theiractions. The clergy possess this power only if they can mould theologicaldoctrine according to their needs. It is the corrupt, distorted theologyresult-ing from this which cements the clergy’s excessive power over believers.Once a correct notion of faith has been restored, superstition has beenrooted out, the structure of the church has been reformed and the power of the clergy in the church has been restricted to its proper limits, then,Thomasius believes, the clergy will lose their means of influence and their interference in politics will cease.Thomasius’ critique of clerical interference in politics is directed againstthe traditional Lutheranism, which, in the territories of the Elector of Brandenburg, was strongly opposed to the religious policies of the Calvin-ist ruler. Thomasius’ intention is to discredit the Lutherans’ resistance to theElector’s religious policies by depicting this resistance as an example of‘priestcraft’, the use of religion by the clergy as a pretext for exercisingsecular power.4This purpose requires a detailed critique by Thomasius of theprinciples of orthodox Lutheran theology and ecclesiology. Thomasius’ aim,I will argue, is not so much to prove that the state is a secular entity, butthat orthodox Lutheran religion is false.Although Thomasius was always critical of orthodox Lutheranism, his theological ideas changed significantly during his academic career and I will structure the chapter accordingly. I will first discuss Thomasius’ ideason this question in the early 1690s, shortly after his arrival in Halle, thenin the second and third sections of the chapter move on to the develop-ment of his ideas after the mid-1690s, when his religious thought was transformed.IIn 1690 Thomasius published the On the Felicity of the Subjects of the Elector of Brandenburg(De felicitate subditorum brandenburgicorum) in Halle.This piece was the first university disputation over which he presided afterhis quarrel with the Leipzig theologians and his departure from Saxonyearlier in the same year.5In the De felicitateThomasius began by criticis-ing the confusion of theology and secular philosophy. The purpose of this92Thomas Ahnert"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"critique was, however, not to remove theology from philosophy, but thereverse: theology, Thomasius complained, had been corrupted by philo-sophical admixtures.6Philosophy had no place in theological argument. Itscontinued use in theology was an inheritance from pagan antiquity. Themain culprits in this were the scholastics. As Thomasius had written in theInstitutiones Jurisprudentiae Divinae, published shortly before the De felicitatein 1688:[T]hese are the fruits of gentile philosophy, or rather its harmful conse-quences, that the Scholastics attempted to deduce the mysteries of faithfrom philosophy, and made philosophy the measure of theology, con-trary to the precept of the Apostle, who admonished the Colossians notto allow themselves to be deceived by philosophy and vain fallacy.7In the De felicitate Thomasius argued that this mixture of theology with phi-losophy had corrupted Christian faith. Scripture was simple and self-evident;it did not require philosophy to be understood. The application of philoso-phy to Scripture produced only conflicting false interpretations, which ledto quarrels among theologians. Charity, the most important Christianvirtue, suffered accordingly.8The confusion of philosophy and religion was no accident, Thomasiuswrote. Theologians had introduced philosophical argument into theologi-cal debate out of a desire for ‘the primacy within the church and for controlof secular power’.9The use of philosophy allowed them to twist the meaningof Scripture to serve their own ends. By pretending that their particular interpretation, based on their supposedly superior expertise in theology, tobe the salvificatory faith, clergymen persuaded the laity of their authority.They aimed to make the laity obedient to themselves, even at the cost ofcorrupting Christian faith with extraneous human argument.10Removing the clergy’s influence from politics, therefore, required endingthe mixture of philosophy and Scripture and restoring the pristine faith,which would not serve the clergy’s selfish interest. It was, of course, unlikelythat the clergy would end this abuse because their power depended on it.11The person who would end the corruption of Christian faith, Thomasius believed, was the prince, at least in the case of Brandenburg. As Thomasius pointed out, in 1614 and again in 1664 the electors had bannedthe use of anything but Scripture in theological disputes and forbade po-lemical sermons by members of one confession against the other.12Far fromkeeping religion and secular affairs apart, the electors had thus interveneddirectly in purely religious affairs. These interventions, Thomasius argued,were attempts to restore the purity of Christian religion in their territories.They were acts of a godly prince, concerned for the state of faith, whothereby also deprived a corrupt clergy of their means of illegitimate influence.13The Prince and the Church in the Thought of Thomasius93"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"IIFrom about 1693, however, Thomasius’ conception of the nature of Christian faith began to change. The changes in turn influenced his critiqueof the clergy’s interference in politics. Until this time he had argued thatwhat was true doctrine was evident from Scripture, unless humans tried toforce Scripture into a philosophical framework. Only then did the meaningof Scripture become obscure and did conflicting interpretations develop.Around 1693, however, this changed, for as Thomasius noted, controversyover doctrine did not vanish, even if only Scripture was accepted as the basisof the argument. One reason for this was that theological doctrine con-cerned the divine mysteries which were incomprehensible to human reason.Thomasius had already said this in previous writings, but he now concludedfrom this that the divine mysteries could only be represented in the form of metaphors. No metaphor, however, was ever exclusively true: a poetmight compare beauty to a flower or a pearl or something else. Even Scripture, therefore, could not serve as the basis for a consensus in doctri-nal questions.14But if neither reason not clerical authority were accepted inarguments over Scripture, there really was no final arbiter in disputes overScriptural interpretation.Thomasius’ response to this problem was to reject the idea that Christianfaith consisted in any doctrines at all. There could be no consensus in doctrinal questions. Faith, moreover, did not require the acceptance of particular doctrinal truths. To look for these in Scripture, therefore, was unnecessary. Faith consisted instead in a mystical orientation of thebeliever’s will towards God. This orientation of the will was prior to anyopinions, including religious doctrines, in the intellect. The will was notinformed by the intellect, but on the contrary defined the ends towardswhich the efforts of the intellect were directed. The will was thus not acapacity for choosing between different courses of action, based on thejudgement of the intellect. It was never in equipoise between various pos-sibilities, representing instead a desire or love for something and therebyproviding the motive power for human action.15If the will were completelyfree and undetermined, Thomasius pointed out, it would never be able toarrive at a decision: to explain a choice made by the will you would haveto posit a will of the will and so on, ad infinitum. This was an argument alsoused by Leibniz and Hobbes, although to different ends: Hobbes to groundthe will in desire, Leibniz in ideas.16There were, Thomasius argued, four basic forms of this will as desire. One,the good will, was the love of God, from which all other virtues followed.The other three, bad forms of volition, were lust, ambition and avarice, atriad which stems from a long tradition and ultimately is derived from afusion of the first Epistle of John with Aristotle.17The good will can exist94Thomas Ahnert"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"only in a pure form, but the three corrupt varieties can be mixed in varyingproportions.This conception of the will was central to Thomasius’ definition of religious faith. The faithful, he wrote, were those whose desire was directed towards God. They were not distinguished by particular doctrinalbeliefs, but by the orientation of their will towards God. The faithless were those whose volition was corrupt and who loved the world – a starklyAugustinian distinction.18This love of either God or the world was notchosenby a free will: this love was identical to the will. The transition to thegood will therefore could not be a matter of choice. Nor could it be broughtabout by informing the intellect, because the activity of the intellect wassubordinated to the will. Instead, the good will was brought about by aprocess of regeneration, in which the individual realised his corruption,despaired at his inability to bring about regeneration and yearned for God’sassistance, which, if the person was sincere, would be granted in the formof divine grace. With the arrival of divine grace the love of God was restoredand replaced the love of creation characteristic of the corrupt.19Thomasius’ new conception of faith thus devalued doctrine in favour of a mystical love for God, which, to many contemporaries, smacked of religious enthusiasm. Thomasius’ argument was highly significant for hiscritique of his orthodox Lutheran clerical opponents. Orthodox Lutheransconceived of the human church, the ecclesia visibilis, as a community definedprecisely by its consensus on orthodox doctrine derived from Scripture.Orthodox Lutheran theorists distinguished between the church triumphantafter the Last Judgement and the church militant in the saeculum, the world before that time. The church militant consisted of the ecclesia invis-ibilisand the ecclesia visibilis. The former was the invisible and universalchurch of all Christians, the latter the sum of all human congregations. Inthe human congregations the members of the invisible, true church weremixed with those who were believers in a formal sense without being trueChristians, such as hypocrites, sinners and those still struggling to attainChristian faith. Though there might, in exceptional cases, be Christiansoutside the visible church, normally Christian faith was presented to aperson through the visible church. God’s providence took care that nobodywould be denied the opportunity of accepting the gift of salvation beforethe Last Judgement.20Although membership in the visible church thus was no guarantee of sal-vation, it fulfilled an important role in guiding its members towards eternallife, because it taught the saving doctrine of the gospel to its members.Whether they adopted this doctrine or not, the human church could notdetermine. Judging the sincerity of a believer was left to divine scrutiny. The human church, however, had to ensure that scriptural doctrine was presented correctly and, within the church, was not challenged publicly byThe Prince and the Church in the Thought of Thomasius95"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"contrary opinions, which only confused those who were not yet firm in theirfaith. The human, visible church was not intended to be identical to theinvisible community of saints, but it had to be undisturbed in its task ofteaching salvificatory doctrine. As Johann Benedikt Carpzov, a Leipzig professor of theology and opponent of Thomasius in the 1690s wrote, inthe human church it was requisite that ‘a sentence [was] passed, in whichthe errors [were] condemned and silence [was] imposed on their authors orprotagonists, and which [was] brought to the notice of everyone by pro-mulgating it in public’.21The purpose of such a sentence was threefold: to separate true from false doctrine, end disputes among theologians, andrestore peace in the church. This peace may not be perfect, because it permitssinners, hypocrites and imperfect Christians to rub shoulders with the trueChristians in the visible church. It is, however, the best the ecclesia militanscan achieve.22To orthodox Lutherans Thomasius’ reduction of faith to a quasi-mysticallove of God seemed to deny that salvation required holding particular religious beliefs. In the eyes of theologians such as Carpzov, faith in Thomasius’ sense became identical to enthusiastic Schwaermerey, the rejec-tion of doctrinal correctness in favour of a belief in faith as based on indi-vidual divine inspiration. The orthodox accepted the possibility of divineinspiration, but to them this inspiration had to express itself in opinionswhich could be verified by the standard of revealed doctrine. Thomasius’reduction of faith to love and his characterisation of doctrines as exchange-able metaphors, made it impossible in orthodox eyes to distinguish truedivine inspiration from false. As one of Thomasius’ most tenacious oppo-nents, the orthodox Lutheran clergyman Roth in Leipzig put it, fides, faith,began with notitia, the knowledge in the intellect of the message of salva-tion offered by Christ. In the believer notitiawas followed by assensus, intel-lectual assent to this message. From this sprangfiducia, trust in God.Thomasius’ argument, Roth maintained, was an example of religious Enthusiasterey.23Roth was not alone in his rejection of Thomasian enthusiasm. A juniormember of the theological faculty in Halle and later pastor in Nuremberg,Gustav Mörl, criticised those ‘who present love of God and one’s neighbourand self-abnegation as the foundation of faith and of our salvation’, that isThomasius.24The primary purpose of faith, Mörl argued, was not ‘regenera-tion and sanctity’ in temporal life, as Thomasius maintained, but to attain‘eternal life and beatitude’ after death. In Mörl’s opinion, Thomasius confused the two. Eternal life could be brought about only by faith in Christ, whose death on the cross had offered mankind the remission of sins. Without Christ’s intercession with the Father eternal, death followedinevitably from the guilt of original sin. However piously and uprightly aperson lived in this life, nobody could escape eternal damnation withoutChrist’s meritum, his atonement for humanity’s original sin. The intellectual96Thomas Ahnert"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"knowledge that God would save the believer who had faith in Christ, Mörlclaimed, led to love towards God, so that ‘true faith was never found withoutlove towards God’. But nor was ‘love towards God [found] without truefaith’.25It was not possible to equate faith and love as Thomasius did.Even theologians at Thomasius’ own university of Halle found his indif-ference towards doctrine excessive. The professor of theology Justus JoachimBreithaupt said that while regeneration took place mainly in the will, it wasnot possible to abandon all criteria of true and false for the concepts of the divine mysteries. Breithaupt agreed with Thomasius that the humanintellect could not grasp the infinite and no ‘true or positive knowledgecould be produced of these matters, beyond opinion or merely negative con-cepts’.26But although the divine mysteries themselves might be incompre-hensible, they had to be distinguished from the meaning of the words usedto describe them in Scripture, which could be understood. The evidentnessof things considered in themselves was different from that of words: ‘WhenI see a thing before me, as it is, the concepts of it follow from its presence;but where there are only words as signs of things, these concepts are notformed from the scrutiny of the object, but flow from the meanings of the words.’27The words used in Scripture to describe the divine mysteriesconveyed an imperfect knowledge of them, but nevertheless ‘a positive and truthful knowledge. . . insofar as the Holy Ghost intends to produce itin us, according to humans’ capacity to understand them’.28Thomasius’ views on faith, these theologians believed, made it impos-sible to distinguish true faith from false, divinely inspired believers from religious enthusiasts and fanatics. The danger of religious enthusiasm wasfelt to be especially strong at the time Thomasius was writing. The last yearsof the seventeenth century saw the emergence of numerous radical religiousmovements such as the Philadelphic societies in the Holy Roman Empire.Millenarian expectations were heightened by the imminent turn of thecentury. In the 1690s a series of ecstatic prophetesses made their appearanceranging from the blood-sweating Anna Eva Jakobs in Quedlinburg and thenoble Rosamunde Juliane von Assenburg, who had had visions of Christalready as a child, to Katharina Reinecke and Anna Margaretha Jahn in Halberstadt, who were the subject of an inquiry chaired by Veit Ludwig von Seckendorff, the first chancellor of the University in Halle, at whichThomasius lectured.29Thomasius, on the other hand, maintained that the orthodox Lutherans’insistence on doctrine only reflected the clergy’s desire for power over thelaity. It was, to use a contemporary English expression, an example of ‘priest-craft’.30Even though the church was supposedly governed by all three estatesjointly, the clergy, Thomasius argued, exercised effective control over thedefinition of doctrine. By making faith dependent on the profession of par-ticular opinions, Thomasius said, the clergy could define those who did notagree to its doctrines as heretics. Under this pretext the clergy could thenThe Prince and the Church in the Thought of Thomasius97"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"persecute these dissenters or have them persecuted by the secular authority.By declaring something to be a necessary part of faith, the clergy couldcompel the laity to actions which were in the clergy’s interest.31Preventing the clergy’s interference in politics, in Thomasius’ eyes, therefore, did not require a theory of the secular state, which is not veryprominent in Thomasius’ works. It required instead a theory of church government and faith which could not serve as a pretext for exercisingsecular power over believers. Thomasius’ critique of priestcraft was a critiqueof manipulated theology. Whether orthodox Lutheran clergymen really didexercise secular powers over their flock is a matter of definition and of littleinterest here.32What is important is that the debate over the issue of the political power of the clergy is conducted mainly in ecclesiological andtheological terms.IIIOne common argument about Thomasius’ theory of the relationshipbetween the prince and his church is that Thomasius gave the prince con-trol over all external actions of his subjects in religious matters, while theinner sphere of conscience remained free. This meant that the prince coulddetermine the outward form of religious ceremonies in accordance with thedemands of the secular state. This interpretation, however, I will argue isunconvincing, because the prince, in Thomasius’ opinion, generally cannotbe said to have a politicalreason for determining external ceremonies andrites. There are exceptional cases. The prince can and must ban rituals whichlead to civil unrest. However, unless the result is civil unrest, the prince hasno political justification for changing ritual. In so far as Thomasius doesgrant the prince a right to regulate ceremony this right is generally not legitimated in secular political terms.In his De jure principis circa adiaphoraThomasius explicitly criticises his older friend Samuel Pufendorf on this point. In his De habitu religionisChristianae ad vitam civilemof 1687 Pufendorf had argued for the existenceof a natural religion which required men to worship God in a manner whichwas appropriate to God’s greatness. Humans could know on the basis ofnatural reason of the existence of an omnipotent God who had created theworld and they were obliged by nature to express their gratitude to thecreator in worship.33This obligation to worship rests on the same groundsas natural law: humans knew that God must have commanded this worship,just as they knew that God must have given them the precepts of naturallaw. Further, the subject who did not worship, it was to be assumed, did notrespect God as legislator of natural law, either, and therefore was likely tobreak the precepts of natural law.34The person who did not worship God ina suitable fashion, therefore, could be punished by the secular magistrate,just as someone violating the precepts of natural law could be punished.98Thomas Ahnert"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"This is an argument in which limited powers of the sovereign over worshipare justified in terms of public tranquillity.Thomasius, however, contradicts Pufendorf on this point in his De jureprincipis circa adiaphora (The Right of the Prince in Indifferent Matters) of 1695,arguing that external worship is no certain sign of whether a person is agood citizen. Reverence for God can be feigned: [h]is enim hypocrita &homo omnibus vitiis deditus etiam vacare potest’ (‘even somebody who isa hypocrite and the slave of all vices can perform external ceremonies’).35Aperson’s conduct is a far better indication of probity than participation insome religious ritual. God does not need these external signs of worship,either, because he reads the heart and does not look on outward actions tojudge a person’s devotion.36It is true that in the De jure principis circa adiaphoraThomasius does saythat the prince can regulate external ceremonies. He can, for example, intro-duce the Gregorian calendar, decide whether to allow instrumental churchmusic and rule on whether to permit auricular confession.37The importantpoint is that the prince’s justification for this is not political. It is not aboutreason of state and it does not, I believe, reflect a secular conception of therelation between prince and church, as has been argued. Thomasius doeswrite that the prince should follow the ‘salus populi’, when he determinesthe form of religious ceremonies. It is, however, important to note the definitionwhich Thomasius here gives to the term ‘well-being of the people’.He says that the prince cares for the salus populi‘most when he abrogatesceremonies which are useless and tend and dispose more towards super-stition than towards edification’.38It is the concern for the people’s pietywhich should be guiding the prince’s actions, not political necessity andexpediency.The importance of the concern for piety should not be underestimated,especially in the context of Brandenburg-Prussia in the seventeenth century.In 1613 the then elector, Johann Sigismund, had converted to Calvinism,precisely in order to complete the Protestant Reformation, which he felt hadfallen short of the thorough reform of religion which had been necessary.The Reformation of 1540 under the Elector Joachim had been an extremelycautious modification of Catholicism, described as a via mediabetween theold and the new faith. Epitaphs in churches, chasubles, auricular confessionand even exorcism in baptism were retained in the Lutheran church of Brandenburg. After 1613 it was precisely this so-called ‘leftover papal dung’that was targeted by the electors.39It is noticeable how critical Thomasius is at all times of subordinating reli-gion, including external ceremonies, to political interests. In the Einleitungzur Sittenlehre(Introduction to Moral Philosophy) of 1692 he wrote that:it should be considered that if the secular interest of a commonwealth isthe true purpose of religious ritual one should have to say that divineThe Prince and the Church in the Thought of Thomasius99"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"service must differ according to the different republics and that thechangeable interest of this or that republic must be the standard of achangeable divine service, which would seem very inappropriate andalmost blasphemous.40As a result, Thomasius rejected what may be termed a ‘civil religion’, a formof worship which is intended to buttress citizens’ loyalty towards the state.In his Vollstaendige Erlaeuterung der Kirchenrechtsgelahrtheit, based on lectureshe gave on Pufendorf’s De habitu in 1701, he observed that making citizensperform particular ceremonies contributed nothing to civil peace and moral-ity: ‘There are many adults, who attend church assiduously and never-theless before and after church lead a dissolute life, governed by all theirpassions.’41Thomasius even goes as far as to say that the prince should notinterfere in either cultus internus orcultus externus. The conscience is, ofcourse, free anyway, but a particular externalcult contributes nothing topublic peace either and is unnecessary to revere God, who inspects the heart,not outward actions, which any hypocrite can perform. The external cult,Thomasius writes is commanded ‘neither by reason nor by revelation’.42Thomasius concludes that ‘both the cultus externus and the cultus internusshould be free for all men, and they do not pertain to the prince insofar ashe is head of the state’.43This seems at first to contradict what I pointed out above, that Thomasiusgave the prince the right to purge rituals of superstitious practices. He says this not only in the De jure principis circa adiaphora, but in the Vollständige Erläuterung der Kirchenrechtsgelahrtheit, too.44It is important tonote, however, that this freedom of the cultus externusrefers only to non-superstitiousforms of worship. Thomasius, as shown above, believed thatGod was incomprehensible and that therefore there was no single correctway to worship him. What was important was that this worship was moti-vated by sincere, childlike love. It was thus distinct from those establishedrituals, which had been born of superstition. Superstition made worshippersbelieve, that their performance of the external ritual alone would pleaseGod. It was the old ‘papalist’ belief in the efficacy of the opus operatum,which Thomasius was attacking here. While the prince should at least tryto abolish rituals based on superstition, this was not always possible. Theemotional, unreasonable attachment of the populace to these rituals oftenmade it impracticable to attempt this reform. ‘So the prince must take carethat the ceremonies are restricted gradually, because it cannot be changedall at once, but one must be tolerant, in order to maintain some order among the subjects.’45The reference to the Lutherans in Brandenburg is clear. They had vehe-mently opposed the attempts by the electors to reform their religious practices. The attempt by the elector in 1615 to have crucifixes, images and side-altars removed from the Berlin Dom – after all his court church –100Thomas Ahnert"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"led to violent anti-Calvinist riots. The mob stormed the houses of theCalvinist court preachers Sachse and Füssel, vandalising and looting theinventory. Füssel and Sachse barely escaped, the former with no more thanthe clothes he was wearing at the time, so that for Good Friday services laterthat week Füssel appeared in the pulpit in a green vest, his underwear, stock-ings and a borrowed gown.46This local Lutheran resistance to Calvinism continued throughout the seventeenth century. Attempts at mediation such as the various Religionsge-sprächeorganised by the electors, invariably failed. When the Swedish armyoccupied the Mark Brandenburg during the Thirty Years War, the Swedeswere able to exploit the Lutherans’ hostility to their elector to their advan-tage.47Thomasius presented this Lutheran resistance to the elector as anexample of priestcraft. If the Lutherans were denying the elector the rightto reform their church, then this was because the Lutheran clergy fearedlosing its power over its congregation. In abolishing the corrupt religiouspractices, the elector would rob the orthodox Lutheran clergy of its holdover laymen.It can be argued, therefore, that Thomasius’ critique of clerical inter-ference in politics does not necessarily require a theory of state sovereignty.That clergymen should not have political power is seen as self-evident andis accepted even by Thomasius’ most traditional orthodox Lutheran oppo-nents.48The challenge Thomasius faces is not to prove that clerical inter-ference in politics is wrong – practically everybody agreed with that – butthat the orthodox Lutherans’ ecclesiological and theological ideas led to pre-cisely this influence of the clergy on political life. To do this, he had to provenot that the state should be a secular entity, but that orthodox Lutheranismwas nothing but a pretext for exercising secular power. This, in turn,demanded a theological refutation of orthodox Lutheranism: for if this wasa pretext for secular power, it had to be false in theological terms, too. Whatappears at first to be a debate about the sovereignty of the secular state,therefore, turns out to be an attempt to undermine the independence of aterritorial church, by accusing its clergy of political ambition.Natural law has been conspicuously absent from my account. It is oftengiven a more central place in discussions of this problem in Thomasius’thought, but it seems to me that it is less important to the ‘church and statedebate’ in Thomasius, than the theological and ecclesiological issues I havediscussed above. Thomasius’ critique of the orthodox Lutherans is only onevariety of the critiques of priestcraft which were common in the EuropeanRepublic of Letters around 1700. In England they were stimulated by theAnglican church’s increasing suppression of dissenters after 1660, when the Church of England was restored. As many critics of the establishedchurch argued, it was only the interference of clergymen in politics whichled to these persecutions. In France, Huguenots in the late seventeenthcentury were faced with increasing persecution, which culminated in theThe Prince and the Church in the Thought of Thomasius101"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. One of the most famousHuguenot refugees, Pierre Bayle, commented that the King of France hadbeen persuaded to persecute the Huguenots by a corrupt and power-hungryCatholic clergy. It is not suprising, therefore, to see Thomasius accusing theorthodox Lutherans in the territories of the Elector of Brandenburg of ‘priestcraft’. Their opposition to the Elector, he maintained was no morethan clerical ambition masquerading as religion.Notes1. Some of the most recent important publications on Thomasius are F.

This is the idea that God’s right to rule over men derives fromhis having created them. God, Locke notes, gave us both our bodies and oursouls, as well as all the faculties that these come with. Therefore, God hasas complete a right to rule over us as a workman has to dispose of his ownhandiwork.1But why should the fact that God has created us imply that he has a right to rule us? To modern scholars, Locke’s argument has seemedto express both the great distance between Locke and our modern ways of thinking, and the internal strains of Locke’s position.2The aim of thischapter is to re-establish the sense of the Creator’s right model within thecontext of late seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century debates on naturallaw. This model, as I will strive to show, is not only understandable withinthat context, but has some considerable philosophical strengths that evenmodern atheists may appreciate. Instead of plunging into an exegesis ofLocke’s rather well-known texts, I will strive to bring out these strengths,which relate both to the moral and the political thought of our authors, byreading a less well-known natural law theorist who defended the very sameview of God’s right to rule.Locke was not alone in presenting what modern commentators have oftenregarded as weak or confused arguments for God’s right to rule. In order tograsp the meaning and importance of Locke’s attachment to the Creator’sright argument, this argument must be reinserted into its historical land-scape. That landscape was constituted by a broad European debate on thenature of sovereign power as wielded by the sovereign of sovereigns on theone hand, and as wielded by human rulers on the other. Of the different(British, German, Swiss and refugee Huguenot) interlocutors in this debate,I will focus in particular on the natural law professor Jean Barbeyrac(1694–1744). The opposed positions on this issue taken by the authors dis-cussed in this chapter – Pufendorf, Leibniz, Locke, Barbeyrac, Burlamaqui,109"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Wolff – are not best viewed as simply expressions of competing theologicalviews, or even of opposed moral philosophies. The debate also connects veryimportantly to the views on the tasks and on the authority of the civil sov-ereign defended by these authors. This connection is brought out quiteclearly by Barbeyrac’s arguments. Barbeyrac, whose fame in the eighteenthcentury was mainly based on his best-selling French translations of SamuelPufendorf’s natural law treatises, also elegantly illustrates how the Creator’sright model relates to other available accounts of God’s right to rule. Onlya comparison of these different models can reveal the relative merits andphilosophical advantages (or disadvantages) of the Creator’s right model,and show what questions thinkers like Barbeyrac and Locke thought theywere addressing in defending it.I. Pufendorf’s response to HobbesThe issue of God’s right to rule is a standard theme in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century debates on natural law. In most cases, these debatesrelate to Pufendorf’s critique of Hobbes. The latter famously declares thatGod’s right to rule is notderived from the fact that he created us, or fromsome gratitude that men feel for the benefits God has bestowed on them.God’s right to rule over men, Hobbes holds, must be derived ‘not from hisCreating them as if he required obedience, as of Gratitude for his benefits;but from his Irresistible Power’.3Pufendorf protests that such a view does notallow for any distinction between obligation and constraint. Strength isindeed required to enable a superior to rule efficiently. In order for a supe-rior (whether human or divine) to have a rightto rule he must have some‘just reasons [justae causae] why he can demand that our liberty be limitedat his pleasure’.4A few paragraphs later, Pufendorf specifies that I ‘have noapparent reason to question’ the power of a being who 1) has bestowed con-siderable benefits on me; 2) seems better qualified to take care of my futurethan I am myself; 3) has already expressed his desire to rule me; and 4)whose rule I have already voluntarily submitted to.5‘This is all the moretrue,’ Pufendorf continues, ‘if I am indebted to him for my very being. Forwhy should not He, who gave man the power of free action, be able fromHis own right to limit some part of man’s liberty.’6Pufendorf’s observations were hotly debated in the early eighteenthcentury. In a famous critical letter on Pufendorf’s principles, Leibniz arguedthat Pufendorf had failed to distance himself from Hobbes. This is princi-pally because Pufendorf’s efforts at providing a justification for God’s rightto rule failed: indeed, they had to fail. For Pufendorf, moral judgements arealways dependent on law. A law, as Hobbes and Pufendorf agree, is thecommand of a superior. Ultimately, all human laws derive their moral forcefrom the natural laws and from the idea that these laws are divine com-mands. All our moral distinctions, then, presuppose that the natural laws110Petter Korkman"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"are already received as commands given by a legitimately ruling God. Thisposition obviously makes it impossible for Pufendorf to claim that mencould articulate a moral justification for God’s right to rule prior to accept-ing that rule. And if no such prior justification can be given, Leibniz argues,then men do not obey God because they see that he has ‘just reasons’ fordemanding our obedience, or because he is just, good, and so on. Mensimply have no moral terminology available to make such distinctions priorto accepting God’s rule. The only reason left, why men might agree to obeyGod, is the Thrasymachean and Hobbist reason: that God is omnipotent,and that we fear his sanctions. Thus, Pufendorf gives us just as tyrannical aGod as Hobbes does, and in fact he allows us no way to distinguish betweenGod and an omnipotent devil. Furthermore, by making God’s will the definition of morality for us, Pufendorf ends up with a radical voluntaristposition, where God creates morality by arbitrary fiat, and where he could change it at will. Pufendorf’s principles, Leibniz concludes, are bothphilosophically confused and dangerous to true piety. Pufendorf makes God a tyrannical sovereign whose right to rule we cannot justify morally,and whom we obey passively and blindly.II. Burlamaqui’s PufendorfOne way of salvaging Pufendorf from Leibniz’s critique would be to focuson his arguments from benevolence and competence. If God is good andwills what is good for us, and if he is at the same time wise and more capableof looking after our interests than we are ourselves, then does not this initself provide him with ‘just reasons’ to rule us? According to the Swissnatural law professor Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui, it does.According to Burlamaqui, a discussion about obligation and about God’sright to rule must ultimately start with the fact that man naturally strivesfor happiness. Reason, as a calculus about how best to achieve this goal, provides the first foundation of morality.7Whatever reason judges to be conducive to human happiness is therefore ‘morally obligatory’. When aman perceives God as not only omnipotent, but as benevolent (good) andcompetent (wise), he realises that obedience to God does indeed constitutethe most direct course to the felicity he aspires to.8This realisation providesman with the strongest possible motive for accepting the divinely imposedlaw as his rule. Such motives, Burlamaqui argues, are what moral obligationis all about. Burlamaqui concludes that his account accords exactly withPufendorf’s: this is what Pufendorf meant, then, when he drew God’s benevolence and competence.9For Burlamaqui, morality as a whole is about how men are to becomehappy. While this idea of morality is different from Leibniz’s view, it is nota Pufendorfian view either.10Pufendorf quite explicitly claimed that theutility of the laws is not the reason why the laws are morally obligatory.11Barbeyrac on the Creator’s Right to Rule111"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"More generally, the ends that men propose to themselves can never give riseto moral obligation without the intervention of a higher principle. In thisrespect, Pufendorf’s discussion of God’s benevolence and competence wasperhaps somewhat unlucky, since that discussion could easily lead to inter-pretations like that defended by Burlamaqui: interpretations which standPufendorf’s moral philosophy quite on its head.12Barbeyrac was clearlyaware of this problem and argued that Pufendorf should have been morecareful with his wordings. The idea of God is undoubtedly the idea of a beingwho is both benevolent and competent, as well as omnipotent. The idea ofsuch a being is, furthermore, accepted by all men as the idea of a being whohas a self-evident right to rule us all. But this right does not, as Pufendorfhad come close to claiming (in his eagerness to contradict Hobbes), derivefrom ideas about God’s being benevolent and competent, as if we obeyedhim because of expected benefits, or out of gratitude. Rather, Barbeyracargues:This reason [that God’s benevolence makes it impossible to question hisright to rule us], as well as the following, serves rather to make the oblig-ation stronger and more reasonable, than to establish its true and imme-diate foundation. To deal with this issue more precisely, one must, as itseems to me, go about it in the following manner. There is properly onlyone general foundation of obligation, to which all the other can bereduced, and this is the state of natural dependence in which one is withrespect to GOD’s power: because he has given us being, and he can, there-fore, demand that we use the faculties he has given us towards the endsthat he evidently intended them for.13Unlike Burlamaqui, Barbeyrac does not abandon Pufendorf’s duty ethics.On Barbeyrac’s interpretation, God’s right to rule is not justified by factsconcerning the utility of the natural laws. Pufendorf does argue that thenatural laws are demonstrably useful for the continued existence of human-ity. The fact that these laws are useful cannot explain the sense in whichthey are morally obligatory, however.14Morality is not about utility, butabout things that we must or must not do. Morality is about absolute dutiesand for Pufendorf, as for Barbeyrac, the absolute nature of moral commandscan only be made sense of when the natural laws are thought of as divinecommandments.15If God’s right to rule were justified in terms of its utilityfor purely human ends, the absolute character of moral obligation could nolonger be accounted for. This is one main reason why Pufendorf would havedone well not to discuss God’s right to rule in terms of benevolence andutility. The second reason, however, which forms the subject-matter for thesecond half of this chapter, is that such terms invite us to regard the civilsovereign’s power as alike in aims, scope and origin to the power wieldedby God.112Petter Korkman"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"III. Does God’s right to rule require a justification?Pufendorf, of course, had not meant to say that God’s benevolence, or thegratitude that we feel for benefits he has bestowed on us, constitute themoral grounds for our obligation to obey him. And if we look more closelyat how Pufendorf worded his statement, his claim was actually not aboutwhy we ought to obey God, but about the things that make it impossiblefor us to questionGod’s right to rule. What Pufendorf was trying to do wasnot to prove that God has a right to rule. He had already granted as much.In fact, any rational being’s idea of God is necessarily, Pufendorf holds, theidea of a being entitled to rule him.16Pufendorf’s discussion of God’s right to rule must be seen in the contextof his critique of Hobbes.17The obligation to obey, Pufendorf emphasises,must not be thought of in terms of external compulsion or in terms of bruteforce. Brute force merely gives a ruler the means to ensure that he is obeyed.The idea that we have an obligation to obey God is based on a feeling thathemeritsour obedience, and that disobedience meritspunishment.18Suchideas cannot arise out of observations about the irresistible force that a sovereign has at his disposal. These ideas are instead part of every rationalbeing’s idea of God, whom we view as a perfect being, as our creator, asbenevolent, etc. If one were to form an idea about a supreme being whowouldnotmerit our obedience, this would not be an idea of God at all, butof some ‘inane idol’.19Pufendorf’s point as against Hobbes, then, is that theconcept of God is not only the concept of the Almighty Being. The idea ofGod is the idea of a being who is entitled to our obedience, just as he is enti-tled to our gratitude. He is not merely thought of as powerful, but also as agood and rightful ruler meriting our obedience.20Note also that the duty toobey is not here properly speaking derived from or justified by some factabout the divine nature, as if the ideas of God’s benevolence would logicallyprecede and entail the idea that he deserves obedience. Both benevolenceand a right to rule are inseparably part of our concept of God.Barbeyrac expresses agreement with Pufendorf’s view, arguing that ‘assoon as one has a correct idea of God, one cannot but recognise the righthe has to impose such restrictions as he likes to the faculties that he hasgiven us’.21While all human rulers must, in order to justify their rule, beable to point to some just reasons which are based on natural law, theauthority of the ‘King of Kings. . . is based on reasons which carry theirjustice with them, and which do not need to borrow their force from else-where’.22Unlike human sovereigns, God has a right to rule that requires noseparate justification or derivation. Barbeyrac is right to insist on this point.It is important because it salvages the idea of moral demands as absoluteand unconditional, as commands that bind with a sui generis force.23It isalso important because it makes a sharp distinction between the absolute-ness of moral requirements thus understood, and the much more condi-Barbeyrac on the Creator’s Right to Rule113"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"tional obligations imposed by human rulers and civil laws. Before turningto the political side of the problematic, let us look a bit more closely at the model Barbeyrac proposes to replace Pufendorf’s somewhat confusingaccount.IV. The creator’s right modelBarbeyrac’s discussion of God as our creator has in general been interpretedas an effort to emend Pufendorf’s theory and to reply to Leibniz by provid-ing the justification or the derivation of God’s right to rule that Pufendorffailed to accomplish.24If this were Barbeyrac’s intention, then his use of the creator’s right model would indeed be open to the critique that it is confused or tautological, as most modern scholars have argued. The sameaccusations have, of course, been directed against Locke’s use of this model.Let us look at how Barbeyrac phrases his account.A worker, as such, is master of his product, and can dispose of it as helikes, although he has but given it its form. If a sculptor could by his owndoing make living statues, and if he were the true author of the intelli-gence he would provide them with, this alone would give him a rightand a just reason to demand that the marble or gold that he has formedwith his hands and provided with awareness submit to his will....ButGod is the author both of the matter and of the form of the parts thatwe are made of; he has created our bodies and our souls, and he hasendowed them with all the faculties that they are adorned with. He cantherefore prescribe such limits as he likes to these faculties, and demandthat men only use them in such and such a manner.25Is this an attempt at reconciling Pufendorfian natural law with Leibniz’scritique, and thus at providing a derivation or a justification for God’s right to rule? If it were, Barbeyrac would have to claim that although thenatural laws define almost all of morality, and although they have a moraland obligatory character only because they are understood as divine com-mands, there is (at least) one moral principle which precedes all imposition.This is the principle that makers have some rights over the things that theyhave made. Since this moral principle would precede God’s rightful rule, itcould be used to justify God’s right to rule over men. Men could justify obe-dience to morality as a whole and to God as the authority to whom we owethat obedience, by noting that yes, this being has made us and he thereforehas a right over us. There are clear reasons why this cannot be what Barbeyrac means.First and most importantly, Barbeyrac quite clearly claims that only God’scommands are morally obligatory in themselves, while all other principles114Petter Korkman"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"must borrow their force from the fact that God commands them. The sameis true of Locke, as well. In the Essays on the Law of Nature, the early dis-sertations on natural law where he put forth his most clear and forceful for-mulations of the creator’s right model, Locke unambiguously asserts thatonly the divine commands bind by ‘intrinsic force, and of themselves’.26Even the maker’s right to the produce of his work must therefore derive itsobligatory and moral force from divine imposition: it can become a moralprinciple imposing obligations only once God’s right to rule is already pre-supposed. But in fact the whole idea of separating a prior justification forGod’s right to rule is quite misleading, here. Neither Pufendorf, Barbeyracnor Locke assumes that men are first without morality and without God,and that they need to provide a justification for God’s right to rule in orderto become subject to his laws. Men are always already moral creatures, andevery moral distinction they make presupposes that they are subject tomoral laws.One main reason why modern interpretation regularly makes some of theseventeenth and eighteenth centuries’ finest moral and political philoso-phers look stupid is that their arguments are assumed to address questionsthat these thinkers did not in fact address. Barbeyrac’s and Locke’s discus-sions of God’s right to rule should be understood as recommendations aboutthe terms in which we should think of obligation, and of its foundation in our relation to God. While obligation must be clearly separated from coercion (something the Hobbesian model failed to do), it must also not beconfused with expected benefits (a confusion that Pufendorf’s discussion of benevolence and competence might invite, and in fact did invite). Obligation must be thought of as absolute, in much the same way as man’sdependence on his creator is absolute. God, furthermore, must be thoughtto merit our obedience, much in the same way as we ordinarily feel that aworkman has a right to dispose over the produce of his work.While the above advantages of the creator’s right model were importantto Barbeyrac and Locke, who both argued against deriving the obligation ofthe natural laws from mere coercion or utility, this model also differs fromalternative accounts in other, equally central respects. The creator’s rightmodel pointed to a radical and essential difference in how we should relateto God and morality on the one hand, and to the commands of humansuperiors on the other. No human sovereign has made his subjects in thesense in which Barbeyrac’s sculptor made his living statues. But even if ahuman ruler had done so, his authority would not be on a par with God’s,who has given us ‘both of the matter and of the form of the parts that weare made of’. No human superior can pretend to wield the same kind ofauthority over his subjects that God has. To understand the importance ofthis fact, we must again compare the creator’s right model with other avail-able accounts.Barbeyrac on the Creator’s Right to Rule115"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"V. The moral tasks of the stateOn the kind of Leibnizian reading that Burlamaqui gave of Pufendorf, a spe-cific picture of the human ruler’s authority emerged. Generally, Leibniz andhis eighteenth-century admirers tended to view the human ruler as having,in many crucial respects, the same kindof authority over his subjects as Godhas as ‘the most perfect of Monarchs’.27The difference between God andhuman rulers is, Leibniz affirmed, one of degree rather than one of kind.The human ruler, just like God, wields his authority with a view to helpingrational beings achieve moral perfection.Leibniz and most of his followers argue that the state carries an essentialpedagogical role; that its primary task is not merely to constrain the indi-viduals from harming each other, but to contribute to the moral perfectionof its citizens.28Such a view of the state’s tasks is defended, among others,by Burlamaqui and by Christian Wolff. Thus Burlamaqui argued that thecivil laws are not made only with a view to upholding external stability in the state, but ‘to obligate the subjects to act in accordance with their veritable interests’. The human sovereign’s authority is based on his abilityto lead men to the same human goal that the natural laws aim at, namelymoral perfection and happiness. ‘It is to this end,’ Burlamaqui concludes,‘that the sovereign strives to direct his subjects better than they could themselves.’29Wolff, in a similar vein, argues that the civil authorities canlegitimately use penal law to help citizens become better men. Ultimately,this implied a right to enforce belief in the correct moral and religious doctrines.30VI. The King of Kings and civil sovereignsThe Leibnizian argument, and this is one of its most important qualities,requires that all authority, whether human or divine, is justified on the samegeneral principles.31The Creator’s right model, on the contrary, starts fromthe assumption that God’s right to rule is a self-evident part of our conceptof the Creator. Unlike the Leibnizians, Barbeyrac and Locke do not presentthis view as a general principle for establishing just grounds for moralauthority. They defend a specific understanding of the way in which moralobligation comes into our lives (that is, in the form of absolute command-ments) and of the radical difference that there is between God and humanrulers. God’s authority requires no justification but forms a self-evident part of how we perceive our creator. The authority of human sovereigns,however, is always a delegated authority, and one that the human superiorwields in order to perform certain tasks delegated to him by the natural lawsand by the social contract. The civil laws, Barbeyrac insists, have a muchmore limited task than the natural laws. This difference corresponds to the116Petter Korkman"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"different ways in which God and human rulers are recognised as legitimaterulers.While Leibnizians like Burlamaqui and Wolff argued that the politicalcommunity exists in order to make the citizens into better men, Barbeyracand Locke insisted that men’s quest for moral and religious perfection is pre-cisely one of the things that the political community must not interferewith. One important background to this conviction is the era of religiousstrife and quarrel that marked natural law theorists from Grotius and Hobbesto Barbeyrac and Locke. While the seventeenth-century generations ofnatural law theorists (I count Pufendorf as the most important author ofthat generation) had wanted to safeguard against religiously inspired civilwars by arguing that the church should have no independent authoritywithin the state, Barbeyrac and Locke (both of whom were active mostly atthe end of the seventeenth and at the beginning of the eighteenth century)realised that this is not enough. The state can manifestly also exert danger-ous religious violence, as the forced conversions in France clearly showed.In order to put an end to the religious violence ravaging the Europe of theirday, and in order to protect the rights of religious minorities within thestructure of the modern state, the individual’s moral and religious questmust be left to every individual. The political community cannot, therefore,legitimately impose laws with the sole end of helping them achieve moralperfection.It was even necessary, in order to prevent abuse of the Legislative Power,that the authority of the Legislators be not allowed to extend to forbid-ding on some penalty all that they might judge contrary to some virtue.Since they are not always sufficiently enlightened, they might easily usethis pretext to forbid very innocent things. Of this we have but too manyexamples.32The most important of the examples discussed by Barbeyrac are the forcedconversions that, he notes, abound ‘even today’ in Europe. Sovereigns,claiming to serve God, undertake moral crusades against religious minori-ties, whom they punish for merely doing their duty: that is, for serving Godpeacefully as their consciences dictate.Barbeyrac also uses the idea of the social contract and of the origin andend of political communities to buttress his claims. Men, he notes, did notinvent the state so that they could impose their own religious and moralconvictions on each other.33What they needed was rather the opposite. Theyneeded protection against the depraved passions of other men, and againstexternal enemies. They needed protection so that they could be safe, prosperand pursue their personal quests without external interference. This is whythe state was created: to protect the individuals from each other and to safe-guard as large a portion of their natural liberty as possible.34Rational agents,Barbeyrac on the Creator’s Right to Rule117"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"therefore, did not enter the contract with a view to empowering the humansovereign to direct them in their individual spiritual quests. Nor could theyrationally have done so. The means that the state has at its disposal aresimply not adequate to such a task. While the state can indeed force mento conform their external behaviour to the rules it lays down, it cannot byusing laws and sanctions efficiently influence their convictions and motives.Men’s convictions, just like the motives that drive them to actions, arevisible only to themselves and to God. Men can also not be forced to changeopinion. Virtue and religion are outside the state’s practical reach: empow-ering the human ruler to legislate over these aspects of human life cannottherefore have formed any part of the intentions either of God or of ratio-nal contracting parties.35The idea of what rational contracting parties could have consented to isin some respects a problematic construction. If the political community isto rest in any veritable sense on the consent of the contracting parties, thejustification of existing political institutions cannot depend on what an idealrational agent would agree to, but on what actual existing subjects consentto. Why would it not be possible for men to empower the state to makethem virtuous and pious? According to Locke and Barbeyrac, there are bothlogical and moral reasons why this is impossible. It is not logically possiblefor men to agree to believe what they are told – they cannot even them-selves decide what to believe. More importantly: whatever men contract to,they remain morally responsible for all the actions that they undertake. Menhave no right to give away their responsibility for their moral actions. InLockean and Barbeyracian language, this can be expressed by noting thatmen’s ‘submission to civil Government does not extend, and never couldextend even should they wish that it did, to putting a Human Legislatorabove GOD, the author of Nature, the Creator and Sovereign Legislator ofMen’.36I can never commit myself to accept all and whatever laws and com-mands that a human sovereign chooses to impose on me. This is especiallyclear when we are discussing matters that relate to my innermost moral convictions. On this point, Barbeyrac and Locke differ sensibly from seventeenth-century natural law theorists like Pufendorf. Unless an explicitconstitutional law clearly states the opposite, Pufendorf holds, I have anabsolute duty to obey the sovereign in all things, even when his commandsare clearly against natural law and morality. The idea that the citizen, likethe slave, has alienated all of his natural rights to the sovereign contains noparadox. Barbeyrac wages a footnote war against this contention, arguing(with Locke) against the slave-contract model for understanding the civilsovereign’s authority. Since men do not in an absolute sense own them-selves, they are not free to sell themselves, any more than they are free toalienate the personal responsibility that they have, in front of God, for theirreligious convictions.37The correct attitude towards human rulers, then,differs sensibly from our attitude towards God and morality. With respect118Petter Korkman"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"to the former, men must ‘remain vigilant, & always consult, as much as theycan, the ideas of Justice & Equity, of which everyone bears the seeds’.For as soon as the most authentic of laws of the most Legitimate Sover-eigns find themselves in opposition, in any way whatsoever, with theimmutable Laws that are written in our heart; there is no room for doubt,but one must even, whatever the cost, disobey the former, so as not todo the slightest damage to the latter.38VII. Morality and politicsFor Barbeyrac, the natural laws imposed by God do not only provide, as theearlier generation of natural law theorists had insisted, a justification for the human sovereign’s right to rule. They also impose crucial limits to hisauthority. The civil sovereign specifically does not have any authority overthe citizen’s religious and ethical convictions. Thus, even when the humanruler forbids an action that is clearly immoral or a belief that is judged hereti-cal, he does not and cannot forbid it as heretical. When the human legis-lator forbids an action or a belief, he does so on the grounds that this beliefis dangerous to public safety, to the tranquillity of the political community.39Furthermore, although the sovereign as such has a right to forbid by law allactions that he deems to be contrary in some way to public safety, this doesnot entirely free the citizen from the responsibility that he has in front ofthe ‘tribunal of reason and conscience’.40The civil laws and the ‘laws ofvirtue’ therefore constitute two separate jurisdictions, as Barbeyrac puts it.41While it would be impractical and even counterproductive (with respect totheir legitimate aim) for the civil laws to forbid all actions that the legisla-tor perceives as immoral, this does not mean that men would be free toundertake all actions that the civil laws permit. Nor is it ever justified toobey commands or laws that conflict in dramatic and obvious ways withthe demands of conscience.The discussion of God’s right to rule was an important element in earlymodern debates on the nature of moral obligation. It was also, as we havenow seen, central to Barbeyrac’s distinction between morality and civil law.Whereas the demands of morality concern man as a whole, the civil lawscan have only one legitimate goal: to protect the citizens against harm fromeach other. Barbeyrac’s account clearly delineates moral and religious con-victions as forming a private sphere. While men can and should relinquishthe right to implement the laws of sociability to the sovereign, this can neverprovide the human ruler with a justification for intervening in that privatesphere. In this, the authority of the human sovereign and of the civil lawsclearly differs from the authority of God and morality. It differs both inorigin, in extent, and in purpose from the authority wielded by God, fromthe authority that morality has. It is the power of a vice-regent, and as suchBarbeyrac on the Creator’s Right to Rule119"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"it is always subject to the limits that the ‘king of kings’ has set to it.42Giventhe intellectual context in which Barbeyrac and Locke presented theirCreator’s right model, then, that argument proves to be quite reasonable,and arguably more than merely reasonable. It is a concise and plain way ofdenying that the civil sovereign should, or even that he could, take onhimself the kind of moral authority that is peculiar to the relation betweenCreator and creature.Notes1. Locke had already defended the Creator’s right model in his early Essays on theLaw of Nature.

One main reason why Barbeyrac published Leibniz’s critique was because he felt that this would provide him with an opportunity for justifying Pufendorf’sprinciples and for showing that the German natural law theorist did not in factembrace voluntarism, that his divine command understanding did not imply voluntarism, and that Pufendorf, unlike the confused and confusing Leibniz, hadprovided a coherent moral theory capable of doing justice to our strongest intu-itions about the nature of moral demands.

This model assumes that allpower in the state is monopolised, and it abolishes the diversity of mutual-ist power relations characteristic of the Middle Ages.2It also destroys thebasis of the legal status which the subject had in the mediaeval network ofpower and which culminated in a right of resistance. A power monopoly issystematically incompatible with a right of resistance; that is, with a rightto call the power monopoly into question. As Wolfgang Kersting notes inhis analysis of Kant’s theory of resistance, ‘a right of resistance codified inpositive law would amount to the self-dissolution of the state’.3Bodin’s model constitutes an important stage in a historical developmentin which the state became more rational and more modern. The increasingcomplexity of society made it necessary to ensure ‘law and order’; that is,social and political integration, by means of an efficient judicial system. Institutions and structures which were contrary to the function and efficiencyof the state, therefore, had to be transformed or eliminated. Bodin had formulated an important insight which subsequent political theories couldnot ignore. If the state and the safeguards it provides are to be effective, itmust have sovereignty and, as Michael Seidler comments, sovereignty can bedefined only ‘in terms of non-resistance’.4At the same time, most authorswere unwilling to deny the subject all rights, an idea that Thomas Hobbeslater discussed extensively. There have been many remarkable attempts at reconciling these conflicting goals, namely to maintain the sovereignty of thestate without callously exposing the subjects to tyranny. But for a long time,a satisfactory theoretical solution could not be found – until efficient formsof self-restraint of the state, based on a separation of powers, became theoretically conceivable. It was only then that the transformation of a rightof resistance into a resistance by legal means could be completed.123"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"The stages on the long road towards this goal included not only noteworthy contributions which paved the way for solutions within theconstitutional state, but also models that were inapplicable in practice. Nevertheless, they deserve to be remembered because they show how difficult the problem was and how urgently solutions were sought. It is, ofcourse, impossible to provide an exhaustive account here. In the followingsketch, I will discuss only a few characteristic positions which were impor-tant either for the German Enlightenment or within it.I. Limited right of resistance and modern theory ofsovereignty: Hugo GrotiusThe theory of resistance which Hugo Grotius developed in some detail inhisDe jure belli ac paciscombines traditional ideas with modern concepts.It was precisely this mixture of old and new notions, which is quite typicalof Grotius, that inspired the next generation of scholars in their theories ofnatural law. His position is, however, somewhat surprising (not only at firstglance). On the one hand, he is resolutely opposed to a right of resistance;on the other hand, he construes cases in which he regards resistance as jus-tified, without basing them on a rightof resistance. This contradictory par-allelisation of the general prohibition of resistance and the legitimisation of resistance in individual cases cannot be resolved in a theoretically satis-fying manner. None the less, a look at Grotius’ theory of sovereignty mayhelp to clarify the situation.Grotius prohibits resistance on principle because pragmatic considerationsled him to the conclusion that the state which was created ‘to safeguard lawand order (tranquillitas)’5would be unable to realise its genuine purpose ifone could invoke an ‘indiscriminate right of resistance (ius resistendi promis-cuum)’6against it and its actions. While an individual who does not yet formpart of a society originally has a right of resistance – which is viewed as aright to self-help – the state abolishes it by means of a higher law. This hastwo consequences. In the first place, while natural law allows a person todefend himself against injustice with the means available to him, higher lawconfines this right to a legal procedure. The right of resistance and the vio-lence connected with it are replaced by legal means, which in turn must bebased on valid legal titles.7Second, the abolition of a natural right of resis-tance implies that there can be no right of resistance against the actions ofthe state. Instead, the citizen has a far-reaching duty to obey, in principle,even if the state does him an injustice. Thus, the prohibition of the iusresistendias a form of self-help allowed by natural law carries with it a prohibition of resistance as refusal to obey.For Grotius, both prohibitions necessarily follow from his definition ofthe function of the state: ‘For if this indiscriminate right of resistance weremaintained, there would not be any legal community but only an orderless124Frank Grunert"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"mass as with the Cyclops.’8In his thinking, ‘public tranquillity, whichincludes the tranquillity of the individual’, ranks among the highest valuesand is actually indispensable. It is made possible by the state and should notbe endangered by acts of resistance – not even if the resister feels that he isin the right because the state treated him unjustly. Thus, Grotius rejects re-sistance not on normative grounds, but rather out of prudence: resistanceundermines the public order to such a degree that the damage to societyand to individuals exceeds any putative benefits by far. Therefore, resistancemust be viewed like any other violation of the law: ‘The citizen who vio-lates the civil law because of some momentary benefit severs the bond whichprovides permanent benefit for himself and his offspring.’9Grotius stresses that the denial of a right of resistance applies not only toan individual without any office but also to the lower authorities. Here, heexplicitly distances himself from monarchomachic approaches which claimthat the lower authorities have both a right and a duty ‘to resist injusticecommitted by the supreme power in the state’. According to his strictconcept of sovereignty, the lower authorities are just like private individu-als as regards their relationship to the summa potestasfrom which they derivetheir powers.10These do not suffice to invalidate the actions of the sovereign, be they justified or not.Although Grotius rejects a right of resistance on principle, he agrees withthe prevailing view that passive resistance is justified if the authoritiesshould command something ‘which contradicts natural law or divine commandments’.11In other words, the order given by the human summapotestasis neutralised by a higher law. In the case of ‘gravest and mostobvious danger’, even active resistance – that is, immediate self-defence – ispermitted if one carries it out ‘with consideration for the public welfare’.12For Grotius, these exceptions, which are primarily based on natural law,do not constitute a right of resistance as such. As he mentions explicitly,this is also true of his list of seven cases in which resistance is to be allowed.He therefore prefaces this list with the following remark: ‘We have said that it is correct not to resist those invested with the supreme power in thestate. Now we must remind the reader of a few points so that he should not regard those as violators of this rule who in truth are not.’13Accordingto Grotius, someone who offers resistance in the following cases availshimself of natural or positive rights without having to invoke a right of resistance:1. Resistance as punishment of an authority which does injustice or breaksthe law is permitted (and thus does not violate the general prohibitionof resistance) if the authority is subject to the legitimate power of thepeople. In this case, the authority has received only limited sovereigntyrights, while the people remain the genuine sovereign and retain the rightto punish.14Sovereignty and Resistance125"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"2. If the one who holds the summa potestashas given up his sovereigntyrights, he becomes a private individual and no longer needs to be obeyed.Strictly speaking, the issue of whether resistance is permitted or not isirrelevant here.3. Grotius’ third case is based on the distinction between an imperiumanditsmodus habendi: the people may offer resistance to a ruler who wantsto transfer his powers although he acquired only the ius imperandi(rightof rule) and not sovereignty as a possession. By attempting to transferpowers which he received only iure usufructario(for temporary use) theruler usurps somebody else’s rights and the transaction is null and void.Because he encroaches upon the legal status of the people, which rankshigher than his, resistance is justified and does not violate the prohibi-tion of a right of resistance.4. The people may also offer resistance against a ruler who makes himself apublic enemy (hostis populi), ‘since the will to rule and the will to destroycannot coexist. Someone who declares himself an enemy of the entirepeople thereby renounces his authority’.15In this case, resistance isdirected not against a legitimate sovereign but against a private individ-ual who abuses his powers in order to wage an illegitimate war againsthis own subjects.The remaining three cases (5–7) are very similar and can therefore be summarised quite briefly. In all of them, resistance does not contravene theprohibition of a right of resistance because the ruler violated the contrac-tual limits of his sovereignty. Here, resistance is directed against specific actswhich are not covered be the sovereign’s legal title or against a person whohas already lost his legal status as sovereign. Thus, the ruler loses his powerswhen he ignores the conditions that were set when he received them (5).16Where there is a separation of powers, one may resist a ruler who encroachesupon ‘that part of sovereignty which lies outside his competence’ (6).17Finally, Grotius considers the possibility of a positive right of resistance: thetranslatio imperiimay be subject to conditions that allow a right of resistanceto be exercised in a legitimate way (7).18Although he rejects a right of resistance in general, Grotius is obviouslywilling to allow a fairly wide spectrum of legitimate resistance. In essence,the exceptions he makes come close to what a fully developed theory of resistance permits. One can therefore agree with Wolzendorff who writesabout Grotius: ‘If I may say so, it is only in terms of the wording of his teach-ings but not in terms of their content that one can count him among thosewho deny the right of resistance.’19The extent of resistance which Grotiusconditionally permits suggests that his prohibition of a right of resistancereaches only as far as it actually reaches: resistance is prohibited except where it is allowed. This seems to have been Grotius’ point: where permis-sion is given, resistance is no longer prohibited but becomes a legitimate126Frank Grunert"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"intervention. In his approach, contrary to the traditional view, ‘permittedresistance’ is, strictly speaking, a contradictio in adiecto; in other words, per-mitted resistance ceases to be resistance. The legitimacy of the interventionthat takes its place follows from the theory of sovereignty, because the sevencases mentioned above can ultimately be reduced to only two elements ofthis theory: First, the intervention is legitimate if the ruler for some reasonor other no longer legitimately holds the legal titles of sovereignty. In thiscase, resistance is not directed against a sovereign and therefore cannotviolate any sovereignty rights.20Second, if sovereignty is subject to contrac-tual limitations, resistance is a legitimate intervention justified by positivelaw.21In such cases, it is again not directed against a sovereign ruler in thetrue sense, so that it is – as Christoph Link notes – in reality a kind of liti-gation between different institutions.22This shows that Grotius restricts resistanceto those instances where the ruler is a legitimate and full sovereign.In view of the history of the term, this usage is somewhat problematic.Thus, it appears that the contradiction between the general prohibitionof resistance and a right of resistance in individual cases is resolved byredefining the notion.23Actually, the theoretical basis of Grotius’ approachlies in specific characteristics of his theory of sovereignty. On the one hand,he develops a concept of sovereignty which follows Jean Bodin in stressingthe autonomy of the sovereign as the defining characteristic of the summapotestas; in this respect, he anticipates the power monopoly of the modernstate. On the other hand, this autonomy is legally effective to the fullestdegree only if is not restricted by contractual agreements. Whereas the laterabsolutists Hobbes and Pufendorf hold that sovereignty is established by acontract and at the same time excluded from further contractual arrange-ments, Grotius assumes that sovereignty is always subject to the provisionsof the contract, down to the details of how its content is defined.24II. Prohibition of resistance and search for alternatives: Samuel Pufendorf and Christian ThomasiusIn his rather unusual theory of the state, Thomas Hobbes denies contrac-tual obligations between the individual citizen and the sovereign on prin-ciple and tries to show that the citizen can never suffer injustice at the handsof the ruler.25Despite his sympathies for a restrictive theory of resistance,Samuel Pufendorf disagrees. In his De jure naturae et gentium, he lists numer-ous instances of injustice which can be committed by the authorities againstthe individual, both in his role as subject and in his role as a human being.26But although he observes that the actions of the ruler may be illegitimate,Pufendorf does not unreservedly justify resistance as a reaction to injustice.Rather, he suggests that one should pardon less serious offences because manis by nature imperfect, while the state is of eminent social importance. Inthe case of grave violations of the law, one should save himself by takingSovereignty and Resistance127"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"flight.27In his discussion of the right of resistance against a usurper,Pufendorf also takes a position that emphasises the preservation of thestate.28Although the usurper originally has no legal titles of his own, he ina sense acquires rights through the rational insight ‘that it is better for thecommonwealth if someone looks after it than if it is suspended in perma-nent unrest and confusion, without a certain master; therefore one canaccept the authority of anyone who is in possession of power if only he con-ducts the government in a way that is proper for a lawful ruler’.29Moreover,prudence dictates that even in such a situation one should not endangerone’s life and property by ‘futile recalcitrance’.30Following Grotius,Pufendorf restricts the right of resistance to cases of individual and collec-tive self-defence.31If the ruler reveals himself as an enemy of his subjects,resistance is merely the exercise of the right to self-defence and thereforeundoubtedly permitted. In this case, Pufendorf holds – quite like Grotius –that resistance does not infringe upon existent sovereignty rights becausethrough his enmity, the ruler absolves the subjects of their duty to obeyhim. Accordingly, their actions are not resistance in the traditional sense butrather a defence against aggression, which natural law permits once the situation has reverted to the natural state of affairs.Pufendorf’s theory of resistance can be understood as an absolutist variantof Grotius’ approach. Christian Thomasius, however, introduces some principally new points of view and attempts to combine the sovereignty ofthe ruler with certain rights of the subjects. This may appear somewhat sur-prising, as his ideas were originally strongly influenced by Pufendorf. Bothin his definition of the summa potestasand in his rejection of any right ofresistance, Thomasius relied on Pufendorf’s De officio hominis et civis, fromwhich he took not only the ideas but even the wording.32But despite thisfar-reaching dependence, he does not follow his model in every respect. Heagrees with Pufendorf that the citizen owes the government reverentia, fideli-tasandobsequium, but he apparently feels that Pufendorf goes too far whenhe demands that the citizen should think and say only good and honourablethings about the leaders of the state and all the measures they take.33Thefact that it is precisely this passage which Thomasius does not cite showsquite clearly where he draws the line. Indeed, this noteworthy detail is notaccidental. It fits in perfectly with his reflections about how the subject can be protected (if only rudimentarily) against unjustified claims of theauthorities.Although he resolutely denied a right of resistance, Thomasius wasundoubtedly aware of the dangers that originate from the supreme powerin an absolute monarchy. He therefore tried to provide a variety of theoreti-cal justifications for restricting the supreme power and its competence, butwithout granting the subject full rights vis-à-vis the prince and without anyseparation of powers. Some of his ideas belong to the traditional repertoireof normative safeguards: the prince should be bound by the provisions of128Frank Grunert"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"natural law, the supreme power should be limited by the ultimate purposeof the state34andleges fundamentalesshould be introduced. Two themes,however, which differ widely in their starting points but are neverthelessconnected, deserve to be considered more closely: first, Thomasius attemptsto confine the power of the prince by giving a theoretical proof of its naturallimits; and, second, he advocates a public discourse about the ‘diseases’ oftheres publicawhich is to prompt and accompany a reform of the state.With regard to the first theme, it is generally known that Thomasiusrestricts the regulatory intervention by the supreme power to external actsthat are capable of disturbing the outer and inner peace of the common-wealth.35He justifies this limitation not only normatively in terms of naturallaw and in terms of the ultimate purpose of the state, but primarily (andperhaps more effectively) by his assertion that all political claims whichconcern man’s inner sphere cannot be realised in practice and are thereforeexcluded from the prince’s discretionary powers on principle. Thomasiuswrites: ‘Since no man knows the heart so that he should be able to guessanother’s secret perfidy and since such rebellious thoughts do not disturbthe public welfare, a prince must be content if his subjects merely concealtheir evil thoughts and subjugate them so that they do not lead to evil quarrels and do not induce others to do likewise.’36Although the efficiencyof this limitation is questionable, it represents a considerable historicalachievement since it means that the prince no longer has any power overmatters of belief and thought. As Thomasius states, it is not possible ‘thathuman force should effect an inner recognition of divine truth in us’.37Itfollows that ‘when civil societies were instituted, no nation subjected its willin religious matters to the government, nor could it reasonably have doneso’.38The same applies to the realm of thought: ‘The human mind has beenso highly privileged by God that it is not subject to any human authority.For when someone is to recognize the truth, the only way he can reach itis by being shown causes and reasons which he must agree to.’39Thisfreedom of thought implies a certain degree of freedom of speech. First,Thomasius infers that the publication of scholarly writings – ‘matters pertaining to reason’40– is subject only to ‘the general censorship by rea-sonable men’.41Second, freedom of thought means that nobody may beforced to say something that he does not think.42Freedom of thought andspeech are prerequisites for the public discourse about the ‘sick republic’with its regulatory function in the political sphere.The theme of the sick state developed gradually. In Discours welcher gestaltman denen Frantzosen im gemeinen Leben und Wandel nachahmen solle?(1687),Thomasius still favoured the idea of the ‘learned prince’, which was influ-enced by Plato’s philosopher-king; but a year later, he introduced the notionof the ‘sick republic’,43which allows legitimate criticism of the politicalsystem with the aim of reform.44The reason for the illness of a republic canlie either in ‘human deficiencies’ (such as the incompetence or malevolenceSovereignty and Resistance129"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"of the ruler or the obstructiveness of the subjects) or in structural ‘deficien-cies of the state’ (for example, inadequate laws).45In any case, it is neithera ‘vice’46nor an ‘insult’ nor ‘impious speech’47if one points out such anillness, since ‘it is not disgraceful for somebody to fall ill, and he will notbe blamed for it, because the cause of the illness often lies in the weak con-stitution of the body or in an honourable and necessary way of life, etc.’.48On the other hand, someone who keeps existing illnesses secret clearly actsagainst his duties.49The ‘illness’ metaphor allows Thomasius to justify suchcriticism without arousing suspicions that he might be an impious enemyof the state.50To some extent anticipating Kant’s demand,51Thomasius sug-gests that the illness should be diagnosed in public discussion.52In anattempt to disguise the explosive force of a critical discourse, he maintainsthat such a discussion would concern only points that are obvious to allanyway.53But the fact that Thomasius is so careful and invests so muchrhetoric shows clearly that – in his own view – he is treading on dangerousground. We can assume that he knew very well that a public discussionabout the illness of the republic would be much more than a mere repeti-tion of common knowledge.Of course, not every ‘private person’ is entitled to diagnose the illness.Thomasius regards unsolicited suggestions by ordinary citizens as a vice; butit is only a case of less severe temerity, not one of punishable injustice.54Therole of the doctor, who both diagnoses and heals, is split up: The teacher‘merely identifies the illness, but he leaves the cure’55to the ‘counsellor’, who has to make sure that the patient does not die of the therapy. ‘There-fore, a counsellor will sometimes have to leave an illness which is deeplyrooted in the republic, and to direct his advice only to the goal of prevent-ing the evil from spreading further.’56Thus, we see that under certain conditions, Thomasius demands no more than containment of the evil by means of gentle reform. His willingness to tolerate the ‘deeply rooted evil’,whose rigorous elimination would presumably destroy the republic, suggeststhat the ruler himself may well be this evil. Accordingly, the ‘counsellor’holds an eminent position in the network of political action, but Thomasiusdoes not elucidate the normative reasons that justify this role.In view of these provisions, the question of resistance and especially ofthe right of resistance loses much of its importance. On the one hand,Thomasius has made an effort to protect important freedoms against inter-ventions by the ruler; on the other hand, it is precisely because these freedoms have been secured that there is a procedure for initiating reformswhich, in Thomasius’ view, gives no cause for legal or political concern. Wewill leave aside the question of how successful his ideas actually were. Heobviously did not succeed in resolving the contradiction between hissupport for absolutism and his attempts to counter the negative conse-quences of absolutism. Presumably, the reasons for this failure do not lie inthe political naïveté that has sometimes (and without much justification)130Frank Grunert"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"been imputed to Thomasius,57but rather in the incongruous circumstancesof the historical situation. None the less, his proposals are undoubtedlystages in a historical development in which both absolutism and the ideaof resistance were eventually overcome by the constitutional state.III. Corporate rights and modern theory of sovereignty:Christian WolffThe contradiction between the sovereignty of the ruler and the rights of thesubjects, which could not resolved with the theoretical devices of traditionalnatural law, reappears in the work of Christian Wolff in all its sharpness, butagain we find some remarkable attempts at overcoming it.In order to safeguard the efficiency of fundamental laws (leges fundamen-tales), Wolff develops a rather complicated proposal in which normativeideas and considerations of prudence are combined. Since external meanscan hardly be used to force the authorities to observe the fundamental laws,there must be an internal reason for them to accept the binding force ofthese laws. Accordingly, Wolff suggests that the sovereign should swear anoath:By an oath, one calls God to witness that one is willing to keep one’spromise and that He should take revenge if one does not keep it. Someonewho believes in the existence of a God who knows and sees everythingand will punish him if he either intends not to keep his promise or if helater knowingly and willingly acts contrary to it will therefore be deterredby the oath from breaking his promise. Thus, the oath is a means bywhich sovereigns can be obliged to keep the fundamental laws.58This presupposes that the sovereign recognises God and always has Himbefore his eyes, which can be achieved only by thorough religious instruc-tion. None the less, even if the sovereign should not fear God’s tribunal inthe other world, the oath retains its force because of highly pragmatic con-siderations of prudence. By breaking the oath in an obvious way, the sovereign would arouse suspicions among foreign rulers, who would neitherenter into new alliances with this untrustworthy partner nor rely on exist-ing agreements. In the end, all security would be lost and the sovereignwould cause himself more and more damage. Apart from that, a ruler whodoes not keep his word must, of course, always fear the indignation of hissubjects, who easily tend towards ‘unrest and insurrection’, so that Wolffconcludes: ‘Someone who recognizes these dangerous consequences will bedeterred by them even he should have no fear of God.’59If, however, all these ‘internal conceptions’ should be of no avail, one hasto act from outside, using ‘external force’. This somewhat abrupt introduc-tion of coercive measures is remarkable in two respects. First, it indicatesSovereignty and Resistance131"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"how much importance Wolff attaches to the idea that the ruler shouldcommit himself to the fundamental laws. Second, the use of force is precarious inasmuch as Wolff – contrary to his own announcement – neithernames nor explains the procedures by which legitimate force can be applied. This is all the more surprising because Wolff strongly advocates(self-)restraint of the sovereign’s powers along the lines of a corporate state.60In principle, the ‘supreme power’ is inviolable, but wherever the rulerencroaches upon ‘the right which is reserved for the people or the most distinguished’, one may resist and keep him under control.61In fact, sovereignty as ‘totally unlimited power’ of an individual does notplay a major role in Wolff’s approach, especially since he is careful to avoida decision between absolutism and corporatist constraints. The differentforms of government must prove themselves under the given circumstances,and only by standing the test do they acquire their value; it cannot be deter-mined in the abstract. Although Wolff believes that a corporate state can beappropriate and thus advocates a form of government which is backward incertain respects, his ideas on sovereignty have some progressive traits. Henotes that even if the powers of the ruler are constrained, ‘power and author-ity are unlimited in view of the entire commonwealth’.62Here, he formu-lates a concept of sovereignty which regards sovereignty as a compound of different rights and competences which operates both externally andinternally.IV. Prohibition of resistance and sovereignty of the people:Immanuel KantIn view of the theoretical considerations of his predecessors, the theory ofresistance developed by Immanuel Kant appears to be strikingly traditional,despite its consistent rigour. In essence, his strict prohibition of resistanceis clearly based on a logical argument that had dominated the debate for along time. According to Kant, a right of resistance is an inconsistent insti-tution; in the final analysis, it means that the public law contains its ownnegation: by allowing resistance, the ‘highest law-giver’ would decide thatit is not the highest.63A right of resistance would rank higher than thesupreme power and thus refute the latter’s existence. On the level of legalpractice, this internal contradiction leads to aporetic consequences whichdemonstrate that a right of resistance is untenable: who, asks Kant, shouldbe the judge in a dispute between ‘people and sovereign’?64And he imme-diately provides the answer himself: ‘It can be neither of them, since hewould judge his own case. We would therefore need a sovereign above thesovereign who could decide between the latter and the people, and that isa contradiction in itself.’65Legalised resistance amounts to a permission toabolish the legal order. The law would thus reintroduce a pre-legal situation,but its only and proper purpose was to transcend that situation. For Kant,132Frank Grunert"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"it is therefore perfectly clear that ‘resistance against the highest legislationmust always be conceived as something which contravenes the law and evendestroys the entire legal constitution’.66Despite this strict prohibition of resistance, Kant does not simply abandonthe subject to the whims of the sovereign. The subject has certain rights andeven ‘inalienable rights vis-à-vis the sovereign’,67but (as usual) such rightsdo not justify any coercion, so that the possibility of exercising them alwaysdepends on the sovereign’s benevolence. Kant insists that the subject whoserights were violated should enforce them within the existing legal order, forinstance by the process of judicial review (‘gravamina’) or by the public dis-course which the sovereign himself permits. In the end, the ‘freedom of thepen’ – only ‘within the bounds of respect and love for the constitution’ – isthe ‘only palladium of the people’s rights’, because it can inform a benevo-lent sovereign about an existing (possibly even legal) injustice.68Kant’s‘public use of reason’, 69is a continuation (under the changed political and philosophical conditions of the late eighteenth century) of Thomasius’earlier demand for the same thing. Although both authors stress with a certain amount of rhetoric that the public use of reason is politically harmless, it is obvious that the self-enlightenment of the people by meansof public discourse can push the process of political reform – which Kantregarded as necessary and possible – beyond the present political order.The element in Kant’s political thinking which is surprising and calls foran explanation is not the emphatic rejection of any right of resistance(which is legally and logically consistent and therefore quite plausible) butrather the legal situation of the subjects, which is legally unambiguous butpolitically extremely labile. After all, Kant differs from those predecessorswhose views have been presented here in that he deals not only with therealisation and the political status of acquired rights – which may possiblybe called into question again – but speaks about ‘inalienable rights’, whichany person necessarily has and which he cannot give up ‘even if he wantedto’.70The insecure legal position of the subjects is even more remarkablewhen one takes into account that Kant pleads both for a separation ofpowers and for sovereignty of the people. For it is generally assumed thatthese two institutions can transform a subject with precarious rights into acitizen who enjoys both political and legal participation.Kant emphasises again and again that the state, which unites a largenumber of people under certain laws,71contains three powers which areboth coordinate and subordinate with respect to each other: the legislature,the executive and the judicature.72As Kant states, the legislature belongs‘only to the united will of the people’73and can strip the ruler (as the execu-tive which is subject to the law) of his powers, depose him or reform hisadministration.74This model of a state which is based on sovereignty of thepeople and has a division of powers would make resistance (and certainly aright of resistance) completely superfluous since it is either impossible orSovereignty and Resistance133"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"unnecessary in all imaginable types of conflicts. In disputes between thesubject/citizen and the government, the judicature is a third party that isable to pass judgment; in addition, the legislature is a superordinate powerwhich possesses a higher right. Here, the option of legal procedures makesresistance unnecessary. In a conflict with the sovereign, the subject as citizenis, strictly speaking, confronted with himself so that he cannot suffer anyinjustice – ‘volenti non fit iniuria’.75Here, resistance is simply not possiblewithout an inner contradiction. In this fashion, one could abolish the rightof resistance and at the same time make the legal position of the subjectsstronger than ever before. The guarantees that the old right of resistanceprovided are now either devoid of any function or have been redistributedamong other institutions and procedures. In this way, not only the right ofresistance ceases to exist but also the subject, who has become a citizen and no longer needs the old legal and political guarantees which the rightof resistance gave him.The contradiction between these theoretical considerations about thestate and the labile legal position of the subject described above cannot beoverlooked, but it can be solved both in theory and in practice. In his theoryof the state, Kant develops a notion of the state according to ‘pure legal principles’, a ‘state as an idea’.76At the same time, he tries to connect therequirement of political reason with the actual political situation in the late eighteenth century. He succeeds in this endeavour because he turns the idea of the state into the guiding principle (‘norma’)77of any society, sothat any state is actually subject to the reason-based idea. ‘The idea of a con-stitution which harmonizes with natural law’ – so he writes in Streit derFakultäten– ‘is the basis of all forms of government, and the commonwealthwhich, being conceived in accordance with it by means of pure concepts ofreason, forms a platonic ideal (respublica noumenon) is not an empty figmentof the imagination but the eternal norm for any civil constitution whatso-ever and abolishes all war.’78Because of this norm, any existing legislatureis required to ‘govern in a republican fashion; that is, to treat the peopleaccording to principles which correspond to the spirit of the laws of liberty(which a people with mature reason would prescribe for itself)’.79Since thenorm of reason is only possible in a genuine republic – a state with divisionof powers based on the sovereignty of the people – Kant subjects the stateto a process of historical development which leads to its transformation.Thus, while enlightened absolutism is sanctioned as legally valid, it is alsomerely a stage in a process that does not come to an end until the republicis established.80For Kant’s contemporaries, who were subjects in comparatively insecurelegal conditions, this model may not have been very comforting, as it com-bined the desire for political change with political and legal stability. Nonethe less, Kant’s ideas are quite radical inasmuch as he implants an elementof change into the existing political conditions, no matter how unsatisfac-134Frank Grunert"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"tory they may be. He does so not only by means of theoretical postulatesof reason, but also by deriving political postulates from them which cannotbe denied in the long run. Theoretically, the absorption of the right of resis-tance in the constitutional state is already visible in Kant’s writings, even ifin practice, it was still far off.Notes1.

More specifically, I want to focus on Hobbes’ treatment of the classicalformula of distributive justice – suum cuique tribue, give to each his own – aformula which has been considered theclassical definition of justice. Mymain concern is to show that Hobbes understands this formula quite dif-ferently from the prior natural law tradition and that this reinterpretationdepends upon his new concept of natural law.The chapter is divided into four sections. First, I offer some brief remarkson the meaning and use of the suum cuiqueformula in ancient and medievalpolitical philosophy (I). Second, I show the way in which Hobbes is con-cerned with the problem of distributive justice in relationship to the stateof nature (II). After that, I explain Hobbes’ critique and reinterpretation ofthesuum cuiqueformula (III). Finally, I give a short preview of the mannerin which Kant follows Hobbes’ reinterpretation of the suum cuiqueformula(IV).I. The suum cuiquein ancient and medieval political philosophyIn the present context, it is not possible to give a detailed account of thehistory of the suum cuiqueformula, so I will restrict myself to the following139"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"remarks. The history of this formula dates back to antiquity: it can be foundin the political philosophy of Plato, Aristotle, Cicero and in Roman law. Inancient political theory, the term ‘justice’ almost forms a guiding topic withregard to both political institutions as well as individual virtue. This centralimportance of the term ‘justice’ can be seen in the well-known discussionson just law, just government, the just ruler and finally in the discussions onthe role of justice as a social virtue manifest in the virtue of the citizen.Although it was Aristotle who introduced the concept of justice in thefifth book of his Nicomachean Ethics, as well as some important distinctionssuch as the difference between commutative and distributive justice, it wasthe Stoics who provided a systematic natural law basis for the concept ofjustice. They did so by embedding it in a cosmopolitian theory of naturallaw, based on a teleological concept of nature. One can see this clearly inthe work of Cicero, whose ‘conception of natural law bears the unmistak-able imprint of Stoicism’4and whose philosophical writings are our mostimportant source for hellenistic natural law. In his De officiis, Cicero claimsthat all men are obliged, according to an immutable principle of the ‘lawsof human society’, ‘to contribute to the general good’, that is, not to disturbanother man’s suumand not to harm anybody else for the sake of one’s ownadvantage.5Cicero’s further considerations make it clear that he is follow-ing his Greek predecessors on this point. He understands the precept ofjustice as a principle of moral behaviour that belongs to the doctrine ofvirtue, not of law: the suum cuique tribueis the subjective rule of acting in amoral manner. The point of view from which Cicero considers the prin-ciple of justice is always the question of what is to be done in order to be a‘good and just man’ (vir bonus et justus).6Keeping in mind this connectionof the term juswith the concept of justice as a virtue, we are now able tounderstand the meaning of Cicero’s jus naturale. In contrast to modernnatural law, this concept does not indicate a theory from which the princi-ples of legal coercion can be derived, but formulates the principle of theconstitution of an ethical community in which all people are bound to eachother by ties of friendship and mutual love.Although Cicero’s philosophical writings were popular in the MiddleAges,7for thinkers like Aquinas and Suárez the most important source of the definition of justice might have been the one in the Corpus Juris Civilisof Justinian. Justice there, to quote a phrase from the Roman lawyer Ulpian,is defined as constans et perpetua voluntas ius suum cuique tribuere, that is, as‘the perpetual and constant will to render to each his right’. Together withthehoneste vivere(live honourably) and the alterum non laedere(hurt noother), the suum cuique tribuerebelongs to these ‘iuris praecepta’.8It canhardly be doubted that the origin of Ulpian’s well-known definition lies inthe Stoic philosophy with which the Romans were familiar through Cicero’swritings. Thus, Cicero designated virtue as the ‘steadfast and continuous useof reason in the conduct of life’.9The similarity of Ulpian’s definition is even140Dieter Hüning"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"clearer if we compare it to the definition to be found in Cicero’s early writingDe inventione:Justice is a habit of mind which gives every man his desert while pre-serving the common advantage. Its first principles proceed from nature,then certain rules of conduct became customary by reason of their advan-tage; later still both the principles that proceeded from nature and thosethat had been approved by custom received the support of religion andthe fear of the law.10In order to show that the Thomist thinkers also understand the suumcuique tribueas a description of a virtue – as something that belongs to the behaviour of a vir bonus– one might recall the way in which Aquinasmakes use of the suum cuiqueformula. Aquinas refers to the formula in hisSumma theologiae. In question 58 of the Secunda secundae, he asks whetherthe Roman lawyers’ definition is appropriate. Aquinas accepted the Romanlawyers’ definition under the conditition that it isunderstood aright. For, since every virtue is a habit, that is, the principleof a good act, a virtue must needs be defined by means of the good actbearing on the matter proper to that virtue. Now, the proper matter ofjustice consists of those things that belong to our intercourse with othermen. . . . Hence the act of justice in relation to its proper matter andobject is indicated in the words, ‘Rendering to each one his right’, since,as Isidore says, ‘a man is said to be just because he respects the right (jus)of others’.11II. The suum cuiqueand the state of nature: the place of justice in Hobbes’ political philosophyI have already suggested that Hobbes’ legal philosophy marks the beginningof a new epoch in the history of political thought. Hobbes himself claimsthat civil philosophy focuses on the two terms of ‘libertas’and ‘imperium’–the natural freedom of the individual and the necessity of the state’s domin-ion – and that the concept of civil philosophy might not be older than hisown book De Cive which appeared for the first time in 1642.12Nevertheless,he views natural law in a manner broadly similar to his predecessors, namelyas involving an ‘Investigation of Naturall Justice’13and as developing a‘Science of Naturall Justice’.14He also follows the earlier natural law tradi-tion in characterising his civil philosophy as concentrating on the conceptof the lex naturalisand its obligation.15Finally – and this is a further elementof agreement between Hobbes and the natural law tradition – he accepts asthe systematic starting point of his own considerations the classical defini-From the Virtue of Justice to the Concept of Legal Order141"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"tion of justice, namely that the word justice ‘signifies a steady Will of givingevery one his Own’.16The analysis of the word ‘justice’, Hobbes emphasises,leads necessarily to the question, ‘from whence it proceeded, that any manshould call any thing rather his Owne, then another mans’. The questionof justice thus hinges on the origins of the rights of private property.17There-fore, if justice consists in the ‘will of giving every one his Owne’, the prin-cipal question to be answered by legal philosophy is: what is the origin andthe object of this distribution? This seemingly harmless question about thebasis of private property – for Hobbes the basic form of all other subjectiverights – is the means by which he can turn the entire natural law traditionupside down.There are three aspects worth emphasising here. First, we should notdeceive ourselves about Hobbes’ use of these classical concepts and termi-nology of natural law, since Hobbes, according to Richard Schlatter, ‘alteredthe definitions of the old terms and produced a wholly different theory’.18That Hobbes is engaged in a study of such a classical subject as the conceptof distributive justice has to do with his understanding of scientific methodin philosophy. The appropriate approach of the ‘Acquisition of Science’, he agrees, is ‘to examine the Definitions of former Authors; and either to correct them, where they are negligently set down’, or to replace them by better ones. This nominalistic understanding of science is the reason why Hobbes is not particularly interested in the philosophical origins of the formula: ‘For words are wise men’s counters, they do but reckon bythem: but they are the mony of fooles, that value them by the authority of an Aristotle, Cicero, or a Thomas, or any other Doctor whatsoever, if buta man.’19Second, Hobbes was, of course, not the first to question the foundationof private property. Since the Middle Ages, there had been an extensive discussion about the origins of private property, its relationship to naturallaw and its legitimation.20In addition, the main representatives of Spanishscholasticism, Vitoria and Suárez, held the view that the introduction ofproperty was a result of human law.21Both of them also attempted a rein-terpretation of Ulpian’s definition by turning the term iusinto a ‘legal claimright understood as a moral faculty’.22But Hobbes makes this discussionmore radical by demonstrating that the question about the origins of privateproperty cannot be answered on the teleological basis of traditional naturallaw.Third, considering Hobbes’ relationship to the preceding natural law tra-dition, we should bear in mind that his fundamental break with this tradi-tion is characterised by his rejection of the Aristotelian dogma that man isazoon politicon– by nature destined for civil society – and the convictionthat this dogma could be a reasonable starting point for political philoso-phy. Hobbes’ claim, by contrast, is that the principles of the societas civiliscannot be found in the natural conditions of man. For Hobbes man is no142Dieter Hüning"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"longer considered a zoon politiconor an animal rationale, belonging, by virtueof his reason, to an universal teleological order created by God, but is ratheran individual who is primarily a subject of needs and rights. It might be argued that this new conception of man is only the result of a new conception of nature. One might be tempted, therefore, to regard Hobbes’rejection of traditional natural law and the teleological order of nature asstemming from the so-called ‘mechanization of the view of the world’.23Although this view has its merits, it does not help us to understand what isnew or revolutionary in Hobbes’ theory of natural law. It seems to me moreimportant at this point to analyse the legal consequences Hobbes drawsfrom his discovery, namely, that, given the traditional concept of naturallaw, it would be impossible to develop the foundation of property, of mineand thine, on the basis of considerations found in the Aristotelian, Stoic orscholastic writings. By criticising the Aristotelian dogma of the zoon politi-conand by claiming that the principles of civil society are artificial ratherthan natural, Hobbes opened the way to a completely new foundation ofnatural law. The most important consequence of this change in natural lawis that all political authority is artifical because it has its origin in a socialcontract.In this light we can turn to Hobbes’ development of his concept of naturalright and of the state of nature in De Cive. Here the central issue is what can be called the juridical dilemma of the state of nature.24Given the factthat every individual in the state of nature bears the natural right of self-preservation and that everyone is the judge in his own case, it follows thatthe attempt to realise one’s own right immediately destroys the conditionof every possible right. Why is this the case? It seems to me sufficient torefer to what Hobbes himself called the ‘contraction of his argument’ of thestate of nature:Because in certaine cases the difficulty of the conclusion makes us forgetthe premises, I will contract this Argument, and make it most evident toa single view; every man hath right to protect himself. . . . The same mantherefore hath a right to use all the means which necessarily conduce tothis end...: But those are the necessary means which he shall judge tobe such....He therefore hath a right to make use of, and to doe all what-soever he shall judge requisite for his preservation: wherefore by thejudgement of him that doth it, the thing done is either right, or wrong;and therefore right.25The centre of this argument is the assumption that the natural right ofthe individual is unlimited. This means that in so far as everyone is the judgein his own case and authorised by right reason to determine what action isnecessary for self-preservation, it is impossible to place an a priori limit onthe exercise of this natural right. This is so because it is not possible to estab-From the Virtue of Justice to the Concept of Legal Order143"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"lish a law-governed relationship between natural right and its exercise underthe condition of the state of nature. In this ‘natural condition of mankind’there is no possibility of ascertaining what is required to secure one’s preser-vation, for every possible use of force could, under certain circumstances,be legitimated by one’s own judgement of it as an action which is necessaryto secure one’s right against that of another.In Hobbes’ view, this concept of a state of nature where everything iscommon to all men, is implied by the ‘ius in omnia’: in the natural state, all things can be acquired by everyone for the purpose of self-preservation.In this condition ‘it was lawful for every man, in the bare state of nature,or before such time as men had engaged themselves by any covenants orbonds, to do what he would, and against whom he thought fit, and possess,use, and enjoy all what he would, or could get’.26But where everything is held in common, there is nothing which belongsexclusively to me or to another person. Therefore, the sentence ‘Nature hathgiven to every one a right to all’ and its logical negation ‘No one has a specialright to anything’ are identical.27On the other hand, Hobbes identifies theoriginal community of goods with the state of war in which ‘one by rightinvades, the other by right resists’.28So Hobbes concludes that because ofthe original community of goods the state of nature is a condition where‘the notions of Right and Wrong, Justice and Injustice have . . . no place’;and ‘where there is no common Power, there is no Law: where no Law, noInjustice’.29We are now in a position to grasp Hobbes’ revolution in political philoso-phy. According to Hobbes, there is no such natural law as Aquinas, Suárezand Grotius had supposed. It is not possible to derive a universal law of possible legal coercion, since nature yields no universal principle to limitexternal freedom. In other words, the concept of right would be whollyindefinite. On the contrary, in a state of nature, everyone has a right to allthings and no exclusive right to anything. Given this concept of the stateof nature, it is fair to conclude with Norberto Bobbio that Hobbes holds apurely ‘conventionalist conception of justice’.30This might seem a disastrousconsequence for natural law, of course, and many interpreters, namelyjurists, claim that Hobbes was committed to legal positivism. But I think itwould miss the point to consider Hobbes’ critical attitude to the natural lawtradition as a turn towards legal positivism. Although there are some argu-ments in his philosophy reminiscent of this view, he did not give up theidea that reason has to determine which principles of law limit our exter-nal freedom. Further he held that the same reason imposes duties upon uswhich force us to seek a state of peace with others.31In my opinion, Hobbesput to rest the vain attempts to find the principles of possible juridical coer-cion in the natural conditions of life. He was the first to begin the inversionof the teleology of nature into the subjectivity of the individual and the firstto establish the subjectivity and the will of man as the basis of politicaltheory.32144Dieter Hüning"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"III. The critique and reinterpretation of the suum cuiqueformulaHaving outlined aspects of Hobbes’ concept of the state of nature, we nowhave to consider its implications for the concept of justice. What conse-quences does the elimination of the teleological conception of nature as thefoundation of natural law have for the meaning of the suum cuiqueformula?The first effect was to divide the justice of a person from the justice of thatperson’s actions, thereby separating morality from law. Hobbes says:The names of Just, and Unjust, when they are attributed to Men, signi-fie one thing; and when they are attributed to Actions, another. Whenthey are attributed to Men, they signifie Conformity, or Inconformity ofmanners, to Reason. But when they are attributed to Actions, they sig-nifie the Conformity, or Inconformity to Reason, not of Manners, ormanner of life, but of particular Actions. 33Although Hobbes makes some allusions to the traditional concept of the‘just man’ who ‘takes all the care he can, that his Actions may be all Just’,it is clear that in his view legal philosophy has to do primarily with thejustice of actions. For Hobbes the justice of manners ‘is that which is meant,where Justice is called a Vertue’, while the justice of actions has a totally dif-ferent meaning, namely, that a man can be called ‘not Just, but Guiltlesse’34– a distinction which in my opinion foreshadows in certain respects theKantian distinction between morality and legality. We may also note thatfrom this distinction Pufendorf drew the conclusion that Ulpian’s definitionof justice has little to do with questions of jurisprudence:It is clear from this [the necessary distinction between the justice of actions and the justice of persons] that the definition of justice commonly used by the Roman Jurisconsults, namely, that it was a ‘constant and abiding desire to give one his due’, is very unsatisfactory,since jurisprudence is chiefly concerned with justice of action, and takes cognizance of justice of persons only in passing, and in a few particulars.35Hobbes is only concerned with virtues in so far as they function as thosecharacteristics ‘which are required for the maintenance’ of the civil society.36It is quite revealing that Hobbes, having outlined the difference between a just and an unjust man, continues by identifying justice and righteous-ness: ‘Such men are more often in our Language stiled by the names of Righteous, and Unrighteous; then Just, and Unjust; though the meaning is the same.’ Hobbes reduces, therefore, the virtues of the citizen to what he calls ‘righteousness’, ‘for Righteousness is but the will to give every onehis owne, that is to say, the will to obey the Laws’.37From the Virtue of Justice to the Concept of Legal Order145"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"The second effect of Hobbes’ transformation of the concept of justice wasto highlight the formalism of Ulpian’s definition. According to Hobbes inhisDialogue between a Philosopher and a Student of the Common Law, to definejustice as to give everyone his own, is purely formal and, therefore, empty:‘When you say that justice gives to every man his own, what mean you byhis own? How can that be given me, which is my own already? Or, if it benot my own, how can justice make is mine?’38The formula is empty, Hobbesargues, because it requires the distribution of something that is alreadysomeone’s own. In order to be applicable in a particular case, the formulasystematically assumes a rule by which someone is able to determine what-ever is ‘mine and thine’ (meum et tuum). According to Hobbes, this presup-poses the existence of a legal order. Similar to the other famous precept of‘do not hurt another’, the suum cuique tribuereformula is empty, being filledwith specific content only by positive laws, a critique which has becomepopular in the textbooks of jurists.39Aristotle, Cicero and Aquinas neveridentified this formalism as a problem because they never doubted the existence of a teleological order of nature. This order allowed the objects ofmorality, and justice to be seen as antecedent to and independent of man’swill. It is significant, then, that the formalism of the principle of distribu-tive justice was reflected for the first time at that moment when the Aristotelian conception of nature as a teleological order was being ques-tioned. In fact, this criticism of the formalism of the traditional norm of dis-tributive justice was symptomatic of a change in the meaning and functionof natural law itself. It allowed Hobbes to minimise the importance ofnatural law in relation to positive law, to declare that natural law consti-tutes only – as Norberto Bobbio has pointed out – ‘the foundation of valid-ity of the positive legal order, taken as a whole’.40The change in function of natural law also affects the classical norm ofdistributive justice. The suum cuiqueformula could no longer be understoodas an ethical principle of individual virtue, requiring one to align one’sactions with the community of utility or the common benefit, but as a basicprinciple of determining the external mine and thine.According to Hobbes,this formula expresses the necessity of the constitution of a legal order in which any kind of subjective rights can be determined and secured bypositive law.41But we should remember that, according to Hobbes, the suum cuiqueformula is formal, that is, it does not say anything about whattype of distribution is just. The claim of (distributive) justice, therefore, isidentical with the claim that there should be distribution, while the specialform of distribution belongs to the sovereign’s will. As Hobbes puts it, dis-tributive justice is ‘the act of defining what is Just’.42As such, the meaningof the suum cuiqueformula demands one leave the state of nature, allowingit to be identified the famous ‘exeundum e statu naturali’. Hobbes himselfcombines the two principles – the principle of distributive justice and theexeundum– in the following manner:43146Dieter Hüning"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"The distribution of the Materials of this Nourishment is the constitutionof Mine, and Thine, and His; that is to say, in one word, Propriety; andbelonged in all kinds of Common-wealth to the Soveraign Power. For where there is no Common-wealth, there is . . . a perpetual warre of every man against his neighbour; And therefore every thing is his thatgetteth it, and keepeth it by force; which is neither Propriety nor Com-munity;but uncertainty....Seeing therefore the Introduction of Propri-ety is an effect of Common-wealth; which can do nothing but by thePerson that Represents it, it is the act onely of the Soveraign; and con-sisteth in the Lawes, which none can make that have not the SoveraignPower. And this they well knew of old, who called that Nomos, (that is tosay, Distribution,) which we call Law; and defined Justice, by distribut-ing to every man his own.44Because the establishment of a system of contracts by which everyone’s legalclaims are determined by positive laws is the condition, not the result, ofjustice, it can be said, as Hobbes states in the Latin version of Leviathan, thatcivil power, property and justice were born at the same time (‘civitas, pro-prietas bonorum, et justitia simul nata sunt’).45The third result of this transformation of the concept of justice is perhapseven more dramatic than the two I have already mentioned. The fact thatthesuum cuiqueformula needs to be reinterpreted as connected with the exeundum– with the claim to enter into a civil society with legal rules guar-anteed by a sovereign power – also makes it clear that Hobbes had brokenwith the assumptions of justice in the natural law tradition. It is not bychance, then, that in LeviathanHobbes subordinates ‘the ordinary defini-tion of Justice in the Schooles’ to another, namely, a contractualdefinitionof justice: ‘For where no Covenant hath preceded, there hath no Right beentransferred, and every man has right to every thing; and consequently, noaction can be Unjust. But when a Covenant is made, then to break it isUnjust: And the definition of INJUSTICE, is no other than the not perfor-mance of Covenant. . . . The nature of Justice consisteth in keeping of validCovenants.’46According to this contractual definition of justice, keepingcovenants, established by Hobbes as the third law of nature, is to be under-stood as the true ‘Fountain and Originall of JUSTICE’.47It is by establishinga system of contractual relationships that indefinite natural right is changedinto a right that can be legally claimed.IV. Kant and the suum cuiqueformulaWe can conclude with a brief remark on Kant’s legal philosophy, designedto show the manner in which Kant follows the Hobbesian line of argument.In the introduction to his Doctrine of Right, where he discusses the ‘divisionof the duties of right’, Kant refers to Ulpian’s precepts. Without attemptingFrom the Virtue of Justice to the Concept of Legal Order147"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"a detailed analysis, we may point out that Kant, like Hobbes, also criticisesthesuum cuique tribueas an empty formula: ‘If this last formula [i.e. the‘suum cuique tribue’] were translated “Give to each what is his”, what it sayswould be absurd, since one cannot give anyone something he already has.’Thus, the formula requires a different interpretation or as Kant says: ‘a correction in expression.’48Through this objection Kant follows the line ofargument developed by Hobbes: ‘In order to make sense it would have toread: “Enter a condition in which what belongs to each can be secured tohim against everyone else”.’49Kant, therefore, also transforms the formula into the precept which marksthe entry into civil society. Again agreeing with Hobbes, Kant claims thatjustice among men is not possible under the conditions of natural commu-nity. He combines the claim that one must leave the state of nature withone which establishes civil society: ‘From private right in the state of naturethere proceeds the postulate of public right: when you cannot avoid livingside by side with all others, you ought to leave the state of nature andproceed with them into a rightful condition, that is, a condition of dis-tributive justice.’50This implicit reference to Hobbes’ criticism of our formula can be con-firmed by looking at Kant’s claim in the so-called ‘Vigilantius-Nachschrift’of the Metaphysics of Morals. Kant not only assumes that the suum cuiqueisthat principle from which all the legal duties in the proper sense – that isour duties against others – can be derived,51but also that Hobbes was thefirst to have considered the principle in this sense:In the state of nature, the judgement about right and wrong belongs to every individual; therefore, he can violate another one’s liberty un-impededly. This state of violation would be perpetual, if everyone werelegislator and judge [in his own case]: This has been called the state ofnature, – but a state which is contrary to the innate liberty. For thisreason, it is necessary, as soon as men approach each other, to leave thestate of nature in order to establish a necessary law, a civil state, that isa universal legislation which determines the right and wrong, a generalpower which secures everybody’s right, and a judicial power whichreestablished the violated law or which finds out the so-called distribu-tive justice (suum cuique tribuit). Hobbes was the only one who, amongall other natural law theorists, accepted this as the main principle of thecivil state: exeundum esse ex statu naturali.52Insisting upon the close connection between the claim of justice and theduty of entering into a civil society, Kant follows Hobbes’ critique of the tra-dition. For this reason, individual justice no longer plays an explicit role intheDoctrine of Right. In so far as legal philosophy is concerned primarilywith the constitution of a legal system whose task is the mutual assurance148Dieter Hüning"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"and guarantee of subjective rights, the justice of an individual or his moral-ity loses its importance. For the institutionalising of justice as legislation andpolitical jurisdiction limits the possibilities of acting in accordance withindividual maxims of justice.What conclusions can we draw from these considerations? First, we canobserve that Hobbes (and later Kant) discuss the problem of justice not as apart of ethics, but as belonging to the doctrine of right. Distributive justiceis considered as part of legal order. Second, the realisation of justice amongmen is not primarily a question of individual morality or virtue, but a ques-tion of a legal duty, that is, the duty to enter into a condition wherein every-one’s right can be secured by general laws guaranteed by a sovereign power.In summary, one can say that in the Hobbesian (and Kantian) tradition ofmodern natural law the concept of justice as a virtue is replaced by the ques-tion concerning the validity of the ground upon which coercion can be validated. In this context, the suum cuiqueformula is to be understood asthe basic principle of the right of the state.Notes1.

But beyondthat, no one in a stable society is self-governing except where the ruler’s laws aresilent.’42.Leviathan, p. 105.43.

This distribution is Justice, and thisproperly is the same which we say is one’s own. . . . It is also a Dictate of the Lawof Reason, that Statute Laws are a necessary means of the safety and well-beingof Man in the present world. . . .’ However, Hobbes does not distinguish clearlybetween distributive justice with regard to subjective rights, i.e. the establishmentof legal rules to regulate private property on the one hand, and the distributionof goods itself on the other hand. In contrast to the distribution of goods the dis-tribution of rights is purely formal because it is concerned only with securing thelegal conditions for possible acquisition of goods as property.44.Leviathan, p. 171. In the last sentence of the quotation, Hobbes alludes to Cicero’sfamous discussion of just distribution in De legibus(I, 19). But Hobbes changesCicero’s intention in a very subtle manner: while for Cicero the just distributionsupposes the teleological concept of lex naturae, for Hobbes on the contrary thelaw of distribution is to be derived from the will of the sovereign ruler, whosepower itself is legitimated by an original contract of all his subjects.45.Leviathan.

A lengthysubtitle explained that the tract was directed against defenders of individ-ual rights of resistance, notably the sixteenth-century humanist, GeorgeBuchanan, and the English Jesuit, Robert Parsons, as well as against morerecent contributions from the English republican, John Milton, and theauthors of the radical tract entitled Naphtali, issued in 1667 by two ScotsCovenanters, James Steuart of Goodtrees and John Stirling. Mackenzie’sachievement in producing a comprehensive defence of absolute monarchi-cal government induced the Convocation of Oxford University immediatelyto pass a resolution thanking Mackenzie ‘for the service he had done hisMajesty in writing and publishing Jus Regium’.1Denoting the apotheosis of royalist ideology in the final years of Stuart absolutism and Scottish political independence, Mackenzie’s arguments subsequently moved thenineteenth-century constitutional historian, Frederic Maitland, to declarethat nowhere in the history of political thought was the belief ‘that we per-ceive intuitively that hereditary monarchy is at all times and in all placesthe one right form of government’ defended more vigorously or extensivelythan in Jus Regium.2As Lord Advocate during the notorious ‘Killing Times’ of the late 1670sand early 1680s in Scotland, Mackenzie of Rosehaugh was known amongcontemporary opponents by the popular sobriquet ‘Bluidy Mackenzie’ forhis vigorous part in forcibly suppressing the Presbyterian Covenanters. Concerned not only to denounce arguments for the natural rights of self-defence and resistance articulated in Covenanting tracts like Naphtali, butalso to curb the levels of civil unrest thereby promoted, Mackenzie initiallyappears an unlikely figure with whom to begin considering the relationshipbetween ideas of natural jurisprudence and the construction of political sovereignty in late-seventeenth century Scotland. As a legal theorist,Mackenzie’s instinctive positivism rendered his specific discussions of155"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"natural law embryonic and inconclusive. Yet, as is evident from the argu-ments of other contributors to this volume, the language of natural law wascontinually subjected to conflicting constructions which could alternativelyendorse or preclude resistance to political authority across a range of dif-ferent constitutional and confessional contexts throughout early modernEurope. Hence the appeal to natural law demanded serious attention for alltheorists concerned to preserve absolute monarchical sovereignty from boththeoretical challenge and practical attack. In Scotland, what had finally pro-voked Mackenzie into penning Jus Regiumwas his incensed disbelief thatBuchanan and other resistance theorists ‘should have adventur’d upon adebate in Law, not being themselves Lawyers; and should have written Booksupon that Subject, without citing one Law, Civil, or Municipal, proorcon’.3As he conceived, discussion of royal authority was indeed a ‘debate in Law’,thus signalling an ideological shift from the early seventeenth century whenJames VI and I had confidently enjoined that ‘the absolute Prerogatiue ofthe Crowne . . . is no Subject for the tongue of a Lawyer, nor is it lawfull tobe disputed’.4This chapter contextualises royalist attempts in Scotland to restrict thelanguage of natural jurisprudence in order to preclude it from becoming theexclusively polemical preserve of radical nonconformists. In seeking todefend the legal and political integrity of Scottish sovereignty from internaland external challenge alike, theorists such as Mackenzie became involvedin wider contemporary endeavours to establish the sources of authority inScots law which necessarily required defining the juridical character andextent ofius naturae. As this chapter illustrates, concrete historical realitiesensured that the popularity of arguments defending natural law and concerns to preserve civil sovereignty to some extent enjoyed an inverserelationship in Restoration Scotland.The chapter is in three sections. The first considers how the language ofnatural law first had to be differentiated from its theological attraction inorder to become less destabilising politically. The second relates the simul-taneous need for the political threat to the integrity of the sovereign state,posed by radical Presbyterian Covenanters, to be confronted, discredited and neutralised. The final section concludes by suggesting that althoughboth these challenges had been largely accomplished by 1688, just as theinternal sovereignty of the Scottish crown appeared secure, the WilliamiteRevolution ruptured the dynastic continuity of the Stuarts which had historically represented the defining quality of Scottish national identity and sovereign statehood. Consequently, the nature of Scottish sovereigntybecame increasingly ambiguous, not only following the departure of James VII and II in 1688, but particularly after the incorporating politicalunion enacted between Scotland and England in 1707. While the securityof sovereign Scottish statehood waned, however, appeals to ius naturaethereafter acquired the familiar legitimacy and attraction characteristic of156Clare Jackson"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"the ‘natural jurisprudential interpretation’ of the eighteenth-century Scottish Enlightenment.5ICharles II’s return to power in May 1660 was accompanied by the restora-tion of the ancient and separate institutions of crown government through-out the Stuart multiple monarchy. After the profound disorientation of thecivil wars, legal and political thinking focused on reinforcing the internalintegrity of Scottish sovereignty. For not only had the negative legacy of theincorporating Cromwellian union considerably eroded Scottish enthusiasmfor potentially greater political union with her southern neighbour, butCharles II also perceived ‘many reasons to continue Scotland within its ownlimits and bounds, and sole dependence upon himself’.6In the aftermathof what an Edinburgh minister, John Paterson, dubbed the recent ‘greatState-quake’, defining the nature and extent of political sovereignty was deemed imperative.7Bodinian theories of indivisible, illimitable andinalienable sovereignty acquired renewed popularity as the architects of theRestoration settlement sought to rebut mid-century Covenanting defencesof shared sovereignty, on which could be grounded arguments for individ-ual rights of resistance as well as visions of federal union with other statesin the name of presbyterian internationalism.The enactment of a characteristically anti-clerical and royalist Restorationsettlement encouraged the subsequent publication of a series of major elab-orations on Scots private and public law. For his part, Mackenzie conceivedthe construction of a secure theoretical and legal royalist edifice to be essen-tial, for as he explained, ‘if these points be clear by our positive Law, thereis no further place for debate’ since ‘before Laws be made, men ought toreason; but after they are made, they ought to obey’.8Among the range ofpublications aimed at rendering Scots law more articulate during this periodwere, most notably, the Institutions of the Law of Scotland, issued by Sir JamesDalrymple, Viscount Stair, in 1681, together with Mackenzie’sLaws andCustoms of Scotland in Matters Criminalof 1678 and his ownInstitutionsof the Law of Scotlandof 1684. Together with a series of more specialised contributions from other contemporary jurists, including George Dallas, SirJohn Nisbet of Dirleton and Sir Alexander Seton of Pitmedden, these workswere not, however, conceived exclusively in terms of the particular jurispru-dence of Scotland. During a period in which almost one-half of all Scottishadvocates received formal legal education in the Netherlands or France,Scots legal thinking remained characteristically cosmopolitan in perspective,promoting the evaluation of Scots law within the comparative contexts ofthe laws of nature and of nations.9Throughout Europe, the sharp vicissi-tudes of recent political contingencies also invariably prompted interest indiscussions of natural law which offered standards on which governmentNatural Law and Political Sovereignty in Scotland157"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"should be founded and which transcended the vagaries of individual monarchs and politicians alike.This renewed interest was conspicuously apparent in Scotland in thedivergent juridical characterisations of ius naturaeproduced by the twoleading jurists of the period, Stair and Mackenzie, who served, respectively,as President of the Court of Session and as Lord Advocate. In Mackenzie’scase, his Institutionsof 1684 provided a parallel jurisprudential counterpartto the political defence of iure divinokingship articulated in his Jus Regium,published in the same year. In both works, he declared his methodology asbeing to establish ‘the present, positive Law’ of Scotland first, before turningto ‘the Principles of common Reason, Equity and Government, abstractingboth from the positiveness of our Law, and the nature of our Monarchy’.10From the competing sources of legal authority available, Mackenzie regardedstatutes as ‘the chief Pillars of our Law’, not only because they were clearlypromulgated by a sovereign lawgiver, but also because their very publicityprotected individual liberties by ensuring, for example, that no subject could be pursued for an action which was not defined as a crime in print.11Official concern to ensure that the Scottish statutes remained publicly accessible had earlier promoted a government grant and exclusive licencebeing granted to the Clerk Register, Sir Thomas Murray of Glendook, for theproduction of a new edition of the Scottish statutes from 1424 onwards.12Published in lavish folio editions, the detailed line drawings of each Scottish monarch that accompanied the elaboration of the statutes passedduring successive reigns symbolically reinforced Mackenzie’s own convic-tion that ‘None are so much obliged to Laws as Monarchs’.13Published three years after those of his colleague, Stair, Mackenzie’s Insti-tutionsprovided an implicit critique of the jurisprudential precepts articu-lated in Stair’s much larger Institutionsof 1681. For although Mackenzierefrained from referring directly to Stair, his positivist jurisprudence formeda striking contrast to Stair’s rationalism. For Stair had announced his inten-tion of proceeding from the general to the particular, declaring that since‘equity and the law of nature and reason is perfect and perpetual’, naturallaw established a universal standard to which legislators aspired.14Hencethose nations were ‘most happy, whose laws are nearest to equity, and most declaratory of it’.15Since equity represented ‘the body of the law’, thepurpose of positive municipal law was ‘only to declare equity, or make iteffectual’.16Furthermore, in arguing for the pre-eminence of case law as cus-tomary law, Stair acknowledged Scotland to be a nation ‘happy in havingso few and so clear statutes’.17Believing that the rational principles of equity were most clearly reflected in consuetudinary law, Stair criticised the rigidity of statutory law and warned that the proliferation of enactmentsinevitably ensured that statutes ceased offering ‘evidences and securities tothe people’, but became ‘labyrinths, wherein they are fair to lose their rights,if not themselves’.18Although reluctant to allude to his former experiences158Clare Jackson"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"as a ‘Commissioner for the Administration of Justice’ in the unitedCromwellian British commonwealth of the 1650s, in forming his preferencefor custom as a source of authority in Scots law, Stair inevitably reflected on his professional involvement with the pre-eminent case law system ofEnglish law. Like Mackenzie, however, Stair was also concerned to make thesources of Scots law as publicly available as possible, receiving permissionfrom Charles II to publish his Institutionsin 1681, in conjunction with thefirst printed collection of judicial decisions from the Lords of Session whichduly followed in two volumes in 1683 and 1687.19The divergent prioritisations of the sources of Scots law between Stair andMackenzie generated similarly contrasting deductions concerning the char-acter and relative obligation of ius naturae. Regarding equity as the body ofthe law, Stair accepted that if ‘man had not fallen, there had been no dis-tinction betwixt bonumandæquum’ and likewise nothing more ‘profitable,than the full following of the natural law’.20Given man’s depravity, however,he recognised that it was better for man to ‘quit something of that whichby equity is his due, for peace and quietness sake’, than to ‘use compulsionand quarrelling in all things’.21Hence he acknowledged the practical neces-sity of observing positive laws, but avoided drawing too sharp a distinctionbetween legal and moral rights, regarding the former as a specialised anddistinct case of the latter. He did, however, find it more difficult to accom-modateius gentiumwithin his framework of law as a rational discipline, sincehe was aware of the Grotian warning that it was not always possible for mento discern the difference between a correct conclusion drawn from naturalprinciples and an issue over which common consent could be found. Sincethe latter tended to suggest a law of nations, rather than an aspect of naturallaw itself, Stair preferred to interpret ius gentiumthrough a reliance on internal custom, rather than on abstract principle, when addressing specificissues, such as the law of war at sea. Inclined thus to evaluate positive lawthrough a prism of general jurisprudential principles, Stair likewise accordedless binding authority to Roman, or civil, law, than was customary amongseventeenth-century jurists. Detracting from an enquiry concerned withintrinsic justice, he thus criticised commentaries on the civil law for merelyproviding ‘a congestion of the contexts of law: which exceedingly nauseatesdelicate ingenia [intellects]’.22Reminding Charles II in the ‘Dedication’ tohisInstitutions, that he and his Scots subjects had been ‘least under the yokeof Rome in your sacred or civil interest’, Stair concluded that Roman lawwas ‘not acknowledged as a law binding for its authority’, but only as ‘a rule,followed for its equity’.23By contrast, a very different construction of ius naturaewas articulated inMackenzie’s Institutions, since his instinctive attachment to legislation as asource of legal authority rendered him less likely to defend notions of anindependent natural morality. Adopting the Justinianic division of law intothe law of nature, the law of nations and the civil, or municipal, law of eachNatural Law and Political Sovereignty in Scotland159"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"country, Mackenzie defined natural law as being ‘those common principleswhich are common to Man and beasts. . . rather innate instinct, than positive Law’.24Effectively denuding ius naturaeof any specific moral quality,he followed contemporary Continental practice by differentiating furtherbetween a ‘primary’ natural law representing the shared legal principlesupon which mankind rationally ordered its world and a ‘secondary’ law ofnature governing specific legal arrangements between sovereign states in an embryonic form of international law. Regarding the latter, however,although Mackenzie later observed that ‘Men are much delighted to hear ofthe Law of Nations’,25he contended that disputes between sovereign stateswere not ‘occasion’d by the Laws of Nations, as fed by Luxury and Avarice’.26By contrast, since such legislation only regulated a limited number of issuessuch as diplomatic relations and international treaties, the body of law com-prehended within ius gentiumwas of less extent than might initially be imag-ined. Of considerably more significance within Mackenzie’s interpretativeframework was Roman law, which he vested with more authoritative statusthan Stair, describing it as ‘the Generall Supplement of our Law’.27Avowedly intent on ‘inserting nothing that is controverted’, Mackenziethus found it difficult to accommodate more uncertain Grotian notions ofnatural law within the scope of his Institutionssince they lacked clear evi-dence of a legislator’s will.28He did, however, elsewhere address the poten-tial conflict which arose between his own instinctive attachment to regardall law as derived from the sovereign’s will and his recognition of each indi-vidual’s capacity to use correctly his own recta ratioto obtain knowledge of the natural law. At his death in 1691, Mackenzie left unfinished his commentary on Justinian’s Digestwherein he defended notions of univer-sal justice, but distanced himself from notions of an independent moralityalong the lines of the Grotian etiamsi daremusclause by emphasising that‘all the Principles of Justice and Government, without which the Worldcould not subsist’ depended upon belief in an infinite and immortal deity.29Moreover, he took the absence of this religious foundation to be the reasonwhy Justinian’s definition of natural law as instincts common to all livingcreatures lacked effective meaning. While reiterating that the laws of naturewere ‘dicates written in our harts’ by God, rather than deductions inferredby men, he recognised that since humans had themselves been created bya morally perfect deity, this definition necessarily entailed degrees of circu-larity in attempting to define morality in terms of God’s will.30IIWhile the theoretical relationship between the legal and the moral contentof natural law remained a matter of unresolved debate in late seventeenth-century Scotland, what vested this jurisprudential controversy with practi-cal urgency was, however, its bearing on issues of political obligation. If160Clare Jackson"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"nothing else, the effects of the mid-century civil wars had conspired torender this a generation whose sense of the political was highly practicalduring the years subsequently known as the ‘Killing Times’ in Scottishhistory. Issues of natural rights of resistance and self-defence were, forinstance, dramatically brought home to Bishop Andrew Honyman ofOrkney when he was seriously wounded by a shot in his arm from a radicalCovenanter whilst in Edinburgh in 1668 overseeing the publication of his anti-Covenanting tract entitled A Survey of Naphtali. In 1677, Mackenziewrote to Honyman’s colleague, Archbishop James Sharp of St Andrews,protesting that while his own political enemies might have succeeded ininflicting bodily harm in a recent attack from which he had suffered abroken leg, he doubted their ability to break his resolve, given what hetermed his ‘secret pleasur in serving the King’.31Two years later, the brutalmurder of Archbishop Sharp himself was carried out by a band of radicalCovenanters who allegedly sang psalms as they thrust their swords into theprimate’s body, convinced that their actions were the product of divineinspiration.Amidst such heightened political circumstances, practical exigenciesurgently required theoretical legitimisation. Sharing adherence to a largelyfabulous form of ancient constitutionalism, which held the Scottish monar-chy to have been originally founded in 330 BCby the mythical King FergusI, seventeenth-century Scots of all political persuasions regarded themselvesas subjects of the most ancient monarchy in the world. Yet although themonarch was universally identified as the locus of political authority towhom obligation was entailed, the mid-century civil war experience haddemonstrated that conflicting constructions of monarchical sovereigntyabounded. Hence, as perceived disparities between enacted positive normsand the moral order acquired critical import, rival positivistic and rational-istic interpretations of political sovereignty both identified a different iusnaturaleas the basis of political obligation.At one end of the ideological spectrum were the individual rights of resis-tance defended in the covenanting tract, Naphtali, published anonymouslyby James Steuart of Goodtrees and John Stirling and regarded by oneappalled reader as displaying ‘all that a Toung set on fire by hell can say’.32Described subsequently as ‘unquestionably the most strident revolutionarytract of the Restoration’ for its ‘explicit justification of rebellion and tyrannicide’,Naphtali’s contractarian defences of popular sovereignty werepredicated upon a combination of Buchananite inheritance and selectivereadings of Althusian natural law theory.33In another radical tract entitledJus Populi Vindicatumpublished in 1669, Steuart of Goodtrees expanded hisdefence of resistance, maintaining it to be a ‘firme truth, that the conditionof a people modelled into a civil state’ could not be ‘worse then it was before,but rather better’.34While acknowledging the divinely endowed nature ofcivil government, he nevertheless held kingship and magistracy to be purelyNatural Law and Political Sovereignty in Scotland161"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"human constructs, deriving from early contracts or ‘compacts’. Hence, if aking ‘doth violate his compact, as to all its conditions, or as to its cheef,maine and most necessary conditions’, Steuart held that subjects were ‘deIurefreed from subjection to him, and at liberty to make choice of another’.35By such an interpretation, the correct definition of a tyrant depended onhis moral conduct, rather than on the constitutional legality of his acces-sion, as royalist apologists insisted. Steuart’s naturalistic defences of resis-tance were eagerly taken up by more radical Covenanting publicists whoproduced manifestos in the late 1670s and early 1680s, publicly proclaim-ing that Charles II had forfeited his right to the throne by his ‘perjury andbreach of covenant both to God and his kirk’, as well as the ‘usurpation ofhis crown and royal prerogatives therein’.36Consequently, the Covenantersannounced their decision to ‘declare a war with such a tyrant and usurper’,together with ‘all men of his practices’ and all those deemed to have‘strengthened him in his tyranny, civil or ecclesiastic’.37Unsurprisingly, a very different construction was placed on the duty of political obedience by those responsible for maintaining civil peace.Determined that the preservation of order should become the chief priorityin order to avoid a repetition of the misery and confusion of the civil war years, members of Charles II’s administration were obliged to construct atheoretical defence of their actions which eliminated the scope for the language of natural rights to become a legitimating lexicon of resistance.Attacking Buchanan and the anonymous authors of Naphtali, Mackenzie ofRosehaugh insisted that ‘our Monarchs derive not their Right from thePeople, but are absolute Monarchs, deriving their Royal Authority immedi-ately from God Almighty’.38Associated with such ideas of the monarch asGod’s Vicegerent were notions which identified royal with patriarchal powerand which adhered to beliefs in natural subjection by attacking ‘the Jesuitical and Fanatical Principles, that every man is both Free, and at Libertyto choose what form of Government he pleaseth’.39Dismissing all sugges-tions that the government of Scotland was based on the unstable constitu-tive power of the community, divine right theories had been most clearlyenunciated in the early seventeenth century by James VI and I, for whomkingship represented the ‘trew paterne of Diuinitie’, confirming that ‘by theLaw of Nature the King becomes a naturall Father to all his Lieges at hisCoronation’.40From the absolute sovereignty of the Stuart monarch could also bededuced the concomitant commands of passive obedience and non-resistance. For if, as Mackenzie put it, ‘he be Supream, He cannot be judg’d,for no man is judg’d but by his Superior’.41For those who sought to upholddivinely ordained absolute monarchy, all forms of active deprecation werecondemned wholesale and particular energy was required to refute claimsthat resistance was justified by ius naturaethrough the fundamental humanimperative of self-preservation. In an appendix hurriedly attached to the first162Clare Jackson"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Edinburgh edition of Jus Regium, Mackenzie enumerated the specific his-torical conditions under which Grotius had defended limited rights of resis-tance, before dismissing them as inapplicable to Restoration Scotland. Whileacknowledging that Grotius’ account might be ‘justly rejected, as beinghimself born under a Commonwealth’, Mackenzie insisted that he was,however, ‘an enemy to such Fanatical Resistance’ whose precepts had beendangerously misrepresented.42In his denunciatory Survey of Naphtali, BishopHonyman of Orkney returned to Justinian’s definition of ius naturaeasinstincts common to all living creatures. Acknowledging that althoughbeasts were entitled not under ‘any Legal restraints of the exercise of theirself-defending power’, being ‘only under natures Law’, he insisted that men had surrendered this liberty in exchanging their natural rights of self-defence for the protection of government.43As Honyman elaborated, withina sophisticated civil society, there was no clearer judicial example of thisprecept than that of a condemned man submitting to the death penalty,since it denoted an instance ‘where natures Law of self-preservation (at leastin the way of violence) must cease and be silent’.44As Honyman’s tract suggests, discussion of natural law and natural rights were becoming increasingly visible in published pamphlets andsermons during the Restoration. Typical of the popular dissemination ofthese ideas was a polemical attack penned in 1682 by an episcopalian cleric,James Craufurd in the form of a Serious Expostulationwith the radicalCovenanters. As Craufurd explained, even in those societies, unlike Scotland, where political power was recognised to have originally resided inthe community, the precepts of natural law enjoined that its members had concluded ‘the wisest Bargain they could make’ by surrendering theirnatural rights to the magistrate.45Aware, however, that ‘Men are apt to confound Natural Rights, and the Law of Nature, which vastly differ’, heargued that even in societies founded upon popular contractual agreements,natural rights merely represented a necessary corollary of government andsubjects were only entitled to enjoy such rights insofar as they were givenleave by the laws of that particular administration.46Hence injunctions to non-resistance continued to oblige subjects regard-less of the qualitative character of sovereign authority. As defenders ofabsolute monarchy pointed out, if the hallmarks of political sovereigntywere taken to be inalienability, indivisibility and incommunicability, notonly was monarchy itself, by definition, absolute, but it also represented themost effective bulwark against civil disorder. As Mackenzie concluded,‘though a mixt Monarchy may seem a plausible thing to Metaphysical Spiritsand School-men, yet to such as understand Government, and the World, itcannot but appear impracticable’.47Elsewhere, a similar argument was con-structed by a Scots law student, Andrew Bruce of Earlshall, who embarkedon a ‘juridical investigation into the decrees of princes’ which he defendedpublicly at the University of Franeker before the renowned natural jurist,Natural Law and Political Sovereignty in Scotland163"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Ulrich Huber in 1683. While acknowledging that indivisible sovereigntycould subsist within a republican democracy, Bruce declared his admirationfor the practical efficacy of absolute monarchy. Sceptically distrustful of allideological models held to transcend time and place, he pointed out thatCharles II’s enactment of the Act Recissory in 1663 had ensured that theentire Covenanting revolution in Scotland remained no more than a his-torical figment of the imagination, while in the Netherlands, the abolitionof the Perpetual Edict in 1672 had likewise destroyed the legislative embodi-ment of Grotian notions of universal freedom and justice.48Characterisingthe indivisible, irresistible and inalienable sovereignty possessed by theabsolute monarch as the same as that vested in Roman Emperors by the lexregia, Bruce thus accepted that ‘princes simply have the right, that is thepower, of treating their citizens badly’ and it was the subjects’ duty to recog-nise this power.49Despite such unequivocal injunctions to obedience, political authority wasnot entirely denuded of all moral substance by members of Charles II’sadministration. The absolute monarch of Restoration Scotland was not per-ceived to be basileus, or despotical. As much in moral, as in constitutionalterms, clear differences prevailed between monarchy and tyranny and therewere crucial distinctions between the sovereign’s liberty of action and hismere immunity from civil laws. As Mackenzie explained, since absolute mon-archs remained subject to the laws of God, of nature and of nations, anymonarch who deemed himself able to dispense with such laws must ‘thinkhe is ty’d by no Law; and that is to be truly Arbitrary’.50Since Scotland lackeda formal court of chancery on the English model, however, the Scottishmonarch’s right to dispense with civil law remained intact on those occa-sions when it was decreed that æquumcould be preferred to iustum.In seeking to divert attention away from the contestable language ofnatural law and natural rights, royalist defenders also appealed to notionsof fundamental law. Despite having the potential to undermine absolutistclaims that the monarch was legibus solutus, such leges fundamentalesappeared to operate in a way that circumscribed the monarch’s conductwithin a set of leges regni, separate from the traditional constraints of the laws of God and of nature and thus preserved certain popular rights and liberties. In 1607, James VI and I had attempted to confine Scottish ‘fundamental laws’ to the constitutional principles which established andregulated monarchical succession, explaining to members of the English Parliament that the Scots did not use the term ‘as you doe, of their CommonLaw, for they haue none’.51In his Leviathanof 1651, however, ThomasHobbes proposed a diametrically opposite version, interpreting the conceptof fundamental law as a binding obligation placed on subjects to upholdwhatever sovereign body was in authority. In Restoration Scotland, the legaland political meaning of fundamental law remained no less ambiguous. InNaphtali, Steuart of Goodtrees and Stirling declared that the National164Clare Jackson"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Covenant of 1638 and the Solemn League and Covenant of 1643 togetherrepresented ‘the very Fundamental Law of the Kingdom’, on which ‘all theRights and Priviledges either of King and People, are principally bottomedand secured’.52Unsurprisingly, Mackenzie disagreed, insisting that a funda-mental law was one on which the authority of Parliaments historicallydepended and which was prior to statutes and hence could not be abro-gated, along the lines of indefeasible hereditary succession. He was, however,less certain about the ‘fundamental rights’ conferred by such laws. For whilehe recognised ‘Liberty and Property’ as ‘indeed the fundamentall Rights ofthe People’ without which ‘neither Individuals nor societys can subsist’, inthe aftermath of the civil unrest unleashed during the late 1670s and early1680s, he observed that ‘factious and restless Spiritts have made every thingby very remote and ill deduc’d consequences to be a violation of these fundamentall Rights’.53Hence he was forced to conclude that ‘what thesefundamentall Laws are, I cannot determine’, rendering it unjust ‘to makethat a Crime in innocent country men, which the best Lawyers understandnot’.54IIIThe simultaneous publication in 1684 of Mackenzie’s Jus Regiumand hisInstitutionsthus represented a considerable contribution towards the royal-ist ideological enterprise. As the radical challenge posed by the Covenant-ing extremists jeopardised the nation’s social and political fabric during thelate 1670s and early 1680s, Presbyterian nonconformity divided into anirreconcilable and hardened minority and a moderate majority willing toacknowledge the monarch’s lawful authority while petitioning for the eccle-siastical establishment of Presbyterianism. In the process, older Covenant-ing defences of shared sovereignty, federal union and contractual kingshipwere eclipsed and then largely discredited. A powerful edifice predicatedupon duties of passive obedience and non-resistance triumphed over ancientconstitutionalist interpretations of individual rights and self-defence. Anewer lexicon of sovereignty thus replaced sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century allusions to the reciprocal nature of kingship. In passing the ExciseAct of 1685, for example, members of the Scottish Parliament enthusiasti-cally recognised James VII and II as one of the most ‘absolute’ monarchs in the world, while acknowledging that he did not possess ‘an arbitrarydespotick power’ to ‘act in violation of the laws’.55While the indivisibility of the monarch’s political sovereignty was thusvaunted, issues of inalienable sovereignty remained less clear. Emotive andnegative memories of the Cromwellian occupation quickly conspired torender proposals for an incorporating Anglo-Scottish political unionabortive in 1670. For his part, Mackenzie challenged the right of membersof the Scottish Parliament to ‘extinguish or innovate’ its constitution, unlessNatural Law and Political Sovereignty in Scotland165"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"such a decision was taken unanimously, since each commissioner’s right ‘cannot be taken away from him without his own Consent, tho’ allthese who are in the Society with him should renounce what is theirs’.56Hostility was also expressed towards notions of future legal union betweenScotland and England, for not only was Scots law increasingly recognised toderive from very different legislative sources than those of English law, butpractical obstacles also existed. For example, since there was no mechanismfor Parliamentary appeal in Scotland, there was no need for the Scots Parliament to be a permanent constitutional fixture and no precedent foraccording final judicial decisions to an elected assembly rather than toappointed judges. Hence although questions relating to appellate jurisdic-tion came under sporadic scrutiny during the Restoration, it was not untilafter the Williamite Revolution of 1689 that provisions for ‘remeid of law’were enshrined in the Claim of Right.It was, ultimately, the impact of the Williamite Revolution which alsoserved to alter the perceived relationship between natural law and civil sovereignty in late seventeenth-century Scotland. For although it had beentraditionally assumed by most royalists that the greatest threat to orderlygovernment was likely to come from extreme presbyterian nonconformists,during James VII and II’s reign, the largest risk to civil order and individualliberties appeared to emanate from the Crown itself. For not only did thedivinely ordained monarch seem intent on compromising the divine rightsof the established episcopalian church, but James’ aggressive Catholicisingpolicies were also perceived as likely to undermine national integrity. Following his sudden flight to France in December 1688, however, appealsto natural law could be recast in a manner that permitted acquiescence inan international revolution as opposed to previous Covenanter rebellionsagainst the monarch’s domestic authority.57Hence, although the Scots have been traditionally characterised as ‘Reluctant Revolutionaries’, in aiming to ensure that Scotland would hence-forth be free from popery and arbitrary government, the framers of the 1689 Claim of Right set about declaring certain actions to be illegal which the Scottish monarch unquestionably possessed the legal right to doby the Restoration settlement of 1660.58In doing so, the predominantly Presbyterian architects of the Revolution settlement of 1689 did not chal-lenge the authority of Restoration legislation, but focused instead on itsintrinsic justice. Viewed from this perspective, events in 1689 fundamen-tally altered the manner in which monarchical government in Scotland washenceforth conducted: as one disillusioned episcopalian remarked, there wasindeed ‘a new systeme of Government’ and ‘new, and untryed Rules to walkby’.59The subsequent elevation of Steuart of Goodtrees to serve in 1692 asone of Mackenzie’s successors in the office of Lord Advocate demonstratedthe extent to which previously radicalised resistance theories had been effec-tively tamed. Instead, the religious duty of subjection was made compatible166Clare Jackson"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"with the secular right of the people to hold their sovereign accountable ifhe violated the laws not only of Scotland, but also of God, nature andnations. For although the irrevocable suspension of the Stuart line thatoccurred in 1689 profoundly disorientated Scottish political thinking, thelanguage of natural law subsequently emerged, shorn of its radical and apoc-alyptic aspirations and henceforth able to serve as a guarantor of politicaljustice, if not of undivided political sovereignty.Notes1.

The main thrust ofthis chapter is to argue that in English-speaking political discourse, the useof the concept of ‘self-defence’ became isolated from the constitutionalframework in which it had been embedded in Germany. Rather than being circumscribed by civil laws, it was transformed into a fundamentalright overriding other considerations about the body politic. It becameembedded into considerations about a ‘state of nature’.The reign of Mary Tudor had already seen intense reception of Germanaccounts of legitimate resistance among English exile communities.6Fromthe battle at the White Mountain in 1620 English interest in what was goingon in Germany surged again. Translations of Bohemian pamphlets deplor-ing the Protestant fate circulated.7In the wake of this interest an increasingnumber of members of the political nation attempted to make sense ofEnglish and Scottish troubles in terms of the terminology and reasoning ofGerman political treatises.8Put in the Tower, Sir John Eliot closely read thework of the German scholar Henning Arnisaeus.9As the Ancient Constitu-tion seemed to crumble under the pressure of conflict between king and parliament from 1642, what had been a feature preventing closer reading of170"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"the texts emanating from Germany, namely their exhaustive philosophicaland legal reasoning on the very basis of a body politic, increasingly becamethe very reason to look at these lengthy treatises.10In what follows only two instances of such reception will be discussed indetail, the translation of Henning Arnisaeus’ De jure maiestatisby Sir JohnEliot in 1628–30 and the use of Johannes Althusius’ Politicaby the later LordAdvocate of Scotland, James Steuart of Goodtrees, in 1669.11These are exam-ples from two different countries and two very different contexts, one pre-ceding the civil war, the other after it. But both were concerned with findinga formula against tyranny without compromising kingship by looking at aGerman text. Charles McIlwain chose to summarize that formula with theGerman term Rechtsstaat– a state run by laws rather than by might, onemight awkwardly translate – when in 1934 he distinguished Hobbes, Filmerand those claiming rights of sovereignty beyond the law from those con-ceiving a rule of law beyond the reach of either king or people, to his mindamong ‘many more’, the aim of Sir Matthew Hale, Sir Edward Coke and,indeed, Sir John Eliot.12Seventeenth-century German accounts of the meaning of sovereignty ina state rested, however, on the twofold development of administration andexecutive rights in the Holy Roman Empire – on both the territorial leveland the level of the Empire as a whole. This complementary developmentof state-building allowed accounts of resistance against the supreme magis-trate to defend order and subjection and yet to systematically include theright to resist. Once those accounts were used to construct an argumentabout the place of sovereignty and the possibility of resistance in Englandor Scotland, the German systematic approach and the new environment collided and produced substantially novel claims about the body politic. In what follows, the term Rechtsstaatas used with reference to German political theory around 1620 will be shortly elaborated (section I) and the reception of Arnisaeus and Althusius by Eliot and Steuart looked at (sections II and III).IThe term Rechtsstaathad been coined in the wake of the collapse of theEmpire and the foundation of modern sovereign states on German soil.Some of the princes of the Empire had become sovereign kings and were no longer bound by the jurisdiction of the Imperial Aulic court or the Imperial chamber court. Judges in these newly founded states were anxiousto bind the monarchs to the law without committing themselves to princi-ples of modern democratic sovereignty that were despised as alleged importsof revolutionary France. Their courts of law had been founded during theseventeenth century and had been given privileges by the Emperor and the Imperial Estates to protect them against interference from individualSelf-Defence in Statutory and Natural Law171"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"princes, who had themselves been bound to comply with the positive Imperial law as it had been developing since the Golden Bull of 1356.Indeed, Sir James Stephen, in his lectures on the History of France publishedin 1851, answered Voltaire’s famous question ‘why has England so long andso successfully maintained her free government and her free institutions?. . . Because England is, as she has always been, German.’13Of course, emphasis on the rule of law14understood as a body of pre-scriptions and assumptions sanctified by its age and being in accordancewith and a mirror of divine law and the law of nature, underpinned byCiceronian and neo-Platonic notions of harmony, was neither peculiarlyEnglish or German; nor was the accompanying notion that every societyhad to be a hierarchy of order and subjection with the monarch as its undis-puted head. The ‘strain of idealism’, which J. N. Ball15detected in Sir JohnEliot’s conception of the relation of king and parliament combining uncom-promised monarchical authority with the rule of law, reflected a notion per-fectly common to men like Jean Bodin (Six books on the Republic, 1576),16George Buchanan (De jure regni apud Scotos, 1576),17or, indeed, to Sir JohnDavis (Law Reports, 1615).18Bodin and Buchanan, though, shared a commonproblem: how to reconcile uncompromised monarchical government, therule of law and the precept of harmony with the fact of religious strife? Howto prevent a tyrant from breaking divine and natural law and yet preventgovernment from dissolving and the monster of the common man fromraising its many heads? During the seventeenth century, reflections on poli-tics slowly abandoned the notion of harmony in favour of a more techni-cal understanding of the specific rights and responsibilities of the variouspolitical players in a kingdom, a process that has been understood as leadingfrom the law of nature to natural rights.19Against this background, the constitutional context and political experi-ence of the Empire allowed an unquestioned hierarchy of order and sub-jection in the body politic to be combined with an account of monarchybound by law. So far, the thought addressing the kingship of James I hasbeen described in similar terms by Glenn Burgess.20But in the Empire, suchan unquestioned hierarchy was not put into jeopardy by accounts of legiti-mate resistance against law-breaking magistrates. Accounts of resistance inthe Empire must thus be understood as similar to a surgical operation, whoseaim is to prevent a specific magistrate from threatening the true faithwithout actually damaging the hierarchy of order and subjection that wasmeant to be a prerequisite of social life. The 1524 Peasants War, the eventsat Münster, the St. Batholomew’s Day massacre and again the assassinationsof Protestant or allegedly pro-Protestant princes had brought home thedangers of common men turned assassins. The period from 1606 to 1620saw a plethora of work specifically dedicated to combining accounts of theexercise of this surgical operation with the Bodinian notion of sovereignty.21Two of the most celebrated and influential pieces were the absolutist De jure172Robert von Friedeburg"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"maiestatisby the Lutheran medical doctor Henning Arnisaeus of 1610 andthe constitutionalist Politicaof the Calvinist Johannes Althusius (published1603–14).These works, as did the whole genre of books published after 1606,reflected the mainly peaceful, if tense, cohabitation of Protestants andCatholics in the Empire from the 1520s and in particular since the Peace ofAugsburg in 1555. But they had to address the profound legal and politicalinsecurity following the dissolution of Imperial monarchical governmentand the imperial judiciary in the wake of the Habsburg family feud betweenArchduke Mathias and Emperor Rudolf from the 1590s.22Among Lutheranand Calvinist accounts alike, one core feature was to distinguish three legitimate kinds of resistance against the Catholic monarch Ferdinand II. Ina nutshell, this distinction had been already developed in Regius Selinus’account of legitimate self-defence in cases of emergency of 1547, reeditedin 1618 and frequently quoted thereafter.23The most important of these three forms was the duty of inferior magis-trates, that is, the estates of the Empire, to protect their subjects by way oftheir specific liberties enjoyed under the ancient constitution of the Empire(the Golden Bull), as representatives of the people and in particular as measured against the oaths the Emperors had to swear as a condition of election. The second legitimate kind of violence was supposed to be self-defence in narrowly defined cases of emergency. These were spelled out inthe 1532 Imperial code of capital punishment (Constitutio Criminalis Carolina), paragraphs 139–145.24Finally, from the latter part of the 1530s,self-defence came to be acknowledged as a right by law of nature as well, although the boundaries of that right remained ill-defined. When it came to illustrating the legitimacy of self-defence by historic examples, mostcommentators willing to use the concept of defence eschewed pinpointinga specific group in the body politic that might engage in such acts. Rather,they chose examples where a whole people, like the people of Switzerlandin their struggle against Austria or, in later examples, the Dutch in theirstruggle against Spain, had allegedly exerted such a right. During the 1530sto 1547, Germany was understood to be such a body politic under threatfrom foreign powers, most notably the Turks and the Pope. Many pamphletsconflated these alleged threats to a single menace and combined it with spe-cific incidents, such as the alleged massacres of Spanish troops in the siegeof Düren during the 1543 Jülich-Kleve war of succession. In each case, theGerman nation and fatherland and the integrity of its laws were alleged tobe under threat and thus had to be defended. Self-defence by law of naturewas then regularly understood to be a right of the evolving territories withinthe Empire, reconceived as fatherlands of pious believers.25The Bodinian notion of sovereignty, while readily applied to the Empirefrom the 1590s, had to be moulded to adapt it to the reality of the Empire.Thus, even those political theorists who by 1620 had become famous forSelf-Defence in Statutory and Natural Law173"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"their opposing views on the issue, like the Lutheran adherent of absolutismHenning Arnisaeus26and the Calvinist adherent of popular sovereigntyJohannes Althusius,27were effectively prescribing similar measures to belegitimate forms of resistance against tyrannical acts of a supreme magis-trate. Both to Arnisaeus and Althusius, individual self defence was permit-ted in cases of immediate danger to one’s own life and property, providedno legal remedy was available, by law of nature. No prince, said Arnisaeus,had a right to ignore the property of his subjects, to take away the right topetition against breaches of law committed against a person or the right to defend oneself against such breaches.28Both Arnisaeus and Althusiusmake it absolutely clear that subjects must not resist.29Both use the termfatherland to describe a situation where subjects have the duty to take uparms and support the territorial nobilities in defending the fatherland.30Arnisaeus, in his De jure maiestatis, elaborates this defence of the fatherlandin the context of his argument about the relation of lord and vassal. Whilethe vassal is bound to the lord by his oath of allegiance, he must in no casetake up arms against his fatherland to please an unjust lord. The fatherlandis to be preferred to the father and, indeed, to the lord. Once the lord thusattempts to attack the fatherland of the vassal, the vassal must regard hisoath of allegiance to the lord null and void and defend his fatherland evenagainst his lord.31To any German reader, the vassals of Arnisaeus’ argument are easily iden-tified as the princes of the Empire, who still received their fiefdoms fromthe Emperor as their lord and who were indeed bound to him by oaths ofallegiance.32Although in a much more explicit fashion, namely in a chapterof its own devoted to the issue of tyranny and its remedies, Althusius elabo-rated the self-defence of individuals against immediate threats to their livesand property, the rights of the electoral princes as representatives of thepeople to punish a tyrant, and the duty of territorial princes and nobilitiesto rally the subjects against threats to the fatherland.33The constitutionalbackground of the Empire thus allowed Althusius to portray the Emperor asa mere officer of the people without compromising the duty of subjects tounconditional obedience. It allowed Arnisaeus to portray majesty, the rightsof kings, as the undisputed property of the monarch by inheritance, lex regisor conquest with no independent right of the community itself, withoutcompromising the rights of the imperial princes, the vassals of the emperor,to defend their dominium against him if need be.IISir John Eliot’s use of Henning Arnisaeus’ De jure maiestatissignals one ofthe earliest systematic attempts to make use of the arguments developed inthe Empire in order to understand the nature of monarchical power and thetrue basis of the body politic in England. Eliot’s text is a highly abbreviated174Robert von Friedeburg"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"translation of De jure maiestatis, clinging, however, to the structure ofArnisaeus’ argument and keeping to Arnisaeus’ basic organisation of thework in terms of the sequence and title of books and chapters. What is significant are the deviations between Eliot’s abbreviated translation andArnisaeus’ original argument.34Arnisaeus first defined majesty, or sovereignty, as indivisible royal powerbound only by the law of nature and divine law within the commonwealthand inferior to none outside it (Book I, Chapters I and II). Eliot stuck closelywith the original text. Elsewhere, he had agreed that monarchy was the bestform of government.35But he left out Arnisaeus’ uncompromising attack onaristocracy.36Arnisaeus was similarly uncompromising in his insistence thattrue monarchy is free from constraint of written laws. Majesty was ownedbylex regis, inheritance or conquest, which made power over men legal bylaw of nature. To Arnisaeus, the law of nature mainly applied to the rela-tion among peoples and involved the right to war and to possessions byconquest. Slavery could thus be a legitimate way of government over men.Arnisaeus calmed the reader only by promising that princes were rationalbeings and that thus rational behaviour could be expected of them.37Eliottransforms this into ‘Absolute power is that which is not tyed to the neces-sity and coartion of law’, but adds that nevertheless a king was ‘not therebyloose from all direccon of law’.38While Arnisaeus bolsters his point aboutthe rational prince with the medieval lawyer Baldus, Eliot translates Baldusas saying that the king was ‘to govern by Law and Reason & not just by hislust & will’.39This difference in emphasis led into an entire change of argument inEliot’s transformation of Arnisaeus’ account of defence of the ‘fatherland’.Arnisaeus used the concept dealing with the relation of lords and vassals inChapter V. That chapter provided him with a way out of the unconditionalsubmission of subjects to their magistrates – which he did not wish to under-mine by any exceptions – with regard to the relation of the emperor to his(princely) vassals. It allowed Arnisaeus to declare their defence against the emperor lawful by styling it as their duty to defend their fatherland. ToArnisaeus, the oaths of these princes to the Emperor were void in cases ofdanger to their fatherland – that is, the territories they rule – for we owe thefatherland even more respect than we owe our fathers.40Eliot transforms thisinto ‘for noe fidelity by covenant can be so sacred that it should be preferredbefore the piety that is due to one’s countrey . . . And a Vassal may in manycases renounce his lord but a subject may never forsake his countrey whichwe must love above our parents and ourselves’.41But Eliot took Arnisaeus’patria– to Arnisaeus the territory within the Empire – as the realm ofEngland itself. He thus failed to identify Arnisaeus’ patriots and vassals asthe princes of the Empire. Instead of juxtaposing the princes’ feudal privi-leges, rights and duties to their subjects against their oath to the Emperor,Eliot in his translation juxtaposed the possible lack of the binding power ofSelf-Defence in Statutory and Natural Law175"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"an oath of allegiance against the unconditional commitment of everysubject to the welfare of his country – a notion not just alien to Arnisaeus’purpose of argument but directly against the very grain of his argument.Inserting Cicero at this point, Eliot substantially transformed Arnisaeus’argument about the territories as fatherlands within the Empire into a pointon the duties of citizens, a notion carefully avoided by Arnisaeus.42Eliot concluded: ‘The summe of this discourse is this: That a prince whohath majesty is not bound by the decrees of his Antecessors quod iura maies-tatis & statum imperii: but only so far as the publicke good and the laws of god and nature doe require. And a prince must aim at this end in all his acts, that he keep his honour and words, and that the common wealtake noe hurt.’43Where Arnisaeus wrote a blueprint for absolutism – if onlyterritorialabsolutism within the Empire – and thus provided arguments forits defence both against the people and the Emperor, Eliot produced a stoicking checked by the uncompromised obligation of his subjects to put thewelfare of the country before any other obligation, certainly before those oftheir solemn oaths. A door was thus left open to understand the welfare ofthe fatherland as different from that of the king and allow both to wage waron their respective behalf. Deprived of the context of the Empire and itsmany levels of government, the argument for self-defence and for thedefence of fatherland acquired an unprecedented meaning.IIIJus populi vindicatum, written by James Steuart of Goodtrees in 1669 in the aftermath of the Pentland Rising,44has gained a reputation as themost radical covenant publication. Though indebted to the rhetorical deeds and argumentative traditions of earlier Presbyterian pamphlets, this nearly500-page treatise attempted to provide legal and philosophical argument indepth in favour of his case by mounting Althusius’ Politica.45It is, however,difficult to imagine a historical and in particular an intellectual experiencemore different than the Scottish and the German. Scotland lacked the legal tools to sharply distinguish claims for the power of the people fromclaims for the rights of subjects.46The National Covenant of 1638 hadescaped these problems because it declared a state of defence for the wholekingdom.47After 1660, however, Scotland did not as a kingdom defend Presbyterianism. Indeed, the son of the Marquis of Argyle, the 9th Earl ofArgyle, actually asked Edinburgh whether he should help quell an allegedrising of Presbyterian supporters in 1666.48Therefore, support in favour ofthe Pentland rising had to construct a case for defence with the body politicleft out.An earlier pamphlet defending the rising, Naphtali, or the Wrestlings of theChurch of Scotland, for the Kingdom of Christ, did so via a narrative of thestruggle of the church against Antichrist.49It was not meant to engage in176Robert von Friedeburg"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"political theory. Since the 1630s, a state of continuous breach of divine law,along with the accompanying right of self-defence allowed by the law ofnature, was portrayed as having become almost a matter of everyday life.50With no legal remedy or support even by inferior magistrates,51subjects areleft under ‘God’s special ordinance’ expressed in the Covenant52and in subsequent ‘lawful non-obedience’ to the lawbreaking men in office.53Theauthors of Naphtali, the lawyer James Steuart and a Presbyterian minister,had thus stuck with the notion that self-defence by law of nature was to beunderstood as an exception, only viable during short moments in which thecivil law was not accessible, such as during an armed robbery. But due totheir description of Scottish history, such a state of lawlessness had becomea matter of decades, not of hours. They had also taken on board a combi-nation of the practice and rhetoric of bonds against common threats suchas the Armada in 158854and combined them with notions of apocalypticstruggle.55But, most important, the contemporary private law account of self-defence, based on breaches of positive law by inferior magistrates, had beeninflated into self-defence by law of nature without regard for the integrityof order in the body politic. Germany had seen similar arguments in the1530s, and John Ponet and Christopher Goodman had made statementspointing this direction. Ponet even went so far as to remind his readers ofthe Biblical Phineas, who had slain a sinner allegedly without any officewhatsoever. Indeed, in 1531 Johann Wick, an adherent of Luther in Münster,had assumed that a ‘rural people’ (landvolck), in the case where no magis-trate was willing to defend the true faith, could defend itself when left withno other remedy to redress grievances. He had also provided the exampleof the very same Phineas.56Wick, however, had been driven out of Münsterby the Anabaptists. Steuart, by citing Phineas and thus returning to the argu-ments of Wick and Ponet about the alleged lack of any inferior magistrates,had turned back to the state of political theory of over a century earlier. Inthe meantime, Catholics had slain Protestants in France and the events atMünster had cast their shadow over political argument. Bishop Honymanthus rightly condemmed an account with apparently no reflection on acentury of political theory.57BecauseNaphtalihad eschewed caution aboutinflating the issue of self-defence into many men resisting the supreme magistrate, Honyman was able to describe Continental Protestant scholar-ship based on countless quotations from Calvin, Luther, Zwingli and evenfrom Rutherford’s Lex Rex58as unequivocally condemning Naphtali’s case.59He could finish by reminding his readers about a cornerstone of Germanpolitical experience, Münster and the Anabaptists invoking images of totalanarchy: ‘Provoking people to go about meddling with the advancement ofreligion,actibus Imperatis, which is the magistrate’s part, and not only actibuselicitis, is but a ruining of all order God hath set.’60It surrendered this order,Honyman concludes, to ‘Münster madness’.61Self-Defence in Statutory and Natural Law177"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Steuart’s Ius populiresponded to Honyman’s devastating critique by pro-viding an account of society and government in general that was meant tobear out Napthali’s conclusions without taking refuge only in apocalypticimages. The first part (Chapters I–IV) provided an outline of the argument.The next part (Chapters V–VIII) contained the new core of Steuart’s argu-ment. He radically departed from the tone of Naphtaliand attempted sophis-ticated argument on the erection of government, the covenant of men and magistrates, the nature of magisterial power and the ‘people’s safety’ asthe supreme law. It is here that roughly half of all quotations relating tocontemporary political thought in general (39 of 92) and to Althusius inparticular (14 of 27) are to be found. Emerging as the overwhelming primesource for Steuart, Althusius was cited with 27 quotations to 29 references,almost twice the next most often cited source of contemporary thought(Rutherford, with 14). Commanding nearly a third of all such quotations,Althusius was referred to for the sovereignty of the people, the issue of apactum, the right of the people to resist, and magistrates being repre-sentatives of the people. But his understanding of representation, the cor-porate people, order and harmony, ius symbioticumand the unconditionalobedience of subjects save in narrowly described cases of self-defence, wasignored.Steuart made essentially two claims. First, since the Scottish parliamenthad ‘basely betrayed its trust’ and ‘There is no hope, or humaine probabil-ity now left, that ever the people of Scotland shall have a parliament...oftheir inferior judges to resent the injuries, oppression and tyranny’,62the‘Law of nature will allow self defence even to private persons in cases ofnecessity’.63The intent of the participants of the rising could be under-stood as an attempt to submit a petition for grievances. The authorities inEdinburgh, having prevented such submission and then miscarried justice,64could be construed to be inferior magistrates severely breaching positive law.Given that such a breach of law by inferior magistrates could be qualifiedas ‘atrox’ and ‘notorious’, one could argue that at least technically the kindof self-defence provided for by all German accounts, from Althusius toArnisaeus, was indeed what was at stake. Steuart is thus quick to throw theallowing of such self-defence by even the famous arch-absolutist Arnisaeusat Honyman, to defend the Pentland rising and undermine Honyman’scharge of the alleged undermining of all political order by Presbyterians.65Steuart refers to self-defence as allowed against tyrannical actions con-trary to the law of nature. He identifies the King of Spain as a tyrant to hisAmerican slaves and thus in flagrant breach of the law of nature.66ToArnisaeus, however, conquest provided lawfultitle by law of nature, evenfor slavery. Between Steuart and his source, use of the reference to the lawof nature had entirely changed. Steuart thus cited an author supporting theright of self-defence, but transferred that claim into another context by pro-viding examples that his source would not have understood as cases per-178Robert von Friedeburg"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"taining to the issue in question. Metaphors of a woman ‘defending herchastity’ (p. 28) serve both to nourish the rhetoric of self-defence and tokeep the issue in the sphere of cases of self-defence commonly allowed bystatutory law. To Arnisaeus, as to Althusius, self-defence by single subjectswas allowed as an ad hoctool of the official judiciary but never meant to bedirected against the Emperor or princes in the Empire, let alone to be a rightfrom the state of nature. Indeed, already in 1530 Melanchthon and Lutherhad ruled out the application of self-defence by law of nature in respect ofresistance against the Emperor.67Only the distinction of private law self-defence – provided for by the Constitutio Criminalis Carolina, paragraphs139–45 – and the self-defence of fatherland by law of nature allowed Germanpolitical theory to recognise these different kinds of self-defence. ScottishPresbyterians of 1666, however, had not been provided with any court ofappeal. Thus, in the course of Steuart’s argument, a series of cases clearlydistinguished in German thought – the self-defence of the body politic as acorporate whole, the special privileges of the nobility as representatives ofthe people, inferior magistrates acting on behalf of the body politic, and thespecific issue of individual statutory law self-defence – were conflated intoa single issue: self-defence as a right by law of nature.Second, underlying this conflation, the whole Althusian concept of representation and order was dropped. In particular in Chapter VI, ‘On theCovenant betwixt King and People’, Steuart, quoting Althusius, asserts:‘Lawyers and politicians tell us that the King is absolutely bound unto hissubjects, and the people obliged unto the King conditionally.’68Steuart,however, changed this claim to a relationship of mutual conditionality.69Once the supreme magistrate failed to live up to any of the unspecified conditions agreed upon in the Covenant, he immediately ‘falleth from hissovereignty’.70Steuart thus turns the idea of a pact from a device to explainthe right of resistance of inferior magistrates in exceptional circumstancesinto a mutual obligation, by comparing it with indentures between masterand servant.71Accordingly, the notion of ‘tyrant’ becomes inflated as well.Chapter VII rejects the metaphor from body72to depict the relation of magistrate and subjects and instead invokes society as the sum of ‘righteousproprietors of their own goods’. Violation of their property thus marked theborder between lawful monarchy and tyranny.73To support this allegation,Steuart points out that the ‘People of God . . . by Law of Nature are to carefor their owne soul (and) are to defend in their way true religion’.74The‘safety of the People, both in soull and body, their religion, Lives, Liberties,Priviledges, Possessions, Goods and what was deare to them as Christians’,75was depicted as the only supreme law and as a device sufficient to organisethe interaction of men. Men had to be described as capable of such inter-action because though ‘not Kings, Judges, Nobles or in authority’ they were‘God’s creatures created and formed to his owne image and similitude (and)made equal’.76Self-Defence in Statutory and Natural Law179"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"In effect, lack of legal remedy and of devices to distinguish the people assubjects from the representatives of the people and bearers of sovereigntyhad led to a conflation of otherwise clearly separated claims about theapplicability and meaning of self-defence. In the course of Steuart’s argu-ment, the inflated case of emergency in Scottish recent history, his languageof rights, and the lack of representatives had extinguished the distinctionbetween the power springing from the people and the duties of subjects –between the right to self-defence provided to individuals by the civil law and the right to self-defence provided for an entire body politic by lawof nature. The chirurgical isolation and subsequent transferral of some ofAlthusius’ tools to establish magistracy into Steuart’s framework resulted ina new argument on the nature of society in general.IVThe Englishman Sir John Eliot in 1630 and the Scot James Steuart were notalone in 1669 in having trouble coming to terms with concepts borrowedfrom Germany.77In an age that rested on the assumption of the unshakenexistence of hierarchy, no one could argue in favour of resistance, let alonerebellion, and expect others to be persuaded. The religious wars in Europeand the British civil wars, perhaps the last of the former, had taught nothingif not the importance of order.78For that very reason, after a century ofbloodshed, some wanted to purge the language of politics of any ambigu-ous phrases whatsoever.79However, measured against the European background of religious conflictand the truly European nature of certain arguments forged to understand achanging world, it is equally important to recognise just how fundamen-tally different the constitutional context of those conflicts in each politywas, even though those acting within it and attempting to make sense of itunderstood themselves to be on a truly European scene. Because accountsbased on the political experience of the Empire could neatly distinguish therights of princes, the legal protection of subjects against magistrates and theobligations towards fatherlands, arguments for self-defence against tyrantscould also be neatly distinguished in an increasingly systematic manner,leaving out older humanistic arguments on citizenship and instead allottingpositive rights to monarchs, princes and subjects. Within this framework,arguments in favour of sovereignty and self-defence could be mountedwithout compromising the hierarchy of order and subjection. The privilegesof law courts in Germany to defend subjects against breaches of the law werehailed by eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century Germans as the core oftheRechtsstaat.While Constitutional Royalism, as recently studied,80shared many characteristics with accounts from the Empire, the Scottish and English contemporaries of Althusius and Arnisaeus had a much harder time saving180Robert von Friedeburg"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"the constitution and yet allowing self-defence. The English and the Scottishpolity of the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries lacked safeguards against‘inept or deranged monarchs’. Some contemporaries, such as Sir John Eliot,responded by attempting to come to terms with the apparent impossibilityof being good subjects and avoiding conflict with the king. However, theway into the systematic probing of the rights and duties of monarchs andsubjects, demonstrated in academic accounts from the Empire, led – almostunwittingly – into much more controversial and radical accounts in Britain.Notes1.

It is equallywell known that these writers were no supporters of democratic or republi-can ideals. Yet, not uncommonly, their notions of natural equality have beenread as expressions of egalitarian sentiments similar to those that have cometo characterize western political thought since the American and French rev-olutions. To take just one example, in her much cited study, Jean Hamptonspeaks of Hobbes’ ‘egalitarian beliefs’ as principally similar to beliefs thathave later inspired ‘movements designed to achieve political equality forracial minorities and for women’.1While this level of egalitarianism isseldom associated with Pufendorf, his doctrine of natural equality has beenseen as affirming a universal value of humanity that anticipates later doctrines of universal human rights.2This tendency to find early traces ofegalitarianism in Hobbes’ and Pufendorf’s political theories has led somecommentators to accuse them of fraud. Behind this charge has been thebelief that the doctrine of natural liberty and equality was – to cite one well-known prosecutor – ‘the emancipatory doctrine par excellence, promisingthat universal freedom was the principle of the modern era’.3When Hobbesand Pufendorf proceeded to justify authoritarian government, slavery andthe subjection of women by assuming individual attributes and social conditions which made it necessary for people to give their consent to such arrangements, an inherently egalitarian idea was being used for non-egalitarian purposes.In what follows, I will take a different approach to Hobbes’ and Pufendorf’s doctrines of natural equality. Instead of seeing these as early butstill inadequate (or devious) manifestations of egalitarian ideals, I will treatthem as integral elements of their theories of civil sovereignty. The purposeof this historical exercise is not to vindicate Hobbes and Pufendorf in theface of egalitarian critique. It is rather to explore how the notion of equal-ity has not only served as a concept of emancipation in the western tradi-tion of political thought, but has been an important tool of state-building189"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"as well. This is, of course, an old Tocquevillean theme. But whereas Tocqueville saw that behind the emergence of a modern centralized statewas a simple transition from ‘feodal inequality to democratic equality’,4thanks to the egalitarian potential inherent in the Christian religion, thepicture we have today is more complex. The idea of equality was not demo-cratic or egalitarian throughout this historical process. By the time Hobbesand Pufendorf formulated their theories, the idea of human beings as equalby nature already had a long history, starting from Roman law. However,before the seventeenth century, it referred solely to the non-existence ofnatural power relations and said nothing about the respective value ofhuman individuals. Thus, it was commonly used to defend the idea of ahierarchically organised political agent called ‘the people’ against royal abso-lutism. Hobbes’ and Pufendorf’s doctrines of natural equality were formu-lated against this conceptual background. They transformed a notion usedmainly by their political adversaries into a concept which denaturalised pre-vailing civil hierarchies and gave the sovereign new powers over the socialorder. In doing so, they were neither fostering nor betraying some egalitar-ian ideal, but redefining human relations in order to pacify societies tornapart by confessional and constitutional conflicts.IIt has been common to think that Hobbes’s notion of natural equality wasa consequence of his philosophical anthropology, a deduction from ‘hisindividualist and materialist conception of human beings’.5And it is, ofcourse, true that in his three discussions on the natural condition of thehuman species Hobbes presented an individualistic and naturalistic notionof natural equality. In The Elements of Lawhuman beings are equal by naturebecause their physical and intellectual differences do not prevent theweakest or the most stupid from killing the strongest or the most intelli-gent.6InDe civeHobbes added that this shared ability to kill makes humanbeings equal because it is the greatest power a human being can have and‘those who have the greatest power, the power to kill, in fact have equalpower’.7InLeviathanthis argument was not repeated, but the issue wasfurther elaborated by the remark that prudence is based mainly on experi-ence, wherefore the differences in practical wisdom are much smaller thandifferences in physical abilities. And in any case, since all human beings aremore familiar with their own reasoning than that of others, they all thinkthat their practical wisdom is as good as that of anybody else. Therefore, allare inclined to follow their own will rather than another’s.8Hobbes’ notion of natural equality was thus quite compatible with hisanthropology. Yet it was not deduced from it. For Hobbes did not deny thatone individual may be ‘manifestly stronger in body, or of quicker mind thananother’.9And nothing in his anthropology would have prevented him from190Kari Saastamoinen"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"saying that even though human beings are obviously unequal in their phys-ical and intellectual abilities, they are still capable of killing each other andinclined to think that they are as prudent as anybody else. Therefore, nonatural power relations exist between them and they tend to follow theirown will. When Hobbes said that these features make human beings equalby nature, he was not exploring the logical consequence of his anthropol-ogy. He was redefining a concept that was already widely used and politi-cally influential.This aspect of Hobbes’ theory has been somewhat obscured by the fact that he presented his doctrine of natural equality as refutation of theAristotelian idea according to which ‘some men are by nature worthy togovern’, while ‘others by nature ought to serve’.10This easily gives theimpression that all his adversaries rejected the idea of natural equality. Yetthe idea that human beings are equal by nature was neither novel nor rareat the time Hobbes wrote. In the first chapter of his Patriarcha, composedperhaps already in the 1620s, the royalist Robert Filmer lamented that therewas a common opinion among theologians and other learned men thathuman beings are by nature free and equal.11This idea was a commonplaceboth in scholastic theories of natural law and in early modern theories ofpopular sovereignty. It was widely known from sixteenth-century Protestantresistance theories and also from the more scholarly writings of FranciscoSuárez and Johannes Althusius.In all theories of popular sovereignty, the role of the notion of naturalequality was much the same. It indicated that by natural law no individualhad coercive power over another. This meant that when human beings hadgathered into larger societies, coercive power had first belonged to the com-munity as a whole and only thereafter been delegated to the king. Conse-quently, in one way or another, the power of the king was dependent onthe will of the people. By ‘the people’, however, these writers did not referto a congregation of equal individuals with similar rights. For them, thepeople were a hierarchical corporation where individuals had different rightsand duties according to their place or status in the society. The people were,in Ernst Kossmann’s words, ‘a structured set of interrelationships with a his-torical identity’ which the king was not allowed to alter. As political agent,the people included principally ‘a network of ancient institutions, of coun-cils, parliaments, colleges and estates, and secondarily, those who had placein them’.12The people were, then, clearly distinguished from the multitude,the latter regarded as incapable of formulating a common will.By maintaining that human beings are equal by nature, early modern theorists of popular sovereignty were not contradicting their hierarchicalidea of the people. This was so because their notion of natural equality, inherited from Roman law,13referred exclusively to the non-existence ofnatural power relations, saying nothing about the respective value of humanindividuals. A good example is Althusius’s Politica methodice digesta, origi-Hobbes and Pufendorf on Natural Equality and Civil Sovereignty191"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"nally published in 1603 and read all over Protestant Europe. Referring to Justinian’s Digest, Althusius declared that by natural law all human beingswere equal and under the jurisdiction of no one, unless they gave theirconsent to someone’s authority.14This did not prevent Althusius from maintaining that some human beings were better than others according their ability to help others,15and that these differences served as the basis of power relations. For it was natural that in every society there were superiors and inferiors. And since some were superior in their capacity tohelp others, it was natural that the less able consented to the power of theformer. A husband, for example, was better equipped to help his wife thanthe wife to help her husband. Consequently, it was natural for the wife toconsent to the authority of the husband. More generally, it was ‘inborn tothe more powerful and prudent to dominate and rule weaker men’, just asit was ‘inborn for inferiors to submit’.16These differences also determinedthe worth and status of each man in the society, creating an order accord-ing to which rights, liberties and honours were to be distributed to eachcitizen.17On this basis, Althusius constructed a highly hierarchical idea ofthe people, remarking that if human beings were equal in civil life, ‘discordwould easily arise, and by discord dissolution of the society’.18The politicalsignificance of the doctrine of natural equality was that the highest powerhad been created by the consent of the people. In this case, to give consentdid not entail surrendering sovereignty. The people were better equipped tohelp the king than the king to help the people, hence sovereignty remainedin the people.In pre-Civil War England the notion of natural equality was used in a roughly similar manner to oppose royal absolutist aspirations and to justify the independence of the Parliament as representative of the people.19During the Civil War, Robert Filmer criticised such a practice by offering ananarchistic account of natural equality. In The Anarchy of a Limited or MixedMonarchyFilmer observed that if human beings really were equal by nature,sovereignty must belong equally to each human being, women, servants,the poor and even children included. Consequently, it will ‘prove a mereimpossibility ever lawfully to introduce any kind of government whatsoeverwithout apparent wrong to a multitude of people’.20Filmer, of course, presented such a conclusion as a reductio ad absurdum,aiming to demonstrate the superiority of his patriarchal political doctrinebased on biblical evidence. While Hobbes shared Filmer’s distaste for theories of popular sovereignty, he did not think that in a culture rent byreligious fanaticism one could establish a stable political order on biblicalauthority alone. Instead, he redefined commonly used juridical notions ina way that made them compatible with his anthropology and suitable fordefending his ideal state.In the case of natural equality, Hobbes’ redefinition involved two steps.The first was the naturalistic definition of natural equality in his discussionof the state of nature. This retained the conventional meaning of the term192Kari Saastamoinen"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"in so far as it referred to the non-existence of natural power relations. Whatwas new was the reason for this non-existence: now it was not natural lawbut the physical and mental characteristics of human beings. This notionof natural equality played a central role in Hobbes’ demonstration that thenatural condition of the human species is that of war. In this way, Hobbesassociated natural equality with the idea that there could be no politicalagent called the people prior to the establishment of sovereignty.21His nat-uralistic interpretation also made this notion of natural equality incapableof legitimating political resistance. For unlike natural equality based onnatural law, it did not indicate a moral obligation to respect the autonomyof other human beings. Consent achieved by force was as legitimate a foun-dation for domination as consent given for some other reason.22This meantthat existing domination could always be interpreted as a sign of consentalready given.If the notion of natural equality used in the discussion of the state ofnature was conventional in that it said nothing about the value of humanindividuals, the second step in Hobbes’ redefinition gave natural equality a meaning unprecedented in the theories of popular sovereignty or earliertheories of natural law. Approaching natural law in terms of the principlesneeded to maintain peace, Hobbes declared that to achieve this end themembers of the commonwealth must regard each other as equal by nature.More precisely, they must acknowledge that ‘the question who is a betterman has no place’ in the civil state where determination of their value isdependent on the sovereign.23In other words, they must recognise eachother as equally valuable by nature. This was no longer a naturalistic notionof natural equality, but a social institution created by the fact that no citizencould demand for himself rights which he was not ready to grant others.24It was motivated by the wish to maintain peace with those whom one is not able to subdue, and was made necessary by the vanity of humannature. Inclined to regard themselves at least as valuable as anybody else,human beings also wanted others to value them as they valued themselves.If they felt insufficiently appreciated by others, they were inclined to usewhatever means to get the respect they felt they deserved.25This belligerenttendency could be pacified only if the members of the commonwealthrecognised that all differences of value among them are dependent on thesovereign.The mutual recognition of natural equality, it should be noted, did notmean that one had to regard every citizen as an autonomous individualcapable of thinking independently what is best for him. Hobbes did not hes-itate to describe the minds of the common people as a clean sheet on whichthose who attained an authoritative position could write whatever opinionsthey liked.26The recognition did mean, however, that the sovereign was freeto mould civil hierarchies at will. Yet the same human vanity that madesuch recognition necessary also imposed two rules of equity, which the sov-ereign should follow in governing the state. The first one was to administerHobbes and Pufendorf on Natural Equality and Civil Sovereignty193"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"justice equally so that when ‘the rich and the mighty’ do some injury to‘the meaner sort’, they have no greater hope of impunity than when ‘poorand obscure persons’ commit crimes against mightier ones.27The secondrule was to levy taxes equally, preferably on consumption. If the sovereignfailed to do so, the citizens had, of course, no right to resist, although inthis case their complaints about the sovereign’s behaviour were ‘justified’.28The natural law of equity undoubtedly brought an element of civil equal-ity into the Hobbesian state. One should, however, be cautious in seeing itas a manifestation of ‘egalitarian beliefs’. The reason why the sovereignshould follow the rules of equity is not that if he fails to do so, he disre-spects the natural equality of his citizens. The principal task of the sover-eign is the safety of the people,29and by violating the rules of equity he is,given human nature, bound to cause civil disturbance. If ‘the great’ are notpunished for their crimes, this causes insolence and hatred in other citizens,which eventually leads to ‘an Endeavour to pull down all oppressing andcontumelious greatnesse, though with the ruine of the Common-wealth’.30Unequal taxation, in turn, will cause civil unrest, because the poor always‘shift the blame from their own idleness and extravagance onto the gov-ernment and the commonwealth’, claiming that ‘they are oppressed andexhausted by taxes’. The true reason for their irritation is not, however, thetax burden itself but the fact that taxes are often levied unequally. For a taxbecomes not only heavier but also more intolerable ‘when many wriggle outof it’, as exemplified by the fact that the most bitter of civil struggles arethose about tax exemptions. Hobbes believed that if taxes were levied onlyon consumption, people would not feel unequally taxed – in fact, theywould hardly notice taxation at all.31In Hobbes’ opinion, the administration of justice and taxation were issuesin which the sovereign had to follow equity, if he wanted to keep his sub-jects peaceful. Keeping the peace did not, however, require him to avoidvalue hierarchies within civil society. On the contrary, hierarchies of honourare necessary for the maintenance of civil peace. This is so because ‘ambi-tion and longing for honours cannot be removed from men’s minds’, andit will cause endless quarrels and factions within the civil society unless thesovereign takes care that there are ‘Laws of Honour’ and ‘a public rate ofworth for such men who deserve the respect of the Commonwealth’.32Hobbes knew well that there were countries where titles of nobility wereattached to considerable legal privileges and tax immunities, but his remarkson equity seem to indicate that the sovereign should avoid such arrange-ments. However, even if the nobility had nothing but their titles of honourto distinguish them from the common people, this did not mean that theywere without special powers in civil life. To be sure, Hobbes’s comments onthis issue were somewhat confused. In Leviathan, discussing power, he firstremarked that ‘nobility is power’ only in those commonwealths where thenobility ‘has Priviledges: for in such priviledges consisteth their Power’.33194Kari Saastamoinen"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Yet a little later he wrote that titles of honour ‘are Honourable’ because theysignify ‘the value set upon them by the Sovereign Power of the Common-wealth’.34They are ‘signs of favour in the Common-wealth’, and this favour,Hobbes was now ready to admit, ‘is Power’.35If this was Hobbes’ final position, he would have agreed with Abbé deSiéyès who, in his Essai sur les privilègeswritten in 1788 just before the Revolution, criticized the suggestion that the nobility could retain its titlesof honour after being stripped of its privileges. In Siéyès’s opinion, this wasunthinkable, because such titles would have a powerful influence on sociallife. They would make honour dependent on the favour of the king, not on the ‘free esteem’ of the people. As a consequence, honours would go tointriguers in the court, not to the worthiest servants of the public. More-over, since the titles of nobility were permanent and inherited, the publiccould not withdraw honours that their possessors no longer deserved. As aresult, royal titles of honour would destroy whatever positive effects thehuman desire for esteem had on social life.36Hobbes was, of course, unfamiliar with a notion of the public as Siéyèsknew it, but he understood that royal titles of honour alone created realhierarchies within society. For Hobbes, however, such hierarchies had a positive effect on civil life. In his eyes, human desire for esteem and honourwas a mainly negative force in civil life, as people tended to desire andhonour things they regarded as signs of exceptional power irrespective ofwhether these were just or unjust.37It was only proper, therefore, that thesovereign should control and pacify this desire by granting signs of hisfavour. While aristocrats may have found such a theory of the nobilityinsulting, it expressed an attitude to social hierarchies quite different fromSiéyès’s unqualified condemnation of all royal titles of honour.IIHobbes transformed a notion of natural equality into a tool of state-build-ing in two ways: first, by giving the non-existence of natural power relationsa naturalistic explanation; and, second, by maintaining that in order to keeppeace, citizens must recognise that they are equally valuable by nature. Thissecond aspect of Hobbes’ doctrine was picked up when Pufendorf formu-lated the natural law groundwork for his theory of the state. Responding tothe constitutional situation in the Holy Roman Empire after the Peace ofWestphalia, Pufendorf saw that the Empire with its complex institutionalstructures was an ‘irregular state’, one that could not be characterised by anyof the three traditional forms of state. This pejorative view took its meaningfrom the idea of a state that was ‘regular’ in that its sovereignty was undi-vided. Persuaded that the Empire could not be transformed into a regularstate, Pufendorf supported the alternative idea of the Empire as a mere confederation of sovereign states.38Hobbes and Pufendorf on Natural Equality and Civil Sovereignty195"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"While firmly rejecting Hobbes’ naturalism, Pufendorf followed Hobbes in rejecting the traditional idea of natural equality, claiming instead thatnatural law requires a natural equality of value to be recognised. However,whereas in Hobbes’ theory such recognition was restricted to the membersof one’s own commonwealth and motivated by the wish to maintain peacewith those whom one cannot permanently subdue, Pufendorf maintainedthat there was a categorical moral duty to recognise that all human beingshave by nature similar rights and duties.Following the general scheme of his moral science, Pufendorf proved theexistence of this duty by demonstrating that it is required by the first prin-ciple of natural law: the divinely imposed duty to promote peaceful social-ity among human beings.39Echoing Hobbes, he based his argument on thehuman desire to be esteemed by others. All human beings have a delicatesense of their own value which makes them most disturbed if they feel thatthey are not sufficiently appreciated by others. Several factors can intensifythis self-esteem, but its main support is human nature itself, i.e. the aware-ness of being a human being. This is exemplified by the fact that the word‘human’ is generally felt to denote a certain dignity, such that the mosttelling reply to someone’s insult is that one is neither beast nor dog, butevery bit as much a human being as the other person. And since the senseof being a human is shared by all human beings, nobody is able to live onpeaceful terms with a person who does not regard him or her as a fellowhuman being. It follows that natural law commands everybody ‘to esteemand treat another man as his equal by nature, or as much as a humanbeing’.40Pufendorf emphasised that the duty to recognise the equal humanity ofothers is not fulfilled merely by admitting that all are capable of killing oneanother. One also has to recognise a universally shared equality of right (ius).This one does by acknowledging that the obligation to cultivate socialitywith others ‘lies in all men equally’ and that greater gifts of mind and bodygive no one a right to inflict injuries on those with lesser abilities.41Fromthis follows the equality of power or liberty, which means that every humanbeing is by nature ‘a governor of his actions’ and that no one has powerover another, prior to some agreement.42At first sight, Pufendorf’s universal duty to recognise a moral equality ofall human beings appears more egalitarian than Hobbes’ civil duty to regardother male citizens as equally valuable by nature. It seems to give moral pro-tection to individual autonomy by denying the possibility that legitimatepower relations could be based on consent achieved by use of force.43Thisimpression is, however, based on two assumptions which are usually takenfor granted in modern contractual thought but which Pufendorf did notshare.First, in Pufendorf’s theory, the recognition of natural equality is not thestarting point of political philosophy. It is derived from and subordinated196Kari Saastamoinen"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"to the more fundamental duty to maintain sociality among human beings,based on God’s command to preserve the human species.44The duty topromote sociality, in turn, requires human beings to take care for their ownpreservation.45In consequence, all considerations of natural equality aresubordinated to the fact that human beings have a natural duty to give theirconsent to such power relations as are necessary for their survival.Second, the duty to recognise natural equality does not mean that onehas to regard every adult as an autonomous individual capable of decidingindependently what is in his or her best interests. Pufendorf criticisedHobbes for maintaining that the differences in the practical wisdom ofhuman individuals are smaller than the differences in their physical abili-ties. It is obvious that some individuals are by birth far more prudent thanothers and that ‘experience fails to compensate for others’ dullness’.46Someindividuals are, in fact, so incapable of taking care of themselves that whenthey live as slaves of someone more prudent, ‘they have found a status suitable to their mental equipment’.47And even those who do not need this kind of daily guidance usually fail to understand how existing powerrelations serve their survival and well being. The unlearned majority of malehouseholders do not ‘understand the nature of civil society’, and even thosewho do are often ‘ignorant of its advantages’.48Consequently, they easilyregard all forms of political subordination as an unnecessary burden. Thewomen, in turn, are tormented by a powerful desire to rule and find theirdomestic subordination so repulsive that Pufendorf is ready to characterisetheir sufferings (though not patriarchal power itself) as God’s special pun-ishment for the sins of Eve.49In Pufendorf’s eyes, the foregoing meant that if the legitimacy of powerrelations were dependent on a conscious approval given by each individual,the result would be anarchy and war. Therefore, such an idea was againstnatural law. This is not to say that he was merely repeating Althusius’s idea,according to which it is natural for the less talented to accept the authorityof the more able. The message of Pufendorf’s doctrine of natural equalitywas that only such power relations are justified as men and women with aproper understanding of the requirements of their survival and safety wouldconsent to. In a culture that propagates individual autonomy as the highestmoral and political value, such an understanding of equality might easilyappear fraudulent. But seventeenth-century Europe was not such a culture.With his notion of natural equality Pufendorf was not appealing to somewidely shared egalitarian sentiment, only then to betray it. Like Hobbes, hewas redefining a notion that still most often said nothing about the rightsand value of human individuals. And like Hobbes, he was doing this in orderto define human relations in a way that gave the sovereign new powers overthe social order.In this respect, the consequences of Pufendorf’s moral idea of naturalequality went even further than Hobbes’ naturalistic conception. FollowingHobbes and Pufendorf on Natural Equality and Civil Sovereignty197"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Hobbes, he declared that the only authority rational male householders wereready to accept was a sovereign who protected them from each other andoutsiders.50This meant that there could be no hierarchically organised corporation called the people prior to and independently of the sovereign.Pufendorf did not, however, rest content with this Hobbesian conclusion.Natural equality also meant that the principal aspect of sovereignty, theright to use capital punishment, did not exist before sovereignty was estab-lished. On this issue, Pufendorf attacked especially Hugo Grotius, who hadmaintained that natural law did not specify as to who is entitled to imposea punishment. All morally decent people had the right, if needed, to punishby execution a person who had seriously violated the moral law.51Pufendorfdid not deny that in the state of nature the right of war included not onlythe right of violent self-defence but also a right to kill an offender whorefuses to compensate the injuries he or she has caused. Such a rightbelonged, however, only to the injured party. Those who had not been vio-lated had no right to inflict harm on the offender in order to protect peace.This was the right to punish in the strict sense of the term. It did not existin the state of nature, but was created simultaneously with sovereignty and,as such, can be practised only by the sovereign and his officers within thecivil society.52Pufendorf may have had several reasons to make this claim.53What isinteresting is that his argument against the natural right to punish appealedto the natural equality of human beings. He pointed out that there is some-thing harsh and hard in the penalty itself, as ‘human beings voluntarilyundertake to afflict and destroy their fellows’.54This is not a problem whena sovereign in the civil society imposed punishments. For in this case themembers of civil society have made one person or assembly their superiorwith the authority to protect their safety by punishing those who disobeyhis orders. The situation is different in the state of nature, i.e. among equals.For human beings are no more allowed to punish their equals than they areallowed to impose laws upon them.55And it is contrary to natural equalityto push oneself forward, unasked, as the arbiter of human affairs.56Here,Pufendorf relied on a conceptual link between the right to punish and sov-ereignty: to punish is to act as a sovereign. When one punishes one’s equal,one puts oneself into the position of a sovereign without any authorisationfrom other people. Grotius had attempted to avoid this problem by main-taining that when a person violates the law, it makes all morally decenthuman beings his or her superiors.57To this Pufendorf answered that crimesdo not decrease the dignity of human beings to a degree that they shouldbe classed as mere animals and all decent people their natural superiors.58Of itself, the duty to promote sociality gives no one a right to kill such aperson as punishment.Besides making the sovereign the sole possible possessor of the right topunish, recognition of natural equality also affected the internal structure198Kari Saastamoinen"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"of civil society. Pufendorf did not think, however, that keeping peacerequired rules of equity quite as strict as those proposed by Hobbes. EchoingHobbes, he declared that ‘those who readily allow all men what they allowthemselves are best fitted for society’, wherefore no one should ‘require forhimself more than he allows others’. A person may, however, demand morefor himself if ‘he has acquired some special right to do so’.59Such rights are granted by the sovereign, who creates ‘a decorous order’ within the civil society by giving some citizens high offices and titles of nobility.60Moreover, while the sovereign has a duty to administer justice so that ‘theseverity of laws’ is ‘meted out not alone upon citizens of little means, butalso upon the rich and powerful’, this does not mean that distinctions ofrank and dignity should be completely forgotten in court. It merely indi-cates that these distinctions should not ‘be so influential that the more powerful can insult the less fortunate at their pleasure’.61Similarly, whilethe sovereign has a duty to take care that taxes are ‘justly proportioned’, this does not indicate that there should be no tax immunities. It only means that such immunities should not be granted with the result that other citizens are ‘defrauded and overburdened’.62Unlike Hobbes, Pufendorf did not think that the value of human beingswithin the civil society should or could be totally dependent on the sover-eign. Besides the ‘artificial reputation’ created by the sovereign, every citizenhad a ‘natural reputation’ which followed from his inclination or disincli-nation to obey the rules of sociality and his capacity for laudable actionsthat distinguished him from other citizens. In Pufendorf’s opinion, the sov-ereign was wise to take such a reputation into account in the distributionof public honours and offices. Pufendorf was not, however, ready to grantthis ‘public esteem’ any larger political significance. In the end, natural rep-utation did not alter the natural equality of citizens and the sovereign wasfree to do as he pleased. If it happened that a person whom some regardedas unworthy was raised above his betters, those who protested had to bepunished for showing contempt of the sovereign power.63Just as natural equality made the sovereign independent of natural repu-tation, it also gave him a right to control the nobility. Titles of nobilityunconnected to civil offices were to be taken away only as a punishment,but privileges and immunities annexed to these titles could be cancelled by the sovereign whenever he thought that the condition of the state sorequired.64The sovereign was also perfectly free to appoint commoners toimportant offices, if he regarded them as suited to the job. If the sovereignbecame so dependent on one social class that he could not take gifted menfrom all classes in his service, this was a sure sign that the state was in badcondition. If, for example, a king was forced to favour the nobility becausehe needed them to restrain his people, he had become a participant in aconspiracy with one part of his subjects against the others. In this case, hispower no longer depended on visible authority but on ‘cunning design’.65Hobbes and Pufendorf on Natural Equality and Civil Sovereignty199"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"IIIIn their accounts of natural equality, Hobbes and Pufendorf transformed anotion used to resist absolutism into a tool of state-building. This they didby maintaining that natural law requires that all citizens (Hobbes) or allhuman beings (Pufendorf ) recognise mutually that they by nature possessequal rights and duties. In the seventeenth century, one feature of such arecognition was striking: it was given irrespective of people’s religious con-fession. This feature did not, however, follow from the doctrine of naturalequality alone. While neither Hobbes nor Pufendorf championed a multi-confessional state, their accounts of natural equality presupposed people for whom the Christian religion as such created no power relations amonghuman beings. Such an idea was clearly more in accordance with Luther’sZwei-Reiche-Lehrethan with Catholic doctrine, but it generated resistancewithin Reformed churches too. Hobbes attempted to persuade his readers toaccept it by offering a complicated Bible interpretation which gave theKingdom of God a historical existence, but insisted that Christ’s mission onearth had no political function whatsoever.66Pufendorf chose a simplerLutheran route, maintaining that God’s spiritual kingdom, i.e. the Church,was a ‘mystical body’ that included no coercive power but was united solelyby the Word.67Therefore, the Bible concentrated on moulding the souls ofChristians and said little about the rules that should govern God’s worldlykingdom, leaving this to natural reason.68For Hobbes and Pufendorf, those who accepted such a distinction shouldrecognise that other citizens or all human beings had by nature the samerights and duties as themselves, irrespective of their social position. Thisrecognition derived from and was subordinated to the requirements of peaceand security. It did not rely on some value associated with humanity as such;nor did it include the idea that the others were beings capable of knowingand thus entitled to decide what was in their own best interests. The mainresult of such recognition was a state in which the sovereign was free tomould the civil order for the sake and purpose of civil peace.For people who live in modern western democracies, it is difficult to graspprecisely the character of an equality of this sort. This is so, first, becausethe older notion of natural equality that referred solely to the non-existenceof natural power relations has long since disappeared from common usage.Second, in modern democracies equality is so strongly identified with equalcivil rights. It is not seen as something which the citizens should mutuallyrecognise in order to keep peace, but as a fundamental moral feature ofhuman social existence which the state should recognise and sustain in itsinstitutions. Something resembling this idea of equality was present in theseventeenth century,69but it gained more strength when the modern statewas better established and not constantly threatened by traditional powernetworks and religious conflicts. It may well be, as a Tocquevillean of today200Kari Saastamoinen"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"has suggested, that the state as articulated by writers like Hobbes andPufendorf unknowingly assisted the breakthrough of this modern egalitari-anism.

But sincethe sovereignty of states is the principle governing their mutualrelations, they exist to that extent in a state of nature in relation toone another.(G. W. F. Hegel, Elements of the Philosophy of Right, §333)Current political affairs quite clearly demonstrate that the whole notion ofinternational law still finds its limits in the assumption of state sovereignty.1Hobbes’ theory of the state of nature provides a crucial starting point forlooking into these puzzling issues since he himself had claimed ‘concerningthe Offices of one Souveraign to another, which are comprehended in thatLaw, which is commonly called the Law of Nations, I need not say any thingin this place; because the Law of Nations, and the Law of Nature, is the samething’.2It is too easy to dismiss this assertion as proof that Hobbes was notreally bothered by the question of international law.3I will approach thisissue in two distinct stages.In section I a systematic comparison with Kant’s theory of sovereignty andinternational law will reveal striking similarities with Hobbes’ own theory,and in section II a brief discussion of how most natural law theorists also departed from Hobbes’ assumption quoted above, will provide a widerframework. My argument claims no less than that Hobbes was the first theorist to address the paradoxical relationship between sovereignty andinternational law. In my concluding remarks (section III), a brief outline of contemporary thought on this relationship will reveal the need to recon-sider international relations in connection with the problem of legitimatesovereign power. Thus Hobbes’ insights are of continuing relevance to ourown current political debates.IHobbes’ assumption that the state of nature is the same thing as the rela-tionship between sovereign states provides the obvious starting point for my204"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"discussion of natural law and sovereignty with regard to international rela-tions. Hobbes’ well-known argument is that to overcome the potentialthreats and structural conflicts of the state of nature there must be a socialcontract for the creation of a sovereign authority. Only under the frame-work of a legitimate sovereign power is the existence of right secure and possible. Therefore, only by the creation of a civil commonwealth can theantinomy of conflicting rights be resolved. This line of argument provedfundamental for all future considerations of sovereignty and right. But sinceit proves more difficult to adopt as far as international relations are con-cerned, one has to look for an alternative.A closer consideration of the Hobbesian theory of the state of naturereveals that there already exists within it a means which could help usunderstand the potential conflicts of international relations. Since potentialconflicts among nations can be carried out only by reference to force becauseof the lack of any independent superior authority, the structural conflictamong states is indeed to be considered as analogous to the state of nature.Therefore, it also holds true for the relationship between states, that themost frequent reason why they ‘desire to hurt each other, ariseth hence, thatmany. . . at the same time have an Appetite to the same thing; which yetvery often they can neither enjoy in common, nor yet divide it; whence itfollows that the strongest must have it, and who is strongest must be decidedby the Sword’.4This potential conflict is aggravated by the fact that everystate needs to will to hurt others.Just like every man in the state of nature, so too is every state ‘allowed aRight to use all the means, and do all the actions’ for its self-preservation.5Thedecision as to what constitutes the appropriate employment of any meansalso lies in the discretion of each state, since ‘he himself, by the right [of]nature, must bejudg’.6Thus states have a right to everything (ius in omnia)‘but it was the least benefit for [them] . . . to have a common right to allthings; for the effects of this right are the same, almost, as if there had been no right at all; for although any . . . might say of every thing, this ismine, yet could he not enjoy it, by reason of his Neighbour, who havingequall right, and equall power, would pretend the same thing to be his’.7Unlimited liberty therefore makes it impossible to enjoy liberty safely.This brief sketch of the Hobbesian state of nature demonstrates quiteclearly that it is applicable to the situation of international relations.However, the analogy between the state of nature and international rela-tions employed by Hobbes himself, finds its limits in various aspects. Onecrucial disanalogy certainly is the potentially equal power of man in thestate of nature which does not correspond with the relationship betweenstates. Hobbes points to yet another difference in Leviathan, where he states,‘in all times, Kings, and Persons of Soveraigne authority, because of theirIndependency, are in continuall jealousies, and in the state and posture ofGladiators; having their weapons pointing, and their eyes fixed on oneNatural Law, Sovereignty and International Law205"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"another...But because they uphold thereby, the industry of their Subjects;there does not follow from it, that misery, which accompanies the Libertyof particular men.’8If Hobbes equates the state of nature with the relationship between states,then this can also be interpreted as saying that the commands of rightreason, which conduct man in the state of nature, are equally applicable tointernational affairs. Since Hobbes believed that the commands of rightreason alone were not necessarily enough to guarantee the rule of law andtherefore peace, he consequently argued for sovereign state power in orderto enforce law. The leges naturalesare, however, the basis and foundation forany further consideration of sovereign power and the problems attached toit, whether on the internal state level or on the level of sovereign states andtheir interrelationship.Like the preliminary articles of Kant’s Perpetual Peace, Hobbes’ leges natu-ralescan be seen as necessary preconditions for any rightful order of inter-national relations. Although Hobbes was not concerned with discussing inany more detail how the lawless relationship of states might be overcome,it is an intriguing task to assess how far the leges naturales can be applied tothe case of the community of states. Hobbes defined ‘the Law of Nature...[as] the Dictate of right Reason, conversant about those things which areeither to be done, or omitted for the constant preservation of Life, andMembers’.9These natural laws prescribe the objective conditions underwhich it becomes possiblefor a legal order to be established, though theseconditions alone are not sufficient to guarantee such, since natural laws are not enforceable, and their validity depends wholly on the reasonableinsight and voluntary adherence of the involved parties.10One should notunderestimate the importance of natural laws as a means of regulating inter-national relations, although Hobbes’ shrewd theory of sovereignty mighttempt one to do so.The key principle from Hobbes, to which almost all subsequent naturallaw theorists – from Hugo Grotius to Emer de Vattel – referred, reads: ‘thenatural lawmay be divided into that of Men, which alone hath obtained thetitle of Law of nature, and that of Cities[i.e. states], which may be called thatof Nations, but vulgarly is termed the Right of Nations. The precepts of bothare alike.’11This assertion makes it sufficiently clear that Hobbes also appliesthe laws of nature to the interrelationship of states. Since ‘the first and fundamentall Law of Nature is, That peace is to be sought after where it maybe found; and where not, there to provide our selves for helps of War’,12it is quiteobvious that this is also crucial for international relations. Although rightreason demands the pursuit of peace, the more important interest of self-preservation demands that peace should not be aspired to at any cost. Herewe have to consider two fundamental aspects of Hobbes’ doctrine. First, thelaw of nature demands our disposition towards peace at any time and is thusbinding in foro interno. But second, we are not required to act according to206Peter Schröder"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"our disposition for aspiring to peace, if we have reason to believe that weprocure our ‘own certain ruin’13because our counterparts will not act accord-ing to the laws of nature. Thus the outcome of this situation is still unsta-ble since, although every man ought to realise that peace would be in hisown and everybody else’s interest, the only security available is to rely onthe reasonableness of others, and it remains therefore unpredictable whetheror not one will reach a peaceful settlement.In order to reduce this instability, Hobbes derives further natural laws from this fundamental law of peace-seeking (pacem esse quaerendam), whichdemands ‘That the right of all . . . to all things, ought not to be retain’d but thatsome certain rights ought to be transferr’d or relinquisht’.14In the sphere of inter-national relations this claim would imply at least a partial limitation of the sovereign rights of each state. It is at this very point that Kant beginshis reasoning in Perpetual Peace and thus develops further Hobbes’ theory.Since Kant maintains in addition that ‘all right . . . depends upon laws’,15headopts the rigorous Hobbesian concept of interdependence between rightand sovereignty. Right, therefore, is dependent on sovereignty, because thelatter is seen as the way ‘by which what belongs to each can be determinedfor him and secured against encroachment by any other’.16This rigorousconcept of right and its dependence on sovereignty does not work on the level of international right, where the two are necessarily mutuallyexclusive.17Kant highlighted the fundamental importance of the Hobbesian conceptof the state of nature as the starting point of any reasoning about libertyand sovereignty:It is not experience from which we learn of the maxim of violence inhuman beings and of their malevolent tendency to attack one anotherbefore external legislation endowed with power appears, thus it is notsome deed that makes coercion through public law necessary. On the con-trary, however well disposed and law-abiding human beings might be, itstill lies a priori in the rational idea of such a condition (one that is notrightful) that, before a public lawful condition is established, individualhuman beings, peoples and states can never be secure against violencefrom one another, since each has its own right to do what seems right andgood to itand not to be dependent upon another’s opinion about this.So, unless it wants to renounce any concepts of right, the first thing ithas to resolve upon is the principle that it must leave the state of nature,in which each follows its own judgement, unite itself with all others (withwhich it cannot avoid interacting), subject itself to a public lawful exter-nal coercion, and so enter into a condition in which what is to be rec-ognized as belonging to it is determined by law and is allotted to it byadequatepower(not its own but an external power); that is, it ought aboveall else to enter a civil condition.18Natural Law, Sovereignty and International Law207"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Thus it becomes clear that international law is closely tied in with the sov-ereignty of the state; and, as long as the consequent step of establishing asovereign arbiter over the various nations is not implemented, the remedyprovided by the natural laws must necessarily remain deficient. Given theoutline of Hobbes’ ideas, I will now endeavour to show how these are closelyrelated to Kant’s reflections on international law.Kant starts his argument from Hobbes’ premise of the paradoxical ius inomnia: ‘Nations, as states, can be appraised as individuals, who in theirnatural condition (that is, in their independence from external law) alreadywrong one another by being near one another; and each of them, for thesake of its security, can and ought to require the others to enter with it intoa constitution similar to a civil constitution, in which each can be assuredof its right.’19But Kant restricts this assessment in the following passages,because ‘what holds in accordance with natural right for human beings ina lawless condition . . . cannot hold for states in accordance with the rightof nations (since, as states, they already have a rightful constitution inter-nally and hence have outgrown the constraint of others to bring them undera more extended law-governed constitution in accordance with their con-cepts of right)’.20Hence for Kant sovereignty of states excludes a straightforward solutionto the problem of latent and potential conflicts among nations by means ofa superior sovereign power. This point of view is even more Hobbesian thanKantian, and it only remains for Kant to conclude that ‘war is, after all, onlythe regrettable expedient for asserting one’s right by force in a state of nature(where there is no court that could judge with rightful force); in it neitherof the two parties can be declared an unjust enemy (since that already pre-supposes a judicial decision), but instead the outcomeof the war. . . decideson whose side the right is’.21Thus Kant too had to face the dilemma thatany effective international law reaches its limit precisely at the crucial pointwhere sovereign states are not prepared to resign their own authority infavour of a superior international one.Of course, the significant difference between Hobbes and Kant appears tobe that the latter explicitly tackles the problems concerned with interna-tional relations, whereas the former only implicitly engages with the issue.While Kant also endeavours to elaborate a consistent theory of right for thesphere of international relations, Hobbes restricts himself to the insight thatthe structures of the potential conflicts between men in the state of natureon the one hand and among states on the other are congruent. Kant’s impor-tant remark that this congruency is verifiable only up to a certain point,since nations are already in a civilised state which is ruled by law, alludesto the fact that he was not actually interested in solving the problem bymeans of the Hobbesian solution – an absolute sovereign at the suprana-tional level – but rather by developing bilateral and international contractsas the best means of attaining the rule of right and therefore, ultimately,peace.208Peter Schröder"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"If on an international level it proves difficult or even undesirable to estab-lish a sovereign institution which may enforce right and hence determineconflicts, the only remaining alternative is a settlement between the con-flicting parties themselves. Thereby they remain the judges of their owncase, and it is therefore not self-evident that these conflicts will be settledin a peaceful way. Given this principle of ipse-judex, it is clearly impossiblefor any conflict to be resolved in a judicial way. Thus the paradox of the iusin omniaremains fully in place regarding international relations, and theantinomy of rights in the state of nature recurs at the level of internationalrelations. It is at precisely this point that the Hobbesian leges naturalesbecome important for international law.Kant did, of course, identify this problem himself. As long as one remainsunwilling to give up the exclusive right of state sovereignty in favour of asupranational authority, any attempt to resolve the Hobbesian state of conflict resulting from the principle of ipse-judexwill remain at least unsat-isfactory. Hobbes, therefore, argued that it would be inconsistent with state sovereignty to expect a solution to conflicts arising on the interna-tional level along the same lines as he had described for individuals. Theendorsement of right and peace on an international level was limited deci-sively by this strict concept of sovereignty; one is, therefore, ‘not to expectsuch a peace between two nations; because there is no common power inthis world to punish their injustice’.22Kant’s famous treatise on peace reliessubstantially on the insights derived from the Hobbesian theory of right andsovereignty.But Kant, too, had difficulty in overcoming the paradoxical relationshipbetween right and sovereignty on an international level. Though obviouslytroubled by this, he nonetheless fails to provide a convincing solution to it:A league of nations...would be a contradiction inasmuch as every stateinvolves the relation of a superior(legislator) to an inferior(obeying,namely the people); but a number of nations within one state would con-stitute only one nation, and this contradicts the presupposition (sincehere we have to consider the right of nationsin relation to one anotherinsofar as they comprise different states and are not to be fused into asingle state).23Therefore, it seems fair to say that there is no solution possible that wouldallow the inherent tensions between right and sovereignty to be resolvedwhile remaining analogous to the concepts provided for the single particu-lar state.IIThe key argument of the natural law theorists such as Grotius and Vattelconsisted of the assertion that even international relations could be regu-Natural Law, Sovereignty and International Law209"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"lated by a code of law, since they could refer to natural law. The assump-tion that natural law itself could already be perceived as an obligatory lawwas indispensable for this theory. Although Grotius maintained that rightcould only exist with a corresponding obligation, since ‘les Conseils, & tels autres Préceptes, qui, quelque honnêtes & raisonnables qu’ils soient,n’imposent aucune Obligation, ne sont pas compris sous le nom de LoioudeDroit’,24he nevertheless allowed a wide scope for this notion of obliga-tion. For him natural law was equally a right which was demanded by right reason and given by God, ‘qui nous font connoître qu’une Action est morale-ment honnête ou déshonnête, selon la convenance ou la disconvenancenécessaire qu’elle a avec une Nature Raisonnable & Sociable’.25As far asGrotius is concerned, natural law is given a priori and ‘immuable, jusque-làque DIEU même n’y peut rien changer’.26Thus the obligatory character ofnon-positive natural law could become the basis for legal relations amongnations.This notion of obligation derived from natural law is, of course, whollyat odds with the strict idea of right and its dependence on sovereignty inHobbes and Kant. Hobbes’ differentiation between the foro internoandforoexternois crucial, because it reveals a fundamental difference from Grotiusand Vattel, who believed the laws of nature to be already sufficiently bindingupon man. This crucial difference forshadows my criticism of Rawls, becausein order to achieve a just settlement we have to provide the means to achieveit at the same time. In this context a sovereign power remains crucial forthe implementation of justice and thus we need to rely on sovereign statepower.27Thus we need security, ultimately provided and guranteed by sov-ereign power, to allow the laws of nature to be binding for our conscienceand our actions.28Among the early modern natural law theorists it was – apart from Hobbes’contemporary Grotius – the Swiss theorist of jurisprudence Emer de Vattelwho worked out a theory of international law on the basis of natural law.It is striking that, according to Vattel, it was Hobbes in particular, ‘qui aitdonné une idée distincte, mais encore imparfaite du droit des gens’.29Vattelargued that Hobbes’ specific merit consisted in the fact that he was indeedthe first to claim, ‘que le droit des gens est le droit naturel appliqué auxnations’.30Quite obviously Hobbes’ characterisation of international law wasperceived as a fundamental insight into the theory of international law byone of the most important eighteenth-century writers on the subject.Pufendorf had already stressed, in a manner quite similar to Vattel’s, thatHobbes’ position concerning international law was the only sensible one:‘Je souscris absolument à cette position [of Hobbes, whom Pufendorf quotesjust before]; & je ne reconnois aucune autre sorte de Droit de Gens Volontaire ou Positif, du moins qui ait force de Loi proprement dite, & quioblige les Peuples comme émanant d’un Supérieur’.31The different way in which Vattel argues for sovereign state power allows210Peter Schröder"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"him to avoid tackling the problem of sovereignty and international law. Histheory of duties provides the basis by which the sovereign is urged to complywith the commands of natural law also in as far as international relationsare concerned. ‘Il est donc,’ argued Vattel, ‘du véritable intérêt du prince,comme de son devoir, de maintenir les loix & de les respecter: il doit s’ysoumettre lui même.’ While Hobbes highlighted the problems occurringfrom the absence of any sovereign power governing the relationshipbetween states, Vattel pursued an opposite route. He did not want to argueover any theory of sovereignty, but ‘seulement . . . faire voir en conséquencedes grands principes du droit des gens, ce que c’est que le souverain, & dedonner une idée générale de ses obligations & de ses droits’.32If one per-ceives the obligation to follow natural laws as characteristic of the state ofnature, as Vattel did, then the equation of the state of nature and interna-tional relations can be seen not only to describe the potential conflicts, butalso to provide the means by which they may be settled. ‘Cette société,’ saysVattel, ‘. . . est donc obligée de vivre avec les autres sociétés, ou états, commeun homme étoit obligé avant ces établissemens, de vivre avec les autreshommes, c’est-à-dire, suivant les loix de la société naturelle établie dans legenre humain.’33The weakness of this natural law argument becomes immediately evidentif one reads Vattel’s assumption of the validity of prepositive rights againstthe Hobbesian concept of the state of nature. The antinomy of rights is notresolved by Vattel either, and it remains problematic for the relationshipbetween states. Vattel has to admit this himself, when he writes: ‘Les nationsétant libres & indépendantes les unes des autres, puisque les hommes sontnaturellement libres & indépendants, la. . . loi générale de leur société est,que chaque nation doit être laissée dans la paisible jouissance de cette libertétient de la nature. La société naturelle des nations ne peut subsister, si lesdroits que chacune a reçus de la nature n’y sont pas respectés. Aucune neveut renoncer à sa liberté.’34Vattel stresses the paradoxical liberty of Hobbes’conception of a ius in omnia, although he does not seem to fully appreciateits inherently problematic nature. It is difficult to follow his assertion that‘de cette liberté & indépendance, il suit que c’est à chaque nation de jugerde ce que sa conscience exige d’elle, de ce qu’elle peut ou ne peut pas’,35because it remains impossible to give any satisfying answer on the basis ofVattel’s reckoning to the fundamental question of quis judicabit.IIIIt seems that we cannot expect to find a final answer to this question, andit is quite telling that Kant refers to yet another ‘surrogate’ while he is con-cerned with resolving this problem. ‘It is the spirit of commerce,’ he asserts,‘which cannot coexist with war and which sooner or later takes hold of everynation.. . . In this way nature guarantees perpetual peace through the mech-Natural Law, Sovereignty and International Law211"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"anism of human inclinations itself, with an assurance that is admittedly notadequate.’36In the end it seems that even today one avoids transferring theabstract and absolute interdependence of right and sovereignty to the sphereof international relations. Instead the consideration of the many differentintermediate steps between these two idealised stages prevails. Kant recog-nised this, though reluctantly, but he nevertheless maintained in principlethe fundamental philosophical premise of the interdependence of right andsovereignty. Hobbes’ theory was and still remains the crucial starting pointfor any further reasoning, even as far as any theory of right regarding inter-national relations is concerned. Kant’s theory of international right can beseen as superior to the natural law theories by Grotius and Vattel preciselybecause he realised the importance of Hobbes’ theory of sovereignty as beingthe most efficient means to ensure obligation of the law, and he conse-quently paid more than just lip-service to him. Hobbes and Kant neatlydemonstrated that only by restricting the sovereignty of each state would ‘aright of nations, based on public laws accompanied by power to which eachstate would have to submit,’37be possible. But Kant, too, had to experiencethe bitter fact that his principles of right were counterbalanced by the struc-tural problems inherent in the concept of sovereignty38as well as by thefactual power of the persistence of politics.The very fact that sovereignty provides a crucial tool to implement therule of law in international relations, makes it an important task to bringthis discussion back on the agenda of academic debate. Without the rule oflaw it will be the strongest who will at least attempt to dictate the rules.Thus the notions of sovereignty and law can be employed in favour of safe-guarding minority rights as well. Even for a normative theory of interna-tional relations we ought to consider how things were to be put in practice.The means of implementation is crucial for assessing the underlying moral-ity and legitimacy. Thus it is not enough to deliberate on ideal societies andtheir values. We need to know how we can achieve agreement in the caseof discord.If we turn briefly to Carl Schmitt39and John Rawls for the sake of contrast, we can draw attention to the need for incorporating the notion ofsovereignty into our debate on international relations. Rawls, who claims to be Kantian in his theory on international relations,40argues against the use of sovereignty. Indeed, it is telling that Hans Kelsen – together withCarl Schmitt one of the most prominent jurists and political thinkers oftwentieth-century Germany – already explicitly stressed for reasons verysimilar to Rawls that ‘the concept of sovereignty is to be radically abol-ished’.41Yet Schmitt, in contrast, developed a very intriguing theory of sov-ereignty, which he applied to the Weimar Republic and its constitutionaland political problems.42Even during this period he discussed issues of inter-national relations, being so closely related to internal German affairs afterthe defeat of World War I.212Peter Schröder"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"In his later writings Schmitt turned in more detail to international rela-tions with a slightly different set of arguments.43InDer Nomos der Erde,heshowed that the state became the important category and effective powerfor an international and Eurocentric order, which managed to overcomeunrestricted warfare as it was, for example, experienced during the ThirtyYears War. The reciprocally recognised equality between the sovereign statesallowed mutual recognition as legally equal combatants. Thus warfare was bridled by means of a legal order of sovereign states which recognisedeach other as justus hostis.44Despite the importance and merits of this order,there are of course limits to this concept of warfare and international order,which we have encountered throughout this chapter. In Politische Theologie,Schmitt had claimed that ‘he is sovereign, who decides about the case ofthe exception’.45And he stated in the historical account of Der Nomos derErde that it would be in fact a precarious situation if this order were onlysustained by the self-binding contracts of the independent sovereign powers.Thus one can employ Schmitt’s theory on sovereignty as a way to think ofstructures for implementing procedures of decision-making.There existed, however, a different argument which obliged the varioussovereigns to adhere to this order, since the mutually recognised territorialEuropean order was at least a strong de factoargument for its own existence.46But, as Schmitt put it, ‘the continental constitutional law was helpless inthe face of the problem of the exception’.47Thus, like Kant, Schmitt distin-guishes between the international law which is in place between sovereignstates, and an international customary order which regulates the rights of foreigners (Fremdenrecht) and trade (Wirtschaftsrecht). Schmitt added afurther important point, because he differentiated between the continentalterrestrial legal order and the English concept of a mare liberum. Thus hearrived at the freedom of commerce and the liberty of the sea as the dominating factors for international relations during the eighteenth andespecially the nineteenth centuries. The dualism between the state-centredpolitical order and international economic regulations was overshadowedby the First World War and the discriminating articles of the enforced peacetreaties of Versailles and St Germain against Germany and Austria. Theconcept of justus hostiswas, Schmitt argues, replaced by the dominatingmoral law of the victors.Although Schmitt’s analysis does not take us much further than thischanging situation of 1918–19, the problems he raised for a just inter-national order remain relevant. In particular, if we consider a moral lawenforced by the victorious power, combined with economic power and theidea of free trade, then we can grasp the inherent danger, for example, of aUS-dominated world order. The importance of sovereign states could thusbe reintroduced by a very different strategy as a means to counterbalancean informal and potentially illegitimate American sovereignty. Given thesevarious aspects, Schmitt provides one of the best starting points for dis-Natural Law, Sovereignty and International Law213"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"cussing international relations with the underlying aim to revive the ques-tion of sovereignty, i.e. the question of who legitimately can exercise powerover others.In contrast, John Rawls, one of the most prominent contemporary politi-cal philosophers, had in his Theory of Justicediscussed the concepts for awell-ordered society, and embarked only thirty years later on the issues ofinternational law. Interestingly, both in his theories of domestic and inter-national affairs, he seems to ignore the question of sovereignty,48eventhough he argues that he follows the ‘idea of the social contract’.49For thethinkers in the contractarian tradition – notably Hobbes, Pufendorf, Locke,Rousseau and Kant – the question of legitimate state power certainly was atthe heart of their reasoning and argument. However, Rawls implicitly recog-nises only the need for coercive state power, for instance when he advocatesthe need of penalties for stability and order, even in a liberal society. ‘Byenforcing a public system of penalties,’ he argues, ‘government removes thegrounds for thinking that others are not complying with the rules. For thisreason alone, a coercive sovereign is presumably always necessary.’50But allthe arguments of a well-ordered society, based on justice as fairness, ignorethe question which had troubled so many political thinkers from Bodinonwards. Rawls avoids the need to legitimate a sovereign or state power,because he asserts that everybody would ‘implicitly agree . . . to what theprinciples of justice require’.51Since a sovereign is necessary for stability, andhence can be counted among the necessary principles to achieve justice,Rawls can assume this tacit consent as given. The structure of his argumentis already problematic and far from convincing in his Theory of Justice, butit is inconceivable how he could apply these assumptions to the sphere ofinternational relations.As a matter of fact, Rawls does not approach this problem from a stand-point which is concerned with the question of legitimate power. This juridi-cal concern is far from his interest. Rawls focuses mainly on the problem of justification, not compliance or enforcement, and thus silently ignoresHobbes’ claim that the former is meaningless without the latter. Instead,Rawls uses the term peoplesto steer around these issues. ‘A differencebetween liberal peoples and states,’ he argues, ‘is that just liberal peopleslimit their basic interests as required by the reasonable. In contrast, thecontent of the interests of states does not allow them to be stable for the right reasons: that is, from firmly accepting and acting upon a Law ofPeoples.’52He perceives peoples as moral agents, whereas states are seen as potentially amoral and thus dangerous actors, who follow their egoisticself-interests, or the so-called reasons of state. ‘The term “peoples”, then, ismeant to emphasize these singular features of peoples distinct from states,as traditionally conceived, and to highlight their moral character and thereasonably just, or decent, nature of their regimes.’53This seems to be anunnecessary and artificial dichotomy, because Rawls himself maintains that214Peter Schröder"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"every liberal society or people depends on ‘a complex of rights and dutiesdefined by institutions’.54Yet workable and just institutions are effectivelydescribed by the notion of a state. Thus it does not seem particularly helpfulto argue against the state as an agent, but to rely on it in order to allow fora just or decent people.Indeed, Rawls goes so far as to claim that ‘we must reformulate the powersof sovereignty in light of a reasonable Law of Peoples and deny to states thetraditional rights to war and to unrestricted internal autonomy’.55Instead,he introduces the idea that all the various interests should be realised ‘in ways allowed by the principle of justice’.56The veil of ignorance in theoriginal position serves him for this purpose,57and it is therefore crucial tounderstand the dramatic shift of his philosophy and the decline of sover-eignty involved. The original position under the veil of ignorance is theattempt to make agreements obligatory without a coercive power, but Rawlsnevertheless eventually cannot do without it.58Arguably, a fruitful tensionbetween the individual and state was at the heart of the theories of the socialcontract tradition. Rawls’ shift and use of this tradition in his specific guisethrows a ‘veil of ignorance’ over the importance of philosophical discussionabout legitimate state power. And although a liberal thinker like Rawlsadmits – albeit reluctantly – the need for a coercive state power, the ques-tion of how to justify its legitimacy is ignored; because if we do not discussthe implementation of these institutions, we end up with an ideal norma-tive theory of values. This runs the risk, however, of a crucial shortcoming,since only by safeguarding the process of implementation even in the caseof disagreement can we avoid the unaccounted rule of the mighty.This holds particularly true for the sphere of international relations, sincein the Hobbesian and Kantian view on domestic andinternational relationswe encountered their conviction that law necessarily depends on a legiti-mate coercive power. The juridical dilemma of the ipse-judexprinciple ininternational relations is difficult to overcome, but it should not simply beignored. Furthermore, Rawls’ theory too easily gives away the advantages,as perceived by Kant, of constitutional states and the effective rule of lawfor the international sphere, by drawing attention only to its potentialthreats. Thus, while Rawls’ idea of individual autonomy is Kantian, hisoutlook in the Law of Peoplescan claim to follow Kant’s theory only becauseof a restriction of that theory.59Rawls seems to ignore Kant’s assertion of theneed for sovereignty, which I have argued is central to Hobbes’ and Kant’sreasoning about international relations.Finally, it seems fair to say that Rawls’ theory – especially in comparisonwith thinkers like Hobbes and Schmitt – is far from appropriate for extremesituations of conflict. We need to acknowledge that the severest conflictswill arise in extremisand not in ideal settings. It is in such ‘cases of excep-tion’ that we must answer the questions of what to do and how to react.Rawls allows even forceful intervention, but he does not discuss its legiti-Natural Law, Sovereignty and International Law215"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"mate use, i.e. quis judicabit, because the notion of people does not allow fora process of decision-making. Thus it remains not only a crucial task forpolitical philosophy to discuss the modes of how a just and well-orderedsociety of states can be achieved, but there needs also to be a profound dis-cussion of who legitimately might exercise sovereignty, i.e. coercive powerif necessary, and under which conditions. Not least, the increasing demandfor interventions by the United Nations seems to demonstrate the need to recast this debate. Thus – and I deliberately use here Carl Schmitt’s idea– we have to try hard to be extremely clear about who can decide (quisjudicabit), when, and under which conditions, about the casus necessitatis.Notes1.

My main aim in this chapter isto explore the territorial dimensions of early modern accounts of sover-eignty. In so doing, however, my approach is deliberately both historical andnormative. Tracing the historical lineage of state territoriality helps shedlight, I believe, on contemporary struggles over political boundaries. Whycare about excavating a principle of territoriality in the first place? It hasbecome almost a commonplace of contemporary political science and po-litical philosophy that we live in an increasingly de-territorialised world,given the intensification of the forces of globalisation. But political bound-aries remain and are fought over. If sovereignty is being increasingly dis-persed and as a result boundaries blurred, then we still need an account ofthe nature of these emergent boundaries, of the forms of re-territorialisationtaking place. One step along that path is to understand the conceptual toolswe have inherited and which continue to shape our thinking about the relation between sovereignty and territory.How should we conceive of the justification of political boundaries? I shall present three ways of doing so, based on reason of state,rightsandwell-being. The first two emerge directly from early modern discussions ofthe territorial dimensions of sovereignty, and shall occupy most of the dis-cussion below. The argument from well-being offers an alternative way ofjustifying political boundaries, I shall argue, given current political circum-stances. I provide a brief sketch of this argument towards the end of thechapter.It might seem absurd to think anyprincipled justification of boundariesis possible, given the fact that most are the product of historical contin-gency, force and fraud. Hence their ‘justification’, such that it exists, mustsurely fall necessarily under the rubric of ‘reason of state’. The legitimatedistribution of territory is therefore whatever has been agreed upon by219"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"mutually recognising states: hence pacta sunt servanda. The circularity of thisprinciple is simply the way the law of nations works.2This might be true, and it might be a truth historians of political thoughtand international law are in a particularly strong position to insist upon.But it seems unsatisfactory for at least two reasons. First, although it hasoften been overstated, we are clearly entering an era in which territorialstates are confronted with a range of problems that do not admit of neatlyterritorial solutions – problems that are not within the absolute and com-prehensive control of a territorial sovereign.3One response to these prob-lems involves what has been called the ‘unbundling’ of territoriality, or the‘institutionalnegationof exclusive territoriality’ as a means of coping withthem (e.g. the formation of the European Union).4Perhaps reason of statecan explain these responses as well. But if so, then the idea of sovereigntyunderlying the reasons states have traditionally had for trying to secure theirterritorial boundaries has changed dramatically, and we need a new accountof the kind of reasoning states are now led to pursue.Second, contemporary polities are increasingly confronted with whatDavid Copp has called the ‘problem of political division’. What are themoral constraints on the division of the world into states, as well as on the internal distribution of powers and boundaries within them?5In otherwords, why should people take the political units as they exist in the worldtoday as given? Sovereignty may give a state a right against other states interfering in the self-government of its territory, but how far should thisright go?6Even if we feel the question is to some extent absurd – as if wecould consider the distribution of territory as anything else other than a matter of de factoauthority – hundreds of millions of our fellow humanbeings do not. Claims for secession and self-government, ‘recognition’ andself-determination are ubiquitous in modern world politics.Both these points are linked to globalisation: the transnational flows ofpower, capital, people, goods, ideas and cultures that affect states in variousways from above and below.7From above, states are increasingly enmeshedin networks woven by money markets, multinational corporations, theUnited Nations, the World Trade Organisation, regional trade institutions,international law, and cross-national non-governmental organisations. Andfrom below, states are increasingly challenged by the demands made bycomplex clusters of peoples within and across their boundaries seeking dif-ferent forms of recognition and self-determination. These claims often fallshort of outright secession, but they still demand a (sometimes radical)reconfiguration of the governance of the state and, arguably, of sovereigntyin general. They also entail a reconfiguration of the sense of collective iden-tity underlying the nation-state, one intimately linked to boundaries andterritory. My argument will be that to dismiss allsuch claims as outweighedby the need to maintain domestic or international stability is simply to begthe question.220Duncan Ivison"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"ITo begin with, what is sovereignty? The classical doctrine of sovereigntyentails ‘supreme authority within a territory’.8No other entity, either inter-nally or externally, is said to have higher authority than the sovereign. Thesovereignty of the state is also comprehensive; that is, it has authority in allrelevant aspects over a territorially defined group of people, and not simplyover particular issues. The supremacy of authority is central to the classicearly modern discussions of Hugo Grotius and Thomas Hobbes. But theother crucial component of this formulation is the territorialityof sover-eignty. A territory is the joint property of a people. A sovereign territorialnation-state is one whose territory belongs to that population and no oneelse. No superior power exercises dominiumorimperiumover the territory or‘its’ people. Emerging out of the settlement of the treaties of Westphalia, thecollection of people over whom supreme authority is exercised was to bethought of as defined in virtue of their location within borders(as a ‘popu-lation’) as opposed to some other principle or feature, such as religious beliefor ethnicity.9The political task of sovereignty is thus of constituting andthen unifying a heterogeneous ‘people’ occupying a specific portion of the world’s surface. If ethnicity or religious belief no longer provided thekey properties for common identification, states still needed to link theirterritory with some unifying conception of identity. Hence the creation ofnational identities, of course often woven from the very ethnic and religiousmodes of identification said to have been superseded. The edges of sover-eignty constitute the boundaries of the state.But how is national ownership in land legitimated? How does it come tobelong to those who live and work there? If most states are, in fact, theproduct of conquest and war, and/or stitched together from older, pre-existing territorial units, what legitimates the boundaries of nation-states?Perhaps the connection between sovereignty and territory is so obvious that it does not need explicit rendering in the classic natural law and social contract discussions of sovereignty. But on investigation it is not clear that there is a straightforward way of accounting for the territorialdimension of sovereignty in purely natural law terms. Tom Baldwin hasargued that there is a complete absence of an explicit acknowledgement ofthe territorial dimension of the state in these early modern discussions.10However, while this might be true of their explicit definitions of the state,it is clear that there are important discussions of the relation between prop-erty, territory and sovereignty. And this is especially true when natural lawtheorists are confronted with the task of justifying the extension of territo-rial rights in contested circumstances, for example, to the sea and colonialexpansion.There are two components to state territoriality prominent in these early modern discussions. First, that jurisdiction over territory is acquiredProperty, Territory and Sovereignty221"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"via the incorporation of the valid pre-political property holdings of the in-dividuals who contract to form the political association (the property com-ponent). Second, that territorial rights derive from mutual agreement andrecognition between states, in other words, from the law of nations (therecognition component). Exclusive and absolute jurisdiction over a territoryentails a reciprocal principle of non-interference (especially in matters to dowith religion and trade) with other European states. Note that these twocomponents pull in different directions. In the first case, towards claimsabout individual rights, and in the second, towards domestic and interna-tional stability. Interestingly, as we shall see, these rights-basedandreason of state-based modes of justifying national territorial boundaries are oftenconjoined.Consider Hobbes’ justification of the state. Hobbes’ political project wasto show that if there was to be any prospect of civil peace the powers of sov-ereignty should be vested in the figure of an ‘artificial man’, or Leviathan.The supreme authority within a body politic should be identified not withthe people or their rulers, but with the authority of the ‘Commonwealth or State’.11As Quentin Skinner has argued, the crucial idea Hobbes is arti-culating so clearly here is that of the impersonalnature of the authority ofthe state.12Citizens or subjects owe allegiance not to those who exercise the rights of sovereignty, but to the sovereign power. The point of this argu-ment was to address the political challenge of consolidating fractious so-cieties engaged in internecine civil (and international) conflict. But what oftheterritorialnature of state sovereignty? Territory does not feature expli-citly in Hobbes’ definition of sovereignty itself, but it is clearly implied. InChapter XXIV of the Leviathan(‘Of the Nutrition and Procreation of theCommonwealth’), the ‘Territory of the Commonwealth’ is discussed withregard to the ‘distribution of materials conducing to life’. Since in the stateof nature there can be no property, it should be understood as ‘an effect ofthe Commonwealth’ whereby the ‘Sovereign assigneth to every man aportion, according as he, and not according as any Subject, or any numberof them, shall judge agreeable to Equity, and the Common Good’.13This isnecessary in order to guarantee the ‘nutrition’ of the Commonwealth:‘Common-wealths can endure no Diet: For seeing their expence is notlimited by their appetite, but by externall Accidents, and the appetites oftheir neighbours . . .’.14Equally, the ‘procreation’ of the commonwealth alsodepends on a wise governing of its extended territories – its ‘Plantations orColonies’ – either ‘formly voyd of Inhabitants, or made voyd then bywarre’.15These lands are legitimate extensions of the Commonwealth’s ter-ritory, according to Hobbes, since uncultivated land could be freely appro-priated on the grounds that it wasn’t ‘owned’ in the proper sense of theterm.16So for Hobbes, the territorial dimension of the state is to be justifiedon the grounds that the Commonwealth could not secure the well-beingand safety of its population unless it had exclusive control over the area of222Duncan Ivison"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"land upon which they lived.17The boundaries themselves were justified onlyin the sense that they marked the outer limits of the capacity of the sover-eign to secure the protection of its citizens, the main task it was legitimatedfor.18A clear sense of the connection between sovereignty and territory can alsobe found in the arguments of Hugo Grotius, and especially John Locke, butnow linking territoriality more explicitly to the language of rights. In Mareliberum, Grotius makes it clear that ‘Ownership . . . both public and private,arises in the same way. On this point Seneca [De beneficiis VII.4.3] says: “Wespeak in general of the land of the Athenians or the Campanians. It is thesame land which again by means of private boundaries is divided amongindividual owners”.’19It was clear that the sea could not be thought of inthis way, since to have property in something was to have a right to per-sonally consume or transform it in some way, which one could hardly dowith the ocean (as much as one could with the fish you caught from it).20A state could not exclude others from the sea because no state had the right,properly speaking, or the capacity to do so. Every right the state had camefrom the rights of individuals. Similar logic was applied to the vast anduncultivated lands of America. If the sea could not be owned by those whofished on it, then neither could the land be owned by those who simplyhunted or ‘roamed’ over it. There is no ownership in things that are notproperly used by their owners: ‘whatever remains uncultivated, is not to beesteemed a Property, only so far as concerns Jurisdiction, which always con-tinues the Right of the Ancient People.’21Grotius made a distinction then, as Richard Tuck has emphasised, betweenproperty and jurisdiction. One has a natural right to possess any waste land,but one must also defer to the local political authorities (if they are willingto let you settle; if not you have the right to punish them, i.e. declare waragainst them). In De jure belli ac pacisGrotius argued: ‘Jurisdiction is commonly exercised on two Subjects, the one primary, viz. Persons, and thatalone is sometimes sufficient, as in an Army of Men, Women and Children,that are going in quest of some new Plantations; the other secundary, viz.the Place, which is called Territory . . .’22Jurisdiction over territory could beexercised only where it was feasible, as in the case of an army controlling aspecific portion of land, or indeed in the case of national territory. The keypoint is that jurisdictional rights could not be pleaded as justification forstopping someone from free passage or from the occupation of ‘waste’ – ofthings (including land) not being properly used. The problem with this dis-tinction however, as Tuck points out, is that if it fails either no colonisationis possible or just about anything is.23John Locke presents us with perhaps one of the most explicit early moderndiscussions of the two components of the territoriality of sovereignty: property and recognition. He also provides us with intimations of the dif-ficulties involved in moving from claims about rights to justifying politicalProperty, Territory and Sovereignty223"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"boundaries. For Locke, of course, the ‘great and chief end’ of political societyis the ‘mutual Preservation of . . . Lives, Liberties and Estates’.24Propertyarises in external things in virtue of our having prior property in our personand our labour, which we ‘mix’ with previously unowned objects, thusfounding exclusive property – although not specifying the degree of controlwe have over it, save that we can exclude others from it as long as we useit.25In conditions of abundance, these private acts of appropriation harmno one (and do not require another’s consent), since everyone’s claim rightto make use of the world God gave to us can be met. In conditions of greaterscarcity, these acts need not leave anyone worse off, given the two provisoswhich Locke thinks follow from his moral argument about our naturalfreedom and his economic argument about the productivity gains of addingvalue through labour.26With population growth and the introduction ofmoney, and thus an increasing scarcity of available land, some end up beingexcluded from their inclusive claim right to property since others can tradetheir surplus for money and claim rights to their enlarged possessions onthe grounds they are making use of them.27Hence the introduction of civillaw, which is meant to settle and regulate property in these new conditions.On entering a community, men ‘give up all their Natural Power to theSociety which they enter into’ to be regulated by the will of the communityof which they are now a part, and which has as its end the preservation ofmankind.28A Commonwealth comes to have jurisdiction over a territorythen, whenBy the same Act therefore, whereby any one unites his Person, which wasbefore free, to any Commonwealth; by the same he unites his Posses-sions, which were before free, to it also; and they become, both of them,Person and Possession, subject to Government and Dominion of thatCommonwealth, as long as it hath a being.29The rules governing property, although now conventional, are ultimatelyto be in accordance with natural law; they are legitimate only in so far asthey have received the consent of those subject to them. As Locke argues,the ‘Municipal Laws of Countries . . . are only so far right, as they arefounded on the Law of Nature, by which they are to be regulated and inter-preted’.30Thus whereas man’s original inclusive claim right to propertyreferred to the whole world, it now refers to the boundaries of the polity hehas consented to join. These boundaries are, in turn, settled by contracts ortreaties between nations in which members of each society give up rightsof fair access to the other’s territory.31Thus in Locke’s argument the two components of state territoriality are conjoined. First, the territory of a state is said to be made up of the pre-political property holdings of individuals, broadly construed,32who con-tract to form civil society and submit to the regulation of positive law. This224Duncan Ivison"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"law, in turn, is guided by the demand to ‘settle’ what ‘Labour and Industrybegan’ and the natural right of individuals to the means to preservation.Second, national territory is secured through the mutual recognition byother appropriately constituted states (via treaties) of a principle (or at leastpractice) of non-interference. Political boundaries are thus justified accord-ing to both the law of nature and the law of nations.The conjoining of natural and conventional grounds for the justificationof jurisdiction over territory is perhaps most striking when turning toLocke’s justification of colonialism. Early modern colonialism has been the subject of a number of extraordinary studies in recent years which I won’t try to summarise here.33Remember that one consequence of Grotius’ distinction between jurisdiction and property was that although akind of political jurisdiction could be exercised over uncultivated territory,a prince could not forbid strangers from occupying ‘waste’ land. Arguably,in Chapter V of the Second Treatise, Locke pushes this claim even further.Although the various kings of the ‘several Nations of the Americans’ may be associated with different territories, they do not have the right to exclude European nations from them, nor do they possess the status that would require these nations to negotiate with them. The gist of Locke’s argument was that European commercial agriculture generated farmore ‘conveniences’ and benefits to mankind than did the social and eco-nomic practices of the Aboriginal peoples, thus grounding rights to prop-erty in the productive use of land.34It follows, therefore, that Aboriginalpeople do not have genuine property in their lands, and equally, no properjurisdiction over them, for government ultimately tracks the ownership ofland:But since Government has a direct Jurisdiction only over the Land, and reaches the Possessor of it, (before he has actually incorporatedhimself in the Society) only as he dwells upon, and enjoys that: TheObligation any one is under, by Virtue of such Enjoyment, to submit to Government, begins and ends with the Enjoyment.35As James Tully has pointed out, since for Locke the Aboriginal peoples ofAmerica lacked a dynamic system of market-oriented property, they alsolacked the institutions of political society to regulate it, and therefore theylacked ‘Government’ in the proper sense of the term.36They had no recog-nisable form of sovereignty which might block the European right of accessto the lands upon which they lived, hunted and ‘roamed’, but apparentlydid not own. From a Lockean perspective, individuals (and states) haverights of access to land and natural resources that ultimately trump juris-dictional claims over uncultivated territory. As Vattel would later summariseit: ‘When a Nation takes possession of a country, it is considered as acquir-ing the empire or sovereignty over it at the same time as domain. . . . TheProperty, Territory and Sovereignty225"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"whole space over which a Nation extends its government becomes the seatof its jurisdiction, and is called its territory’.37What is the basis of the entitlement of states to their territory? For Lockeit appears to be either some version of the doctrine of Discovery or conquestand mutual recognition. The former was appealed to, as we have seen, inattempts to justify the acquisition of colonial territory, but could hardly be appealed to in the case of the origin of Europeanstates. Moreover, theargument from res nulliuscould be maintained in the New World only by falsifying the actual situation on the ground, or by appealing to con-testable conceptions of what counts as property in land or genuine politi-cal authority. The justification of national territory on the basis of naturalrights thus seems inextricably linked to the discourses and practices ofreason of state.IIWhat the various justifications of sovereignty over territory in these earlymodern discussions point to is the vexed problem faced by any attempt tojustify political boundaries. Claims to territory are usually rooted deep inhistory – and more often than not an elusive, mythical history – in such away that a principled resolution to disputes over them seems far-fetched.Might makes right when it comes to settling territorial boundaries.Kant captured this realist sense of modern international law in his famousjibe at what he called the ‘sorry comforters’ of early modern natural law. Ofcourse, in Toward Perpetual Peace he also argued for a new framework for rela-tions between states. But as much as Kant was a sharp critic of the variousaccounts of the right of acquisition examined above,38his own account of international relations in various places is strikingly Hobbesian.39InPerpetual Peace, Kant was careful to point out how the solution to the problems of the state of nature for individuals – that they ‘ought to leavethis condition’ – was markedly different in the case of states. States alreadyconstituted by their own internal lawful constitution have ‘outgrown theconstraint of others to bring them under a more extended law-governed constitution in accordance with their concepts of right’.40For Kant, the only way to get them to give up their unlawful freedom and submit to the external constraints of a genuinely lawful authority was through the formation of a federation or league of free states, as opposed to a world government, which presented too great an opportunity for despotism. If itis a defining feature of contemporary Kantian theories of justice that theultimate units of moral concern are supposed to be individuals, then Kant’sacknowledgement of the persistence of states can appear as something of anembarrassment, or at least an unexpected moment of realism.41There are at least two ways of reading Kant’s arguments in Perpetual Peace,which turn on differing emphases of his discussion of the ‘Preliminary’ and226Duncan Ivison"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"‘Definitive’ articles of perpetual peace.42According to one reading, states –republican or otherwise – are recognised as sovereign and thus as existingin a ‘seminature’ in so far as they are bound by the minimal rules of inter-action laid out in the six preliminary articles. The crucial article supportingsuch a reading is the fifth: ‘No state shall forcibly interfere in the constitu-tion and government of another state.’43A principle of non-interventionseems necessary to get states to sign up to the minimal rules set out in theother five articles. However such a principle also seems to limit the scope ofcosmopolitan law considerably.A more liberal reading of Perpetual Peace, on the other hand, takes the firstDefinitive Article as crucial – ‘The civil constitution in every state shall berepublican’.44Thus, the sovereignty of states is recognised only in so far asthey recognise and respect the dignity of persons, which they can only doif their internal constitutions are organised according to a legitimate (i.e.Kantian) theory of justice. (It follows that the principle of non-interventionoutlined in the preliminary articles has to be read down in some way.) The just international society is a global league or federation of republicsdescribed by the three Definitive Articles. The preliminary articles are thento be taken as essentially ius in bello, and set out a transitional frameworkfor relations between liberal and ‘illiberal’ states along the path to a ‘per-manent congress of states’. Only within a liberal or republican alliance doesthe international rule of law exist, and this entails states feeling obligatedto subordinate their particular reason of state to law. However Kant’s argu-ments about how to bring about and secure such a permanent– as opposedtoad hoc– congress are ultimately elusive. The obligations on states remainmoral and self-binding rather than legal and coercively enforceable, relyingas they do on appeals to reason (in distinctly non-ideal conditions), to pro-vidence as the workings of a hidden ‘intention of nature’, and finally to the ‘spirit of commerce’.45IIIWe have then two basic ways of justifying political boundaries. One involvesan appeal to reason of state and another to natural law, and through thatto some account of individual rights. I have already discussed some of theproblems with justifying boundaries entirely on the basis of reason of statearguments. I now want to consider arguments based mainly on appeals toindividual rights.The first problem is one of reconciling rights with sovereignty. Interna-tional law is either whatever is in the interest of mutually recognising states,or is an expression of natural law. For Hobbes, of course, this meant thesame thing.46If natural law was obligatory on men in the state of nature,then it was obligatory on states and their rulers as well. The trouble withthis argument is that it simply restates the problem: when there is a con-Property, Territory and Sovereignty227"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"flict between sovereignty and Right, who decides? Hobbes typically saw theproblem very clearly: without an effective sovereign there is no rule of lawand this is as true for international society as it is for civil society. Kant also recognised this problem and it is arguably his attempt to reconcile sovereignty with Right that contemporary liberal political philosophers (at least of a Kantian bent) continue to struggle with.The second issue is related but more specifically to do with the problemof justifying boundaries. On a rights approach, a nation’s legitimate territo-rial claims are related in some important way to the legitimate territorialholdings of its members. If jurisdiction over persons is based on consent,then surely jurisdiction over land should be too, and if I can withdraw myconsent from being governed by the state then surely I can also withdrawmy land as well? But this doesn’t follow. First, the jurisdictiona state pos-sesses over its territory is not analogous to the ownershipan individual holdsover property.47The state can do things in relation to its territory that noindividual can with regard to his property. Even Locke, committed as he wasto a generally individualist and voluntarist political ontology, rejected theidea that an individual could remove his legitimate property holdings inland from a community in which he was residing, however much he wasfree to remove himself.48More to the point, basing the justification of po-litical boundaries exclusively on consent – and through that on individ-ual rights – increases the potential for conflict between individual rights and the extant territorial integrity of a state.Why should we take the existing territorial integrity of a state seriously?Respecting territorial integrity is important, arguably, not only because itpromotes stability between states – by constraining the scope for interfer-ence and territorial expansion – but also because it helps secure the inter-nal conditions necessary for making rights effective. This principle has, ofcourse, been abused. Stability is a desirable feature both within and betweenstates, but it should not outweigh every other consideration all of the time.One way of modifying the principle is to think that respect for territorialintegrity is owed only to legitimatestates and then go on to provide an argu-ment as to what constitutes a legitimate state. There is reasonable disagree-ment about the nature of legitimacy, but minimally a state might be said tobe legitimate in so far as it did not grossly violate the basic human rights orinterests of its population, or threatened the lives and/or basic rights of asignificant portion of its population through policies of ethnic or religiouspersecution.49So, for example, South Africa was refused the mutual recog-nition of most other established states during the apartheid era, and morerecently, Serbia was blockaded and bombed on the grounds (at least in part)of violating the basic human rights of a significant minority of its popula-tion. Much could be said about the inconsistency and partiality of the ‘inter-national community’ when it comes to intervening to protect human rights.But this isn’t reason enough to reject the plausibility of a modified prin-228Duncan Ivison"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"ciple of respecting the territorial integrity of states – not least because, as Iargued above, many of the practical and moral problems faced by states andpeoples today do not admit of neatly territorial solutions.An exclusively rights-based approach to justifying political boundariesthen raises a number of problems. First, it confuses ownership with juris-diction. Second, it potentially makes it too easy for a legitimate state’s inter-est in maintaining its territorial integrity to be undermined. Although weshould not simply defer to the value of domestic and international stabil-ity, it is necessary to place somelimits on territorial claims, mainly for thepurpose of securing the necessary domestic conditions in which the rightsand social and economic welfare of a population can be minimally secured.But once again, this only restates our problem: How then should the terri-torial boundaries of states be justified? Answering this question is especiallyimportant given the problems and injustices faced by many ‘statelessnations’ and indigenous peoples in the world today and their aspirationsfor different forms of self-determination. People value their membership in groups not only when these groups are subject to persecution, but morepositively in terms of the connection they see between their membershipin groups and their sense of well-being and freedom.So what would an acceptable principle of territoriality be? What values or interests should we appeal to? By ‘principle of territoriality’ I mean: thecapacity of a people or state to claim jurisdiction over a specific portion of the world’s surface sustainable against others peoples and states. An alternative to the purely reason of state and rights approaches would be,building up from certain liberal egalitarian intuitions, that a people has a justifiable claim to territory in so far as having jurisdiction over territoryis connected to their well-being. Note two features about this notion of well-being.First, well-being is a helpfully pluralistic notion, but at the same time, nottoo pluralistic. In recent formulations, well-being is conceived usually asinvolving the realisation of a plurality of different values in individuals’lives, although each realisable only to limited and different extents depend-ing on the specific values involved. The advantage of this is the room it pro-vides for arguing about competing goods without the debate automaticallyreducing to relativism or subjectivism. The plurality of different conceptionsof the good characteristic of contemporary societies may be considered akind of ‘reasonable pluralism’ (to borrow a phrase from John Rawls), becauseit usually involves different rankings and orderings of various componentsof human well-being that are at least accessible – if not completely under-standable and acceptable – to the differently situated parties. Given this, oneinterpretation of the liberal demand to treat different conceptions of thegood fairly might be to treat such different rankings and orderings fairly.50Thus a group whose practices are less obviously individualistic or autonomy-enhancing than others should not do less well – in terms of the basic dis-Property, Territory and Sovereignty229"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"tribution of rights and resources in society – than others whose practicesfoster these qualities. Or, if it does do less well, this should not be becauseits practices fail to foster such qualities. Reasonable disagreement aboutthese goods suggests that we should try to accommodate the different rank-ings or trade-offs as best we can, and that any limits placed on the practicesor norms of various cultures be as far as possible the product of negotiationand compromise between the parties involved. Focusing on well-being asopposed to autonomy provides greater room for addressing the differentdemands for accommodation – including forms of jurisdiction over territory– that modern states face, without simply endorsing extant relations ofpower both within and between cultural groups.51Second, well-being, as I understand it, refers to certain fundamental inter-ests of individuals, among which is the interest they have in being membersof different kinds of groups. Thus well-being has a necessarily social andcommunal dimension, just in so far as the ends we come to value are partlyconstituted by our membership in different kinds of groups – familial, cul-tural, associational and national. Membership in groups, in other words,matters because it helps provide individuals with a way of moving aroundthe broader social world they inhabit, whether through the provision of alanguage, cultural structure, beliefs about value, and so on. To lack such anorientation would be to lack a crucial component of any possible good life.Returning to our principle of territoriality then, the claim would be that ifwell-being is thought of as connected to being a member of a wider culturalgroup of some kind – of being a member of and participating in a ‘societalculture’52– it follows that, ceteris paribus, the conditions required for suchgroups or cultures to preserve themselves should be provided as far as it ispossible to do so.53The viability of a ‘societal culture’ depends upon theexistence of some form of political and/or social infrastructure, and thismight include a claim to territory. Not all groups, of course, will require ter-ritory to maintain themselves or to maintain the goods related to the well-being of their members. But some groups or peoples might have a right toself-determination that includes jurisdiction over territory, up to and includ-ing statehood. The claim to territory, then, would derive from the connec-tion between jurisdiction and the well-being of its members. Of course,jurisdiction over territory or self-government might not always serve thebasic interests of the members of the group. And, to reiterate, control overterritory need not imply statehood. Difficult as they are to design and main-tain,54various forms of shared or overlapping jurisdiction – such as in federalsystems – might be more suitable given the specific circumstances of theclaimant. Needless to say, there might be non-territorial forms of sovereigntywhich helped secure the viability and hence well-being of a group and itsmembers just as well.The claim to well-being upon which any territorial principle might bebased would have to be balanced against the equal claims of others (and230Duncan Ivison"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"there will always be others) who live on that territory but who don’t iden-tify with, or aren’t considered part of, the specific ‘societal culture’ or‘encompassing group’ making the territorial claim; for example, English-speaking and Aboriginal citizens of Quebec; non-Aboriginal people livingon Aboriginal lands. This is what I referred to above as a modified respectfor the territorial integrity of states: recognising how extant territorialboundaries become part of the joint good of a polity whatever their histor-ical origins, and yet also the legitimacy of the claims of those strugglingagainst the injustices imposed in light of that history. The tension betweenthese two attitudes is unavoidable. In fact, it is one way of interpreting Kant’sclaim that as far as extant political boundaries go, often the best we can dois to recognise the original ‘stain of injustice’ attached to them and then goon to try and (re)establish a way of sharing the lands and resources thereinon terms more in tune with cosmopolitan right.55Recognition and justicethus go hand in hand.56Notes1.

SeidlerAs my title suggests and others, too, have shown, the early modern contextoffers some instructive comparisons for late twentieth-century debatesbetween liberal individualism and its neo-collectivist critics.1This factbecomes clear when we consider that the early modern sovereign territorialstate challenged defining collectives of various sorts, including those ofestate, class, rank, nationality, philosophy and especially religion. By im-posing universal yet minimal duties of citizenship it liberated, or secured,people from the domineering influence of other, more limited and limitingroles. Our contemporary polemic moves in the opposite direction, of course,for it questions the neutrality and, thus, the purported primacy of the politi-cal order, claiming that the thin self of liberal citizenship undermines thethick or true selves rooted in individuals’ other group adhesions, particu-larly religion and culture. However, by observing the passage from commu-nalism to liberalism in the early modern era, we may learn how to exit fromit, if we wish. Alternatively, by recalling the benefits Europeans sought toobtain by entering the post-Westphalian liberal state we may acquire a salu-tary understanding of the costs of leaving it.I shall illustrate this claim by examining Pufendorf’s view about the relationship of politics and religion, or state and church. Pufendorf is par-ticularly apt for such a comparison because he exhibits both liberal and conservative strains of the contemporary debate. Substantively, his religiousbeliefs were in many respects insular and dogmatic. But his philosophicalconception of the state as the most important human collective, and hisview of the overriding importance of individual citizenship duties andrights, were liberal in character. A similar tension characterises contem-porary discussions where advocates for particular religious and cultural traditions challenge not only one another, but also the liberal polity thatpresumes to regulate such regimes, and where liberalism’s defenders attempt in turn to accommodate their communitarian critics. This sharedproblematic, however expressed, is effectively one about sovereignty. For it concerns an institutionally embodied normative ordering of the 235"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"multiple human collectives whereby we theoretically and practically defineourselves.2Section I details Pufendorf’s conception of sovereignty, its roots in thenatural law imperative of sociality, and the latter’s realisation throughvarious group affiliations or social personae culminating in the sovereignterritorial state. It also reveals the range and continuity of this conception– from early, political discussions to more focused treatments of state andreligion in Pufendorf’s later works, which are the subject of section II. Thetextual analysis there prepares a strategic, comparative platform for sectionIII, which examines current debates about problems that also preoccupiedPufendorf, particularly the contrast between a so-called a politics of recog-nition and a politics of interest.3ISovereignty (imperium) in Pufendorf is a normative concept properly desig-nating authority (potestas) over the person and actions of others. One whohas sovereignty can ‘legitimately and effectively’ enjoin someone else ‘tofurnish something’, meaning that the latter has ‘an obligation not to resistthe command, or not to refuse it’. This general connection between sover-eignty and obligation is paradigmatic in the case of God, whose ‘right torule’ (ius dominandi) or sovereignty denotes ‘the power (vis) to impress anobligation on men’s minds’.4While God’s sovereignty is a simple given in Pufendorf’s scheme, basedon the presumptive fact of creation and God’s benefactory relation tohumans who utterly depend on him, human sovereignty arises from agree-ment, as in voluntary pacts of submission.5However, the sanctity or com-pellingness of these pacts themselves, and the ‘inner necessity’ that urges usto accede to human sovereigns’ commands, depend in turn on our priormoral obligation to the natural law sanctioned by God.6The latter remainsessential to the normativity in Pufendorf’s scheme, for without ‘a sense ofreligion or fear of the Deity’ (which is uniquely human), there is no ‘con-science’ or awareness of moral laws among men, and obligation is reducedto prudent calculation.7Humans’ need for society not only keeps their lives from being ‘the most miserable among all living things’, but also accounts for the fact that‘the greatest part of the evils’ to which they are exposed comes from oneanother.8Accordingly, the natural law commands, first, that they be socia-ble towards everyone and, then, that they establish particular societies todirect the enactment of this sociality and to compensate for its deficiencies.That is, it enjoins not only the practice of a general, cosmopolitan socialityreflected in the law’s ‘absolute [perfect and imperfect] duties’, but also thecreation of particular human associations governed by additional, ‘hypo-thetical precepts’.9Entry into these ‘special, narrower kinds of societies’,236Michael J. Seidler"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"while generally commanded, is implemented ad hocby human discretiontaught by experience. Among the latter’s chief lessons is that despitehumans’de jureequality before the law, their shared obligation to culti-vate a self-fulfilling social life cannot be realised with the ‘complete sort ofequality’ found in the natural state.10In other words, it commands the introduction of a principled inequality through particular kinds of author-ity relationships.Pufendorf’s discussion of such ties begins with the ‘simple and primary’societies of marriage, family and household, which respectively involve the rule of husband over wife, father (parent) over children, and master over servants.11Though he considered these pre-civil arrangements to havea sort of a natural propriety, their real foundation is the actual or presumedconsent of their members. The same dynamic that leads to the creation ofthese units leads also beyond them, for they cannot sufficiently protect indi-viduals against ‘those evils which humans, on account of their depravedcharacter, enjoy directing against one another’.12This requires the estab-lishment of ‘supreme civil sovereignty’ or states, which are materially con-stituted by these pre-civil groupings, and which attain the end of preservingmen’s peace and security ‘as perfectly as human affairs allow’. States alsorest upon consent and submission, they have peculiar rights and obliga-tions corresponding to their increased powers, and – despite the extreme in-equality they introduce into human affairs – they enjoy an unquestionedauthority as ‘means for the cultivation of the natural law’.13The logic of this development points to a supra-state form of sovereignty. However,Pufendorf considers states, which remain in a state of nature with respectto one another, to be the most effective guarantors of human security andfreedom. This is not because of any theoretical impediment but because ‘itis self-evident that it [the state] has no one on earth to whom it is account-able, or who can through a legitimate authority reduce it to order’.14Sovereignty facilitates agency at the levels on which it is exercised and forthose below who identify with it. This theme emerges at the intersection ofPufendorf’s contractarianism with his theory of moral entities. Thus, thosewho formally join with one another into associations for the collectivepursuit of some end are said to have ‘the character of one moral person’,even though they remain physically diverse and in possession of their indi-vidual wills. And the state is defined as ‘a composite moral person whosewill, a single strand woven out of many people’s pacts, is considered as thewill of all, so that it can use the strength and faculties of individuals for thecommon peace and security’.15Pufendorf compares the intra-state relation-ship between sovereigns and other members to that between soul and body,thereby emphasising the pervasiveness, diversity and vitality of the bond.16The loss of such unity, through a divided sovereignty, weakens the bodypolitic and leads eventually to its attenuation or death as a distinct and effec-tive agent, thereby compromising the aims of its co-constituents.Pufendorf and the Politics of Recognition237"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"Like other moral entities, and unlike the essences of classical metaphysicswhich they superficially resemble, personae are imposed on things ratherthan discovered in or derived from them. And except for the common statusof humans as subjects of the natural law, which is imposed by God andmeant to guide all subsequent impositions, they are adventitious or ‘super-added to men . . . by means of some human deed’. Some are simple and de-signate the various social roles of individual agents, such as child, studentor soldier, while others are composed by multiple, existing persons bondedtogether into more complex, higher-order personae.17These distinctionsmake clear that personae necessarily overlap. They must be exercised intandem, are often incompatible and thus confront reciprocal challenges ofrelative priority or importance, exacerbated by their own internal vague-ness and necessary openness to experience.18Such struggles have both a horizontal and a vertical dimension, as it were, for they occur both withinindividuals juggling particular duties and allegiances, and in the larger collectives that are constituted by and must accommodate them.In addition to the primary societies preceding the state, the latter also con-tains many specific associations formed for particular purposes. Some ofthese are private groups like ‘so-called fraternal associations of merchants,craftsmen, and the like’, which are typically benefited by and in turn benefitthe state. However, there are also public personae of a religious nature, eithergeneral or particular. The former are instanced by ‘particular churches thatare contained within civil states’ fixed boundaries, or distinguished by theirpublic confessional formulas’; the latter by more limited or temporary insti-tutions such as ‘councils, synods, consistories, presbyteries, and so on’.19Allsuch bodies have internal rules of order (laws) defining the proper exerciseof authority within them and directing the relevant actions of theirmembers. However, none may challenge the state, which grants ‘whateverright they have, and whatever authority over their own members. For otherwise, if there were a body not subject to limitation by the supreme civil sovereignty, there would be a state within a state.’20Disputes aboutjurisdiction or sovereignty must be resolved in the civil state’s favour; otherwise it cannot attain the end for which it was established.The notion of moral entities, the principle of sociality and the concept of sovereignty were first introduced in the Elements of Universal Jurispru-dence(1660). Further developed in a series of Heidelberg dissertations, theyculminated in Pufendorf’s infamous De statu imperii Germanici (1667), whichemployed this theoretical machinery to analyse the condition of theGerman Empire.21In this important work, which he revised shortly beforehis death, Pufendorf began also to elaborate the church–state relationshipwhich would continue to occupy him during the rest of his life.22TheEmpire’s main problem, he claimed, was its irregular or ‘monstrous’ condi-tion, its ineffectual struggle to contain multiple competing or, at least, non-cooperating sovereignties, some of them allied with hostile external forces.238Michael J. Seidler"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"The excessive independence of and parity among its constituent jurisdic-tions or personae, both political and religious, made it incapable of unifiedaction on behalf of its own or its members’ interests, and a prey to com-peting powers like France and the Turks.23De statu imperiihighlighted a politicised religious diversity as the mainweakness in a state and began the harsh and relentless critique of Catholicism that distinguished Pufendorf from more irenic, ecumenicalfigures like Leibniz. Thus, he noted, ‘the greatest part of the World think theDifferences of Religion the principal Causes of the Distraction and Divisionof the Empire’, for they are ‘the most effectual active Ferment, which canpossibly affect the Minds of Men’.24Moreover, he referred to the ‘untimelyreligious zeal’ (importunum in religionem studium) that not only divided statesinternally, but also kept Protestant sovereigns from forming externalalliances against an ever encroaching papacy, which sought constantly to regain the hegemony it had acquired during the checkered history ofChristianity.25Because of these efforts, any state that permitted an officialCatholic presence endangered its systemic integrity by allowing two‘heads’.26The Protestant Reformation challenged Catholicism’s sovereigntyclaims and reasserted the political (and religious) authority of secular rulers.However, its own reformatory and revolutionary excesses further splinteredthe church and thus created other sources of disunity within multi-denominational states.27Because of its inadequate appreciation of civil sov-ereignty it merely pluralised, not solved, the traditional dual citizenshipproblem, thereby defeating its own liberatory intentions.IIPufendorf’s attack on Catholicism’s imperial claims culminated in his essay‘Of the Spiritual Monarchy of Rome: or, of the Pope’ (1679), and in his twomain works on religion, De habitu(1685) and Ius feciale divinum(1695).28These continue to exhibit his worries about confessional diversity as a politi-cal liability. However, as the study of history and personal experience hadtaught him, such differences are also a social fact requiring concrete poli-cies of accommodation. Accordingly, Fecialepresented a detailed programmefor ecclesial concord among Protestants (Lutherans and Calvinists) and a broader policy for religious coexistence in multi-confessional states. Reconciliation involves a kind of doctrinal unification salva veritate, and tol-eration an agreement to cooperate in its absence – itself distinguished intoecclesial and political versions. Political toleration is either owed by right,issuing from pacts like the Westphalian settlement or bestowed by a sover-eign’s indulgence. It is in any case a temporary expedient of conditionalvalue, like a ‘Truce in War’ or a hypothetical ‘as if’, corresponding to theScriptural command to defer weeding. Moreover, it is necessarily selectiveand limited rather than total, resting on the prudent judgement of sover-Pufendorf and the Politics of Recognition239"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"eigns and clearly implying – especially in the case of indulgences – theprimacy of the political order.29Limited political toleration obtains when those of a different religion areallowed ‘to live quietly in the Civil Society, and enjoy in common withothers the benefit of the Laws, and Protection of the Government’, eventhough they have no right thereto; or ‘when the greater Part of the Nationindulges to the lesser the Exercise of their Religion, limited by certain Laws’.This typically happens when persons already within the state ‘change andforsake their ancient Religion’ for another, or ‘when Strangers of a differ-ent Religion are receiv’d into any Nation [and] . . . are allow’d without Disturbance to Practice their new and different Way of Religion’.30The lattersituation presumes the sovereign’s ‘Right of Naturalisation’, as in the caseof Charles XI’s restriction of Huguenot immigration to Sweden and the GreatElector’s virtual open door policy in Brandenburg.31In general, tolerationshould be granted only ‘where the tolerated Party has no Principles of Religion, which are contrary to the Peace and Safety of the State, nor suchas are apt and tending in their own nature to create Troubles and Commotions in the Commonwealth’.32But wherever it exists, a sovereignshould take care ‘that the Liberty granted to all be strictly maintain’d, andthat it be not either openly violated, or by any indirect Methods abridg’d’;and that the majority does not deprive minorities of ‘the common Benefitsof Subjects’. If he does so, he will find the latter ‘more respectful and offi-cious to him than those of his own Religion; because they will hold it aspecial Demonstration of his Goodness and Favour . . .’. That is, as Lockealso noted, beside other advantages to the state such as population increase,toleration creates a kind of civic loyalty among its beneficiaries, as remainsevident today in the immigrant communities of liberal states.33The need for toleration arises from the fact that, even though religion consists essentially of believers’ private relations to the deity, who covenantswith them ‘as particulars’, their social nature causes it to acquire an exter-nal, institutional dimension as well.34That is, it naturally gives rise tochurches. These are ‘moral Bodies . . . of the nature of Colledges, or suchSocieties, where a great many are joined for the carrying on [of ] a certainBusiness’. Like religion itself, churches antedate the state and are function-ally distinguished from it; yet they are ‘not to be independent from the CivilJurisdiction’, to which the law of nature assigns ‘the outward Governmentof Religion’.35This jurisdiction involves a threefold regulative authority.First is the sovereign’s ‘Right of . . . general Inspection’, which applies toall in-state associations and watches ‘that nothing be transacted in theseColledges to his Prejudice’. This negative oversight belongs even to non-Christian sovereigns and covers all churches in their domain, includingthose of which they are not members.36Second, as members of particularchurches, which are voluntary, democratic associations instituted by the‘free Choice and Consent’ of their members, sovereigns not only share the240Michael J. Seidler"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"privilege of instituting appropriate ecclesiastical statutes and ministers, butthey also have additional, special obligations and thus rights springing fromthe coincidence of their religious and royal roles. In the latter capacity, theymust protect the church and further its interests, either directly or throughthe mediations of qualified subordinates.37Habitu’s origin as a response to Louis XIV’s revocation, in 1685, of theEdict of Nantes, makes somewhat surprising its advocacy of a third regula-tory authority which an anonymous English translator found, in 1719, ‘notso much of a Piece’ with the rest of the work.38It effectively combined thefirst two powers by advocating the imposition of a ‘ruling religion’ for thesake of public ‘Tranquility’ and ‘Safety’.39That potentially ominous notionwas not, however, despite Pufendorf’s personal piety and stern words aboutrecalcitrants, a recrudescence of religious intolerance but a precursor ofRousseau’s civic religion and later, secular attempts to create a supportivecivic culture.40Given most people’s imperfect social nature, their pronenessto habituation and conformism, and the inadequacy of coercive means forcontrolling their actions, the state must institute a common pedagogycapable of fashioning a unified citizenry committed to the common interest.41This includes the defence of those civic and religious liberties forwhose protection people entered the state. Accordingly, if Christianity as amoralised ‘universal religion’ helped the state more easily to achieve thatend, its furtherance was not merely allowed but demanded by the socialityprinciple.42Given the importance of the state’s teaching authority and its presump-tive link with a particular religion, public challenges to the latter neces-sarily seemed opposed to the state itself. This was not dogmatism onPufendorf’s part, but prudence caring for the public interest. Accordingly,he could also allow that ‘it is not absolutely necessary to maintain thePublick Tranquillity, that all the Subjects in general should be of one Religion . . .’. Indeed, just as a ruler’s religion might differ from the state’s‘ruling religion’, citizens could withdraw from the latter under certain conditions. ‘For, what loss is it to the Prince’, Pufendorf asked, ‘whether hisSubjects are of the same Religion with himself, or of another’, so long asthey perform their duties as subjects?43People’s roles as believers and citizens involve ‘divers Moral Qualifications’ and ‘different Obligations’ generated by independent legal orders, even though they are enacted by theself-same human beings (hominibus).44Yet this leaves the problem of divided loyalties, since the state’s claimeddiscretion over religious affairs may contravene a religion’s insistence oncertain public conduct. Thus Pufendorf himself cautioned in his reply to theDutch Hobbesian, Adrian Houtuyn, about assigning too much control overreligious matters to civil rulers, lest one yield ‘that to the Prince, which Godhas reserved as his own Prerogative’ and give up too much of one’s freedom.As Houtuyn had noted, private religion may demand violations of a sover-Pufendorf and the Politics of Recognition241"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"eign’s orders – in which case Pufendorf held that one should always obeyGod before man.45The notion of two kingdoms and discrete obligations mayseem itself to be an unwarranted substantive presumption.At this apparent impasse, Pufendorf offered a procedural solution privi-leging the state. Opting for systemic consistency and unified agency, heasserted the necessary congruence of ‘true politics’ and ‘true religion’.Though assuming that the latter could be independently determined by reference to the supposed plain words of Scripture, he also defined it in relation to the former, which addressed the concrete requirements of thesociality principle.46That is, given the importance of the state to humanaffairs, any religion shown to undermine its effectiveness (or sovereignty)could not be true. The procedural character of this position appears in theassociated evidentiary requirement – found throughout Pufendorf’s work –that rival authority claims be demonstrable to other qualified knowers bymeans of either philosophical reasoning or Scriptural analysis, and thathonest dissent always get a fair hearing and an opportunity to dissuade.47For without this proviso, human ignorance, fallibility, insincerity, partialityand imperiousness render suspect any claim to normative ultimacy, includ-ing religious assertions mediated by human interpreters. That is, true poli-tics is not an alternative to true religion, but needed to facilitate its publicrecognition.This demand for epistemological accountability has the makings of a contemporary argument for civil authority. For it rejects attempts to be both ‘Judges and Witnesses’, or ‘Party and Judge’, in one’s own case, therebyreclaiming the solitary unaccountability of the natural state.48Instead, itexpands participation in a public dialogue, debate or contestation, and protects participants against those who would obstruct the same. In otherwords, it presumes and, indeed, requires the intervention of a sovereign state that acts not merely as a party to the discussion but, at least ideally, asits enabler. In brief, and in line with Pufendorf’s natural law theory, it regards the state as a hedge against human imperfection. Such a conceptionof the state’s role remains at the heart of today’s debates over politicalauthority.IIIAs in the late seventeenth century, the contemporary state is confronted byvarious collectives that regard its regulatory authority as an unwarrantedusurpation of their own social power or sovereignty, and by individuals who deem the requirements of liberal citizenship at odds with the demandsof their other memberships or personae. In the earlier period, these so-called‘nomoi groups’ were primarily religious in nature, making the conflict onebetween state and church, or subject and believer. Today, while religionremains important, they are primarily ethnic, cultural or national – factors242Michael J. Seidler"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"that often coalesce. Also, the emergent state that, in the former case, con-fronted existing centres of power is met today, in its more ascendant posi-tion, by a ‘reactive culturalism’ of those who reject its claims to substantiveneutrality and formal evenhandedness.49In both settings, the challenginggroups assert a normative independence from the state based either on theirorigins or intrinsic worth, and they demand a peculiar, overriding allegiancefrom the individuals whose lives they shape and identities they colour.Some, being better organised or institutionally more defined, present them-selves as direct alternatives to the liberal political order; they wish to be, orto function as, sovereign states. Others demand only that their presence be‘recognised’ in that framework through special legal accommodations. Thatis, the former wish to secede and create their own polities, while the latterattempt to rewrite the social contract and adjust existing institutions to theirown needs.In his Multicultural Citizenship, Will Kymlicka distinguishes so-callednational minorities from both ethnic communities and other focal sub-groups such as gays, women and the disabled.50Moreover, he contrastsmultinational states composed of several such cultures intent on attaining(retaining, regaining) some form of sovereignty, with polyethnic statesformed by immigrants mainly seeking inclusion and willing to adjust to thesociety that receives them. Both arrangements, but especially the former,face the problem of ‘differentiated citizenship’, requiring not only the inte-gration of more or less diverse legal regimens but also the generation of ‘tiesthat bind’, namely, a civic loyalty based on shared values and identity as members of the same community.51These demands pose a kind of Catch-22.52For both the permission and the rejection of claims to inde-pendence may undermine the commonality needed for social unity and stability – the former by accommodating the separatist impulse, the latterby frustrating it.53The liberal state’s relation to its constituent collectives is complicated byits parallel relation to the latter’s members as individual citizens, allowingand requiring it to intervene on their behalf. Thus, Kymlicka’s ‘weak multi-culturalism’ imposes the twofold demand of freedom within groups andequality among them.54That is, liberal toleration may not extend to groupsthat oppress their own members or (those of) other groups, including thestate. These conditions raise two sorts of questions. One concerns the char-acterisation of individuals, since this determines which particular author-ities apply to them, and in what order. Also, are the collective personae thusimposed voluntarily or involuntarily assumed? The other has to do with thecharacterisation of groups as such, since this dictates the treatment eachmay demand from other collectives and the state. The first involves whathas been called ‘the paradox of multicultural vulnerability’, and the secondintroduces the important contrast between a so-called politics of recogni-tion and a politics of interest.55Both questions are crucial to defining thePufendorf and the Politics of Recognition243"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"state’s relation to its members, individual and collective, and the latter’s rela-tions among themselves; and both generate accusations about the state’stransgressive non-neutrality or abuse of sovereignty. However, both demon-strate as well that the accusations levelled against the state also apply to the collectives that launch them. And this in turn provides the basis of a powerful argument for the liberal state’s ultimate authority.There has been much discussion of the liberal order’s necessary or, at least, actual failure to be neutral towards all its constituencies. Thus, Dumm refers to the ‘paradox at the heart of liberalism’, where ‘the politicsof equal dignity are pressed upon minorities in the context of a hegemonicculture to which they must conform’.56Walzer, too, describes the nation-state – one of his five regimes of toleration – as non-neutral, since the publiccollective (the state) inevitably exerts ‘pressure to assimilate to the domi-nant nation, at least with regard to public practices’, noting also that suchpressure occurs especially in the ‘key area’ of language.57Others have criticised the ideal of universal citizenship for its tendency to enforce a‘homogeneity of citizens’, and for the gender biases thereby reproducedthrough official institutions.58However, similar charges may be directed toward many religious and cultural groups clamoring for independence from the state. Indeed, as Lockenoted and Pufendorf knew from Karl Ludwig’s Heidelberg, collective iden-tities are often ‘greedy institutions’ that have ‘a tendency to go imperial’.59That is, they interpret themselves in exclusive or essentialistic terms,denying the fact of intra-group Realpolitikand ignoring members’ concur-rent affiliations with other self-defining collectives.60Forgetting that social-ity is multiform on the individual level as well as that of larger composites,they fail to extend to members the toleration which they seek on their ownbehalf. Instead, defining membership in terms of non-voluntary belongingrather than consensual joining, they not only cement inequitable authorityrelationships within traditional collectives, but even block or unfairly com-plicate individuals’ right of exit. And so the liberal state, by granting cul-tural or religious groups jurisdictional autonomy, may foster practices – ofmarriage, family, education, property, punishment, religious control – atodds with its goal of allowing individuals to manage their own lives withoutundue interference. Ironically, by empowering groups as such in relation toother groups (including itself) – a move justified in terms of its liberatingimpact – it may make (certain) individuals within them more vulnerable orless free.The liberal state was originally conceived, in the seventeenth century, asan instrument for the mitigation of conflict and the regulation of plura-lism, particularly within multinational and multi-religious territories. Thisremains its fundamental purpose. The question is how, or on what terms,such pluralism can be exercised, or, what the conditions of toleration are.One way in which the state achieves its aim is by relegating certain conduct244Michael J. Seidler"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"to the private sphere, retaining the public domain for the joint pursuit ofcommon interests. Another imposes certain restrictions on the publicexpression and pursuit of private interests. Both methods aim to maximisethe compossibility of divergent interests and correspond to what Hobbescalled the law of ‘compleasance’ (that all strive to accommodate themselvesto the rest), by whose observance people become sociable.61However, in thedebate over multicultural rights, as in the early modern clash between reli-gious and civic imperatives, both the acceptance of privatisation and theaccession to the terms of public participation may seem unduly constrain-ing or falsifying. And religious or cultural values, if seen as constitutive ofone’s very identity, may be asserted as unconditional and non-negotiable,subordinating all other duties and personae. If so, the leveling pluralism ofinterest group diversity offered by the liberal state will be rejected as an inad-equate substitute for a pluralism of cultural differences.62Diversity is an outsider’s generic description of difference. It suggests anegalitarian status that is shared by all who differ, and that to insiders mayappear insufficiently respectful, deferential, or recognisant.63The politics ofrecognition, whereby particular groups are granted special status or legalautonomy to facilitate their collective self-preservation, is a proposedremedy for this systemic affront. It is, as such, already a concession, in thatmany groups seek recognition (or toleration) only when they cannot realisetheir broader, imperial aims.64More importantly, though, it is opposed tothe politics of interest that sustains the liberal order. For by adopting anabsolutist language of rights and making a priori meritorian claims, it short-circuits the give-and-take of ordinary political advocacy and negotiation,which is characterised by openness to change, multiple alliances and onlypartial attainment of one’s objectives. Instead, it ‘amplifies the inevitablevices of pluralism’, heightening sensitivity to differences and perpetuatingmutual distrust.65Also, since it values the continuation of specific traditionsand the preservation of given collective identities, it frowns on negotiatedsettlements and transformative accommodation, typically seeing these onlyin terms of loss. Like metaphysical essentialism, conceptual abstractionismor intellectualism, and unlike a voluntarism responsive to experience thatcreates moral entities (or personae) as needed, it is purist, conservative andsuspicious of alter-ation (othering). Under its aegis, contestation over limitedsocial attention and resources thus becomes a zero-sum game, which tendsto create a political impasse within the state or, if the latter is deemed suf-ficiently unresponsive, even a direct challenge to its authority.We have here another paradox – perhaps the most significant generatedby the politics of recognition. For by emphasising difference and demand-ing only ‘a weak and attenuated bond’ with the state, it renders suspect ‘thelanguage and possibilities of collectivity, common action, and shared pur-poses’. However, as Pufendorf might have said (about irregular states), ‘[a]society with a multitude of organized, vigorous, and self-conscious differ-Pufendorf and the Politics of Recognition245"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"ences produces not a strong State but an erratic one’. And such a disunified,irregular state is incapable of benefiting either itself or its constituencies. Forin the end, even apolitics of difference is compelled to appeal, either tacitly or explicitly, to [the] presupposition of commonality: to judges who will equitablyenforce the laws; to teachers who will sympathetically portray culturesother than their own; to social workers who will continue to assist thepoor...and to politicians who still work to reform deep-seated, struc-tural injustices. Those appeals presuppose . . . a notion of membershipthat is centered without monopolizing loyalties.66This sort of thing is still provided, in the contemporary world, by a regularstate with sovereignty over other collectives within it, one capable of impos-ing on all its members not only particular citizenship duties but also a morebasic ‘duty of civic participation’. This is ‘the duty to make it possible thatthere be a state and a legal system in the country one inhabits . . . that therebe something around here to be a (legal) citizen of’.67In Pufendorf’s terms,it is the duty to be sociable by constructing and maintaining states, and by not undermining their sovereignty through the exercise of alternative,competing loyalties.Clearly, as in Pufendorf, the contemporary liberal state’s role encompassespositive formation as well as negative enforcement. For the requirementsjust noted involve both an effective organisational structure supported bysanctions, and a cooperative mentality motivating subjects to abide by itsconstraints. Such an attitude may be fostered by the state through a coun-terpart ideology corresponding to Christianity as a ‘universal religion’(which harmonises one’s multiple allegiances to the state and other groupsby bringing them under one normative umbrella), or by what Rosenblumterms the ‘moral uses of pluralism’.68This refers to a civic culture comprisedof multiple voluntary organisations, involvement in which does not somuch teach as practice individuals – almost incidentally – in certain politi-cal virtues essential to democratic life.69My argument is that Pufendorf’sconception of a civil sovereignty which countenances no opposition fromcompeting groups and asserts a primary claim to individuals as subjects, aswell as his voluntaristic notion of moral imposition, fostered such an envi-ronment. To be sure, his interpretation of ‘let a thousand flowers bloom’would probably be closer to Mao than to Mill (partly because of his view of the surrounding world); still, his restraint of other ‘greedy institutions’(particularly religion) and the associated liberation of individuals for multiple, chosen allegiances were important preconditions for such civicpossibilities.As noted earlier, Pufendorf ‘solved’ the problem of conflicting loyaltiesthrough the notion of systemic (divine) consistency which guaranteed 246Michael J. Seidler"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"the congruence of true politics and true religion, and through what I callhis epistemological turn, which required that substantive assertions be supported by proof or evidence. Both moves affirm the primacy of the political order: the first because it allows religious claims to be concretelyadjudicated according to the norms of true politics, and the second becauseit secures a public forum in which such debate can occur. Indeed, they maybe seen as elements of a third, more overarching strategy still characteristicof contemporary liberalism. This involves the reduction of politics to security, the attendant withdrawal of government (as a player) from the religious/cultural sphere, and the consequent elevation of the state to a kindof meta-level beyond the direct challenges of other, competing authorities.It is precisely because the state’s normative interest is thus minimal or‘universal’ that it can judge other interests in so far as they impinge on thedomain of social peace and security. As Waldron notes, all collectivitiesincluding the state pursue certain interests which they assert as normativelywarranted. When these are expressed and compared, however, they become(mere) opinions.70Such elevation into abstractness, which is a necessaryconsequence of any reflective stance, creates a burden of intellectualaccountability and involves the assumption of a kind of intellectual citi-zenship that relies, in practice, on one’s membership in a real sovereignstate. In that context, demands for special, unnegotiated recognition,whether religious or cultural, are deemed illegitimate, and all interests areconsidered equal and subject to the empirical laws of compossibility. Thestate’s interest alone remains supreme, since it is the concrete preconditionfor such comparison and adjudication.Such a conception of the state is surely difficult to challenge, and so criticism focuses mostly on the state’s incomplete realisation or imperfectcompliance with its own ideals. Thus, the typical objection maintains thateven liberal institutions cannot rise to such heights of neutrality and musttherefore forfeit claims to a special authority. However, the retort to thischarge is simple: other collectivities are still less neutral and do not provideeven an imperfect forum for the peaceful resolution of differences. Or if they do, it is merely a happy coincidence. The liberal state at least aimsexplicitly at such a goal; most other collectivities do not even pretend to it.As Pufendorf said, although ‘supreme sovereignty was established in orderto repel the evils threatening mortals from each other . . . that very sover-eignty had to be conferred on men, who are surely not immune from thosevices which provoke men to molest one another’.71The same goes for othersocial groups which are far less embarrassed by their inevitable partiality.Finally, it should be noted that non-civic identities may be as easily, orbetter fostered by a concrete politics of interest that enables all individuals,in carefully tailored ways, to pursue self-selected cultural/religious options.It is not the state’s role to protect or further any of these in particular, butmerely to ensure that all of them may be pursued by individuals with equalPufendorf and the Politics of Recognition247"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"advantage. This is undoubtedly a difficult project with many moral remain-ders, one readily misapprehended by particular players as biased. And, ironically, it may involve concrete policies similar to those advocated by apolitics of recognition.
