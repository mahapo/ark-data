Ralph Epperson has spent 27 years in researching th e history of the two sides of the Great Seal, and has discovered that those who designed them committed America to what has been called \"A Secret Destiny.\" This future \"destiny,\" called THE NEW WORLD ORDER, is so unpleasant that those who wanted the changes it entails had to conceal that truth in sym bols. This book, THE NEW WORLD ORDER, is the amply documented explanation of what those symbols mean and how they connect to this nation's future. Mr. Epperson is making his research available to the American people so that they may know just what these planners wanted for our future.

I felt that it would assist the reader in understanding my material if I included s ome brief comments about my personal background. I have becom e an avid reader since my graduation from college and I have noticed that many of the works I read frequently fa iled to provide some of this background information. So I feel that I must include similar information i n this, my second book. I started reading in 1963 when a friend of mine not iced that even though I was a college graduate, my knowl edge of history, political science and economics was woeful ly lacking. I started reading at his insistence, and I haven't st opped since. Reading in one subject got me interested in another , and the process led me ultimately into the esoteric world o f secret so- cieties and their concealed symbols. (The word esot eric is de- fined as a word or understanding that is intended f or or under- stood by only a chosen few, as an inner group of di sciples or in- itiates.) As I continued my reading, I started noticing that I was discovering the evidence of an enormous truth; a tr uth that had escaped almost all of yesterday's historians. T here was no question that some of these researchers had been mo ved to expose a part of this truth, but I was unable to fi nd the one book that would put the entire story all together. My search for that elusive volume continued, but I simply couldn' t find it. About a year ago, I started feeling the need to wri te that volume myself. However, feeling extremely inadequate for a task as impor- tant as this one, I decided that I would redouble m y efforts to locate the one volume that would put it all togethe r into one easily understood text. I continued my search into the writings of others, hoping to find someone who had performed this task before me, but I continued to be unsuccessful. Since I was unable to find that one book, I decided that I had to write it myself. This is that effort. So, please accept this modest work for what it is: an honest attempt to put 26 years of research into one volume , by an individual who feels completely inadequate for the task! I can"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"assure the reader that my self-perceived inadequacy is only because of the importance of the information discov ered. The chore seems to be doubly difficult: not only mu st my research be thorough, but I must also make the info rmation I have uncovered believable. However, I do feel that I have succeeded as far as my meager talents have allowed me. There is no question that the research I conducted was not as exhaustive as it could have been. The more that I read, the more that I realized I had to read because the evid ence to support the conclusions of this book appeared to be nearly limitless. However, there comes a time when every r esearcher must conclude that the material that has been alrea dy located is adequate enough to convince even the most ardent skeptic and that any additional material uncovered would on ly duplicate that which had already been found. In addition, there are several things I would like the reader to know. Quite often I have quoted the comments of several writers when one or two would probably have made my point. However, there is a reason for this. My intention is to make certain that the skeptical reader could not claim that I had cited only one writer an d that he or she could not speak for the others in his or her field. I wanted the reader to know that there were several a uthors who made the same point with their writings. In other w ords, I have endeavored to truly document my conclusions by exposing the reader to as many writers as possible. I believ e that the reasons I have endeavored to do this will become cl ear as the reader progresses through this book. Secondly, the authors that I have quoted were eithe r those that I discovered had a part in the events describe d in this book, or were those who had convinced me that they had per- sonally researched the original works of the author s they cited. In other words, I am attempting to prove my content ions from the writings of those who were either directly invo lved or have thoroughly documented their own research. The reade r will soon discover that the writers I have cited are man y of the principal writers in the area of this volume. The reason that I have done this is simply because I believe that the information that I have uncovered is extremely important to the future of the world, and that it m ust be presented in a manner that is as believable as is p ossible. I wnnt the reader to believe this information because it comes from the experts in their respective areas of exper tise.

In summary, then, I am hopeful that the reader will agree with me that I have succeeded in exposing a monumen tal truth that has escaped the overwhelming majority of the h istorians of the past.

However, th at does not mean that the evidence is incorrect; it merely indi cates that most people will consider those conclusions to be s imply too in- credible to be believed. But, because of the implications for the future of not only the United States but of the world, if I am correct , it is impera- tive that this material be considered, by as many a s is possible. For this reason, I have attempted to keep the conte nts of this book as readable as I could. I am hopeful that each reader will be as dutiful as the average jury member. Anyone who has served on a jur y will remember being admonished by the judge to remain op en as they consider the evidence to be presented througho ut the trial. The juror is instructed to ignore any previous prej udices and to carefully weigh the evidence presented. I can ask no more. My goal is to have a positive impact on reversing t he plans of those who are altering our future. Obviously, to accomplish that task, I must convince as many as I can that I am correct in my assertions. I am therefore hopeful that each reader of this mat erial will accept my challenge and remember the admonitio n of the judge: be honestly open and dutifully consider the evidence that will presented.

Today's newspapers are full of stories about the ra mpant rise in divorce rates; the increasing abuse of chil dren by some parents; increases in the incidence of rape; pornog raphy being read by an increasing number of people; more crimes against property; demands for world government; urgings for national borders to fall; Christian churches being closed be cause they will not seek licensing by the state; etc. But why are these things happening? Why are all of the legacies of the past, the family, national borders, the right to practice any chosen religion, the right to private property, amongst other things, under such attack? Is it poss ible that there are actually people and organizations who rea lly want to change the basic order of things? Clues to the answers to these questions can be glea ned from some comments made by people and organizations that are talking about these wide-reaching changes in th e nature of our lifestyle.

Rockefeller says as President he would work toward international creation of 'a new world order' ....\" 1 On January 30, 1976, a new document called The Dec- laration of Interdependence was introduced to the A merican people. It was signed by 32 Senators and 92 Represe ntatives in Washington D.C. and read in part: \"Two centuries ago our forefathers brought forth a new nation; now we must join with others to bring forth a new world order.\" 2 Another individual who has commented is Henry Kissi n- ger, former Secretary of State. According to the Se attle Post- Intelligence of April 18, 1975, Mr. Kissinger said: \"Our nation is uniquely endowed to play a cre- ative and decisive role in the new order which is taking form around us.\" 3 President George Bush gave the commencement address at Texas A & M University on May 12, 1989, and he u sed similar words as well. His speech was on the subjec t of Soviet-American relations and he was quoted as sayi ng, in part: \"Ultimately, our objective is to welcome the Soviet Union back into the world order. Perhaps the world order of the future will truly be a family of nations.\" 4 Historian Walter Mills maintained that prior to Wor ld War I, Colonel Edward Mandell House, the major advi sor to Woodrow Wilson, the President at the time, had a hi dden motive for involving America in the war. The histor ian wrote: \"The Colonel's sole justification for preparing suc h a batch of blood for his countrymen was his hope of es- tablishing a new world order of peace and security. \" 5 "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION Adolf Hitler, a Socialist, and the head of the Germ an gov- ernment prior to and during that nation's involveme nt in World War II, is quoted as saying: \"... National socialism will use its own revolution for the establishing of a new world order.\" 6 He confided to Herman Rauschning, the President of the Danzig Senate: \"National Socialism is more than a religion; it is the will to create superman.\" 7 Hitler added this thought: \"Well, yes! We are barbarians, and barbarians we wish to remain. It does us honor. It is we who will rejuvenate the world. The present world is near its end. Our only task is to sack it.\" 8 Another book on his background quoted his comments that his NAZI (National Socialist) Party had a hidd en purpose, one that was not perceived by the world at large. Mr. Hitler was quoted as saying: \"He who has seen in National Socialism only a political movement has seen nothing.\" 9 The Humanist religion issued a manifesto in 1933 st ating its beliefs about the world in general. It took the following position about the need for the wealthy governments to share their wealth with the less fortunate nations: \"It is the moral obligation of the developed nations to provide — through an international authority - ... economic assistance ... to the deve loping portions of the globe.\" 10 The April, 1974 issue of Foreign Affairs, the quart erly periodical issued by the Council on Foreign Relatio ns in New York, had an article in it by Richard N.

He stated: \"... we are likely to do better by building our 'house of world order' from bottom up rather than from the top down .... ... an end run around national sovereignty, eroding it piece by piece, is likely to get us to w orld order faster than the old-fashioned assault.\" 11 Even the Communist Party is voicing similar thought s. The People's Daily World for Thursday, March 9, 198 9, contained an article written by Angela Davis. Those familiar with Miss Davis will remember that she was the Vice Presidential candidate for the Communist Party a fe w years ago. She currently is a member of the National Comm ittee of the Communist Party of the United States. She is qu oted in the paper as saying: \"One underlying effect of anti-communism in this respect is to encourage a certain hesitancy to embr ace solutions which call for deep, structural, socio-ec onomic transformation.\" 12 Another Communist, Alexei Kovylov, spoke at an even ing meeting held at Windstar, Colorado in August, 1985, and gave the participants in attendance a surprise pres entation. He spoke about the 12th World Festival of Youth and Students held in Moscow a few months prior to his l ecture. He said: \"There were three programs. The first was poli- tical and dealt with the various issues of peace an d disarmament. The second was dedicated to environmental [is- sues] and to the new international economic order.\" 13 The alleged need for a change in the basic way thin gs are done is consistent with the teachings of the \"fathe r of Com- munism,\" Karl Marx.

One such Pope was Pope Pius XI, who wrote the following in 1937: \"Communism has behind it occult forces which for a long time have been working for the overthrow of the Christian Social Order ....\" 16 One of the Popes who preceded him, Pope Pius IX, wr ote this in November, 1846 about the changes that he sa w in the future: \"That infamous doctrine of so-called communism ... is absolutely contrary to the natural law itsel f, and, if once adopted, would utterly destroy the rights, property and possessions of all men, and even socie ty itself.\" 17 Another individual who wrote about the future was D r. Jose Arquelles, of an organization known as the Pla net Art Network.

She wrote: \"The new world is the old ~ transformed.\" 19 Another clue about what is in store for the future world was offered by Dr. James H. Billington, who receive d his doctorate as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, and has taught at Harvard and Princeton Universities. He wr ote this in his book entitled FIRE IN THE MINDS OF MEN: \"This book seeks to trace the origins of a faith - perhaps THE faith of our time. What is new is the belief that a perfect secular [meaning worldly] order will emerge from the forcib le overthrow of traditional authority.\" 20 That these future changes would involve force and s lavery was confirmed by B. F. Skinner, chairman of the Psy chology Department at Harvard University, in his book entit led BEYOND FREEDOM AND DIGNITY. Dr. Skinner has been called \"... the most influential of living American psy- chologists\" by Time magazine. So the world should l isten to the professor when he speaks. The magazine told the reader what the message of Professor Skinner's book was: \"We can no longer afford freedom, and so it must be replaced with control over man, his conduct and his culture.\" 21 Another student of these changes is Alvin Toffler, who wrote this in his book entitled THE THIRD WAVE: \"A new civilization is emerging in our lives .... This new civilization brings with it new family sty les; changed ways of working, loving and living; a new economy; new political conflicts; and beyond all th is an altered consciousness as well.

He has observed: \"It's clear that sometime relatively soon in terms of the lifetime of the human species people will ident ify with the entire planet and the species ....\" 23 The reason why these changes are necessary was ex- plained by Manly P. Hall, perhaps the world's leadi ng authority on esoteric words and language. He wrote in his book entitled LECTURES ON ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY: \"The time has not yet arrived when the average man is strong enough or wise enough to rule himself .\" 24 And he explained who he considered worthy enough to rule those on the world considered by the experts t o be in- capable of governing themselves. He wrote: \"Never will peace reign upon the earth until we are ruled by the fit.\" 25 Mr. Hall even indicated that these changes would oc cur soon. He wrote this comment in his book previously cited: \"One hundred years ago [meaning in 1884] it was predicted that within a few centuries men would rev ert to the gods of Plato and Aristotle .... We may all look forward with eager anticipation to that nobler day when the gods of philosophy once mo re shall rule the world ....\" 26 Aldous Huxley, in his book called BRAVE NEW WORLD REVISITED, quotes a character called the Grand Inqu isitor in one of Feodor Mikhailovich Dostoevski's parables as saying: \"In the end they [the people] will lay their freedo m at our [the controller's] feet and say to us 'make us your slaves, but feed us.'\" 27 The Tucson Citizen newspaper of November 3, 1988 printed a photograph of a some people involved in a \"march for literacy,\" and it clearly demonstrated that at least some xvm"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION people in America are now asking their government t o make them their slaves. The picture showed a demonstrato r carrying a picket sign that read: \"Uncle Sam, we want you to support us.\" 28 Mr. Huxley gave us a date when we could expect thes e changes to occur. He wrote the following in his boo k written in 1958: \"... the twenty-first century ... will be the era o f World Controllers ....\" 29 And then he told us why these \"controllers\" would n ot fail: \"The older dictators fell because they could never supply their subjects with enough bread, enough circuses enough miracles and mysteries. Under a scientific dictatorship education will really work ~ with the result that most men and women will grow up to love their servitude and will never dream of revolution. There seems to be no good reason why a thoroughly scientific dictatorship should ever be overthrown.\" 30 Someone who might have given the world the date for the commencement of these predicted changes was Zbignie w Brzezinski, President Jimmy Carter's National Secur ity Advisor during his four year administration. He wro te the following in his book entitled BETWEEN TWO AGES: \"Either 1976 or 1989\" -- the two hundredth anniversary of the Constitution — could serve as a suitable target date for culminating a national dialogue on the relevance of existing arrangements, the workings of the representative process, and the desirability of imitating the various European regionalization reforms and of streamlining the administrative structure.\" 31 xix"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION So, the people of the world can now determine what those changes are that those in the positions of implemen ting changes have in store for them. In summary, then, t hese changes are: The old world is coming to an end. It will be replaced with a new way of doing things. The new world will be called the \"New World Order.\" This new structuring will re-distribute property from the \"have\" nations and will give it to the \"ha ve- not\" nations. The New World Order will include changes in: the family: homosexual marriages will be legalized; parents will not be allowed to raise their children (the state will;) all women will be employed by the state and not allowed to be \"homemakers\"; divorce will become ex- ceedingly easy and monogynous marriage will be slowly phased out; the workplace: the government will become the owner of all of the factors of production; the private ownership of property will be outlawed; religion: religion will be outlawed and believers will be either eliminated or imprisoned; there will be a new religion: the worship of man and his mind; all will believe in the new religion; The United States will play a major role in bringin g it to the world.

He is on record as saying: \"World government is coming. In fact, it is inevitable. No arguments for it or against it can change that fact.\" 32 The goal of a one world government is not a new thought. One of the earliest formal organizations t hat sup- ported the concept of that goal was the Illuminati, founded on May 1st, 1776, by Adam Weishaupt, a teacher of Cano n Law at the University of Ingolstadt in Bavaria, now par t of Ger- many. Professor Weishaupt was quoted as saying: \"It is necessary to establish a universal regime and empire over the whole world ....\" 33 A more modern organization that supports the coming changes is the Masonic Order called, simply, the Fr eemasons or the Masons. This world wide fraternity has membe rs in America, as will be discussed, and they, too, suppo rt a call for a one world government. One who has written abo ut this secret organization is Paul Fisher, and he says thi s about them in his book entitled BEHIND THE LODGE DOOR: \"Masonry will eventually rule the world.\" 34 Albert Pike, the Sovereign Grand Commander of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry here in the United Sta tes from 1850 to 1891 wrote a book entitled MORALS AND DOGMA . Mr. Pike has been praised by his fellow Masons as a member almost without parallel in the history of the Mason ic Order. Carl Claudy, himself a Masonic writer of great este em, wrote this about him: \"Albert Pike: one of the greatest geniuses Free- masonry has ever known. He was a mystic, a symbol- ist, a teacher of the hidden truths of Freemasonry. \" 35 2"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 TOMORROW'S RULERS So, the outsider can know that whenever Mr. Pike speaks, he speaks with authority and knowledge. He is perhaps the greatest Masonic writer of all time. His book is given to each Scottish Rite Southern Ju risdic- tion Freemason who is asked to read it. (There seem s to be a difference of opinion as to whether or not this boo k is still required reading for each Scottish Rite Mason. This writer was told that it was given to each Scottish Rite Ma son in Tucson. Other Masons say that that is not true.) In it, he informs the new Mason about the moral teachings of the Ma- sonic Lodge. He instructs the Masonic reader that t he Order will eventually be asked to rule the entire globe. He wrote: \"... the World will soon come to us for its Sovereigns [apparently referring to its governmenta l leaders] and Pontiffs [apparently meaning its relig ious leaders.] We shall constitute the equilibrium of the universe , and be rulers over the Masters of the World.\" 36 He wrote this supportive statement in a book entitl ed LEGENDA: \"And thus the warfare against the powers of evil that crushed the Order of the Temple goes steadily on, and Freedom marches ever onward toward the conquest of the world.\" 37 The Order of the Temple Mr. Pike was writing about was the Knights Templar, which was, according to him, \"devoted to the cause of opposition to the tiara [t he Pope's triple crown] and the crowns of Kings ....\" 38 Mr. Pike said that the Catholic Church was a \"power of evil ...\" because it had \"crushed\" the Templars, ev en though he admitted that they were \"devoted\" to opposition to the Church and its leader, the Pope. But the major point of that quote is that these for ces of opposition, presumably meaning the Masons, are marc hing \"onward toward the conquest of the world.\" 3"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 TOMORROW'S RULERS Mr. Pike repeated his devotion to the conquest of t he world, with this comment at the end of his book ent itled MORALS AND DOGMA: \"Such, my Brother, is the TRUE WORD of a Mas- ter Mason; such the true ROYAL SECRET, which makes possible, and shall at length make real, the HOLY EMPIRE of true Masonic Brotherhood.\" 39 But, the major worldwide movement that champions a one world government, under a religious leader, is a new phenomena occurring worldwide called. The New Age M ove- ment. Texe Marrs, a researcher into this new religi on, has written two books on the subject. Both of these boo ks are excellent primers for those who wish to know more a bout the beliefs of this religion. The two books are entitle d DARK SECRETS OF THE NEW AGE, and MYSTERY MARK OF THE NEW AGE. He has written: \"The New Age Movement has undeniably taken on the definite form of a religion, complete with a n agreed-upon body of doctrine, printed scripture, a pattern of worship and ritual, a functioning group of ministers and lay leaders.\" 40 Another writer who has written two books on the New Age religion is Constance Cumbey. Her two books are called THE HIDDEN DANGERS OF THE RAINBOW, and A PLANNED DECEPTION. She has written this: \"The New Age Movement is a religion complete with its own Bibles, prayers and mantras, Vatican City/Jerusalem equivalents, priests and gurus, born - again experiences (they call it 'rebirthing,') spir itual laws and commandments, psychics and prophets and nearly every other indicia of a religion.\" 41 The new religion has a series of leaders. One is a woman named Alice Bailey, a prolific writer on the subjec t of the New Age. She was the founder of an organization cal led the Arcane School, one of the major Lucis Trust divisio ns. The Lucis Trust was a major publisher of books supporti ng the religion.

She identified them as being: \"The three main channels through which the preparation for the New Age is going on might be regarded as the Church, the Masonic Fraternity and the educational field.\" 42 (The main thrust of this book will to be to examine only one of the three organizations mentioned by this au thor, that being the Masonic Fraternity. There are numerous wo rks by other writers exposing the involvement of the Churc h and the educational field in the New Age Movement, so this writer will not attempt to duplicate those efforts. Howeve r, only a few are aware of the involvement of the Masons, and that is why I have chosen to concentrate on that organizati on.) Another major writer on the New Age Movement is Benjamin Creme, and he admitted in his book entitle d THE REAPPEARANCE OF THE CHRIST AND THE MASTORS OF WISDOM that: \"The new religion will manifest, for instance, through organizations like Masonry. In Freemasonry is imbedded the core of the secret of the occult Mysteries.\" 43 So Masonry conceals a great mystery inside its temp les, one that is connected somehow to the New Age Moveme nt. The Masons admit in some of their writings that the y too are anticipating a new age, a series of major chang es. Henry Clausen, the past Sovereign Grand Commander (the eq uiva- lent of their President) of the Scottish Rite of Fr eemasonry, has been quoted as saying: \"We look towards a transforming into a New Age using, however, the insight and wisdom of the ancie nt mystics.\" 44 The Masons claim that the things that they believe in are as old as the ancient civilizations.

One of the most prolific writers on the subject of this \"lost\" truth is Manly P. Hall, a 33rd degree Mason. (For those unfamiliar with the Masonic degrees, all Masons in America start through what is called the Blue Lodge, consisting of three degrees. The initiate in to this lodge goes through three separate and different initiatio n cere- monies, one for each degree. After completing these ceremo- nies, he may stay where he is, or choose to affilia te himself with either the York Rite or the Scottish Rite. The latter is divided into two separate jurisdictions, the Southe rn and the Northern. These are based primarily on state border s, and whether one joins one or the other depends on where the ini- tiate lives. The two Scottish rites have an additio nal 29 degrees, making for a total of 32. There is one mor e degree, called the 33rd degree, which is honorary, and only a few are invited into that degree. The York Rite has a total of nine degrees. However, since little has been revealed about this order, the auth or will concentrate on only the Scottish Rite, and in parti cular, the Southern Jurisdiction.) Mr. Hall has written a book entitled LECTURES ON AN - CIENT PHILOSOPHY in which he talks a great deal abo ut the Masonic fraternity. This is his comment about t he coming changes: \"A new day is dawning for Freemasonry. From the insufficiency of theology and the hopelessness of materialism, men are turning to seek the God of phi - losophy.\" 45 Notice that Mr. Hall has said that current \"theolog y,\" ob- viously current \"religion,\" has proven insufficient . Also, he feels that \"materialism,\" meaning the right to priv ate proper- ty, is also a failure. But more importantly, he poi nts out that this new \"God\" of the Freemasons is somehow differe nt from the God of the Jews and Christians. As will be illu strated 6"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 TOMORROW'S RULERS later, some of the Masons believe that the God of t he Bible is a God of evil. Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, perhaps the founder of t he current New Age movement, has also determined that the Masons are somehow supportive of her religious view s. She wrote this in her book entitled THE SECRET DOCTRINE : \"... at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries many Freemasons trav- elled to Tibet where they were initiated into the esoteric [defined as intended for or understood by only a chosen few, as an inner group of disciples or ini - tiates] order of the Masters of wisdom.\" 46 It should be expected that she would support the Ma sonic fraternity. In 1875, she founded an organization ca lled the Theosophical Society, basically dedicated to teachi ng the world about her new secret religion. One of the ear liest members of that organization was Albert Pike, later to be- come the Sovereign Grand Commander of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. 47 Albert Pike, who later became a 33rd degree Mason, the highest degree attainable, also saw that there were some sig- nificant changes coming, and that he was supportive of those changes. He wrote the following in his book entitle d MORALS AND DOGMA: \"... we can look on all the evils of the world, and see that it is only the hour before sunrise, and th at the light is coming.\" 48 If Mr. Hall is right, the \"evils\" that his fellow M ason Al- bert Pike saw are connected to current religion, an d that which is coming is somehow different from those rel igious views. Mr. Hall, who as mentioned previously is another 33 rd degree Mason, also wrote that a new day was coming, and that it was not too far into the future: \"A new light is breaking in the east; [the signifi- cance of the location, \"the east,\" will be pointed out later] a more glorious day is at hand. The rule of the 7"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 TOMORROW'S RULERS philosophic elect ~ the dream of the ages — will ye t be realized and is not too far distant.\" 49 So, Mr. Hall is also expecting that these changes a re about to occur in the not too distant future. Someone who attempted to zero in on when these chan g- es were expected to occur was Alice Bailey, previou sly men- tioned. She wrote about when she thought the New Ag e would arrive: \"Eventually, there will appear the Church Uni- versal, and its definite outlines will appear towar ds the close of this century.\" 50 Since she wrote early in the 20th century, we can s ee that she was predicting the eventual arrival of the New Age, sometime around the 1990's. This estimate of that d ate is not too far wrong, as will be demonstrated later in thi s book. Whatever is coming in the future, some New Agers ha ve told us that they expect that it will last for a lo ng time. One such writer is Ruth Montgomery, who wrote that she saw that the new religion would rule the earth for a th ousand years. She wrote the following in her book entitled HERALD FOR THE NEW AGE: \"The New Age, the millennium [a millennium is a period of one thousand years], will see an end to t hat strife, at least for a thousand years.\" 51 Just what is the New Age religion that will last fo r at least one thousand years on the earth? One who attempted to answer that question was Con- stance Cumbey in her book entitled THE HIDDEN DANGERS OF THE RAINBOW. She wrote that these were the basic tenets of the new religion: 1. \"The Plan\" for the future includes the instal- lation of a New World \"Messiah,\" the imple- mentation of a new world government and new world religion under Maitreya (an indi- vidual who will be examined later in this book). 8"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 TOMORROW'S RULERS 2. A universal credit card system will be imple- mented. 3. A world food authority will control all of the world's food supply. 4. A universal tax. 5. A universal draft. 6. They intend on utterly rooting out people who believe the Bible and worship God and to completely stamp out Christianity. 52 As was discussed prior to this summary, certain peo ple have indicated that they see the Catholic Church as an enemy. Here Mrs. Cumbey says that they see not only Catholicism as the enemy, they also see all of Chri stianity as an enemy. Whatever the New Agers believe in, it appears to be growing in popularity. Bantam Books, one of this na tion's leading publishing houses, has reported that the sa les of their New Age titles has increased tenfold in the past de cade. Time magazine reports that the number of New Age booksto res has doubled in the past five years, to a total of about 2,500. 53 According to an article in Forbes magazine, \"publishers estimate that total sales of New Age titles today are at least $100 million at retail.\" 54 So, whatever they believe in, many believe in it. But perhaps the most insightful comment about the n a- ture of what the New Age religion believed in, and who they worshipped as their god, was written by Mrs. Cumbey in her book entitled THE HIDDEN DANGERS OF THE RAINBOW. She wrote that they had: \"... the intent of bringing about a New World Or- der — an order that writes God out of the picture a nd deifies Lucifer.\" 55 So, if Mrs. Cumbey and the other writers on the sub ject are right, the New Age Movement needs to be studi ed in some depth. 9"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 The New Age Movement The New Age Religion appears to be the exact opposi te of the Old Age Religion, meaning the religion of the J ews and the Christians. These are the two religions that se t the United States on its course because these religions taught that mankind had some basic human rights. They held that the family was the basic unit in all of the world; they believed in the right to private property; they bel ieved in the inalienable (defined as being incapable of being su rrendered) right to life; they held that each person had the r ight to worship their god; and they held that all had the r ight to freedom of association. As shall be documented in t his study, these positions, which were deemed to be \"self-evid ent\" by those who wrote the American Declaration of Indepen dence and the Constitution, became the cornerstones of th e American civilization. (The term \"self-evident\" mea ns that these human rights were not worthy of debate becaus e they stood on their own simply because they were true. T hey couldn't be debated.) 10"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 THE NEW AGE MOVEMENT Yet, today, these cornerstones of American life are no longer \"self-evident.\" They are being publicly disc ussed: people and organizations are now debating whether an indiv idual has the basic human rights to life, liberty and pro perty. Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, a German philosopher, and one of the teachers of many of the world's leading communist revolutionaries, put the argument quite succinctly, in this statement: \"I condemn Christianity. I raise against the Chris- tian Church the most terrible of all accusations th at any accuser uttered. It is to me the highest conceivable corruption.\" 56 Texe Marrs, an author who has written in opposition to the New Age, wrote this about their hatred of the C hristians: \"The New Age believer is told, \"You could be a god in the next instant if only those horrible Christia ns weren't around with their poisonous attitudes.\" 57 That thought was illustrated by another of the impo rtant New Agers, David Spangler, who wrote this in his bo ok en- titled REFLECTIONS ON THE CHRIST: \"We can take all the scriptures and all the teach- ings and all the tablets and all the laws, and all the marshmallows and have a jolly good bonfire and marshmallow roast, because that is all they are worth.\" 58 So the New Age, like the Masons, feel that Christia nity is the enemy, a force to be countered, not by open debate, but by contempt and ridicule, and as shall be illustrat ed later, by even murder. Other parties wish to join the debate. In 1911, the So- cialist Party of Great Britain published a pamphlet entitled SOCIALISM AND RELIGION, in which they placed their po- sition about religion into the arena: \"It is therefore a profound truth that Socialism is the natural enemy of religion. A Christian Socialis t is 11"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 THE NEW AGE MOVEMENT in fact an anti-Socialist. Christianity ... is the antithesis of Socialism.\" 59 So the Socialist, the New Ager, and the Mason have de- clared war on the Christians. And, as in every war, the enemy must be defeated, even by bloodshed if necess ary. This war is no different. Bloodshed is anticipated by al l parties in the battle. LaVedi Lafferty and Bud Hollowell, two New Agers, started the discussion about how their religion san ctions the use of violence against the Christian community. Th ey wrote the following in their book entitled THE ETERNAL DA NCE: \"This is a time of opportunity for those who will take it [apparently the New Agers.] For others, [ap - parently the Christians] if the earth is unsuitable for them, [if they will not accept the New Age religion ] they will go on to other worlds.\" 60 Another New Age spokesman, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the \"guru\" sought out by the rock 'n roll group kno wn as the Beatles, has been quoted as saying: \"There has not been and there will not be a place for the unfit [apparently the Christians.] The fit will lead, and if the unfit are not coming along, [if th ey will not accept the New Age religion] there is no place for them. In the Age of Enlightenment there is no place for ignorant people. Nonexistence of the unfit has been the law of nature.\" 61 Another example of New Age thinking on this vital i ssue came from a pamphlet available in a bookstore selli ng New Age material. It was published by something called the Guardian Action Publications of New Mexico, and it was en- titled Cosmic Countdown. It alleged that it had rec eived these thoughts from something called \"Higher Intell igence,\" and it directed its attention to the hunger/disease problem in the third world. The pamphlet stated: \"The world should be forewarned to be on the lookout for diseases which have been suppressed for 12"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 THE NEW AGE MOVEMENT years, suddenly rearing their ugly heads and deci- mating populations already on the verge of starva- tion in the Third World Nations. Although these peoples will eventually be replaced by the new root race about to make its appearance in a newly cleansed world; nevertheless, for the mo - ment, this is a tragedy.\" 62 The words reveal an incredible scenario: those peop le in the Third World nations are going to be entirely re placed by a \"new root race.\" That eventuality will not be a t ragedy; the tragedy is that these people are dying now due to s tarvation and disease. The concept that a new race of people will inhabit the world in the New Age millennium has been expressed by other believers in the religion. Ruth Montgomery, p reviously mentioned, has written about that change: \"Those who survive the shift will be a different type of people from those in physical form today, freed from strife and hatred, longing to be of serv ice to the whole of mankind. ... the souls who helped to bring on the chaos of the present century [apparently the Christians and the Jews] will have passed into spirit to rethink their attitudes.\" 63 To show that the New Agers are talking about the physical death of the \"enemy,\" one must only search the writings of other New Agers. Another believer to wr ite on the subject of the destruction of those who will not ac cept the new religion was Ruth Montgomery. She has been quot ed as saying in a transcribed interview carried by a magazine called Magical Blend: \"Millions will survive and millions won't. Those who won't will go into the spirit state, because th ere is truly no death.\" 64 Estimates of the number to perish have been made by some New Agers. One who has made such an estima te is John Randolph Price, who was quoted by Texe Marrs i n his book about the New Age. He said that: 13"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 THE NEW AGE MOVEMENT \"John Randolph Price was told by his spirit guide that up to two and one-half billion might perish in the coming chaos.\" 65 That estimate is about half of the current world po p- ulation. Another estimate of the number required to die beca use they will not accept the new religion was offered b y the so- called \"Tibetan master,\" Djwhal Khul, who has said in one of his channelling experiences, that one third of all humanity must die by the year 2000. 66 That would be about 2 billion people. Channelling is one of the strange activities occurr ing inside the New Age religion. Some of the believers claim that they have the ability to call forth the deceased sp irit of someone who lived many years before. Quite often th ese spirits claim to be \"ascended masters,\" those who h ave gone on to discover the eternal truths of all of creatio n. One such believer who claimed to be in touch with a \"master\" was Alice Bailey, previously mentioned. Her spirit called him self Djwhal Khul, and she claimed he spoke through her, saying: \"Death is not a disaster to be feared; the work of the Destroyer is not really cruel or undesirable .. .. Therefore there is much destruction permitted by th e custodians of the Plan and much evil turned into good.\" 67 Just what \"The Plan\" constituted was told to the wo rld by Benjamin Creme, another New Age leader. He place d an advertisement in about 20 newspapers all over the w orld on April 25, 1982, that defined the term. The ad read, in part: \"What is The Plan? It includes the installation of a new world government and new world religion under Maitreya.\" 68 But perhaps the most startling example of the teach ings of this new religion came from the pen of Barbara M arx Hubbard, one of their most articulate writers. She wrote in her book entitled HAPPY BIRTHDAY PLANET EARTH: 14"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 THE NEW AGE MOVEMENT \"The choice is: do you wish to become a natural Christ, a universal human, or do you wish to die?\" 69 \"People will either change or die. That is the choice.\" 70 So the people of the world will be given a choice: they will choose to accept the new religion, or they wil l choose to die! The battle lines are drawn! Choices will have to be made. Some of the leading Socialists of the past have sho wn that they too have chosen up sides. One such indivi dual was Adolf Hitler, the head of the German government dur ing World War II, who held no conviction that the murde r of over 50 million people during that war was wrong. He con sidered himself to be an agent of this unseen god in reduci ng the population of people that he held to be undesirable . He wrote: \"I have the right to exterminate millions of in- dividuals of inferior races, which multiply like ve r- min.\" 71 And he did what he considered acceptable inside his religion. Those who did not believe in his new reli gion had no choice, and they perished. (The evidence that Adolf Hitler was a New Ager will be presented later in another c hapter.) Another of the leading spokesmen for the Socialist posi- tion was George Bernard Shaw, a well-known writer d uring his day. He wrote a book entitled THE INTELLIGENT W OM- AN'S GUIDE TO SOCIALISM, in which he stated: \"I also made it quite clear that Socialism means equality of income or nothing, and under Socialism you would not be allowed to be poor. You would be forcibly fed, clothed, lodged, taught and employed whether you like it or not. If it were discovered that you had not the character and in- dustry enough to be worth all this trouble, you mig ht be executed in a kindly manner, but whilst you were permitted to live, you would have to live well.\" 72 15"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 THE NEW AGE MOVEMENT The Masonic writer, Albert Pike, placed the Masonic order into the discussion, when he wrote this in hi s book MORALS AND DOGMA: \"It is not true to say that 'one man, however little, must not be sacrificed to another, however great, to a majority or to all men.' That is not only a fallacy, but a most dangerous one. Often one man and many men must be sacrificed, in the ordinary sense of the term, to the interest of the many. ... the interest and even the life of one man must often be sacrificed to the interest and welfare of his country.\" 73 The religious view is that the \"sacrifice\" of one l ife for the interest of the \"many\" is murder, and those who believe in the God of the Bible are told not to commit this act. The commandment against this practice is contained in E xodus 20:13 of the Old Testament, and in Matthew 5:21 in the New, and is simply expressed in the words: \"Thou shalt n ot kill.\" The principle is easy to understand: no person has the right to take the life of another. This understanding is nearly worldwide (there are, of course, cultures that have deter- mined that human sacrifice, cannibalism and murder are ac- ceptable forms of behavior, but these are rare in t he history of man.) But, here we are being exposed to a whole new re- ligious view, one growing daily in size and stature , that openly advocates the wholesale slaughter of entire races of people. Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the Illuminati, has also endorsed this new conviction that murder was not im proper by including it in the initiation ceremony into the Order. He has his initiator tell the initiate: \"Behold our secret .... If in order to destroy all Christianity, all religion, we have pretended to ha ve the sole true religion, remember that the end justi - fies the means, and that the wise ought to take all the means to do good which the wicked take to do evil.\" 74 16"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 THE NEW AGE MOVEMENT The initiate was told that he may use whatever mean s, murder included, to achieve the goals of the associ ation that he was joining. And that the major goal of the Illu minati was the destruction of all religion, including Christia nity. That meant that if Christians physically stood in the wa y, they could be removed by simply murdering them. Weishaupt even went so far as to say that anyone no t willing to take the life of another was unfit to jo in the Illuminati. He wrote the following in a letter to a fellow member in 1778: \"No man is fit for our Order who is not ... ready to go to every length ....\" 75 Weishaupt wrote that again, this time using differe nt words: \"This can be done in no other way but by secret associations, which will by degrees, and in silence , possess themselves of the government of the States, and make use of those means for this purpose which the wicked use for attaining base ends.\" 76 Weishaupt was aware of the enormous power of govern - ment and he desired its power for his members. He c om- mitted his organization to its infiltration. Then, he committed it to unspeakable purposes: anything that would fur ther the goal of the Illuminati. He even went on to grant permission to his members to distort the truth by lying if it would further thei r goals. He wrote: \"There must not a single purpose ever come in sight ... that may betray our aims against religion and the state. One must speak sometimes one way and some- times another, but so as never to contradict our- selves, and so that, with respect to our true way o f thinking, we may be impenetrable.\" 77 Perhaps a perfect example of an oath that these ini tiates take somewhere along the road to the pinnacle insi de the secret society was given in a book written by Georg e Orwell 17"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 THE NEW AGE MOVEMENT entitled 1984. Mr. Orwell has an initiate into a se cret society called The Brotherhood in his story asked these que stions: \"Are you prepared to give your life? Are you prepared to commit murder? Are you prepared to commit acts of sabotage which may cause the death of hundreds of innocent people? Are you prepared to betray your country to foreign powers? Are you prepared to cheat, to forge, to blackmail, to corrupt the minds of children, to distribute hab it- forming drugs, to encourage prostitution, to dissem - inate venereal diseases — to do anything which is likely to cause demoralization and weaken the power of the [people?] Are you prepared to commit suicide, if and when we order you to do so?\" 78 This is an example of the philosophy that \"the ends justify the means.\" The initiate should do as he wa s required, as long as the act benefited the Brotherhood. There is no morality under such an oath. So murder of the unfit, those unwilling to adopt th e new religion, will be acceptable. And those who do the annihilat- ing are to feel no remorse. In the view of the New Age re- ligion, the murderers have served mankind well. But, this callous disregard for the right to life o f every human on the face of the earth has been predicted b efore. In the New Testament, John was moved to write in John 6:12: \"Yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.\" The New World Order will sail in on a sea of blood. 18"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 Lord Maitreya The New Age religion will have a worldwide leader, an individual that they call Lord Maitreya. This indiv idual has not made his public appearance yet, but the New Age rs claim that he is on the earth at the present time. They c laim that he came to live with the Asian community in East Lo ndon, England, in July, 1977, by \"descending\" from his an cient retreat in the Himalaya Mountains along the border of India and Tibet. They further believe that \"his imminent emergence into full public view is assured.\" They also claim that this individual is the one tha t the Christians call Christ, the Jews call the Messiah, the Buddhists call the Fifth Buddha, the Hindus call Kr ishna, and the Muslims call the Imam Mahdi. In other words , all of the major religions of the world are awaiting the a rrival of this one individual.

And he is on the earth now, patiently wa iting for the appointed time to reveal his existence to the p eoples of 19"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 LORD MAITREYA the world. He will apparently assume the leadership of all of these religions, and when he does, he will create a one-world religion. The New Agers have written that in the esoteric tra dition (previously defined as being intended for or unders tood by only a chosen few as an inner group of disciples or initiates) the word \"Christ\" is not the name of an individual, but the name of an office, or function, within the Spiritua l Hierarchy of Masters. The masters are a group of perfected me n who have guided human evolution from behind the scenes for cen- turies. And they believe that this Lord Maitreya is that Christ. Manly P. Hall has written of this individual, by id entifying him as: \"... the way, the truth, and the life which, coming to every life, redeems all who accept it.\" 79 Texe Marrs has quoted this individual as saying: \"My Army is ready for battle, My masters of Wis- dom and Myself at the head. That battle will be fou ght for the continuance of man on this earth. Rest assu red that my Army shall triumph.\" 80 It appears that the battle to be fought between the follow- ers of Lord Maitreya and the rest of humanity is st ill in the future. But at least one of the participants has an army already prepared. One who claims to have seen the birth in a \"vision\" of someone who seems to fulfill the requirements of th is Mait- reya was astrologer Jeanne Dixon. Her major claim t o being a \"prophet\" is her prediction, reportedly made befo re the event, of the assassination of President John Kenne dy in 1963. However, her credentials were dealt a serious blow in 1968 when she also \"prophesied\" that the Soviet Uni on would be the first to put a man on the moon. Another of h er \"prophecies\" was that the Republican Party would be vic- torious in 1968 (and it was with the election of Ri chard Nixon, a Republican,) but she also predicted that \" within the following decade (1970-1979) the two-party system a s we have known it will vanish from the American scene. 81 20"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 LORD MAITREYA She further predicted that Richard M. Nixon had \"ex - cellent vibrations for the good of America\" and wou ld \"serve [the] country well.\" 82 Those who question her inability to correctly predi ct that America, not the Soviet Union, would become the fir st to place a man on the moon; and that the two-party sys tem has not vanished from the scene; and that President Nix on ap- parently did not have \"good vibrations\" for this na tion and would later be removed from office by the event com monly referred to as \"Watergate,\" can only presume that s he must have been given \"inside\" information about the assa ssination of the President Kennedy. And that would account fo r her knowing, at least in that event, the true future. Secondly, one can only wonder why this \"non-prophet \" should be listened to about anything after her appa lling record on \"prophecies,\" but there is reason to beli eve that she might have been asked to write an account of this \" vision\" of an important birth by the New Age religion because they wanted the official imprimatur of someone commonly referred to as a \"prophet.\" In other words, her \"prophecy\" m ight have been written to legitimize his claim to be a man-go d so that when this individual made his public appearance him self, the public would marvel at the fact that his birth had fulfilled a prophecy.\" But, in any event, Ruth Montgomery wrote a book abo ut her, entitled THE GIFT OF PROPHECY, in which she wr ote about the very revealing and intriguing vision that Jeanne Dixo n allegedly had: \"The vision which [Jeanne] considers the most sig- nificant and soul-stirring of her life occurred on Feb- ruary 5, 1962. She saw the brightest sun she had ever seen. [The reader is asked to remember this reference to \"the sun.\"] Stepping out of the brightness were a Pharaoh and Queen Nefertiti. [Remember here that these two in- dividuals were Egyptians. This will become signific ant later on in this study.] The couple ... thrust fort h [a] baby, as if offering it to the entire world.\" 83 Jeanne looked at the baby and then said, according to the author: 21"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 LORD MAITREYA \"I knew 'Here is the beginning of wisdom.'\" 84 So what Ruth Montgomery wrote can be summarized as follows: A sun deity gives the world a child, from Egypt, wh o pos- sesses enormous \"wisdom.\" And this event allegedly took place on February 5, 1962. The interpretation of th ese sym- bols will be discussed later and their alleged sign ificance will be developed. Jeanne then says: \"A child, born somewhere in the Middle East short- ly after 7 a.m. (E.S.T.) on February 5, 1962, will revo- lutionize the world. Before the close of the centur y he will bring together all mankind in one all-embracin g faith. Mankind will begin to feel the great force of this man in the early 1980's, and during the subsequent ten years the world as we know it will be reshaped into one without wars and suffering. His power will grow greatly until 1999 [this year is extremely signific ant as will also be developed] at which time the peoples o f this earth will probably discover the full meaning of th e vision.\" 85 So, according to this \"vision,\" a child, born on Fe bruary 5, 1962, will grow up to bring a one-world religion on to the face of the earth, and his efforts will be successful in 1999. The New York Times newspaper ran three consecutive articles on the conjunction of five planets, the su n, the moon and an \"invisible body that astrologers call Khetu, \" starting on February 4, 1962. The first article stated that the various bodies moved into \"rough alignment in the constella tion Cap- ricorn at 7:05 A.M., New York time,\" and that they would \"remain in that alignment until 7:17 A.M., New York time, Monday.\" 86 However, the article went on to say that most of th e people in India became alarmed, because most astrol ogers were making \"predictions of disasters.\" There were a few astrologers who were predicting good for the world as a result of this alignment, but \"few Indians appear[ed] to b e paying them much heed.\" 22"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 LORD MAITREYA Astronomers did not consider the event to be rare, how- ever, and the article went on to report that \"the s ame con- figuration [had] occurred several times in the past ,\" the last time being in April, 1821, and then it occurred twi ce. The article reported that Dr. Kenneth L. Franklin of th e Museum of Natural History-Hayden Planetarium in New York h ad commented that that year does not seem to be a year of any remembered disasters. He was then quoted as saying: \"And that year isn't famous for anything, as far as I kn ow.\" 87 Dr. Franklin also commented on the body the astrolo gers call Khetu. He \"speculated that it may be some sort of astro- logical addition used to make everything come out r ight.\" He then added that he believed Khetu \"to be the invisi ble planet that is frequently taken into account in astrologic al reck- onings, but that he had no idea how it was possible to keep track of something that no one could see.\" The Times carried another article the next day, Mon day, February 5, 1962, and it repeated the concern of th e Hindu astrologers. In fact, that headline read \"Hindu Ast rologers Still Say It's Doomsday.\" And the sub-headline read \"Peaceful Beginning of Planetary Event Is Viewed Gravely.\" The third article in the series ran on Tuesday, Feb ruary 6, 1962, and carried the headline \"'Doomsday' in India Unevent- ful.\" The article reported that the Indian astrolog ers had \"predicted a variety of disasters, earthquakes, tid al waves, devastating fires, and warfare, to name a few,\" but that none of these events had occurred. Furthermore, the arti cle re- ported that Hindu priests had claimed that the reas on noth- ing had happened was because their prayers to their god had been answered. But, none of these three articles mentioned the bir th of anyone on these three days. Furthermore, none but a few as- trologers had believed that something good was goin g to hap- pen, and that only a few in India had listened to t hem. Only Jeanne Dixon, another \"astrologer,\" had seen a vision of something beneficial, in this case the birth of a baby \"full of wisdom,\" at about the midpoint of the three day affair. One can only wonder if, once again, she missed the mark, and was involved in another error. In any event, these people claim that the Lord Mait reya will appear shortly to the entire world and start e veryone off on a road to a world religion. Helena Petrovna Bl avatsky in her book entitled THE SECRET DOCTRINE, called him \" the 23"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 LORD MAITREYA dragon of wisdom.\" So it appears that the one call that Jeanne Dixon made that appears to match other comme nts is her statement that the baby she saw in her \"vision\" was \"full of wisdom.\" If the baby she claimed to have seen in her vi- sion was \"Lord Maitreya,\" then she was right, becau se others have claimed that Lord Maitreya is \"full of wisdom. \" However, there is still reason to believe that she was given \"inside\" information by some New Agers who wa nted to have this \"Lord's\" birth \"prophesied' so that when he did surface, the New Agers could claim that his birth h ad been \"a fulfilled prophecy.\" So the world awaits the visible appearance of Lord Maitreya. 24"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 The Ancient Mysteries \"The One Who Knows The Secret Does Not Speak. The One Who Speaks Does Not Know The Secret.\" Alice Bailey, one of the key members of the New Age religion, wrote: \"There is no question therefore that the work to be done in familiarizing the general public with the n ature of the Mysteries is of paramount importance at this time. These Mysteries will be restored to outer ex- pression through the medium of the Church and the Masonic Fraternity.\" 88 The question of just what the Ancient Mysteries wer e was answered, in part, by Albert G. Mackey, another 33r d degree Mason, in his two volume work entitled ENCYCLOPAEDI A OF FREEMASONRY. He wrote this under the subject of the Ancient Mysteries: 25"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 THE ANCIENT MYSTERIES \"Each of the pagan gods ... had, besides the public and open, a secret worship paid to him to which non e were admitted but those who had been selected by preparatory ceremonies called Initiation. This secret worship was termed the Mysteries.\" 89 The student of the Masonic Order can know that when Mr. Mackey writes, his writings can be relied upon. He is considered to be one of the premier Masonic authors of all time. These are the comments from the biographical information presented on Mr. Mackey in the front of his ENCYCLOPAEDIA: \"... his writings are universally esteemed for thei r sincerity, honest records and common sense. [He was ] a leader in research ... who valued accuracy.\" 90 Carl Claudy, another Mason who writes on the subjec t of the Lodge, also has words of praise for Mr. Mackey: \"[He was] one of the greatest students and most widely followed authorities the Masonic world has e ver known.\" 91 And in his book entitled INTRODUCTION TO FREEMA- SONRY, he praised Mr. Mackey with these words: \"Albert Gallatin Mackey: one of the greatest stu- dents and most widely followed authorities the Maso nic world has known. [He is] the great Master of Freema - sonry.\" 92 So Mr. Mackey can be believed when he tells his rea ders that the worship of pagan gods had a secret, non-vi sible worship besides the public one. The reader can beli eve him when he identifies the name of this secret worship. He told his readers: \"This secret worship was termed the Mysteries.\" Another who has written about the subject of the An cient Mysteries was Manly P. Hall, another 33rd degree Ma son. He 26"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 THE ANCIENT MYSTERIES has written in his book entitled WHAT THE ANCIENT WISDOM EXPECTS OF ITS DISCIPLES: \"In the remote past the gods walked with men and ... they chose from among the sons of men the wises t and the truest. With these specially ordained and illumined sons they left the keys of their great wisdom, which was the knowledge of good and evil. [This will be examined later.] ... these illumined ones, founded what we know as the Ancient Mysteries.\" 93 He wrote additional comments about these mysteries in another of the books he has written, called THE SEC RET TEACHINGS OF ALL AGES: \"The arcana [defined as being a secret or hidden knowledge] of the Ancient Mysteries were never re- vealed to the profane [defined as those not initiat ed into the inner mysteries] except through the media of symbols. Symbolism fulfilled the dual office of con - cealing the sacred truths from the uninitiated and re- vealing to those qualified to understand the symbol s.\" 94 Mr. Hall dedicated the latter book to: \"the proposition that concealed within the emblem- atic figures, allegories and rituals of the ancient s is a secret doctrine concerning the inner mysteries of l ife, which doctrine has been preserved in toto [in the whole] among a small band of initiated minds since the beginning of the world.\" 95 He went on to mention that the Mysteries: \"were secret societies, binding their initiates to in- violable secrecy, and avenging with death the betra yal of their sacred trusts.\" 96 Mr. Hall told the reader that no one is to know the iden- tity of those who have received the secrets. He wro te: 27"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 THE ANCIENT MYSTERIES \"The true Adept and Initiate shall reveal his identity to no man, unless that one is worthy to re ceive it.\" 97 He further explained where some of these initiates lived, when he wrote: \"... no reasonable doubt can exist that the initiat es of Greece, Egypt, and other ancient countries posse ssed the correct solutions to those great cultural, inte llectual, moral, and social problems which in an unsolved sta te confront the humanity of the twentieth century.\" 98 He further amplified that thought when he added: \"Neo-Platonism [defined by Mr. Hall as a school founded by Plotinus around 240 A.D., concerning its elf with the problems of metaphysics, the study of knowledge] recognized the existence of a secret and all- important doctrine which from the time of the earli est civilizations had been concealed within the rituals , symbols and allegories of religions and philosophie s.\" \" So, in summary, it is possible to understand what t hese Ancient Mysteries were. There appear to be at least four truths gleaned from the information provided in the com- ments made above. Those truths appear to be: 1. The Ancient Mysteries had two forms of worshipping the same god. 2. The knowledge of the true god was reserved for those who had been entrusted with the secrets. 3. Those who understood those secrets were sworn to the strictest secrecy. 4. Those who had knowledge of the secrets claimed to possess all of the answers to all of the problems of mankind. There was an additional secret for the secret beare rs: they had to be initiated in a private initiation ceremon y. Albert Pike wrote a little about it: 28"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 THE ANCIENT MYSTERIES \"Initiation was considered to be a mystical death; and the perfect Epopt was then said to be regenerat ed, newborn, restored to a renovated existence of life, light and purity.\"- 100 In fact, this \"new born\" experience is similar to t he exper- ience the \"born again\" Christians go through. The C hristians call their experience a second birth, just as the M asons do. In fact, Albert Pike calls a similar ceremony a \"born again\" ex- perience. He wrote: \"In the Indian Mysteries, the Third degree, the Initiate is said to be 'born again.'\" 101 The ceremony in the ancient mysteries has been desc ribed by the Masonic writer Manly P. Hall: \"In the ancient system of initiation, the truth seeker must pass through a second birth, and those who attained this exalted state were known thereaft er as 'the twice born.' This new birth ... must be personally earned through a complete regeneration of character and conduct.\" 102 This \"new birth\" ceremony involves a sy mbolic death, according to the Mason Kenneth Mackenzie. He wrote: \"In the ancient mysteries, the aspirant could not participate in the highest secrets until he had bee n placed in the Coffin. In this he was symbolically said to die, and his resurrection was to the light.\" 103 Modern day Masons participate in an alm ost similar ceremony to the one described by these Masonic writ ers. In the Third Degree, called the Master Mason degree, i nside the Blue Lodge, the candidate is actually knocked off o f his feet by several of the Masons in attendance. He is wrapp ed up in a blanket and moved to the western end of th e Temple. There, after further ceremony, he is \"raised up\" by a secret grip called \"The Master's grip, or the lion's paw.\" 104 29"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 THE ANCIENT MYSTERIES Those who learned the mysteries also learned that t hey had a secret project, one that was described by Alb ert Pike in his book entitled MORALS AND DOGMA. Mr. Pike wrote: \"Behold our object, the end, the result, of the gre at speculations ... of antiquity; the ultimate annihil ation of evil, and restoration of Man to his first estate, b y a Redeemer, a Masayah, a Christos, the incarnate Word , Reason, or Power of Deity.\" 105 Mr. Hall told his readers that those who had been initiated into the mysteries were the secret power behind the governments of the past. He wrote this about these ancient initiates in his book entitled WHAT THE ANCIENT WIS - DOM EXPECTS OF ITS DISCIPLES: \"[they] ... are the invisible powers behind the thrones of earth, and men are but marionettes, danc ing while the invisible ones pull the strings. We see t he dancer, but the master mind that does the work remains concealed by the cloak of silence.\" 106 Other writers have confirmed the thoughts of Mr. Ha ll. A Masonic scholar named George Steinmetz also acknowl edged that these mysteries exist, and that some of the me mbers inside the Masonic lodges are custodians of the sec rets. He has written this in his book entitled FREEMASONRY, ITS HIDDEN MEANING: \"Ancient secret doctrine, which is concealed in Ma- sonic allegory and symbolism .... It was but to pre serve these truths for future generations that Masonry wa s perpetuated.\" 107 Another who has officially connected the Ancient My steries to the Masonic Order was Manly P. Hall, who wrote t his: \"Much of the ritualism of Freemasonry is based on the trials to which candidates were subjected by th e ancient hierophants [defined as the high priests of the mysteries] before the keys of wisdom were enthroned to them.\" 108 30"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 THE ANCIENT MYSTERIES The Ancient Mysteries had a beginning, according to Mr. Mackey. He wrote about where they started: \"The first of which ... are those of Isis and Osiri s in Egypt. The most important of these mysteries wer e the Osiric in Egypt.\" 109 Another writer, Edmond Ronayne, an ex-Mason, confir med that the Masons were involved in the worship of Osi ris, when he wrote this in his book entitled THE MASTERS CARP ET: Masonry's \"... ceremonies, symbols, and the cele- brated legend of Hiram in the Master Mason's degree , were directly borrowed from the 'Ancient Mysteries, ' or the secret worship of Baal, Osiris or Tammuz.\" 110 Albert Pike then detailed where the mysteries went after their beginnings in Egypt. He wrote this in MORALS AND DOGMA: \"From Egypt, the Mysteries went to Phoenicia, and were celebrated at Tyre. Osiris changed his name, a nd became Adoni or Dionusos, still the representative of the sun. In Greece and Sicily, Osiris took the name of Bacchus ....\" 111 So the Ancient Mysteries conceal an important mystery kept secret from the average person. The mystics c laim that this mystery has been concealed from the world for centuries. Even though they had taken the mystery to other con - tinents, those who believed in this religion were y et to take it to America. That was yet to come. 31"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Chapter 5 Secret Societies \"An invisible hand is guiding the populace.\" Lafayette Arthur Edward Waite, a prolific writer on secret so cieties, has written this: \"Beneath the broad tide of human history there flow the stealthy undercurrents of the secret socie ties, which frequently determine in the depths the change s that take place upon the surface.\" 112 Another who wrote about the power just underneath t he surface was President Woodrow Wilson, who made this startling statement: \"... there is a power so organized, so subtle, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not sp eak 32"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 SECRET SOCIETIES above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.\" 113 So these two writers has warned America that secret societies had been arranging the major events of th e past. And President Wilson warned those who were quick to con- demn these organizations that they had better be ca utious. Albert Pike also connected the secret societies wit h a secret belief in his book entitled MORALS AND DOGMA . He wrote that all secret orders and associations: \"... had two doctrines, one concealed and reserved for the Masters, ... the other public ....\" 114 One such secret society with two doctrines was the Illumi- nati, and Professor Weishaupt, its founder, boasted of his organization's secrecy. He realized that this secre cy would enable them to decide the fate of nations and becau se their deliberations were secret, no outsider could interf ere. He wrote: \"The great strength of our Order lies in its concea l- ment; let it never appear in its own name, but alwa ys covered by another name, and another occupation.\" 115 Weishaupt later wrote about that secrecy in a lette r to a fellow member of the Illuminati: \"Nothing can bring this about [the new world order] but hidden societies. Hidden schools of wisd om are the means which will one day free men from thei r bonds [the \"bonds\" of religion, as will be detailed later.] Princes and nations shall vanish from the earth.\" 116 So the secret societies were created to bring the w orld to the new society known as the New World Order. The members of these organizations obviously feel that their goals are so noble that they may perform whatever tasks a re required of them to bring that goal to fruition. Th is means that murder, plunder, and lying all become acceptab le as long as these methods assist its members in obtaining th eir goal. But the Masons want the world to know that they are not one of the societies involved in c hanging the world's 33"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 SECRET SOCIETIES civilization. They are quick to rush to their own d efense. Albert G. Mackey attempted to clear the air about t hose who had been charging them with some of these activitie s. He wrote in the ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF FREEMASONRY: \"There is no charge made more frequently against Freemasonry than that of its tendency to revolution , and conspiracy, and to political organizations whic h may affect the peace of society or interfere with t he rights of governments. It has been the unjust accusation of every enemy of the Institution in all times past, that its obje ct and aim is the possession of power and control in the a ffairs of state. It is in vain that history records no instance of this unlawful connection between Freemasonry and politics; it is in vain that the libeler is directe d to the Ancient Constitutions of the Order, which expressly forbid such connections.\" 117 So the public is to believe that just because their Consti- tution forbids such activity, the Masons do not eng age in it. But the evidence that connects the Masonic Lodges t o such activity continues to accumulate, Mr. Mackey's deni als not- withstanding. 34"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Chapter 6 Concealed Mysteries \"In all time, truth has been hidden under symbols.\" 118 \"... symbols ... are nevertheless ingenious vei ls that cover the truth.\" 119 Thus wrote Albert Pike, the Sovereign Grand Command er of the Southern Jurisdiction of the Scottish R ite of Free- masonry. There certainly seems to be a power in knowing some - t h i n g that you can't tell your family, friends, chi ldren or busi- ness acquaintances. Adam Weishaupt said it best wit h this selection from his writings: \"Of all the means I know to lead men, the most effectual is a concealed mystery.\" 120 35"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 CONCEALED MYSTERIES The power of hidden symbols was alluded to by anoth er writer, this time Foster Bailey in his book entitle d THE SPIRIT OF FREEMASONRY: \"A symbol veils or hides a secret, and is that which veils certain mysterious forces. These energi es when released can have a potent effect.\" 121 There are many who can attest to that simple truth: organizations with concealed or secret initiation c eremonies abound in America. College fraternities and sororit ies teach the college student to accept secret initiation cer emonies and hidden knowledge at a young age. The Masons, intend ed for adult males, have similar organizations for their y oung sons and daughters, and other secret organizations for t heir wives. All of these organizations tend to prepare their ma le members for further service in the master secret or ganization: the Masons. However, the Masons are quick to point out that the y conceal their truths from the general public. Manly P. Hall wrote this : \"It is for the Adepts [an adept is defined by the dictionary as one who is an expert. But, there is a n \"esoteric\" definition that shall be discussed later ] one to understand the meaning of the Symbols.\" 122 He further instructed his readers that understandin g the symbols could make one wise: \"... an understanding of these symbols is the beginning of wisdom\" 123 Max Toth, a writer about the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt also wrote about the purpose of symbols: \"The knowledge of the ancient mysteries was nev- er revealed to the layman except through the media of symbols. Symbolism fulfilled both the need to conceal sacred truths from the uninitiated and to offer a language for those qualified to understand it.\" 124 36"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 CONCEALED MYSTERIES Whatever these secrets are, one writer on the subje ct feels it is time to make them public. Alice Bailey, one o f the key writers supporting the New Age movement, wrote this : \"The hour for the ancient mysteries has arrived... These Ancient Mysteries were ... hidden in numbers, in ritual, in words, and in symbology; the se veil the secret ....\" 125 Another writer who writes on the Order, Carl H. Cla udy, told anyone who read the Masonic literature that th ey had best understand the language, or they would miss th e true meaning of the words. He wrote: \"He who hears but the words of Freemasonry misses their meaning entirely. 126 Rex Hutchens, a 32nd degree Mason who has written a hook for the Masons, one so important that it was u sed to replace one written by Henry Clausen, a former Sove reign Commander, also informed his readers that his writi ngs also concealed a secret: \"The word reveal means to 're-veil,' that is, to give one explanation and yet continue to maintain t he mystery of the symbol by not explaining it in a ful l and complete manner.\" 127 So, the language code must be broken if one is to l earn the truth about the Masonic Order. The reason that this is so is because the Masons have admitted that they have con- cealed the true meaning of some of their language. However, it is possible to know the true meanings o f at least some of the hidden language. And the reader c an be certain that the discovered interpretations are cor rect because the Masons themselves have revealed the hidden mean ings of some of their symbols in some of their own literatu re. The secret societies that have concealed their purp oses in hidden meanings, concealed writings, and private initiation cermonies, are admittedly powerful. One who recogni zed that power was Benjamin Disraeli, the Prime Minister of England 37"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 CONCEALED MYSTERIES in the late 1880's, who said this in the House of C ommons on July 14, 1856: \"There is in Italy a power which we seldom men- tion in this House ....

It is useless to deny, because it is impossible to con ceal, that a great part of Europe -- the whole of Italy a nd France and a great portion of Germany, to say nothi ng of other countries ~ is covered with a network of t hese secret societies .... ... what are their objects? They do not want constitutional government; ... they want to change the tenure of the land, to drive out the present owners of the soil and to put an end to ecclesiastical [meani ng religious] establishments.\" 128 The Masons know about concealing secrets from the r est of the world. Carl Claudy, a Masonic writer, told h is readers that secrets are inside secrets which are inside ot her secrets. He wrote: \"Cut through the outer shell and find a meaning; cut through that meaning and find another; under it if you dig deep enough you may find a third, a fourth - who shall say how many teachings?\" 129 And even the Communists use concealment. Nikolai Lenin, the Marxist Communist who communized the Russian nation in the years following the Russi an Rev- olution of 1917, wrote this: \"We have to use any ruse, dodge, trick, cunning, unlawful method, concealment, and veiling of the truth.\" 130 The use of secrecy to conceal thoughts from certain of the members of an organization or from the public is th e device of those who have something to hide. That something is so horrible, so terrible, that kn owledge of that secret must be kept from those who would ha ve the most to lose by knowledge of that secret. In the case of the secret societies, it is a belief in Lucifer, also known as Satan, the devil. 38"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 CONCEALED MYSTERIES In the case of Communism, it is the truth that the people living in a Communist nation know that the system d oes not work. But those in a non-Communist nation targeted for a Communist government are not to learn that simple t ruth. They are to be told that the system is the culminat ion of man's upward search for a perfect society. And they must be deluded into believing that there is no cost in the change from their. current form of government to the Commu nist form. But history has recorded the brutality of the Com- munists and the fact that millions of people have h ad to die as the Communists installed that form of government . The evidence to support that contention will be dis cussed later in this study. Secrecy is certainly not a part of the Chrisian rel igion. It is possible to know that nothing that Jesus said ha s been hidden from the Christians. He told the high priest in John 18:20: \"... and in secret have I said nothing.\" The intentional concealing of an organization's bel iefs and purposes by the use of hidden language and conceal ed sym- bols is reserved primarily to the secret soci eties, and the nationwide Masonic Lodges are indeed a secret socie ty. The Masons know that they must conceal their horrib le secret from the people. That secret is simply the fact that c ertain of their members worship Lucifer. And that they keep that secret from the overwhelming majority of their own members . And certainly the public is not to know this fact. And the evidence to support that conclusion is ampl e. But only to the one who cares enough to look for it . 39 "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Chapter 7 Serpents, Stars and Suns So the student of history has to discover the hidde n meanings behind the symbols in the Masonic literatu re and in the secret initiation ceremonies to understand t he Masonic Order. One of the first symbols that needs to be examined is the symbol of the serpent, also called a snake or drago n. Manly P. Hall wrote that the use of this symbol is as old as early man when he wrote this in his book entitle d THE SECRET TEACHINGS OF ALL AGES: \"Among nearly all these ancient peoples the serpent was accepted as a symbol of wisdom ....\" 131 Here Mr. Hall states that the serpent was a symbol of \"wisdom.\" It will be remembered that Lord Maitreya, the future New Age leader, also claimed to possess \"wis dom.\" Mr. Hall continued: 40"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 SERPENTS, STARS AND SUNS \"Serpent worship in some form has permeated nearly all parts of the earth.\" \"The serpent is the symbol and prototype of the Universal Savior, who redeems the world by giving creation the knowledge of itself and the realizatio n of good and evil.\" 132 And then Mr. Hall links the serpent with the Ancien t Mysteries previously discussed. He continues with t he com- ment that the serpent was worshipped by the priests of that religion: \"The priests of the Mysteries were symbolized as a serpent, sometimes called Hydra.\" 133 He then pointed out that the Ancient Mysteries have been passed on to various other cultures, and that they have been brought forward to the present day: \"The Serpent Kings [notice that Mr. Hall cap- italized the two words, as one would do for a deity or for royalty] reigned over the earth. It was these Serpent Kings who founded the Mys- tery Schools which later appeared as the Egyptian a nd Brahmin Mysteries .... The serpent was their symbol .... They were the true Sons of Light, and from the m have descended a long line of adepts and initiates duly tried and proven according to the law.\" 134 Another writer, Wilfred Gregson, informed his reade rs why Mr. Hall capitalized the two words \"Serpent Kin gs\" when he wrote: \"One symbol of great prominence throughout all ancient civilizations is the snake of serpent, wher e it has symbolized 'Divine Wisdom.'\" 135 So. Mr. Hall had reason to capitalize the words, be cause he had discovered that the serpent repres ented divinity. Notice also that Mr. Gregson, even though he chose not to capitalize the word \"serpent,\" confirmed that Mr. H all's use of the capital letter was correct when he stated that there was a connection between \"Divine Wisdom\" and the serpen t. 41"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 SERPENTS, STARS AND SUNS Mr. Hall made the same connection in these comments : \"The serpent is true to the principles of wisdom, for it tempts man to the knowledge of himself.\" 136 A serpent is \"often used by the ancients to sym- bolize wisdom.\" 137 The symbol of the serpent has another concealed tru th, according to Kenneth Mackenzie. He identified that truth in this quote when he described a Brazen Serpent: \"It was a type of Mediator, and a promise of re- demption.\" The word Brazen is defined as \"bold, or impudent.\" And Impudent is defined as \"shamelessly bold or disresp ectful.\" It will be remembered that Lucifer was an anoited c herub in heaven, who fell because he sought godly power. The story is covered in Isaiah 14: 12-14 of the Old Testament : \"How are thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! How art thou cut down to the ground .. .. For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend in to heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of G od: ... I will be like the most High.\" Therefore, it can be safely said that Lucifer would be con- sidered to be \"shamelessly bold\" and \"disrespectful .\" It appears that the Brazen Serpent could be Lucifer ! Another author, John Anthony West, wrote a book ent i- tled SERPENT IN THE SKY, in which he also connected the serpent with \"wisdom.\" He wrote: \"... the serpent represents intellect, the faculty by which man discriminates. There is a higher and a lo w- er intellect. Thus, symbolically, there is a serpent that crawls, and the higher intellect, that which allows man to know God - the heavenly serpent, the serpent in the sky.\" 138 42"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 SERPENTS, STARS AND SUNS The somewhat veiled worship of this serpent in the sky inside the Masonic lodges was alluded to by another Masonic writer, Kenneth Mackenzie, in his book entitled THE ROYAL MASONIC CYCLOPAEDIA. He wrote this: \"Among the charges preferred against the Order of Knights Templar, for which Jacques de Molay suffere d martyrdom, was that of worshipping an idol or image called Baphomet. It has been suggested that Baphomet is none other than the Ancient of Days, or Creator. More cannot be said here without improperly re- vealing what we [meaning we Masons] are bound to hele, conceal and never reveal.\" 139 So, according to this Mason, the snake or serpent i s some- how a symbol of the subject of the Masonic worship, and ap- parently this fact is the secret that the Masons ca nnot reveal to the rest of the world. A Christian minister, Reverend Alexander Hislop, wr ote a book that included some discussion on the subject o f serpent worship. In that book, entitled TWO BABYL ONS, he ex- plained that serpent worship was not something that is re- cent in time. It was an ancient practice. \"Along with the sun [this symbol will be discussed later,] as the great fire-god, and, in due time, id en- tified with him, was the serpent worshipped. In the mythology of the primitive world, the serpent is un i- versally the symbol of the sun. ... as the sun was the great enlightener of the physical world, so the serpent was held to have bee n the great enlightener of the spiritual, by giving m an- kind the 'knowledge of good and evil.\" 140 He then discussed a coin minted in Tyre, the center of the ancient Phoenician culture. (This coin was also the subject of an article in the September, 1986 issue of The Goo d News magazine.) It depicted a serpent entwined around a tree stump. To the left of the stump stood an empty corn ucopia, and to the right a flourishing palm tree. The snake on the coin is the symbol of the powerful god whom the Ro mans 43"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 SERPENTS, STARS AND SUNS called Aesculapius. The name means \"the man-instructing snake, or the \"snake that instructs man.\" The article then reported: \"In mythology, Aesculapius was believed to be the child of the Sun, and thus the 'enlightener' of man kind. As the legend goes, Aesculapius was ultimately stru ck down by a thunderbolt thrown by an angry Zeus, king of the gods, and cast into the underworld.\" 141 The tree stump represented the fallen \"god\" and his ruined kingdom. In the mythologies of many ancient civili- zations, the image of a fallen tree was used to sym bolize the cutting off of a great god or hero, someone cut off in the midst of their power. The snake on the coin was sho wn twist- ing itself around the dead stump, exerting its powe r in an attempt to restore his fallen kingdom. The cornucopia is an ancient symbol of plenty, but it was empty on the coin. This has been interpreted as mea ning that the abundance had been cut off because the great \"g od\" has been cut off, However, the implication is that the horn of plenty will return when the fallen \"god\" is restore d to his \"rightful\" position. The palm tree shown on the coin is a well known sym bol of victory. So it appears that the coin was minted to depict the anticipated return of the fallen snake-god to t he world. The Bible talks about a fallen serpent in the book of Rev- elation, chapter 12, verse 9. However, in this case , the snake is connected to another symbol of the serpent: \"a g reat drag- on.\" \"And the great dragon was cast out, that old ser- pent, called the Devil, and Satan ....\" Is the serpent worshipped in the Ancient Mysteries and a symbol in the Masonic ceremonies a symbol of Satan, the devil? As has already been discussed, there is inde ed evidence that this is the case. Another symbol that needs to be analyzed is the sta r. On the page opposite page 124 in Mackey's ENCYCLO- PAEDIA is a drawing illustrating the \"symbols of Fr eema- sonry.\" Included in the twenty or so Masonic symbol s is a drawing of a shooting star. 44"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 SERPENTS, STARS AND SUNS It can be fairly claimed that a blazing or shooting star would be one that was on the move inside the univer se. One of the directions it could move would be towards th e earth. If itwas moving towards the earth, it could be called a \"falling star. Lucifer is a \"fallen angel,\" according to Isaiah, a n Old Testament prophet, who wrote this in Isaiah 14:12: \"How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer ....\" Notice that Isaiah also said that Lucifer fell from heaven. And other parts of the Bible report that he fell to the earth. So, it is conceivable that the symbol of the \"fall ing\" or \"blazing\" star could be a symbol of Lucifer. A variety of authors have used their writings to di scuss the star as a symbol. Professor Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the Illuminati, was one who explained what he co nsidered the star to be a symbol of: \"... the Flaming Star is the Torch of Reason.\" 142 Mr. Mackey wrote that the star: \"was a symbol of God.\" He then connected the blazing star to another symbo l when he wrote: \"The Blazing Star ... refers us to the sun ....\" 143 And then he connected it with the secret initiation cere- monies inside the Masonic lodge: \"In the Fourth Degree of the same Rite [the Scot- tish Rite of Freemasonry] the [Blazing Star] is aga in said to be a symbol of the light of Divine Providen ce pointing out the way of truth.\" 144 And Mr. Hutchens, the Masonic writer who has author ed the recent book on Masonry, further interpreted the symbol of the star: 45"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 SERPENTS, STARS AND SUNS \"The star as a type of the myriad suns that light other countless systems of worlds is an emblem of t hat Masonic Light in search of which every Mason travels -- the correct knowledge of the Deity, and of His laws that control the universe.\" 145 Closely allied with the symbol of the star is the s ymbol of the sun. Albert Pike identified it with the worship of the past in this collection of quotes from his writings: \"The worship of the sun became the basis of all the religions of antiquity.\" 146 \"... thousands of years ago, men worshipped the Sun .... Originally they looked beyond the orb to t he invisible God .... They personified him as Brahma, Amun, Osiris, Bel, Adonis, Malkarth, Mithras, and Apollo. Krishna is the Hindu Sun-God.\" 147 \"... the Gauls worshipped the Sun under the name of Belin or Belinis.\" 148 \"The sun is the ancient symbol of the life-giving and generative power of the Deity. The Sun was His manifestation and visible image.\" 149 \"The Sun is the hieroglyphical sign of Truth, be- cause it is the source of Light.\" 150 So, Mr. Pike identified the sun as a symbol of a de ity that should be worshipped. He chose to capitalize t he first letter in the word, the \"s,\" as one would in recogn izing the name of a deity. Albert Mackey repeated Mr. Pike's contentions with com- ments like these about \"sun worship:\" \"... [it was] the oldest and by far the most prev- alent of all the ancient religions. Eusebius says t hat the Phoenicians and the Egyptians were the first wh o ascribed divinity to the sun.\" \"Hardly any of the symbols of Masonry are more important in their signification or more extensive in their application than the sun as the source of mat e- rial light, it minds the Mason of that intellectual light of which he is in constant search. 46"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 SERPENTS, STARS AND SUNS The sun is then presented to us in Masonry first as a symbol of light, but then more emphatically as a symbol of sovereign authority.\" 151 So, the sun was a symbol of something that only the be- lievers in the religion known as the Ancient Myster ies un- derstood. These believers, called adepts, certainly knew that the people would not accept their mystery religion, so they had to conceal it from them. So the task became one of cre- ating a religion around a belief that they knew the people would accept, because it would make some sense, at least as far as the adepts would explain it. But their basic purpose was to create a popular religion as a cover for the ir secret worship. The secret religion would be built around a belief in the sun. The sun would be a perfect thing to build a religio n around because of its basic nature. It is very visi ble, and has a very important role in man's life. It rises in th e morning (it appears to be born) and then sets during the evenin g, (it ap- pears to die) and then appears to be \"born again\" t he next morning. It also appears to wander in the sky, sett ing further north (or south) each night. It then returns back t o any given position twice a year. So the sun appears to have a major birth or death t wice each day and twice each year. It would be very easy for the adepts to explain to the peo- ple that only something bigger than mankind, a god, had the ability to die and come back to life. So, the ad epts would teach the people that they had to pray to the god o r it would choose not to return. They encouraged a worship of the sun so that it would return to mankind again, either on ce a day, or once every six months. Albert Pike confirmed this view with this explanati on of why early man worshipped the sun: \"To them [meaning early man] ... the journeyings of the Sun, were voluntary and not mechanical ....\" 152 So early man considered the sun to be something th at moved voluntarily. In other words, the sun did not have to return each morning. Man must have quickly determin ed that since the sun did not have to return, man should st art asking 47"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 SERPENTS, STARS AND SUNS it to return. Man certainly must have figured out j ust how important the sun was to his life and well-being an d he cer- tainly must have determined that if the sun chose n ot to re- turn, all of mankind would perish. So it was an eas y jump from a belief that the necessary sun was an entity that chose to move across the daytime sky, to a belief that it would re- turn only if man prayed to it to return. But there is something even more interesting to be con- sidered that Pike didn't explain with that comment. Obviously, to make the new religion work, the belie vers would have to be able to predict the movements of t he sun. It wouldn't be too long before some of the common peop le would start noticing that the sun was neither an actual b eing nor a god to be worshipped, but something that moved acco rding to precise laws. If the common people figured that out , they would not need the adepts who had computed the sun' s peri- odic cycles. So, to keep their power intact, they w ould teach the people that if they did not accommodate their w ishes, they would make certain that the sun did not return . They could even predict, as their measurements became mo re so- phisticated, the exact time and date when the moon would go between the sun and the earth, causing the sun to \" disap- pear.\" They could then fool the people into believi ng that they were the cause of the disappearance. They could the n explain to the people that if they did not continue to pay them sort sort of tribute, they would not intercede in their behalf, and the sun would not reappear. To keep the minds of the common people away from fi gur- ing out that the whole religion was a scam, the ade pts would conduct beautiful and ornate ceremonies around the worship of the sun. And they would expect the people to pay them for the elaborate rituals. And to make their rituals va lid, the adepts would always claim that the sun obeyed their prayers, thereby convincing the people of their need to keep the adepts around. The people would continue to pay tri bute to these adepts as long as they appeared to be success ful. Now, if the adepts knew that the sun was a symbol o f something that the people would not support, such a s a belief that Lucifer, the devil, was the god that they wors hipped, they would have to continue with their charade, so that the people would not decide to stop worshipping. Becaus e if the people figured it out, they would no longer support their 48"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 SERPENTS, STARS AND SUNS activities. They would have to keep their belie fs from the people, and conceal their secret worship in hidden symbols. So sun worship as a religion prospered. Mr. Hutchens discussed that position in his book: \"In the Tabernacle the brethren, clothed in black, mourn Osiris, who is representative of the sun, of light, of life, of good and beauty. They reflect up on the way the earth may again be gladdened by his presence. Mr. Pike connected the sun to Osiris, mentioned by Mr. Hutchens as worthy of being mourned: \"The three lights at the Altar [inside the Masonic Temple] represent Osiris, Isis and Horus. Osiris wa s represented by the Sun.\" 154 Mr. Mackey went a little further and informed his r eaders that: \"Osirus was the sun ....\" 155 In his book entitled INTRODUCTION TO FREEMA- SONRY, Carl H. Claudy, the author, himself a Mason, connected the sun worship with the ceremonies insid e the Masonic Lodge: \"The lodge ... sets him [meaning the initiate] upon the path that leads to Light but it is for him to . .. travel the winding path to the symbolic East.\" 156 The physical sun rises in the east, and the Masons ex- plain that their search for light begins in the eas t. And notice that Mr. Claudy capitalizes the word \"East,\" appare ntly in reverence to the spot where they believe that this god resides. The Masons tell the world that they circumambulate (de- fined as walking around) the Temple floor during th eir initia- tion ceremonies. Mr. Claudy explains why this rite is per- formed: \"When the candidate first circles the lodge room about the altar, he walks step by step with a thou- 49"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 SERPENTS, STARS AND SUNS sand shades of men who have thus worshipped the Most High by humble imitation. Thus thought of circumambulation is no longer a mere parade but a ceremony of significance, linking all who take part in it with the spiritual aspirations of a dim and distant past.\" 157 He further instructs his readers as to why this cer emony is part of their ceremony: \"Early man circled altars on which burned the fire which was his God, from east to west by way of the south [notice that the north is not included in the cer- emony. The significance of that omission will be di s- cussed later.] Circumambulation became a part of al l religious observances.\" In another part of his book, entitled INTRODUCTION TO FREEMASONRY, Mr. Claudy reported that this style of walking was traceable to the ancient religions of t he past. He wrote: \"Circumambulation ... was in the ceremonies of an- cient Egypt.\" 158 So, this practice of the modern Masons is based upo n the ancient religious practices of the Ancients. So the Masons are telling us that early man walked around in a circle because he was worshipping the s un. Then they tell us that they are doing it for the same re ason. There are reasons that the north as a location to b e vis- ited in their walk around the temple floor is not i ncluded in their initiation rites, and six of the great Masoni c writers have told us why this is so. Captain William Morgan offered his readers this exp lana- tion with this comment from his book: \"... we, therefore, Masonically, term the north a place of darkness.\" 159 Mr. Mackey confirmed that statement in his book: 50"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 SERPENTS, STARS AND SUNS \"The north is Masonically called a place of dark- ness.\" 160 And Mr. Pike confirmed the comments made by the oth er two Masons with this declaration: \"To all Masons, the North has immediately been the place of darkness, and of the great lights of t he Lodge, none is in the North.\" 161 And Kenneth Mackenzie added his confirming thoughts : \"The North was always esteemed a place of dark- ness.\" 162 Mr. Hutchens became the fifth Masonic writer to con firm this detail: \"As in other degrees, the closing ritual provides a summary of the lessons taught in the degree. We hea r in the West the eagles gather and the doom of tyran - ny is near. In the South, truth struggles against e rror and oppression. In the North, fanaticism and intole r- ance wane. In the East, the people begin to know their rights and to be conscious of their dignity a nd that the sun's rays will soon smite the summits of the mountains.\" 163 Mr. Hutchens informed his readers that the North w as where \"fanaticism and intolerance\" resided. What h e meant by this and what the symbol of the North represents will be explored in later paragraphs of this study. And the sixth Masonic writer who confirmed that the North was a place of darkness was Carl Claudy, who wrote this in his book entitled INTRODUCTION TO FREE- MASONRY: \"... the place of darkness, the North.\" 164 And the reason the Masons do not include the North in their rites is found in the Bible in Isaiah 14:13: 51"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 SERPENTS, STARS AND SUNS \"I [meaning Lucifer] will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north.\" The God of the Bible sits in the North, and Lucifer hopes one day to acquire the throne of God for his throne . But, un- til then, the \"North is a place of darkness.\" But, while the north is an excluded territory, the east is the \"place of light,\" and is to be revered. Mr. Hut chens tells his readers why that is so: \"... the East — the source of light and thus knowl- edge.\" 165 Albert Mackey quotes Etienne Francois Bazot, a Fren ch Masonic writer in his ENCYCLOPAEDIA: \"The veneration which the Masons have for the East ... bears a relation to the primitive religion whose first degeneration was sun-worship.\" 166 Rex Hutchens then tells his readers that the Masons de- ploy lights around the Lodge room during the initia tion cer- emony for the 25th degree, called the Knight of the Sun. He writes: \"The ceiling should be decorated to represent the heavens with the moon, the principal planets and th e constellations Taurus and Orion. A single powerful light, a great globe of glass, representing the sun , is in the South. In a physical sense the greater light comes from the sun and the transparencies provide lesser light ... symbolically, the sun or great light is the Truth a nd the lesser lights are man's symbolic representation of Truth.\" 167 Mr. Mackey further discusses this Rite of Circumamb ula- tion, as he calls it, in his ENCYCLOPAEDIA. He says that the rite: \"... exists in Freemasonry. 52"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 SERPENTS, STARS AND SUNS ... the people always walked three times round the altar while singing a sacred hymn. In making this p ro- cession, great care was taken to move in imitation of the course of the sun.\" 168 He then assisted the reader with understanding this prac- tice in the Masonic temples: \"This Rite of Circumambulation undoubtedly refers to the doctrine of sun-worship ....\" 169 However, in another of the books that he wrote, Mr. Mac- key directly states that the rite is connected to s un worship. This is what he wrote in a book entitled MANUAL OF THE LODGE: \"The circumambulation among the pagan nations referred to the great doctrines of Sabaism or sun w or- ship.\" 170 Sabaism is defined by Mr. Mackey in his ENCYCLO- PAEDIA as: \"SABAISM: The worship of the sun, moon and stars, 'the host of heaven.' It was practiced in Pe rsia, Chaldea, India and other Oriental countries, at an ear- ly period of the world's history.\" 171 He then added this rather cryptic comment: \"... and although the dogma of sun-worship does not of course exist in Freemasonry, we find an allu sion to it in the Rite of Circumambulation which it pre - serves ....\" 172 One can understand what Mr. Mackey meant by that comment: the Masons do not worship the sun, they wo rship the Sun! So he was telling the truth, but concealing it in a sym- bolic language. Mr. Hutchens then volunteered the information that in the 12th of the 32 degrees the Rite of Circumambula tion is preserved. He writes: 53"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 SERPENTS, STARS AND SUNS \"In all the Scottish Rite Degrees thus far, the candidate has made twenty-one prescribed circuits around the altar; this degree adds seven for a tota l of twenty-eight. This practice, called circumambulation, is derived from the ancients and existed among the Romans, Semites, Hindus, and others. It is thought to have been a rite of purification. The sun was believed to travel around the earth; th e initiates imitated the movement of the sun when the y made circuits around the altar.\" 173 Furthermore, in the ninth degree, other symbols of the sun are involved in the ceremony. Mr. Hutchens tell s his readers: \"After the obligation is taken, the nine candles of yellow wax are lit. Yellow is representative of the sun, hence light and knowledge.\" 174 In the tenth degree, further symbols representing t he sun are utilized, according to this author: \"There are three sets of five lights: the wax is ye l- low, meaning knowledge and also, as the color of th e sun, represents the Deity.\" 175 Other clues that the sun and the serpent are both k nown symbols of the Masonic Lodge are given by the title s of two of the 32 degrees inside the Masonic Lodge. The 25th degree initiate is called a Knight of the Brazen Serpent, and the 28th degree initiate is called a K night of the Sun. There is another symbol of the sun inside the Mason ic Lodge. The Worshipful Master, the equivalent of the Presi- dent of the Lodge, sits in the east side of the tem ple. We are told why that is: \"The Worshipful Master represents the sun at its rising, the Senior Warden [another officer of the Lodge] represents the sun at its setting, and the J un- 54"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 SERPENTS, STARS AND SUNS ior Warden [still another officer of the Lodge] rep re- sents the sun at meridian [the half-way point.]\" 176 Other individuals and organizations besides the Mas onic Lodges are also involved, in varying degrees, with sun wor- ship, or with an acknowledgement that the sun plays a cen- tral role in their understanding of the nature of t he world. Elizabeth Clare Prophet has been described as being a leader in the New Age Movement, and she has written this in a newsletter she publishes called THE COMING REV O- LUTION: \"the healing of the nations begins with the healing of ourselves. We must draw forth from the Great Cen - tral Sun — that eternal Light with which we were anointed from the beginning.\" 177 Adolf Hitler, the head of the German government pri or to and during World War II, and who was directly respo nsible for the murder of over 50 million people, was also a sun- worshipper. Very early in his life, he joined a sec ret organi- zation called the Thule Society. And forty years af ter the war, some historians are finally delving into its str ange beliefs. Two of these writers, Michel Bertrand and Jean Angelini, have produced a book entitled THE OCCULT A ND THE THIRD REICH, and one of their conclusions is: \"In the Nazi cosmology the sun played a prime role ... as a sacred symbol of the Aryans, in contr ast to the feminine and magical symbolism of the moon, revered by the Semitic peoples.\" The Nazi Party was the name of the National Sociali st German Workers' Party, the party that Mr. Hitler jo ined. It became the controlling party of the German governme nt prior to and during the war. ... the Fuhrer [German for leader, in this case meaning Mr. Hitler] saw in the Jewish people, with their black hair and swarthy complexion, the dark s ide of the human species, while the blond and blue-eyed Aryans constituted the light side of humanity. Hitl er undertook to extirpate [meaning to eliminate] from the 55"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 SERPENTS, STARS AND SUNS material world its impure elements ... to lead it b ack to glory.\" 178 But sun worship, as the Masons point out, is not ne w. The Bible talks about it as well. Ezekiel was an Old Testament prophet writing someti me during the period of 571 to 592 B.C. He tells about how he was taken by God to see a practice occurring near t he Tem- ple. This is what he wrote in Ezekiel 8:15-16: \"And He [the Lord God] brought me into the inner court of the Lord's house, and behold, at the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the a l- tar, were about five and twenty men, with their bac ks toward the temple of the Lord, and they worshipped the sun toward the east.\" And Ezekiel points out that the Lord God considered this practice \"an abomination.\" There is another reference to sun worship in the Ol d Tes- tament, this time in Deuteronomy 17: 2-4, 7. That r eference reads as follows: \"If there be found among you, ... man or woman ... that ... hath gone and served other gods, and wor- shipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of th e host of heaven ... and it be true ... that such an abomination is wrought in Israel ... so thou shalt put the evil aw ay from among you.\" So the God of the Bible has made it clear that sun wor- ship is something that He does not want His creatur es prac- ticing. The Bible even went so far as to say, in bo th instances, that He considered the practice to be an \"abomina- tion\" or an \"evil.\" But to show just how far this practice has invaded the Christian community, the following \"prayer\" was off ered up at a recent funeral in a local Christian church: \"Now you will feel no rain, for your Mother, the earth, will fold her arms around you. 56"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 SERPENTS, STARS AND SUNS Now you will feel no cold, for your Father, the Sun, will always warm you.\" Sun worship continues.

Other names for this creature a re Sa- tan, and the devil. One of the first explanations of just who this bein g known as Lucifer is, is found in the Old Testament in a b ook written by the prophet Isaiah, who wrote around 740 B.C. He wrote that Lucifer was created \"full of wisdom,\" and was \"perfect.\" He was created the \"anointed cherub that covereth t he throne of God,\" and that he actually was \"upon the holy mo untain of God.\" He later \"corrupted [his] wisdom by reason of [his] brightness.\" The Bible then records that God \"cast [him] to the ground.\" Isaiah wrote this in Isaiah 14:12: \"How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! How art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nations!\" 60"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 LUCIFER WORSHIP Notice that the fall of Lucifer weakened the \"natio ns of the world.\" This will be examined in other chapters of this study. \"For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven. I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congrega tion in the sides of the north. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.\" Luke, a writer in the New Testament, records in Luk e 10:18, that Jesus said that he beheld \"Satan [Lucif er's new name] as lightning fall from heaven.\" Peter records in II Peter 2:4 that God has \"spared not the angels [who were in- volved in Lucifer's revolt against God] that sinned , but cast them down\" as well. Paul, another New Testament writer, wrote this abou t Lu- cifer in II Corinthians 11:14, in about 57 A.D.: \"And no marvel, for Satan is transformed into an angel of light\". And in II Thessalonians 2:9, Paul wrote that Satan was capable of working \"lying wonders.\" In around 90 A.D., John, the author of the book kno wn as Revelation, wrote in Revelation 12:9, that Satan wa s a \"drag- on.\" Lucifer shows up in the original site of human habi tation on earth, called the Garden of Eden. The creator Go d placed Adam, the first man (and later Eve, the first woman ) in this garden, but told them that there were certain rules that they had to abide by. These are spelled out in Genesis 2 :16-17: \"And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eates t thereof thou shall surely die. Later, Lucifer spoke through a serpent to Eve , but in reality, to both men and women: 61"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 LUCIFER WORSHIP \"Yea, hath God said: Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?

And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die. For God doth know that in the day y e eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\" So, from the above information, it is possible to g lean a little knowledge about the nature of Lucifer: 1. He was cast down from heaven, because he desired to ascend directly into the seat of heavenly power, the throne of God. 2. He is referred to as the \"son of the morning.\" This appears to be a reference to Lucifer be- ing similar to the sun, which also arises every morning. 3. His desire is to sit on the north side of the mountain of God. 4. Lucifer can deceive the world, because he has been transformed into an \"angel of light.\" 5. Lucifer can work \"lying wonders.\" Now, with those basic understandings of Lucifer in place, it will be possible to examine the views of others about this fallen entity. However, not all agree with a picture of Lucifer be ing evil. Albert Pike wrote: \"... there is no rebellious demon of Evil, or Princ i- ple of Darkness and in eternal controversy with God . 179 In fact, Mr. Pike believes that Lucifer was not a f orce of evil, but could be a force for good. He wrote this in MORALS AND DOGMA: \"For the Initiates [those initiated into the true s e- crets of Masonry] this is not a person, but a force , created for good, but which may serve for evil.\" 180 62"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 LUCIFER WORSHIP To further amplify that belief of Mr. Pike's, it be comes important to quote a letter that he wrote on July 1 4, 1889 to the 23 Supreme Councils of the world. Judging from the con- tents of this letter, it appears that Mr. Pike was attempting to tell the leaders of the various Supreme Councils all over the world that they were to know that Lucifer was t he secret god of the Masons. This letter clearly indicates that he believed the position that Lucifer was a god who had come to earth for th e good of mankind. He wrote: \"That which we must say to the crowd is [pre- sumably Mr. Pike meant that the \"crowd\" was all of the non-Masons, or the public at largel We worship a God, but it is the God that one adores without supe r- stition.\" It appears that one of the purposes of this letter was to advise all of the top ranking Masons that they were to con- coct a story that the Masons worshipped the \"traditional\" God, so that none could ever accuse them of worship ping a cherub, a non-god, by the name of Lucifer. In other words, they were to deny that Lucifer was their god whenev er an outsider was smart enough to break through all of t he secrets and figure it out. So the secret inside the Masonic Order is that Luci fer is their secret god. Any non-Mason today who attempts to explain to any of their Masonic friends or relatives that this is the secret inside the Lodge will be met with an instant eous denial. Every Mason, whether they know the secret of the Lo dge or not, will obviously deny the accusation. Mr. Pike continued: \"You may repeat it to the 32nd, 31st and 30th degrees — The Masonic religion should be, by all of us i n i t i a t e s of the high degrees, maintained in the pu rity of the Luciferian doctrine.\" Here Mr. Pike seems to indicate that it is the 30th , 31st and 32nd degrees that are to be taught the \"Lucifer ian doc- trine.\" The direct evidence that the honorary 3 3rd degree is 63"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 LUCIFER WORSHIP formally taught that Lucifer is the Great Architect of the Universe will be presented later. But, here Pike se ems to say that that lesson is to be taught at an earlier degr ee. \"If Lucifer were not God, would Adonay [the God of the Christians and the Jews] and his priests cal um- niate [defined as spreading false and harmful state - ments about or to slander] him?\" Pike makes two incredible statements about Lucifer: 1. He is considered to be a god! and 2. The priests, and the rabbis, have it all back- wards, and are all slandering his name. As has been illustrated, the Bible states that Luci fer is nothing more than a fallen cherub. He is not a god. Yet Mr. Pike clearly states that Lucifer is a god! And secondly, those who claim that he is the \"wicke d one\" are \"slandering\" him. Those individuals have it all wrong! Mr. Pike continued: ... the true and pure philosophic religion is the belief in Lucifer, the equal of Adonay;\" Adonay, also spelled Adonai, is the Hebrew word for God. To show that Pike was referring to the God of the B ible, he wrote this in his book entitled MORALS AND DOGMA: \"... Adonai, the rival of Bal and Osiris.\" 181 As has been illustrated, Osiris is the sun-god, and the sun has been shown to be a symbol of Lucifer. Adonai is the \"ri- val\" of Lucifer, both in the Bible, and in the w ritings of Albert Pike. \"but Lucifer, God of Light and God of Good, is struggling for humanity against Adonay, the God of Darkness and Evil.\" 182 Here once again Mr. Pike writes that Lucifer and Ad onay are rivals, and that the religious world has it all backwards: 64"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 LUCIFER WORSHIP Lucifer is the \"good god,\" and Adonay is the God of \"evil and darkness.\" (The author would like to interrupt the narrative t o make an observation. That authenticity of that letter by Albert Pike tha t was just quoted has been questioned by a variety of wri ters. It has been reported that Mr. Pike made these comme nts in a \"encyclical\" hand carried to the a meeting of 23 Supreme Councils of the world on July 14, 1889 in Paris, Fr ance. This author is willing to concede that the only evi dence for the contents of this \"encyclical\" consists of i t being quoted in a book written by Frenchman named A.C. de la Riv e enti- tled LA FEMME ET L'ENFANT DANS LA RANC-MACON- NERIE UNrVERSELLE. That title translated from Frenc h to English means THE WOMAN AND CHILD IN UNIVERSAL FRENCH MASONRY. A copy of that page that contains t hat quote, and the cover of the book has been supplied to this author by a concerned researcher who had someone lo cate the book in France for him and make copies of the perti nent pages. The author has read another book that contains the English translation of that \"encyclical.\" That book is entitled OCCULT THEOCRASY and was written in 1933 by Edit h Starr Miller. She cites the book by Mr. de la Rive as her source. She obviously believed that the letter was true and con- tained the actual thoughts of Mr. Albert Pike. In other words, the only source for the letter is a French- man who quotes it in his book and not Mr. Albert Pi ke him- self. It must be assumed that Mr. Pike, if he were alive today and was asked whether the letter was his, would den y that he ever wrote such an \"encyclical,\" whether or not he had written it. But, the reader is admonished to rememb er that if he did indeed worship Lucifer, and wrote the \"encyc lical,\" he would certainly have to deny it. So that answer wou ld tell the researcher nothing. It is the contention of this writer, and others who are at- tempting to decipher the secret symbols of the Maso nic Or- der, that a small percentage of the Masons know tha t all of the symbols inside the Lodge refer to Lucifer. And it must be remembered that these Masons must of necessity do a ll that they can to deny that fact. 65"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 LUCIFER WORSHIP And certainly anyone today who believes that the co ntents of the letter are a fraud would do all that they co uld to dis- credit anyone who said that the thoughts were the a ctual thoughts of Pike.

Notice that Mr. Pike has writ ten else- where that he considered Lucifer to be the secret g od of the Masonic Lodge. So, it is not essential to this writer's position t hat this \"encyclical\" be proven to be valid. It is the autho r's contention that there is ample evidence from other sources, in cluding from Masons other than Mr. Pike, that the secret go d inside the Masonic lodges is Lucifer. That evidence is available to anyone who cares to l ocate it.) But there is another Mason who knows that Lucifer i s the \"good god\" of a particular segment of the Masons. P ike's fel- low 33rd degree Mason, Manly P. Hall, also felt tha t this \"god\" was a \"god of good.\" He wrote in his book ent itled THE SECRET TEACHINGS OF ALL AGES: \"Sun worship played an important part in nearly all the early pagan Mysteries. The Solar Diety ... was slain by wicked ruffians, who personified the evil principle of the universe. By means of certain rituals and ceremonies, symbolic o f purification and regeneration, this wonderful GOD O F GOOD was brought back to life and became the sav- iour of His people.\" 183 (emphasis by author.) This \"god\" who came back to life is not the Jesus o f the Bible, because Mr. Hall refers to him as \"The Solar Diety.\" He is referring to the death and resurrection of Os iris, cov- ered in detail in the Masonic rituals. Manly P. Hall has further identified Lucifer as the god of some of his fellow Masons. He has written this in h is book entitled THE LOST KEYS OF FREEMASONRY: \"When the Mason learns the key to the warrior on the block is the proper application of the dynam o of the living power, he has learned the mystery of his Craft. 66"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 LUCIFER WORSHIP The seething energies of Lucifer are in his hands and before he may step onward and upward, he must prove his ability to properly apply energy.\" 184 Mikhail Bakunin, the Russian anarchist, also addres sed this question of evil and good gods. He wrote: \"The Evil One is the satanic revolt against divine authority, revolt in which we see the fecund [defin ed as meaning fertile] germ of all human emancipations , the revolution. Socialists recognize each other by the words 'In the name of the one to whom a great wrong has been done.' Satan [is] the eternal rebel, the first freethinker and the emancipator of worlds. He makes men ashamed of his bestial ignorance and obedience; he emancipates him, stamps upon his brow the seal of liberty and humanity, in urging hi m to disobey and eat of the fruit of knowledge.\" 185 That thought that Lucifer was a \"good\" spirit, to w hom a great wrong\" was done, is the basic thought that ho lds the New Age together, according to Texe Marrs, the auth or of two major books on the subject. He has written: \"Many New Agers commend Lucifer because by tempting Eve he enabled man to evolve toward en- lightened knowledge and godhood.\" 186 Mr. Marrs discusses the thoughts of a leader in a m ys- tical organization called the Stelle Group, named E klal Kue- shana. He writes that this New Age leader says that : \"Lucifer is the head of a secret Brotherhood of Spirits .... the Brotherhood is named after Lucifer because the great Angel Lucifer has been responsibl e for the abolishment of Eden in order that men could begin on the road to spiritual advancement.\" 187 So, there is a basic disagreement about the nature of Lucifer, also known as Satan or the devil. The Bibl e depicts 67"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 LUCIFER WORSHIP him as a force for evil, and Mr. Pike, and others, pictures him as a force for good. But the connection between Lucifer and the Ancient Mys- teries needs to be further amplified. The Mysteries had a purpose: to create a super man, one capable of understanding the true nature of the uni verse, and to worship the \"true\" god. W.L. Wilmshurst, a Mason, wrote these thoughts in h is book entitled THE MEANING OF MASONRY: \"This -- the evolution of man into superman - was always the purpose of the ancient Mysteries, an d the real purpose of modern Masonry is, not the soci al and charitable purposes to which so much attention is paid, but the evolution of those who aspire to perf ect their own nature and transform it into more god-lik e quality.\" 188 He amplified this thought a little later in his boo k: \"Man who has sprung from the earth [meaning that he was not created by a creator God] and de- veloped through the lower kingdoms of nature to his present rational state, has yet to complete his evo lu- tion by becoming a god-like being and unifying his consciousness with the Omniscient ~ to promote whic h is and always has been the sole aim and purpose of Initiation.\" 189 \"No higher level of attainment is possible than that in which the human merges in the Divine con- sciousness and knows as God knows.\" 190 So, just as Satan tempted mankind with the ability to know good and evil themselves just like God, withou t His assistance, now the Masons are teaching that they t oo could become a god through an initiation into the Ancient Mys- teries. John Anthony West, in his book SERPENT IN THE SKY, wrote this in support of Mr. Wilmshurst's statement : \"Egypt started with the concept of divine attri- butes within man. The gods are not brought down to earth; rather man is raised to the gods.\" 191 68"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 LUCIFER WORSHIP Others besides the above mentioned Masons, like Lou is Keuerbach, have joined the discussion with similar thoughts. He was a nineteenth century philosopher, and a hero of the Communists like Karl Marx. In fact, Frederick Engel s, the co- worker with Karl Marx during the time Marx wrote TH E COMMUNIST MANIFESTO, wrote this about his friend: \"All the Communists of 1845 were followers of Feuerbach ....\" 192 The reason that the Communists supported the ideas of Keuerbach is apparent when the student reads his wr itings, He wrote: \"Man alone is our God, our father, our judge, our redeemer, our true home, our law and our rule, the Alpha and Omega of our life and of our political, m or- al, public and domestic activity. There is no salva tion, save through the medium of man.\" 193 John Denver, the well known popular singer, has ado pted this same philosophy about his divinity. He has bee n quoted us saying this after his new conversion: \"It's the single, most important experience of my life — I can do anything. One of these days, I'll b e so complete I won't be human; I'll be a god.\" 194 Mr. Hall, the Mason, stated a similar thought when he wrote this in his book entitled LECTURES ON ANCIE NT PHILOSOPHY: \"We may study the star intellectually, but we have never attained consciousness until we are the star.\" 195 But this idea that man could become a god is not ne w. The Bible anticipated it, and Isaiah wrote about it back in 741 B.C. This is what he wrote in Isaiah 43:10: \"Thus saith the Lord .... ... understand that I am He: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.\" 69"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 LUCIFER WORSHIP And once again, in Isaiah 45:5: \"I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God beside me ....\" The Bible teaches that there is but one God, and th at mankind has no possibility of sharing His godhead. One who apparently has not believed those statement s in the Bible is Shirley MacLaine, who has become a spo kesman for the position that man can become a god. She has written several books on the subject of her support of the New Age (Newsweek magazine described her as \"the New Age ev an- gelist.\") She wrote the following statement in her book entitled DANCING IN THE LIGHT: \"... we are part of God ...\" 196 and this elsewhere in the same book: \"... if one says audibly I am God, the sound vi- brations literally align the energies of the body t o a higher atunement.\" 197 If each man is a god, mankind is capable of making de- cisions for their own welfare. Each man has complet e control of his decision-making, according to Miss MacLaine. In fact, man's control has extended into areas few have ever claimed for mankind. These are the thoughts of Miss MacLain e: \"I think we choose to be together .... We choose our parents, and I think the parents choose the chi l- dren they want to have before they ever come into a n incarnation.\" 198 She went on further to record another strange thoug ht, when she wrote this: \"... there was no such thing as reality, only perception.\" 199 One can only wonder where Miss MacLaine got these b i- zarre thoughts from. Several clues that can assist the student 70"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 LUCIFER WORSHIP in understanding her have been given by either her own rev- elations or from some articles that have appeared a bout her in the media. In her book entitled OUT ON A LIMB, she wrote about her meetings with her married lover in her apartmen t. She commented that he looked at her shelf of books on, amongst other subjects: \"Marxist theory,\" including a \"biography of [Karl] Marx.\" 200 PARADE magazine of December 18, 1988 had an article on Miss MacLaine in which it revealed that her den had \"lots of framed pictures: Shirley with [Communist] Fidel Cas tro, and with [Communist] Nikita Khrushchev [amongst others. ]\" 201 The magazine reported how Shirley and her lover: \"talked about Democratic-Socialist principles and how it was possible to have them both at the same time if the rich would only share their wealth more .\" 202 Elsewhere in her book, she wrote about how much of a hypocrite she was when she added this contradictory statement: \"... wanted to talk to him [her lover] about how I had made a lot of money and that it made me feel el ite in a world that was broke to know I could buy just about anything I wished for.\" 203 However, nowhere in her book did she say that she h ad freely donated any of her own wealth to the relief of the poor, Apparently she believes that the Communis t ideas about wealth sharing are acceptable only as long as she d oes not have to share her wealth like she wants the other r ich to do. Miss MacLaine has since gone on a nationwide tour p ro- moting her new found religious views to the public. News- week magazine reported in 1987 that she had made a great deal of money explaining her new thoughts to others : \"Since MacLaine began her tour in January [1987,] more than 10,000 people in 15 cities have paid the $300 admission fee.\" 204 71"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 LUCIFER WORSHIP 10,000 times $300 equals 3 million dollars. Obviously, Shirley's tours have proven to be both p opular and lucrative. The Newsweek article on her seminar men- tioned a little of what she teaches in them. The fo llowing are a few of her comments: '\"The earth is moving off its axis,' she says, and only the 'collective consciousness' of mankind can right it. For the spiritually inclined, 'a window of light' will appear on those days [August 16 and 17, 1987] that MacLaine says will 'allow us to rise to a high er plane of cosmic understanding.'\" 205 \"Evangelist\" MacLaine became \"Doctor\" MacLaine when she reported some of her new cures for two of the w orld's most serious medical problems: AIDS and cancer of t he abdomen. According to the Newsweek article, she tol d her audience: \"They [those who paid to hear her in the 15 cities on the tour] all got to hear MacLaine's pronouncements on such subjects as AIDS (she thinks sufferers are sick because they have been 'bereft of love necessary to sustain the balance' o f health); and cancer (for cancer of the abdomen, she advises 'putting patients in a yellow room because yellow is the color 'frequency' of that part of the body.')\" 206 And to think her \"patients\" only have to pay $300 f or such wisdom! But \"Doctor\" MacLaine is not as dumb as one might think. The Newsweek magazine article reported: . \"... everyone who attended had to sign waivers absolving the seminar's organizers from responsibil ity for psychological injury.\" 207 So someone in charge of arranging her seminars is a ware that her ideas might cause psychological damage to those attending, and they have moved to protect her from malprac- tice lawsuits. 72"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 LUCIFER WORSHIP Not only was this \"New Age evangelist\" making money on her personal lecture tours, she was also making money on her best selling books.

Time magazine reported that her \"five books on self-expl oration and self-promotion have run to more than 8 million copi es.\" 208 It appears as if selling the New Age religion can b e very profitable! But, in summary, perhaps the most cogent comment about the battle between the New Age and the Christ ians was made by Nesta Webster in her book entitled SECR ET SOCIETIES: \"The war now begins between the two contending principles: the Christian conception of man reachin g up to God, and the secret society [Miss Webster wrote too early for her to know about the New Age Movement] conception of man as God, needing no revelation from on high and no guidance but the law of his own nature. And since that nature is in itself divine, all that springs from it is praiseworthy, and those acts usually regarded as sins are not to be condemned.\" The battle lines are drawn between those who believ e in a creator God, and those who believe that man can b ecome god.

The Humanist Religion (this will be examined more c are- fully in a later chapter) that is currently becomin g America's m a j o r religious view of mankind, also has a plank in its platform about the total dependence on man's reason . Their fourth plank in their 1933 HUMANIST MANIFESTO reads : \"Fourth: Reason and intelligence are the most effec tive instruments that humankind possesses.\" 216 And the members of the Illuminati share the similar views of both the Masons and the Humanists. Profess or Weis- haupt wrote these two statements: \"This is the great object held out by this Associa- tion: and the means of attaining it is Illumination , en- lightening the understanding by the sun of reason.\" 217 \"When at last Reason becomes the religion of men, then will the problem be solved.\" 218 Perhaps the position that reason is man's last hope for a perfect world can be summed up with these comments from members of the Masonic Lodge.

The first of those commandments was: \"1. God is the Eternal, Omnipotent, Immutable Wi s- dom.\" 221 Wisdom is defined as the power of judging rightly b ased upon knowledge and man gets wisdom through the use of his reason. In fact, Mr. Pike went so far as to deify m an's mind. He wrote: \"Reason is The Absolute, it is in IT we must be- lieve.... 222 \"Masonry propagates no creed except its own most simple and Sublime One; that universal religio n, taught by Nature and by Reason.\" 223 \"The structure itself will be overthrown, when, in the vivid language of a living writer, 'Human reaso n leaps into the throne of God and waves her torch ov er the ruins of the Universe.'\" 224 76"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10 BECOMING A GOD Masonry has deified reason, the ability of man to m ake his own decisions in all of his affairs without con cern of the moral absolutes imparted by the God of the Bible. N o one would be impudent enough to suggest that man not us e his mind at all. What these New Agers, Masons, Humanist s, and members of the Illuminati are saying is that they w ish to use the mind exclusively. That means, for those who bel ieve that there is no God, man can have \"the knowledge of goo d and evil,\" and make up his own moral code as he goes al ong. For those who believe in a God, He is to have no say in the future determination of what is right or wrong. The refore man should have the right to decide for himself in all moral, religious, political and economic decisions , whether or not there is a God. But the truth of life is that the existing God gave man moral laws to follow, primarily in the Old Testamen t. These are called \"moral absolutes,\" and spell out just wh at is right and wrong. According to these individuals and organ izations, man has the right to ignore these teachings, and to decide for himself what is right and wrong. This new \"morality\" is not new. It is as old as man him- self. The Bible teaches that man decided to eat the \"fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,\" and th at is what these organizations have done. Where these decisions of men's \"reason\" leads manki nd will he discussed later in this material. But it is possible to know what the God of the Bibl e thinks about these decisions.

The Humanists, New Ag ers, Communists and the Masons say that wisdom springs s olely from the mind of man, and that man's mind teaches t hat he can become a god himself, having the ability to de cide for himself in all things.

This is the explana tion he received: \"Lucis is the genitive case of the Latin word Lux. We would translate it 'of light.' The Trust has always been Lucis right from its incorporation in 1923. The publishing company, how- ever was called at first the Lucifer Publishing Com - pany as authored by H. P. [Helena Petrovna] Blavat- sky earlier. Lucifer as here used means 'bringer of light or the morning star' and has no connection whatsoever with Satan as conventional wisdom would have it.\" 228 But there is someone else who is making the claim t o being the \"morning star.\" That claim is made in the book of Revelation, chapter 22, verse 16 of the New Testame nt of the Bible: \"I Jesus ... am the root and offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.\" So the Lucis Trust claims that Lucifer is \"the morn ing star,\" and Jesus Christ makes the same claim. Only one can correctly be what they both claim to be. But the Lucis Trust attempted to make an important dis- tinction between Lucifer and Satan, one that should be made again at this juncture. Lucifer was the name of the being that was in heave n with the God of the Bible, until he rebelled. He wa s punished and sent to earth, where it appears th at his name was changed to Satan.

He wrote this in MORALS AND DOGMA: \"And the Mason is familiar with these doctrines ... that the Supreme Being is a centre of Light who se rays or emanations pervade the Universe; for that i s the Light for which all Masonic journeys are a sear ch, and of which the sun and moon in our Lodges are only emblems.\" 229 Notice that Mr. Pike says that this light-bringer i s a god; in fact he capitalizes the \"s\" and the \"b\" in \"Supr eme Being.\" He further deifies \"Light\" by capitalizing the lett er \"1.\" And then he added these thoughts about the nature o f this \"Light:\" \"Behold, it said, the light, which emanates from an. immense centre of Light, that spreads everywher e its benevolent rays; so do the spirits of Light ema nate from the Divine Light.\" 230 \"Masonry is a march and struggle toward the Light.\" 231 To show the reader that these are not just the thou ghts of one Mason, but are the thoughts of all of Freema sonry, it becomes important to quote other Masonic writers. Kenneth Mackenzie in his book entitled THE ROYAL MASONIC CYCLOPAEDIA, written in 1877, said this aft er the entry: SONS OF LIGHT: \"Masons by their tenure are necessarily Sons of Light, and are so accepted even by their opponents, who are Sons of Darkness.\" 232 This is an important revelation. Those who are oppo sed to the Masons and what they stand for are told that they are \"Sons of Darkness.\" If \"Light\" is a deity, and it m ust be be- cause Mr. Mackenzie capitalizes the word, then \"Dar kness\" is also a god. At least this Mason recognizes that the re are two gods in the universe: one of Darkness and one of Li ght. The evidence that other Masons are aware of this distin ction will be offered later in this study. 81"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11 SONS OF LIGHT Another source of revelations on the subject of the Ma- sonic religion is a book entitled FREEMASONS REPOS- ITORY, which is a collection of articles written by Masons. The particular one used in the following reference was pub- lished in 1882-1883. Here the writer was moved to c omment: '\"Let there be light' is a phrase of small import a s some have heard it when kneeling at Masonic Altars. Its breadth of meaning has not been understood. These are the true Craftsmen who are followers of the light in every deed; they are pledged to opp ose whatever is of darkness, ignorance and sin; they ha ve entered upon that illumined way which leadeth to God and to heaven, and they may rightly be called 'Sons of Light.'\" \"Thus has light been regarded in all the philo- sophies and religions of the world. In this respect Masonry but maintains the symbolism which has found general acceptance.\" 233 \"Light is the sign of a presence and power deserv- ing of devout recognition. God may be said to revea l himself in the light. He dwelleth in light inacces- sible — yet he reveals himself to give knowledge to the minds of men, while by the illumination of his presence and his truth he imparts to the human world a condition of true spiritual life ....\" \"The creation of the earth ... was, at the first, 'without form and void.' It was a shapeless and desolate mass of matter. In that condition of prime val chaos, there was an entire absence of light. Then it was the Spirit of God manifested itself as the great quickening principle of a new order, comm u- nicating light and life to the hitherto desolate an d disordered creation.\" 234 To show the reader that most people do not understa nd the esoteric meaning behind the symbol of \"light,\" Mr. Mackey wrote these comments in his ENCYCLOPAEDIA: \"Freemasons are emphatically called the 'sons of light,' because they are, or at least are entitled to be, in possession of the true meaning of the symbol.\" 82"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11 SONS OF LIGHT \"Light is an important word in the Masonic sys- tem. It conveys a far more recondite [defined as be ing beyond the grasp of the ordinary mind] meaning that it is believed to possess by the generality of read ers. ... it contains within itself a far more abstruse [defined as being hard to understand] allusion to t he very essence of Speculative Masonry.\" 235 Perhaps the very reason that the Masons conceal a g reat truth in the word \"light,\" or \"Light,\" can be best summarized in this single statement of Albert Pike in his book entitled MORALS AND DOGMA: \"... Light will finally overcome Darkness.\" 236 So, if the student of \"esoteric knowledge\" wishes t o under- stand the language, it becomes important to determi ne, if possible, who the \"light-bearer\" is. And the studen t can know for certain who that is, because one of the greates t \"seekers of light\" has told the world. That writer is Albert Pike, a Mason, and he has described who this individual is in his book entitled MORALS AND DOGMA. Mr. Pike identified the \"light-bearer\" on page 321 of that book: \"Lucifer, the Light-bearer! Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! Is it he who bears the Light ...? Doubt it not!\" 237 Albert Pike has admitted that the Masons seek Light ! He has now admitted that the \"Light-bearer\" is Lucifer ! The Masons ask for \"Light\" from the \"Light-bearer\" Luci fer! But Mr. Pike is not the only Mason who has admitted that in easily understandable language. A nother Masonic writer is Manly P. Hall, and he has said basically the same thing in his book entitled THE LOST KEYS OF FREEMA- SONRY. The skeptic can know that this book has been in- eluded in a \"list of the best Masonic books availab le\" in a Masonic magazine called THE ROYAL ARCH MASON. The list says that \"it [the list] is the finest basic l ibrary available 83"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11 SONS OF LIGHT to Freemasons.\" So the student can know that this b ook is approved reading for the Masonic Order. This is tha t com- ment, as found on page 48 of his book: \"The seething energies of Lucifer are in his hands [the Master Mason's hands] and before he may step upward [through the remaining degrees?] he must prove his ability to properly apply energy.\" 238 So the energies of Lucifer are in the hands of the Master Mason! The god of some of the Masons is Lucifer! Th ere can be no doubt, because some of the best known Masonic writers have told the reader in their own words! Mr. Hall added this comment on page 55 of the same book: \"The Master Mason is in truth a sun, a great re- flector of light .... He stands before the glowing fire light [the sun?] and the world. Through him passes Hydra, the great snake [Lu- cifer?], and from its [the snake, as a symbol of Lucifer] mouth there pours the light of God. His [Hydra's, the great snake's?] symbol is the rising sun .... Albert Pike confirmed that Hydra was a \"serpent\" on page 508 of his book entitled MORALS AND DOGMA. So that quote from Mr. Hall's book confirms that th e Mason is the intermediary between the sun-god and m an. And through him passes the truth of the sun-god. Simply stated, once again, Lucifer is the god of so me of the Masons! The Bible has made it clear that Lucifer entered th e body of a snake when he approached Adam and Eve in the G arden of Eden. So, the Masons believe that \"Light,\" the emanations from their god Lucifer, will finally overcome the truth given to man by God inside the Bible. Albert Pike put another piece of the puzzle into pl ace when he wrote this on page 287 of MORALS AND DOGMA: 84"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11 SONS OF LIGHT \"You see, my brother, what is the meaning of Ma- sonic \"Light.\" You see why the East of the Lodge, where the initial letter of the Name of the Deity overhangs t he Master, is the place of Light. ... it is that Light, the true knowledge of Deity [the truth that Lucifer is god!] the eternal Good, for which Masons in all ages have sought. Still Masonry marches steadily onward toward that Light that shines in the great distance [the coming New World Order, still perceived as being many years in the future] the Light of that day whe n Evil [this \"Evil\" will be identified later in this study,] overcome and vanquished, shall fade away and disap- pear forever, and Life and Light be the one law of the universe, and its eternal harmony.\" 240 So, Mr. Pike tells the careful reader that the \"Lig ht\" that all Masons seek is the true knowledge of the real g od. And then he tells the world that Lucifer is the real go d of the universe. The final secret of the Masons is no longer a secre t! The student of the Masons can know that the great secret that the Adept Masons are keeping from the I nitiate Masons is that the concealed God of the Masonic Lod ge is Lucifer, the \"light-bearer!\" But a study of \"Light\" would not be complete withou t identifying the individual that the Bible says is t he source of the true light. The name of this individual has bee n recorded in the New Testament, and it was written down by th e disci- ple John, in about 80 A.D. He was an eye witness to many of the events in the New Testament, and he was moved t o write the following, in John 8:12: \"Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. \" So here we see the exact nature of the battle betwe en the followers of the deceiving \"light-bearer,\" Lucifer, meaning the Masons, the Illuminati and the New Age, and the tru e light, Jesus.

Mr. Pike indicated that it is in the eastern part o f their L o d g e that their Worshipful Master, their equivalen t of the President, sits. One Mason who explained this fact was Cap- tain William Morgan, a Mason of some 30 years, who exposed the Masonic rituals in a book entitled FREEMASONRY EX- POSED. According to him, the Master sits in the eas t for a reason: \"As the sun rises in the east to open and adorn the day, so presides the Worshipful Master in the e ast to open and adorn his lodge ....\" 241 87"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12 EAST AND WEST Albert Pike further discussed that point when he wr ote: \"Our Lodges are said to be due East and West, because the Master represents the rising Sun, and o f course must be in the East.\" 242 Mr. Mackey also wrote about the relationship of the place of the Master's location, and the east: \"The East, being the place where the Master sits, i s considered the most honorable part of the Lodge ... \" 243 So the sun, a symbol of Lucifer, the god of some of the Masons, resides in the east. The Masons know this, so they place their Worshipful Master in that area, and the n conceal the reasons why they have done so from their fellow Masons. The significance of this fact will become clear in further chapters of this study. 88"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Chapter 13 The Pyramid of Giza The Masons have agreed with the Egyptians that Osir is, one of their gods, was a deity. For instance, Alber t Mackey wrote rule \"Osirus was the sun ....\" 244 Sun-gods all over the world have had temples erecte d to their memory, and as a place where, they mig ht be wor- shipped. Osirus was no exception. The Masons are aware of this penchant for temple building as a place for god worship. I n October 1953, a Mason wrote the following in the NEW AGE MAGAZINE, the magazine published by the Scottish Rite of Freemaso nry: \"If perchance you were to visit the Great Pyramid of Gizeh [also spelled Giza] ... you would be pre- sented with a souvenir stating that Osiris com- manded Thalmes to build him a house in the form of a pyramid with certain designated passageways.\" 245 89"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13 THE PYRAMID OF GIZA Some in Egypt claim that the Great Pyramid was not built as a tomb for a deceased pharaoh, but as a te mple for initiation into sun worship. There is now a growing body of evidence to support that claim. But, it is important to set the stage for that conc lusion first by examining that evidence. (The author would like to make a few comments at th is juncture. It is not my purpose to convince the read er that these comments about the purpose of the pyramid are correct. I am only attempting to convince you that these sun -worship- pers consider them to be true. And, because they do , they are making plans for our future. And those plans should concern each reader of this material because, as I am attem pting to point out, the overall changes they are arranging a re going to alter the very way all of us live our lives. And, I for one, do not care for the plans being made.) There are some who claim that the pyramid was con- structed about six thousand years ago, and not abou t three thousand years ago as most archaeologists believe. One who makes that claim is Richard W. Noone in his book entitled 5/5/2000. Mr. Noone's book is not abo ut pyra- mids as such, but about his claims that massive cha nges will occur on the earth on that date in the year 2000 du e to a change in the alignment of five planets near to the earth. This will not be the place to comment on his charge s. However, he has done considerable research into the pyra- mids as part of his studies. He has pointed out that the word for \"pyramid\" in a n- cient Egypt was \"glorious light,\" once again connec ting the pyramid with the sun and the sun-god Osiris. Manly P. Hall stated that he too believed that the pyra- mid was constructed for some purpose other than for the bur- ial of a pharaoh. He wrote: \"The Pyramids [notice that he capitalizes the word] - the great Egyptian temples of initiation.\" 246 He also wrote that he knew what the initiation cere mony was for: \"... the illumined of antiquity ... entered its por - tals as men; they came forth as gods.\" 247 90"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13 THE PYRAMID OF GIZA There are many now who believe that an individual named Khufu built the Great Pyramid. The name, acco rding to Mr. Noone, is \"phonetically similar to the ancient Egyptian word for the Great Pyramid, Khuti, meaning 'Glorious Light.'\" 248 Some writers on the pyramid have indicated that the ir research has led them to the conclusion that the py ramid has a concealed time table built into its passageways. Max Toth is one of these authors, and he has written this in his book entitled PYRAMID PROPHECIES: \"The prophecies of the ancient masters are locat- ed into the pyramid form ....\" 249 It is the opinion of Mr. Noone that there is only one prophecy\" that should be examined, and it is this o ne: \"Beginning at the geometrical point beneath the pyramid arris edge [defined as two straight lines coming together at an angle] meets the projected floor line of the ascending passage, we have a straight line that runs up the ascending passage an d Grand Gallery. This line measured 6,000 inches.\" 250 (For those not familiar with these terms, the pyram id is entered through a passageway called the Descending Passage- way. This meets with a passageway, going up into th e pyra- mid, called, obviously, the Ascending Passage, at t he end of which are several rooms. So, here the author is des cribing a line down the Grand Gallery, through the ground und er the pyramid, where it meets with a line coming down the outside of the pyramid. The line, from the point where these two lines meet, back up the inside line, and where it m eets the rooms at the top of the passageway, measures 6,000 inches. The significance of this measurement will be e xplained in some of the following paragraphs. The important thi ng to no- tice here is that this 6000 inch line is truly hidd en: it does not exist in reality. It is hidden under ground wit h no ap- parent existence. It is truly a hidden prediction.) 91"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13 THE PYRAMID OF GIZA Joseph Carr, a writer on the Nazi Party of Adolf Hi tler and its connections with sun worship, wrote about a n experi- ence an individual had inside the pyramid: \"In April, 1904 an English Buddhist named Aleis- ter Crowley visited Cairo .... Rose Edith Crowley [his wife] asked her husband to perform a magical ritual .... [He] obeyed by say ing the prayer of invocation to Horus [another Egyptian sun-god.] He later claimed that a being appeared to him during that hour [and] announced to [him] that the old age was passing away, and a New Age was dawning. Also revealed to Crowley was that the religion of the New Age could not take its place until the old religion [presumably Christianity] was smashed.\" 251 So, here we see a connection between the pyramid, s un- worship and the New Age. One of the proofs that the pyramid was not construc ted as a burial chamber is the fact that both of the tw o large rooms inside the pyramid, the so-called \"King's cha mber\" and the \"Queen's chamber,\" have vent ducts leading from inside the rooms to the outside of the pyramid. This had l ed many to believe that the ducts were meant to provide air for hu- man occupants. Some of these writers have expressed their opinions in the books that they have written. One o f these is Wilfred Gregson, an architect and a 33rd degree Mas on, who wrote this: \"Obviously the idea was to get air moving into the pyramid. You can't exist very long breathing stagnant air. So my principle is that this was a temple of initiation.\" 252 Manly P. Hall, a fellow Mason, agreed with Mr. Greg son, when he wrote this comment: \"... there seems to be no reason why a legitimate tomb should have air vents going from the King's chamber [as well as the Queen's chamber] out to the surface.\" 253 92"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13 THE PYRAMID OF GIZA Another writer on the pyramid, Andre Pochan, has written in his book THE MYSTERIES OF THE GREAT PYR- AMID: \"If the two conduits [into the King's chamber] were originally ventilation ducts, the unavoidable conclusion is that the Great Pyramid's upper cham- ber was not the site of the royal sepulcher. Continuous ventilation would have inevitably re- sulted in not only the putrefaction of the mummy, but also the rapid destruction of all the funerary furniture indispenable to the deceased for his life to the beyond.\" 254 Mr. Noone connected the great pyramid in Egypt wit h the symbolism of the pyramid in Mexico, called the Pyramid at Chichen-Itza: \"the temple at the East of the quadrangle has a great many repeats of a huge sun burst, from the middle of the sun burst is the huge head of a ser- pent whose mouth is open. This needs little explanation. The sun representing 'God' and the serpent 'His Divine Wisdom,' holds man's head so that he can neither see the serpent 'Divine Wisdom,' nor the Light of God from which it comes.\" 255 Mr. Noone is saying that the serpent is attemptin g to keep man from understanding that the god was Lucife r, in the form of a sun burst. But there is another mystery concealed inside the G reat Pyramid that must be explored. The pyramid appears to have been built to memoriali ze the explosion of a great star 4,000 years ago. Mr. Noone says: \"If the Ascending Passage and Grand Galle ry were built to observe this supernova explosion, the Giza complex was built to memorialize a tremendous cataclysm in the earth's planetary system which af- fected the globe with fire and flood.\" 256 93"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13 THE PYRAMID OF GIZA \"The Grand Gallery, aimed like a giant telescope at a particular celestial body in the earth's south ern sky — before its view of the heavens was blocked by the completion of the building — points to where ra - dio astronomy has just pinpointed the supernova (or giant stellar explosion) nearest to our solar syste m ... The Great Pyramid's Grand Gallery is focused at this particular spot in the earth's southern sky.\" 257 Then Mr. Noone discussed the research being done to locate the spot in the universe where the Grand Gal lery is pointed. He wrote: \"In the late 1960's Dr. Anthony Hewish, 1974 co- recipient of the Nobel Prize in physics, was workin g at England's Mulard Radio Astronomy Observatory. Hewish began to track a mysterious rhythmic series of pulses, clearly from a point in the earth's sout hern sky.\" 258 Mr. Noone pointed out that Dr. Hewish : \"... demonstrated that the strange rhythmic pulses were radio emissions from a star that had collapsed or blown itself up in the earth's southern sky some time around 4000 B.C., a date memorialized in the mysteries of Freemasonry as Anno Lucis, the Year of Light.\" 259 In another part of the world George Michanowsky, au thor of the book entitled THE ONCE AND FUTURE STAR, was deciphering an incredible message cut, carved, and indented in an ancient cuneiform (meaning a language of wedg e- shaped characters used in ancient inscriptions) cla y tablet, located in the British Museum. \"The ancient Sumerian cuneiform table Micha- nowsky was deciphering described a giant star ex- ploding within a triangle formed by the three stars Zeta Puppis, Gamma Velorum, and Lambda Velorum. These three stars are located in the earth's southe rn sky and unknown to Michanowsky at the time were being tracked by Anthony Hewish. 94"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13 THE PYRAMID OF GIZA Michanowsky continued deciphering the Sumerian star catalogue, containing observations going back thousands of years. The remarkably accurate star catalogue now stated that the blazing star that had exploded within the triangle would again be seen by man in 6,000 years.\" 260 So two world renowned scientists had independently dis- covered the results of a large explosion that they both felt had occurred around 6000 years ago. Mr. Noone then asked the question: \"Is there a Masonic connection between Vela X, a star which exploded within a triangle, and the an- cient religious symbolism and star dates of Free- masonry?\" 261 And the Masons have answered it with a positive yes . Albert Mackey, the Mason, in his ENCYCLOPAEDIA, wro te this: \"In the Year of Light; abbreviated A.L. The date used in ancient Craft Masonry; found by adding 4000 to the Vulgar [meaning the common] Era; thus, 1911 + 4000 = 5,911.\" 262 This current book was being written in 1989, A.D., which stands for Anno Domini, the \"year of the Lord ,\" meaning since the birth of Jesus. But according to the Mas ons, the true calendar date should be written 5989 A.L. Another writer on the Great Pyramid is Tom Valentin e, and his book is entitled THE GREAT PYRAMID: MAN'S MONUMENT TO MAN. Mr. Valentine wrote: \"... the Great Pyramid's system of passages and chambers is a chronological graph that begins in 4000 B.C. and continues for six thousand years.\" 263 So, according to the Masons, there are only 11 year s to the year 6000. But what happens after the 6,000 yea rs? What is next? 95"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13 THE PYRAMID OF GIZA The New Agers have told us.

So, it appears that sometime in the near future, the New A gers are going to see the beginning of the millennium reign of Lord Maitreya. This position was confirmed by the Lucis Trust, als o a New Age organization, when it wrote the following i n a quar- terly newsletter for the third quarter, 1982: \"The year 2000 looms before humanity as a gi- gantic milestone which marks both an ending and a beginning.

Pre vious chapters have examined two of the major Masonic sym bols, the star and the sun. Other Masonic symbols need to be ex- amined as well. One of these symbols is the obelisk. The word is de fined by a dictionary as a tall, four-sided stone pillar tapering toward its pyramidal top. There are three of major importance in the world to day: one in Washington D.C., called the Washington Monum ent; another one in Central Park, in New York City; and the third in the Vatican, located in Rome, Italy. The first major obelisk is in St. Peter's square in Rome, Italy, and is placed in such a way that every Pope who ad- dresses any crowd in the square, must face the obel isk. The second major obelisk was brought to New York fr om its location in Alexandria, Egypt, and placed in Ce ntral Park in New York City in 1881. The four sides of this ob elisk are 97"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14 OBELISKS covered with Egyptian hieroglyphs and these drawing s have been translated by a variety of Egyptologists inclu ding some Masonic writers. The Masons have told the readers of one of its publ ica- tions that this obelisk was quarried: \"... to praise and adore the divinity of the sun, worshipped by the ancient Egyptians as the source o f light and life. It is a representation of the God R a, or the sun.\" 266 So, there is a symbol of the sun in Central Park, i n the heart of New York City. The third major obelisk is the Washington monument, which was constructed to honor George Washington, t he first President of the United States. President Washingto n was an active and public member of the Masonic Lodge. The monu- ment built in his honor: \"is the tallest such monument in the world, 555 feet high, though not truly an obelisk, because it is not quarried from a single piece but put together from 36,000 separate blocks of granite faced with marble .\" 267 This obelisk is a symbol that has definite Masonic connec- tions. It was constructed many years after the Pres ident's death on December 14, 1799, as it was not until 183 3 that the Washington National Monument Society was organi zed to erect a monument in his memory. The monument was not completed until 1848, when the 3300 pound capstone was set in place. The weight of the cap- stone appears to be semi-symbolic, utilizing the nu mber 33 as a reminder of the 33 degrees inside the Masonic Ord er. The obelisk was constructed of a total of 36,000 se parate blocks and included 188 Memorial Stones inside the monu- ment, donated to the Society by individuals, societ ies, cities, states and nations of the world. Approximately 35 o f these came from Masonic lodges, and the last of these blo cks was placed into the monument at the 330 foot level. Onc e again, the number 33 shows up in the construction of the o belisk, and once again it is semi-concealed in a fact about its con- struction. 98"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14 OBELISKS The total cost of the monument concealed another Ma - sonic number, this time the number 13: the cost of the entire monument was $1,300,000. There are other Masonic secrets concealed in the nu mbers relating to the eight windows in the monument, two on each side. Six of these windows are of the same size, bu t the seventh and the eighth, the two facing the east, ar e larger. It will be remembered that The Masons have stated that it is in the east that their Master sits. So the east has sp ecial sig- nificance to them. The eight windows total 39 square feet in size, and 39 is three times the Masonic number 13. But the two wind ows facing the east conceal another reference to the nu mber 13. The student of geometry will remember that the sum of the squares of the base and perpendicular in a right-an gled tri- angle is equal to the square of the hypotenuse, mea ning the third side. The example often cited to prove that t ruth is the triangle with the three sides being 3 inches, 4 inc hes, and 5 inches in length. The square of the two sides, the sides that are 3 inches and 4 inches in length, are 9 and 16, and the total of those two squares is equal to the square o f the 5 inch side, or 25. Each of the two windows in the east are 2 feet by 3 feet, and the square of the third side is 13. The square of 2 is four, and the square of 3 is 9. The total of 4 and 9 is 13. The number 13 appears to be a very symbolic number to the Masons, but finding out why it is has become a difficult chore. One clue is contained in the Bible in the bo ok of Gene- sis. That book records in Genesis 14:4 that it was in the thir- teenth year that an amalgamation of various kings r ebelled against their leader. It will be recalled that Luci fer rebelled against God in the heavens, and some historians equ ate the number 13 with rebellion and Lucifer. Stan Deyo is one author who explained that the numb er 13 had a very definite meaning. He wrote this in hi s book en- titled THE COSMIC CONSPIRACY: \"... thirteen is the value [assigned] to represent Satan, [the] serpent, [the] dragon, [the] tempter o r rebellion.\" 268 So the Washington Monument, dedicated to the memory of a Mason, conceals many Masonic symbols inside it s obelisk 99"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14 OBELISKS form. But there is an extremely important meaning t hat has not been explained by modern historians. As has been illustrated, the Masons have placed a p ar- ticular importance on the obelisk, primarily becaus e it has its root in the ancient times in Egypt. However, there is another reason, one that is far more important. The first connection is to the past. Carl Claudy, t he Ma- sonic writer, wrote this: \"... the initiate of old saw in the obelisk the ver y spirit of the god he worshipped.\" 269 So, according to this Masonic writer, the obelisk i s a sym- bol of a god that was worshipped by the believers o f the an- cient mysteries. It has been shown that those invol ved in the ancient mysteries worshipped Lucifer. But a far more important reason was revealed to tho se careful enough to note the importance of the revela tion. Mr. Claudy then added this comment: \"From the dawn of religion the pillar, monolith or built up, has played an important part in the worsh ip of the Unseen. ... in Egypt the obelisk stood for the very pres- ence of the Sun God himself.\" 270 He repeated these very words in another section of the same book: \"... in Egypt the obelisk stood for the very pres- ence of the Sun God himself.\" 271 He went on to repeat his statement that: \"... the initiate of old saw in the obelisk the ver y spirit of the God he worshiped.\" 272 Mr. Claudy revealed that the obelisk is a symbol of the sun-god, and implied that this very deity is presen t inside the stone itself. The obelisk stands for the very presence of the sun -god! And the sun-god is Lucifer! 100"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14 OBELISKS Mr. Pike confirmed this statement in his book en titled MORALS AND DOGMA: \"The obelisk was ... consecrated to the Sun.\" 273 And Kenneth Mackenzie, a third Masonic writer, ad ded this supporting statement: \"Sun-worship was plainly connected with the erec- tion of obelisks .... ... they were placed in front of the temples of Egypt. [They referred] to the worship of the sun.\" 274 And Mr. Mackey, a fourth Masonic writer, offer ed this comment: \"Obelisks were, it is supposed, originally erected in honor of the sun god.\" 275 So, obelisks are a symbol of the \"very presence of the sun- god himself.\" This is an explanation that is not of fered to the overwhelming majority of the American people. Yet, one of the major monuments in Washington D.C. is an obelis k. And it was erected to honor George Washington, a very visible member of the Masonic Order. And the Masons have c on- cealed various esoteric numbers inside the blocks o f the mon- ument itself. One of the strange incidents that involved the Wash ington monument occurred first in 1981, and then again i n 1985, when the inauguration ceremony of President Ronald Reagan was moved to the west front of the Capitol from t he tra- ditional location, the east front. Every President since George Washington had been sworn in on the east front of t he Capi- tol building, but, for some unexplained r eason, someone wanted President Reagan sworn in on the west front. Newsweek magazine for January 26, 1981, the issue c ov- ering the inauguration ceremonies, wrote about this change in the location of the ceremony: \"Swearing in a President on the Capitol's West Front - for the first time ever - ....\" 101"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14 OBELISKS The article went on to point out that the reason th e move was made was not an aesthetic one: \"But the seldom-used West Front is crumbling, its rickety porticos held up by wooden posts. 'It's not about to fall down,' assured Capitol architect Geor ge White, 'but it is in need of structural repair.' Rather than pop for a major repair job, however, the Inaugural committee ordered a hasty coat of whi te paint - and draped a gigantic American flag over th e unsightly wooden beams.\" But the Newsweek magazine article did not explain w hy the location was moved to that particular side of t he Capitol. But a possible explanation was offered, rather subt ly, in a Time magazine picture that accompanied their covera ge of the inauguration ceremonies. The picture was a behind t he back, over the shoulder, elevated shot showing the Presid ent giving his inauguration address. The picture is approximat ely 7\" by 8\" in size, and both the President, at the bottom o f the pic- ture, and the Washington monument off in the distan ce, at the top of the picture, appear to be about one inch in height. But the interesting caption at the bottom of the pi cture is where it appears the hidden message is contained. T he cap- tion reads: \"Before some 150,000 listeners at the West Front of the Capitol, Reagan gazes toward the Washington Monument and delivers his address.\" 276 The President gazes at a symbol of the \"very presen ce of the sun-god himself and gives his inauguration addr ess. It is unknown if this shift in the location site wa s for the express purpose of giving a signal to those able to understand the significance of the President \"gazing\" at the v ery presence of the sun-god. But it was the first time that any President had been sworn in on that side of the Capitol, and it put him in a position where, if someone had wished to send a signal involving the Washington monument and its esoteric symbol- ogy, they could have done so. The same scene was repeated in President Reagan's s ec- ond inauguration in 1985.

The French Revolution was in 1789, and many histori ans have concluded that the Illuminati fomented it with the goal of putting their fellow member of the Illuminati, t he Duc d' Orleans, on the throne of France. Mr. Churchill linked Weishaupt and the Illuminati o f 1776 with the Communist Karl Marx of 1848, and Marx with the Russian Communists of 1917. It was his opinion that those individuals had been linked together in a con spiracy lasting for more than 140 years. He then combined t his con- spiracy with European and American revolutionaries. And his final comment was that their combined purpose was t o \"over- throw civilization.\" In other words, Mr. Churchill claimed that their purpose was to bring the world a \"New World O rder.\" He had provided the reader with a brief overview of a long lasting conspiracy. He had told the world that this con- spiracy wanted to overthrow civilization. But, because few knew anything at all about this c on- spiracy, the world paid no attention to Mr. Churchi ll's com- ments. That was no accident because this conspiracy has, i n the main, acted under the cover of concealment. They do not an- nounce their plans before they occur. And they cert ainly do not announce their involvement after the planned ev ent has occurred. Professor Adam Weishaupt boastfully stated that his or- ganization would remain concealed from the eyes of the pub- lic. He wrote: \"The great strength of our Order lies in its concealment; let it never appear in any place in it s 105"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 THE ILLUMINATI own name, but always covered by another name, and another occupation.\" He even told the world, in his writings, where he w ould conceal the Order: \"None is fitter than the three lower degrees of Fre e Masonry; the public is accustomed to it, expects li ttle from it, and therefore takes little notice of it.\" 279 He felt that this secrecy would lead him to success be- cause he felt no one would be able to break into it . He wrote: \"Our secret Association works in a way that noth- ing can withstand ....\" 280 Another reason that he felt that the Illuminati wou ld succeed was the fact that he was offering his membe rs world- wide power.

They is- sued a report in which they concluded: \"... the express aim of this Order was to abolish Christianity, and overthrow all civil government.\" 282 As mentioned previously, Weishaupt founded the Illu mi- nati on May 1, 1776, and the selection of that date as the founding date of their Order appears to be no coinc idence, Albert Pike wrote that May 1st was a festival day: \"The festival was in honor of the Sun.\" 283 The reason that Weishaupt chose the First of May to found his secret, anti-Christian religion has not b een satis- 106"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 THE ILLUMINATI factorily explained. However, there are some intere sting clues as to why he might have chosen that date. One possible explanation involves the Roman emperor Diocletian, who reigned from 284-305 A.D. After the death of Jesus, the Christian world conti nued to be persecuted by a string of violent Caesers of the Roman Empire. But the violence inaugurated by Diocletian surpassed them all in violence. An edict requiring uniformity of worship was issued in 303 A.D., and the Christians resisted by refusing t o pay homage to the image of the emperor. Diocletian met that re- sistance with specific retaliation against the Chri stians: they lost their public and private possessions, and thei r assemblies were prohibited. Their churches were torn down, and their sacred writings were destroyed. In addition, many Christians paid for their resista nce with their lives: it has been estimated that the vi ctims num- bered into the hundreds of thousands. Finally, Diocletian grew ill, and abdicated on May 1, 305 A.D. The persecution persisted, but never again app roached that of the emperor Diocletian. Is it possible that Professor Weishaupt learned abo ut the date of this abdication and picked up the mantle la id down by Diocletian, and started the persecution of Chris tians again, some 1400 years later? The goal of the Illuminati was \"man made perfect as a god - without God.\" 284 But it was a strange ideal, because Weishaupt permitted his followers to utilize any ac tivity to achieve his goal, including lying. He wrote: \"One must speak sometimes one way and some- times another ... so that, with respect to our true line of thinking, we may be impenetrable.\" 285 The members did tell the truth when they took the i niti- ation ceremony, however. They took an oath which re ad, in part: \"I bind myself to perpetual silence and unshaken loyalty and submission to the Order ....\" 286 Weishaupt claimed that he was shocked when his Orde r turned into a religion, but that is what he said: 107"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 THE ILLUMINATI \"I never thought that I should become the founder of a new religion.\" 287 But his religion had a different base than the trad itional religion: his was based upon a worship of reason: \"... then will Reason rule with unperceived sway.\" \"... Reason will be the only code of Man. This is o ne of our greatest secrets.\" \"When at last Reason becomes the religion of man, then will the problem be solved.\" 289 Weishaupt's dedication of his organization to \"reas on\" makes some sense when the reader recalls that \"reas on\" has been defined as the \"unbridled use of man's mind to solve man's problems without the involvement of God.\" The Bible calls this \"the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\" It was this knowledge that God wanted man not to ha ve, and it was the promise made to man by Lucifer that man could have it by eating of \"the fruit.\" In addition, Weishaupt's religion offered its belie vers a reward not offered by any other religion: worldwide power! Weishaupt wrote: \"The pupils [members of the Illuminati] are con- vinced that the Order will rule the world. Every me m- ber therefore becomes a ruler.\" 290 Weishaupt's religion not only offered power to his believ- ers, but he offered them something else not guarant eed by any other religion: worldly success. He said that o nce a can- didate had achieved the exalted degree of Illuminat us Minor, the fourth of the thirteen inside his Order, his su periors would: \"assist him [the member] in bringing his talents into action, and [would] place him in situations mo st favorable for their exertion, so that he may be ass ured of success.\" 291 108"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 THE ILLUMINATI One of those areas where the Illuminati would striv e to place their members was inside government. Weishaup t wrote: \"We must do our utmost to procure the advance- ment of Illuminati into all important civil offices .\" 292 Weishaupt's religion also had a rather unusual view of man's nature. Traditional religion teaches all of m ankind that man is basically a sinner, and that his way out is to change his bad habits. Weishaupt felt that this position w as in error. He wrote: \"Man is not bad except as he is made so by arbi- trary morality. He is bad because Religion, the Sta te, and bad examples pervert him.\" 293 \"Men ... suffered themselves to be oppressed — gave themselves up to civil societies, and formed states . To get out of this state ... there is no other mean th an the use of Reason .... This can be done in no other way but by secret as- sociations, which will by degrees, and in silence, pos- sess themselves of the government of the States, an d make use of those means for this purpose which the wicked use for attaining their base ends.\" 294 Professor Weishaupt's religion authorized its membe rs to use any means that would benefit the goal of the Il luminati. That goal was simple: the destruction of all Christ ianity: \"Behold our secret .... If in order to destroy all Christianity, all religion, we have pretended to ha ve the sole true religion, remember that the end justi fies the means, and that the wise ought to take all the means to do good which the wicked take to do evil.\" 295 Weishaupt spoke about the Jesuits, an order of prie sts in- side the Catholic Church. He was, it will be rememb ered, an instructor at a Catholic university in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, run by the Jesuits. He apparently admired their success , because he organized his order in a similar manner. He wrot e: 109"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 THE ILLUMINATI \"What these men have done for altars and empires, why should I not do against altars and empires? By the attraction of mysteries, of legends, of adepts, why should I not destroy in the dark what they erect in the light of day.\" 296 Some writers in the past have summarized the belief s of the Illuminati for the future use of historians. On e was Nesta Webster, who wrote the following about their aims in he book entitled WORLD REVOLUTION: 1. Abolition of Monarchy and all ordered Govern- ment. 2. Abolition of private property. 3. Abolition of inheritance. 4. Abolition of patriotism. 5. Abolition of the family (i.e. of marriage and all morality, and the institution of the communal education of children). 6. Abolition of all religion. 297 Weishaupt must have felt that his plan would ultima tely succeed. He certainly felt that his Order would con trol the world. And he anticipated that there would be oppos ition to his goals. He summarized all of these thoughts in t his state- ment: \"By this plan, we shall direct all mankind. In this manner, and by the simplest means, we shall set all in motion and in flames. The occupations must be so al - lotted and contrived, that we may, in secret, influ ence all political transactions.\" 298 Weishaupt decided that his Illuminati needed a cove r, and he successfully infiltrated the Masonic Order in 17 82, at the Masonic Congress at Wilhelmsbad. Some Maso ns became aware of that infiltration and were moved to commen t about it. One such Mason was President George Washington who was sent a copy of Professor John Robison's book entitled PROOFS OF A CONSPIRACY by a Christian minister name d G. W. Snyder. The President responded to the minister's request that he read the book, and his letter to th e minister 110"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 THE ILLUMINATI has been preserved for posterity. Mr. Washington wr ote the minister: \"It was not my intention to doubt that the doctrine s of the Illuminati, and principles of Jacobinism, ha d not spread in the United States. On the contrary, no one is more fully satisfied of this fact than I am. The idea that I meant to conve y was that I did not believe that the Lodges of Free- masons in this country had, as societies, endeavore d to propagate the diabolical [defined as being of the d evil] tenets of [the Illuminati.] That individuals of them may have done it, or that the founder ... may have had these objects ~ and ac tu- ally, in my view, had a separation of the people fr om their government, is too evident to be questioned. I believe ... that none of the Lodges in this count ry are contaminated with the principles ascribed to th e society of the Illuminati.\" 299 The President indicated that he was aware that the Illu- minati had arrived in America; that its tenets were diabolical, meaning that he recognized that they involved thems elves in devil worship; and that they intended to separate m an from his government. The President of the United States had acknowledged the presence of the devil-worshipping Illuminati in Ame rica! The book that the President read was written by a m em- ber of the Lodge who had been asked to join the Ill uminati. He was a professor of Natural Philosophy at Edinbur gh Uni- versity in Scotland. After his study, he concluded that the purposes of the Illuminati were completely unaccept able, and he wrote his book to expose its goals. He wrote: \"... an Association has been formed for the express purpose of rooting out all the religious establishm ents, and overturning all the existing governments of Eu- rope.\" 300 He discovered that the leaders would: 111"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 THE ILLUMINATI \"... rule the world with uncontrollable power, whil e all the rest, ... will be ... employed as mere tool s of the ambition of their unknown superiors.\" 301 James Watt, the inventor of the steam engine, was a con- temporary of Professor Robison, and he wrote this a bout his friend: \"a man of the clearest head and the most science of anybody I have ever known.\" 302 But, even with all of these criticisms about the pu rposes of the Illuminati, there were some Masons who felt that the association between the Masons and the Illuminati w as a pos- itive federation. One such Mason, Kenneth Mackenzie , has written that this Masonic infiltration was: \"... an attempt to purify Masonry, then in much confusion.\" 303 Another Mason who approved of the merger was Dr. Wa l- ter M. Fleming, one of the four founders of the Shr ine, an organization that is part of the Masonic fraternity . He and three other Masons formed this organization in 1871 , and he assisted in the preparation of a history of the Shr ine in 1893. In that book, Dr. Fleming wrote: \"Among the modern promoters of the principles of the Order [the Shrine] in Europe, one of the most n ot- ed was Herr Adam Weishaupt ... professor of law in the University of Ingolstadt, in Bavaria ... who re vived the Order in that city on May 1, 1776. Its members ex- ercised a profound influence before and during the French Revolution, when they were known as the Illu - minati.\" 304 Dr. Fleming, a 33rd degree Mason, was recognizing t he found-of the Illuminati as a \"reviver of the Order. \" His quote comes from a book entitled PARADE TO GLORY, written by Fred Van Deventer, which appears to be given to eac h new member of the Shrine. 112"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 THE ILLUMINATI So Dr. Fleming was supportive of the efforts of Pro fessor Adam Weishaupt, because he had \"revived the Order.\" Albert Mackey also praised Professor Weishaupt. He wrote these comments in his ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF FREEMA- SONRY: \"... Weishaupt could not have been the monster that he has been painted by his adversaries.\" And the reason he couldn't have been a \"monster,\" w as because he was: \"... a Masonic reformer.\" 305 However, the major support that Weishaupt has recei ved has come from members of the Masonic Order who have at- tacked those who have been critical of the Professo r and the Illuminati he was the founder of. Albert Mackey, for instance, admitted that John Rob ison was a fellow Mason, but he wrote these comments abo ut his belief that a conspiracy had infiltrated the lllumi nati: \"many of his statements are untrue and his argu- ments illogical.\" 306 \"his theory is based on false premises and his reasoning fallacious and illogical ....\" 307 Kenneth Mackenzie in his book entitled THE ROYAL MA - SONIC ENCYCLOPAEDIA also criticized Professor Robis on MM being: \"The author of a silly and self-contradictory book about Freemasonry .... ... the nauseating nonsense with which Robison decks his book is only to be compared to the more virulent and subtle sarcasm of Barruel.\" 308 The individual called \"Barruel\" by Mr. Mackenzie wa s in fact the Abbe Barruel who had written a four volume series on the llluminati in 1798, independently from the book written by Professor Robison. The Abbe's research b asically supported the conclusions of Professor Robison. 113"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 THE ILLUMINATI Obviously, some of the Masons feel that the Abbe, l ike Professor Robison, was grossly in error. This is what the Abbe wrote about the Illuminati: \"... a terrible and horrible sect. \"... it has formed for that general Revolution whic h is to overthrow all thrones, all altars, annihilate al l prop- erty, [destroy the right to private property] effac e [obli- terate] all law, and end by dissolving all society. \" 309 Another who attacked the Abbe's volumes on the Illu - minati was Thomas Jefferson, one of America's found ing fa- thers. Although it appears that he had read only on e of the four volumes in the set, Mr. Jefferson commented: \"Barruel's own parts of the book are perfectly the ravings of a Bedlamite.\" 310 A Bedlamite was a patient of the Bedlam hospital fo r lunatics in London, England. So it can be seen that Mr. Jefferson did not care for the Abbe's research. Whi le he charged the Abbe with being a lunatic, Mr. Jefferso n praised Adam Weishaupt with these words: \"Weishaupt seems to be an enthusiastic philan- thropist. Weishaupt believes that to promote the pe r- fection of the human character was the object of Je sus Christ. His [Weishaupt's] precepts are the love of God and love of our neighbor.\" 311 Albert Mackey, one of the greatest Masonic scholars and researchers, praised the Illuminati with these word s found in his ENCYCLOPAEDIA: \"The original design of Illuminism was undoubtedly the elevation of the human race.\" 312 Mackey also praised the founder as well: \"He is celebrated in the history of Masonry as the founder of the Order of the Illuminati of Bavaria . ...\" 313 114"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 THE ILLUMINATI Other Masonic writers have praised the founder and his conspiratorial society known as the Illuminati as w ell. Ken- neth Mackenzie wrote this: \"Its object was the advancement of morality, educa- tion, and virtue ....\" \"had the Order been allowed free scope, much good would have resulted ....\" 314 But, whether the critics or the supporters were cor rect, the Illuminati had come to America. Several researc hers into the conspiracy of the Illuminati have provided the student with their evidence that these conspirators had bro ught their plans to the United States. Nesta Webster, who wrote in the 1920's, wrote this about her discoveries of where the Illuminati went after their dis- covery by the Bavarian government: \"Whilst these events [the early stages of the Frenc h Revolution of 1789] were taking place in Europe, th e New World [meaning America] had been illuminized. As early as 1786 a lodge of the Order [of the Illu- minati] had been started in Virginia, and this was fol- lowed by fourteen others in different cities.\" 315 In 1798, Jedediah Morse, a minister and the father of Samuel Morse, the inventer of the telegraph, preach ed a now famous sermon on the Illuminati. He clearly had dis covered their presence in America. He said: \"The Order [of the Illuminati] has its branches established and its emissaries at work in America.\" 316 And in 1812, the President at Harvard University, J oseph Willard, retired to preach in Vermont. He took the occasion of his retirement on July 4, 1812, to express his conc ern over the consequences of the then looming war: \"There is sufficient evidence that a number of soci e- ties of the Illuminati have been established in thi s land. They are doubtless striving to secretly under mine all our ancient institutions, civil and sacred. These 115"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 THE ILLUMINATI societies are clearly leagued with those of the sam e or- der in Europe .... We live in an alarming period . The Enemies of all order are seeking our ruin. Should infidelity gener ally prevail, our independence would fall, of course. Ou r re- publican government would be annihilated ...\" 317 Perhaps the next appearance of the Illuminati occur red in Chicago, Illinois, in 1886, in what has been called the Hay- market Riot. It is uncertain as to whether or not t hey were formally involved as an organization, but the whole affair cer- tainly seems to have occurred in a sequence similar to what they would have orchestrated if they had been invol ved. Cyrus McCormick, the owner of a harvester works in Chi- cago, had refused to accept a union to represent hi s employ- ees. When he was pressed by the union, he closed hi s factory and opened it later with non-union workers. The str ikers and the non-union workers clashed, and a squad of polic e arrived. A bomb was thrown from out of the crowd, and it kil led one and wounded many others. Shooting broke out, and si xty- eight policemen were wounded and seven of them kill ed. After the Haymarket affair, a Captain in the Chicag o police department, Michael J. Shaack, decided that he would see if he could determine why the disaster had occu rred, and he started a thorough investigation. About a year l ater, he issued his report, and these are some of his conclu sions: \"All over the world the apostles of disorder, rapin e, [defined as plunder, pillage] and Anarchy are today pressing their work of ruin, and preaching their go spel of disaster to all the nations with a more fiery en ergy and a better organized propaganda than was ever known before. People who imagine that the energy of the revo- lutionists has slackened, or that their determinati on to wreck all the existing systems has grown less bitte r, are deceiving themselves. The conspiracy against so - ciety is as determined as it ever was. Nothing but the uprooting of the very foundations and groundwork of our civilization will satisfy the se enemies of order ....\" 318 116"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 THE ILLUMINATI Although Captain Shaak did not specify that the gro up behind the riot was the Illuminati, he clearly had discovered that the goal of the conspirators was to \"uproot ci vilization,\" which had been their announced goal for over one hu ndred years. It appears that his research had uncovered t he fact that the Illuminati had been at work in America. 1886 was a big year for those uncovering the eviden ce that this conspiracy existed. Two other individuals spoke out about the secret societies in the world. One was He nry Ed- ward Manning, Archbishop of Westminster, England, w ho wrote that the Communist International was: \"the work of secret, political societies, which fro m 1789 to this day have been perfecting their formati on.\" He said that this conspiracy: \"is now a power in the midst of the Christian and civilized world, pledged to the destruction of Chri s- tianity and the old civilization of Europe.\" 319 The other was Abbe Joseph Lane, a respected scholar of the time, who wrote that he had discovered a plan: \"to disorganize at one blow Christian society and the beliefs and customs of the Jews, then bring abo ut a state of things where, religiously speaking, ther e will be neither Christian nor Jew.\" 320 So there were plenty of warnings, but, overall, few in the world listened. And the secret societies continued to prosper. 117"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Chapter 16 Karl Marx, Satanist Other secret societies prospered as well. And some of the historic figures of the past belonged to them. And the fact that these people belonged to these secret societie s has generally not been acknowledged by the historians w ho have written the \"accidental school of history\" (the the ory that the major events happen by accident. It holds that no o ne really knows why wars, depressions, inflations, etc. happe n. They just do. The opposing view of history is called The Con- spiratorial View of History. This view holds that t he major events of the past have happened by design. People plan wars, depressions, inflations, and revolutions year s in ad- vance.) One of these individuals was Karl Marx, the so-call ed \"father of communism.\" Mr. Marx had been born into a relig- ious family. His family was Jewish and had converte d to Christianity shortly before his birth. Karl was lat er baptized into the Protestant faith. 118"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 KARL MARX, SATANIST Marx's first written work was called \"The Union of the Faithful With Christ,\" in which he wrote: \"Through love of Christ we turn our hearts at the same time toward our brethren who are inwardly boun d to us and whom He gave Himself in sacrifice.\" 321 Just a short time later, he wrote this poem he enti tled \"The Pale Maiden:\" \"Thus heaven I've forfeited. I know it full well. My soul, once true to God, Is chosen for hell.\" 322 George Jung, a friend of Marx's during this time, a dded this comment about Marx's attitude: \"Marx will surely chase God from his heaven and will even sue him. Marx calls the Christian religio n one of the most immoral of religions.\" 323 Marx confirmed this position that something had cha nged his mind about Christianity with these quotations f rom his writings: \"The abolition of religion as the illusory happines s of man is a demand for their real happiness.\" 324 \"I wish to avenge myself against the One who rules above.\" 325 Something had indeed changed Marx's view of Chris- tianity. He continued: \"We must war against all prevailing ideas of reli- gion, of the state, of country, of patriotism. The idea of God is the keynote of a perverted civilization. It must be destroyed.\" 326 As can be illustrated by his own writings, somethin g had not only changed his ideas on Christianity, but som ething had changed his ideas on what God had taught man th rough 119"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 KARL MARX, SATANIST the Bible. Marx was now being critical of God's ins tructions about: How to worship the Creator; How to create a nation to protect God-given rights; Why to establish and maintain national borders; How to create the conditions under which all could be free to love their Creator. All of these ideas had a Biblical foundation. All o f these principles were taught in the Bible. And each of th ese ideas had been tested by a variety of civilizations for m any cen- turies, but as can be seen from his writings, Marx wanted to \"war against\" all of these Biblical principles. Something had indeed changed his mind. In addition, Marx had found another bulwark of God' s plan for man to be unsatisfactory. He also discover ed he had to war against the family. Marx wrote this in his COMMUNIST MANIFESTO: \"Abolition of the family! Even the most radical fla re up at this infamous proposal of the Communists.\" 327 His bitterness towards the family unit caused membe rs of his own family to suffer as well: \"Arnold Kunzli, in his book KARL MARX - A PSYCHOGRAM, writes about Marx's life, including the suicide of two daughters and a son-in-law. Three ch il- dren [of his] died of malnutrition. His daughter La ura, married to the Socialist Lafargue, also buried thre e of her children; then she and her husband committed su - icide together. Another daughter Eleanor, decided with her hus- band to do likewise. She died; he backed out at the last minute.\" 328 120"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 KARL MARX, SATANIST Marx further showed his disdain for the family unit by fathering a child with his own personal maid. She w as a gift from his mother-in-law upon the occasion of Marx's wedding. Apparently he found no hypocrisy in the fact that h e had a maid at the time he considered himself to be the ch ampion of the working man. Marx railed against the rich and p ros- perous, those who were wealthy enough to have had m aids. But he had one himself. It is possible to understand a small degree of the utter despair that Jenny von Westphelan, Karl Marx's wife , must have felt being married to a man who allowed such t ragedies to occur. Marx was quoted as writing: \"Daily, my wife tells me she wishes she were ly- ing in the grave with the children. And truly I can not blame her.\" 329 But the historians who have probed Marx's backgroun d have generally failed to uncover the reason that he had be- come so bitter against Christianity and all of its teachings. A few honest historians have uncovered the something that changed Marx's views, and that something was Satan wor- ship. Marx had discovered the world of the occult. Marx had first been brought to the ideas of Sociali sm by Moses Hess when he was 23. But the most important i nflu- in his young life was the worship of Satan. Many of his friends had discovered this religion be fore he had. One was Mikhail Bakunin, a Russian anarchist, who wrote: \"Satan is the first free-thinker and Saviour of the world. He frees Adam and impresses the seal of hu- manity and liberty on his forehead, by making him disobedient.\" 330 Another friend of Marx's was Pierre Proudhon, a Fre nch socialist and writer. Marx had been introduced to P roudhon by Hess. Mr. Proudhon \"worshipped Satan,\" accord ing to a book about him and his relationship with Karl Marx. 331 He had written that God was the prototype for injus tice: 121"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 KARL MARX, SATANIST \"We reach knowledge in spite of him, we reach society in spite of him. Every step forward is a vi ctory in which we overcome the Divine. God is stupidity a nd cowardice; God is hypocrisy and falsehood; God is tyranny and poverty; God is evil. Where humanity bows before an altar, humanity, the slave of kings and priests, will be condemned . ... I swear, God, with my hand stretched out to- wards the heavens, that you are nothing more than the executioner of my reason, the scepter of my con - science .... God is essentially anti-civilized, ant i-liberal, anti-human.\" Here Proudhon declared God to be evil because he be - lieved that God had denied man his ability to \"reas on.\" Notice that the thoughts of these men were not thos e of an atheist. Marx and his friends, at this stage of their lives, were not atheists, as present day Marxists describe them- selves. That is, while they openly denounced and re viled God, they hated Him while they acknowledged His existenc e. They did not challenge His existence. They challenged Hi s su- premacy. The thing that changed Marx's views about life was the fact that he had discovered the world of Satan wors hip. There is evidence that he had joined a Satanic cult head- ed by Joana Southcott, a Satanic priestess who cons idered herself to be in contact with a demon named Shiloh. One of the distinguishing characteristics of his membershi p in this cult was his long hair and unkempt beard, worn by m embers of her cult. Proudhon also wore his hair in a simil ar manner, and it is quite likely that he was a member of this cult as well. Other Communists have declared their hatred of God. One, a communist named Flourens, wrote this in 1871 : \"Our enemy is God. Hatred of God is the begin- ning of wisdom.\" 332 Another notable Communist, Nikolai Lenin, the fathe r of the Communist revolution of 1917 in Russia, also vo iced his hatred of God and religion. He wrote the following comments: 122"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 KARL MARX, SATANIST \"Atheism is an integral part of Marxism. Marxism is materialism. We must combat religion.\" 333 \"We, of course, say that we do not believe in God. We do not believe in eternal morality.

Down with religion. Long live atheism. The spread of atheism is our chi ef task. Communism abolishes eternal truths. It abolis hes all religion and morality.\" 335 \"Religion is a kind of spiritual intoxicant, in which the slaves of capital drown their humanity, a nd blunt their desire for decent human experience.\" 336 \"We shall always preach a scientific philosophy. We must fight against the inconsistencies of the Ch ris- tians ....\" 337 Lenin, like Marx before him, came from a religious family. His father was a school inspector, and a devout mem ber of the Russian Orthodox Church. But, at the age of eig hteen, Lenin started reading Karl Marx and soon was expoun ding Marxist principles. He later wrote: \"Atheism is a natural and inseparable portion of Marxism, of the theory and practice of scientific S ocial- ism. Our propaganda necessarily includes propaganda for atheism.\" 338 Other Communists have joined the attack on religion. Nikita Khrushchev, a Russian dictator who embraced the Communist theology during the time he spent at the top of the Russian government, wrote this: \"Do not think that the Communists have changed their minds about religion. We remain the Athei sts that we have always been; we are doing as much as 123"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 KARL MARX, SATANIST we can to liberate those people who are still under the spell of this religious opiate.\" 339 But notice that Mr. Khrushchev went one step furthe r than some of the other atheists. He stated that the task of the Communist atheists was to \"liberate\" the God-fe arers from their God. This, obviously, is the task not on ly of the Communists but of the New World Order. Others, more recently, have praised Marxism. One ev en served in a high administrative position inside Pre sident Jimmy Carter's cabinet. He was Zbigniew Brzezinski, the Special Assistant to the President for National Sec urity Affairs. He was, or is, also Director of the Resear ch Institute on International Change, Professor of Public Law an d Gov- ernment, and a member of the Russian Institute, all at Co- lumbia University. In 1970, Mr. Brzezinski wrote a book entitled BETWE EN TWO AGES, in which he made some startling observati ons on the nature of Marxism. Some of these are as follows : \"... Marxism represents a further vital and creative stage in the maturing of man's universal vision.\" \"Marxism is simultaneously a victory of the exter- nal, active man over the inner, passive man and a v ic- tory of reason over belief ....\" \"... Marxism has served as a mechanism of hu- man 'progress,' even is its practice has often fall en short of its ideals.\" \"Teilhard de Chardin [a modern day Jesuit theo- logian and writer] notes at one point that 'monstro us as it is, is not modern totalitarianism really the distortion of something magnificent, and thus quite near to the truth?'\" \"... what will probably remain the major contri- bution of Marxism: its revolutionary and broadening influence, which opened man's mind to previously ig - nored perspectives and dramatized previously neglec t- ed concerns.\" \"... Marxism, disseminated on the popular level in the form of communism, represented a major advance 124"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 KARL MARX, SATANIST in man's ability to conceptualize his relationship to the world.\" \"Marxism ... provided a unique intellectual tool for understanding and harnessing the fundamental fo r- ces of our time. ... it supplied the best available insight into con - temporary reality.\" 340 It is one thing to make all of these favorable comm ents about Marxism, and it is another to actually test t he theory against the reality. There are nations around the world that have applie d Marx's theories. It is now possible to measure the promises against the actuality. One who has actually attempted to determine the act ual practice of Marxism in Communist Russia was Robert Con- guest, a famed British Sovietologist. He esti mated that at least 21,500,000 human beings had been executed or killed in other ways by the Marxist Communist authorities dur ing and after the Russian Revolution of 1917. Mr. Conquest pointed that out this figure was a low estimate and that th e total figure could go as high as 45,000,000. The revolution in Russia was the first successful a ttempt to create a government in a nation based upon the t heories of Marxism, the \"victory of reason over belief.\" China as a nation also experienced a similar fate d uring its Communist revolution of 1923 to 1947. Professor Richard L. Walker in an official government report released by the Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security in 1971 es timated that the total dead in China might go as high as 64 ,000,000. China, too, had experienced the Marxist \"victory of reason over belief.\" A tourist who visited China after the United States had established diplomatic relations with that nation in 1973 shared his thoughts about how Marxism had worked in China in an article he wrote for the August 10, 1973 N ew York Times newspaper.

The authors of a book on this organization wrote: \"It is in the Thule Society that one has to look for the real inspiration of Nazism.\" 345 The Thule Society had interesting roots.

In i t, he makes this observation: \"The inner group which controlled the Thule So- ciety contained men who were self-confessed Luci- ferians ....\" 350 So, the evidence is that Hitler himself became a Lu ci- ferian. He had absorbed the works of the tragic phi losopher, Friedrich Nietzsche: \"whose powerful dissertation on 'the Genealogy of Morals' sought to make a 'Revaluation of all values ' in the proof that so-called evil was good, and what wa s habitually believed to be good was evil.\" 351 Here is that thought again that the God of the Bibl e is \"evil,\" and somehow the \"god\" considered to be evil is \"good.\" And that what was needed was a \"re-evaluation of mo r- als.\" In other words, that which has been taught by the 129"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 17 ADOLPH HITLER, SATANIST Biblical \"good\" God has to be eliminated, and a new system substituted therefor.

But Hitler also acknowledged the role of Freemasonr y in his life: \"In Hitler's observations, published ... under the title HITLER SPEAKS ... one can rediscover the important role played by German Freemasonry as a model for esoteric structuring of the Nazi Party.\" 352 Just like so many other secret societies, the Thule Society had an \"esoteric structuring.\" That must have meant that there were two classes of members, those who knew w hat the secret was and those who didn't. But there is evidence that Adolf Hitler was one of the members of the Society that knew. The man who played the most important role in Hitle r's life was Dietrich Eckart, one of the original seven who founded the Nazi Party and who was in fact called t he \"spiritual founder of Nazism.\" One writer wrote jus t how important Eckart was in Hitler's life: \"Adolf Hitler himself considered Eckart as the most important influence on his life.\" 353 It is known that Eckart had experimented with numer ous drugs in an attempt to reach \"higher consciousness .\" It is now being discovered that Hitler also attempted th e same thing: \"... Hitler attained higher levels of consciousness by means of drugs and made a penetrating study of medieval occultism and ritual magic ....\" 354 Eckart has been called: \"a dedicated Satanist ... and the central figure in a powerful and wide-spread circle of occultists - t he Thule Society.\" 355 But he was also believed in the future appearance o f Lord Maitreya, the hoped for New Age Messiah.

When he lay dy- ing, he told those gathered at his bedside: \"Follow Hitler! He will dance, but it is I who have called the tune! I have initiated him into the 'Secret Doctrine,' opened his centres in vision and given him the means to communicate with the Powers. Do not mourn for me: I shall have influenced history more than any other German.\" 357 \"Eckart claimed to his fellow adepts in the Thule Society that he had personally received a kind of Satanic annunciation [meaning announcement] that he was destined to prepare the vessel of the Anti-Chri st, the man inspired by Lucifer to conquer the world an d lead the Aryan race to glory.\" 358 Another of the links of the Thule Society with Luci fer worship is the emblem chosen as the symbol of the N azi Party itself: the swastika. The dictionary defines a swastika as a cross with its four equal arms bent back in a right angle extension. There are two forms of the symbol: one w ith its arms bent to the left, and one with the arms bent t o the right. The former is universally a symbol of good, while the l a t t e r is universally a symbol of evil. \"Hitler personally selected the final design of the Nazi Blood Flag [the one carrying the swastika as a n emblem representing the Nazi Party.] He reversed th e swastika [from the one proposed] to the form that represents evil ....\" 359 Hitler had a model to base his selection on: the sw astika was the symbol of the Thule Society.

Hall in his book entitled LECTURES ON ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY advised his readers just what th e swastika represented: \"The swastika ... is the whirling cross that represents the centralizing motion of the Eternal ALL.\" 361 One of the original founders of the Thule Society, Rudolf von Sebottendorf, linked the swastika with another symbol, the sun, when he made this statement in November of 1918: \"I intend to commit the Thule Society to this combat .... I swear it on this swastika, on this si gn which for us is sacred, in order that you hear it, O magnificent Sun!\" 362 So the swastika was a symbol of the Thule Society; it was a symbol of the Nazi Party; it was somehow connecte d to a symbol of the Sun-god; and the Sun-god was a symbol of Lucifer. And those who resisted the symbol of the swastika a nd all it represented had to pay for it with the supreme s acrifice on the bloody altar of war. 50 million people died in World War II. 50 million people sacrificed to the religion of Luc ifer. All because the historians who write the \"accidenta l view of history\" somehow were unable to determine that Adolf Hitler had joined a Luciferic cult named The Thule Society some 16 years before the war started.

The thought that America has a \"secret destiny\" wil l probably startle those not familiar with secret soc ieties and their plans for America and the world.

He wrote that the Order of the Quest: \"... was set up in America before the middle of the 17th century,\" [meaning sometime between 1625 to 1675.] 365 That means that Mr. Hall felt that the members of t his Order came to America about the same time that the first settlers arrived. American history records that the first visitors from Europe to the American shore were the English settlers who came in 1607, to be followed by the Pi lgrims in 1620. But Mr. Hall says that amongst those early se ttlers was a group committed by a secret oath. But the only name he mentioned as being involved in the Order of the Quest was that of Benjamin Franklin, o ne of America's founding fathers: \"[Benjamin] Franklin spoke for the Order of the Quest, and most of the men who worked with him in the early days of the American Revolution were also members.\" 366 He further identified most of those men as being, n ot only members of the Order, but also Freemasons as well: \"Not only were many of the founders of the United States Government Masons, but they received aid fro m a secret and august body existing in Europe [the II - luminati?] which helped them to establish this coun try for a particular purpose known only to the initiate d few.\" 367 So a secret society, or several secret societies, d ecided that America would be fertile ground for the establishme nt of a new society, or as Mr. Hall called it, a \"particula r purpose.\" It can be known that those who created the Constitu tion of the United States and its resulting government w ere not 134"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 THE GREAT SEAL connected to the Order of the Quest. Those who crea ted the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States created perhaps the finest documents ever penned by men. The Constitutional Republic they cre ated was the greatest form of government ever devised by man . They created some problems inside the document, (for exa mple it permitted slavery,) but overall, they created the m ost magnificent form of government in the history of th e world. It is obvious that these men, even though Hall stat ed that they were men who \"labored in the cause of world de mo- cracy,\" could not have been the original Founding F athers, because their purpose inside the Order was known on ly to the \"initiated few.\" The creation of America's Republic was certainly a public act, made known, it is certain, to every freedom se eking nation in the world. People do not keep freedom quiet! They let the worl d know that it has been officially recognized by the Ameri can Con- stitution. Even in nations under totalitarian Communism, where freedom of the press is either non-existent, or in nearly total control of the government, people know that America did something that only a few other societies in the pa st had ever done: they had created a truly free Republic! Even today, people still swim shark infested waters , climb over barbed wire fences, and dodge army patrols in the dark of night to come to America, because they seek free dom!

Only those with evil purposes create \"secret societ ies,\" with \"secret oaths,\" with \"particular purposes\" kno wn only to an \"initiated few.\" So the purpose of the Order of the Quest was not beneficial to freedom loving peoples, no matter tha t Mr. Hall says they \"labored in the cause of world democracy. \" They must know something that the rest of America d oes not know: their cause is evil! 135"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 THE GREAT SEAL Mr. Hall then instructed the reader that the Order of the Quest concealed their purpose inside the symbols of the Great Seal of the United States. This seal is the one tha t appears on the back side of the American dollar bill, and c onsists of two sides, what are called the Obverse side, the on e with the eagle, and the Reverse side, the one with the pyram id. Mr. Hall tells his reader: \"... if the design on the obverse side of the seal [the eagle] is stamped with the signature of the Order o f the Quest, the design on the reverse, [the pyramid] is even more definitely related to the Old Mysteries.\" 368 Here Mr. Hall connects the reverse side of the Grea t Seal with the ancient mysteries, the worship of Lucifer as a sun- god. The Great Seal was designed and accepted in 1782, b ut not until several committees appointed by Congress had failed to design one. The first committee was asked by the Continental Co n- gress on July 4, 1776, to \"prepare a device for a s eal of the United States of America,\" and consisted of three m en: Ben- jamin Franklin, John Adams, and Thomas Jeffe rson. This committee of three was not able to decide on a desi gn, so Congress appointed a second committee. This committ ee also had difficulty in deciding, so Congress ap pointed a third committee. They referred the problem to Charles Tho mson, the Secretary of Congress, and his designs were ado pted on June 20, 1782. Max Toth wrote a book about the history of the Egyp tian pyramids, and including a brief review of the pyram id on the back of the dollar bill. This is what he wrote: \"All three committees appointed in succession by Congress between 1776 and 1782 included members holding various positions in Freemasonry.\" 369 So, those who were deciding the design of the Great Seals were not only Masons, but were quite possibly membe rs of the Order of the Quest. Mr. Hall said that the Orde r placed \"their signature\" on both sides of the Seal. So, th ere is reason to believe that at the very least, some of the Maso ns were also members of the Order. 136"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 THE GREAT SEAL Mr. Hall then commented: \"European mysticism was not dead at the time the United States of America was founded. The hand of t he Mysteries controlled in the establishment of the ne w government, for the signature of the Mysteries may still be seen on the Great Seal of the United States of America.\" 370 \"The Great Seal is the signature of this exalted body — unseen and for the most part unknown - and the unfinished pyramid upon its reverse side is a trestleboard setting forth symbolically the task to the accomplishment of which the United States Governmen t was dedicated from the day of its inception.\" 371 He elaborated further: \"There is only one possible origin for these symbol s, and that is the secret societies which came to this coun- try 150 years before the Revolutionary war [about 1 620, the date that the Pilgrims came to America.] There can be no question that the great seal was di - rectly inspired by these orders of the human quest, and that it set forth the purpose for this nation as th at pur- pose was seen and known to the Founding Fathers.\" 372 So America has a \"secret destiny.\" And that secret purpose was being kept from the majority of America's citiz ens. But for the curious, there are ways of determining just what that secret destiny is. The symbols of the Great Seals can be deciphered. A meri- cans can know what that future is. \"Careful analysis of the seal discloses a mass of occult and Masonic symbols ....\" 373 Mr. Hall tells us that some of these symbols have M asonic interpretations. The Masons also have symbols, and have, on occansion, revealed what those symbols mean. So, it becomes possible to know what those Masonic symbols on the Great Seal mean. 137 "},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 THE GREAT SEAL James H.

Ther efore, it would be possible to determine the future of Americ a if these symbols could be deciphered. But first, it would be helpful to decipher as many of the remaining symbols on both sides of the Great Seal a s pos- sible.

It was stil l in its infant stage in 1782, and what it is will be ex plored in some of the following paragraphs. The eagle in the obverse side has very definite mys tic meanings. Manly P. Hall gives us one: \"In mysticism the eagle is a symbol of initiation . ...\" 375 Rex Hutchens gives another: \"The eagle: ... this emblem is of great antiquity figuring in the symbolic inventory of the Egyptians , as the sun; as wisdom is attained through reason, the eagle is also symbolic of reason.\" \"Among the Egyptians the eagle was the emblem of a wise man because his wings bore him above the clouds into the purer atmosphere and nearer to the source of light, and his eyes were not dazzled by t hat 138"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 THE GREAT SEAL light. Since the eagle also represented the great Egyptian Sun god Amun Ra, it is a symbol of the inf in- ite Supreme Reason of Intelligence.\" 376 Another Mason who connected the eagle with the sun was Kenneth Mackenzie: \"With the Egyptians, the Greeks and the Persians, the eagle was sacred to the sun.\" 377 Albert Pike also confirmed this connection when he wrote these comments about the eagle: \"a bird consecrated to the Sun in Egypt.\" \"The Eagle was the Living Symbol of Mendes, a representative of the Sun.\" 378 Perhaps the reason that the eagle was considered to be sacred to the Egyptians was offered by Robert Hiero nimus in his book entitled THE TWO GREAT SEALS OF AMERICA: \"... the eagle has been linked to the Sun [the word has been capitalized, apparently referring to the s un as a deity, rather than to the daytime sun] for it can fly nearer to the Sun than any other bird, and is the o nly bird that is said to symbolically look directly int o the Sun's rays.\" 379 Another writer who wrote a book on the Great Seal w as E. Raymond Capt, and he added this confirmation i n his book entitled OUR GREAT SEAL: \"The Eagle ... is also supposed to be the only creature that can look directly into the sun.\" 380 It is revealing that some of the authors appear to under- stan d the symbology of the Sun, and others think it is just the gaseous orb that lights the earth. The drawing of the eagle conceals other secrets and it will assist the student to examine these as well. The ea gle in the seal has nine tail feathers, and either 32 or 33 fe athers on each of the two wings. These are symbols that have to be interpreted: 139"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 THE GREAT SEAL \"The nine tail feathers of the eagle represent the nine beings in the innermost circle of enlightenmen t in the 'Great White Brotherhood - or the Illuminati.'\" 381 There is another explanation, one more acceptable t han the one offered above by Stan Deyo in his book enti tled THE COSMIC CONSPIRACY. There are nine degrees in the Yo rk Rite of Freemasonry, and connecting the York Rite t o the tail feathers appears to be the more plausible explanati on. The feathers on the two wings also conceal a secret . There are 32 on the right side, symbolic of the 32 degree s inside the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, and 33 on the left si de, symbolic of the honorary 33rd degree. The \"all-seeing eye\" above the pyramid has two mean ings, both related to the Masonic Order. One explanation was provided by the Masons themselves in an article tha t was inside a Masonic Bible. It said: \"The ubiquity of Masonic law was symbolized by the All-Seeing Eye.\" 382 The word ubiquity is defined as the capacity of bei ng everywhere at the same time. The Masons are saying that their law, the one that will punish the Mason shoul d he reveal their secrets, is everywhere and that he can not hide from it. The second interpretation of the symbol of the eye has been offered by many Masons, including Albert Macke y: \"An important symbol of the Supreme Being, bor- rowed by the Freemasons from the nations of antiqui ty. ... the open eye was selected as the symbol of watchfulness, and the eye of God as the symbol of Divine watchfulness and care of the universe.\" \"The All-Seeing-Eye may then be considered as a symbol of God manifested in his omnipresence ....\" 383 So, the simplest explanation of the symbol is that it is the symbol of a deity. And some of the Masons in their writings have told the student who that deity is. 140"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 THE GREAT SEAL One of the Masons who took the next step in explain ing what the symbol stood for was Kenneth Mackenzie who wrote this: \"The eye was also the symbol of Osiris.\" 384 This was confirmed by another Mason, Carl Claudy: \"This [the All-Seeing Eye] is one of the oldest and most widespread symbols denoting God. The Open Eye of Egypt represented Osiris.\" 385 Mr. Mackey also confirmed that the All Seeing Eye w as a symbol of Osiris: \"... the Egyptians represented Osiris, their chief deity, by the symbol of an open eye ....\" 386 Albert Pike connected Osiris with the S un with this comment from his book MORALS AND DOGMA: \"... Osiris, the Sun, Source of Light and Principle of Good ....\" 387 Manly P. Hall connected the symbol of the eye with the symbol of the sun with this statement: \"His symbol, therefore, was an opened eye, in honor of the Great Eye of the universe, the sun.\" 388 Rex Hutchens, one of the most recent Masons to writ e a major book supporting the Masonic Order, also wrote that the all-seeing eye was a symbol of the sun. He wrote: \"On the right side [of a sash worn by a Member of the Masons inside the Temple] is painted an eye of gold, a symbol of the sun or of the Deity.\" 389 Albert Pike however revealed the exact meaning of the symbol in his book MORALS AND DOGMA: \"The All-Seeing Eye ... which to the Ancients was the Sun.\" 390 141"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 THE GREAT SEAL So, the all-seeing eye is a symbol concealing the M asonic belief that Osiris, a representative of the sun, wa s a god. And some of these writers have reported that the sun-go d was Lucifer. So, the all-seeing eye is a symbol of Lucifer, the all-seeing god of the universe. And it was placed on the Ameri can seal by those who knew what it meant. The unfinished pyramid under the All-Seeing Eye als o has a symbolic meaning, as described by the Treasury Department of the United States government in 1935: \"The pyramid is the symbol of strength and its un- finished condition denoted the belief of the design ers of the Great Seal that there was still work to be done .\" 391 (Notice that the Treasury Department reported that the pyramid was \"unfinished [it had no capstone]\" becau se \"there was still work to be done\" in the United States. Th e common explanation that the \"New World Order\" in the Great Seal was the creation of the Republic under the American Consti- tution simply isn't true. That work was finished by the time that the seal was approved in 1782. That means that the \"work still to be done\" had to be completed in the future. The work of creating a \"New World Order\" was, in 1782, \"still in the future.\") But, the all-seeing eye has a far more symbolic mea ning to the Masons, as was described by E. Raymond Capt: \"The triangle, in connection with the All-Seeing Eye, is the Masonic symbol of the 'Grand Architect of the Universe.'\" 392 Manly P. Hall told his readers who the Great Archit ect of the Universe was: he was the Master of the Masonic Lodges: \"The Mason believes in the Great Architect .... Let him never forget that the Master is near. The All-seeing Eye is upon him.\" 393 The Great Architect of the Universe is the title of the god of the Masonic order. But there are some who feel t hat this god is not the God of the Bible, but Lucifer, consi dered by these to be the god of some of the Masons.

It has been my purpose t o prove that that conclusion is true with evidence from the Masons themselves. Some of that evidence has been presente d in the material in earlier chapters of this study. Other e vidence will follow in the remaining chapters of this book.) Other Masonic symbols on the dollar bill, as told t o the student by the Masons themselves in their magazine entitled The New Age are the: 13 leaves in the olive branches; 13 bars and stripes in the shield; 13 arrows; 13 letters in \"E Pluribus Unum\" on the ribbon; 13 stars in the green crest above; 13 granite stones in the Pyramid; 13 letters in \"Annuit Coeptis\"; On the front of the dollar bill is the seal of the United States, made up of a key, square, and the Scales of Justice, as well as a compass, which, of course, is an important symbol in Masonry. 395 It is quite certain that the student of history wil l argue that the number 13 used in all of these symbols sim ply refers to the thirteen states that ratified the Constitution. This would be a reasonable explanation, were it not for the fact that the Masons claim the number as one of their ow n. It appears as if they decided that it was tim e to form the United States when the number of states t hat could be united in the Union reached 13. As was just illustr ated, the Masons consider the number to have Masonic sig nificance. 143"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 THE GREAT SEAL They apparently waited for just that time when ther e were exactly 13 states to form the union, and not 12 or 14. One who has assigned an esoteric interpretation to the number 13 is Stan Deyo, the author who said this in his book entitled THE COSMIC CONSPIRACY: \"13 is the value assigned to Satan.\" 396 But the key phrase on the back of the dollar bill a nd inside the Great Seal is the Latin phrase NOVUS ORD O SECLORUM. It means: NOVUS: New ORDO: Order SECLORUM: World The New World Order! The New World Order on the American dollar bill is not the \"republic\" of thirteen states created by the fo unding fathers. It is the future one thousand year reign o f Lord Maitreya, the New Age \"messiah.\" Lord Maitreya is t he earth's representative of the sun-god, Lucifer. And the future period is symbolized by the unfinished pyramid, sig nifying that the future work is yet to be done. It is an easy task to show that the New World Order is not the republican form of government the founding fathers created, because the pyramid is unfinished. Whatever the New World Order is, it was not completed in 1782. A nd it is not in place yet. America is to bring the New Age to the world of the future! Some of this nation's founding fathers said so! There is no question but that the Great Seal has g reat significance to both the Masonic Order and the \"Ord er of the Quest\" described by Manly P. Hall, a member of the Masons. There is one final piece to be placed into the puzz le of the entire scenario, and that is to determine why these symbols appear on the dollar bill at all. Why should the gr eat seal of the United States contain any symbols that conceal secrets from the overwhelming majority of the Ame rican people?

He suggested that the Seal be put on the dollar bill r ather than a coin and took the matter up with the Secreta ry of the Treasury.\" 398 Some Masons created the Great Seal in 1782, and ot her Masons put it on the back of the American dolla r bill in 1935. And it appears that all involved knew the mea ning of the concealed symbols portrayed therein. There is an abundance of evidence that the Masons w ere heavily involved in the founding of the United Stat es and the design of the Great Seal. 145"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 THE GREAT SEAL The Supreme Council of the 33rd Degree of the Scott ish Rite of Freemasonry has told the student that 13 of the 39 original signers of the Constitution were Masons. 399 Another Mason, Past Sovereign Grand Commander Henry Clausen , put the figure at 23 of the 39. 400 It is also interesting to note that there were 39 signers, exactly three times the Masonic number 13. Other Masons assumed responsible positions inside t he Army fighting for freedom against the English gover nment. 33 Generals in George Washington's army and six of his aides were Freemasons. 401 The Masons then and the Masons now are looking forw ard to the \"NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM,\" the Latin phrase on t he bottom of the reverse side of the Great Seal. Manly P. Hall told the world about the return of Os iris, someday, when he wrote this: \"Osiris will rise in splendor from the dead and rul e the world through those sages and philosophers in w hom wisdom has become incarnate.\" 402 The return to a worship of Osiris and what he repre sents as the sun-god, the worship of Lucifer, is still in the future. One who told the world that was C. William Smith of New Orleans, Louisiana, in the September, 1950 copy of the New Age Magazine, the official publication of the Supre me Council, 33rd Degree Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. What Mr. Smith wrote is extremely revealing. After the student has learned that Lucifer is the god of some of the Masons, it appears that the way to truly understand what he wrote is to substitute the name Lucifer whenever he refers to God. He wrote: \"God's plan is dedicated to the unification of all races, religions and creeds. This plan, dedicated to the n ew order of things, is to make all things new — a new nation , a new race, a new civilization and a new religion, a nons ectarian religion that has already been called the religion of 'The Great Light.'

Hall has said about Freemasonry. He c alled it: \"the most powerful organization in the land.\" 405 Alice Bailey, the New Age leader, has written this about the Masonic Fraternity: 148"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19 THE FREEMASONS \"It is a far more occult organization than can be realised, and is intended to be the training school for the coming advanced occultists.\" 406 The word occult is defined as hidden, concealed, se cret, and esoteric. And an occultist is one who believes in con- cealing secrets from others. The Masons, it is to be assumed, would rush in to d efend themselves against such charges. Any secret, hidden or con- cealed organization would have to, especially if it was discovered that their purposes were not what the av erage citizen believed. And that appears to be exactly wh at this Order has done. The traditional explanation offered by Freemasonry as to its purpose is this one offered by Henry Clausen, a former Sovereign Grand Commander of the Masonic Order. He said it was: \"a particular system of morality, veiled in allegory, and illustrated by symbols.\" 407 The Masons will only admit certain individuals into their initiation ceremonies. Those qualifications are: \"A candidate for initiation must be a man, free- born, unmutilated and of mature age.\" 408 There is one more requirement: they must profess a belief in a supreme being. W.F. Brainard, a Mason in New London, Connecticut, gave a speech in 1825 describing the Order he was a member of He said: \"What is Masonry now? It is powerful. It com- prises men of rank, wealth, office and talent, in p ower and out of power; and that, in almost every place where Power is. of any importance; and it comprises among other classes of the community, to the lowest , in large numbers, active men, united together, and ca- pable of being directed by the efforts of others, s o as to have the Force of Concert throughout the civiliz ed world. 149"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19 THE FREEMASONS They are distributed too, with the means of knowing one another, and the means of keeping secre t, and the means of cooperating, in the desk -- in the Legislative Hall ~ on the Bench -- in every gatheri ng of business ~ in peace and war - among enemies and friends — in one place as well as in another! So powerful indeed, is it at this time that it fear s nothing from violence, either public or private, fo r it has every means to learn it in season, to counterac t, defeat and punish it.\" 409 As has been discussed, members of this powerful org aniza- tion have access to a secret. Included in that secr et are plans for the future of the world. And whatever those pla ns are, they are kept from the average citizen. \"Very early in our Masonic career, we are taught that Freemasonry is a system of morality, the pecul i- arities of which are veiled from [the] uninstructed and popular world by allegorical treaching [sic: teachi ng?] and symbolic illustration.\" 410 It appears to be a logical conclusion that if the M asons had another morality, and if that morality was soun d and would be of benefit to all the people of the world, you would think that they would make it public, instead of co ncealing it inside mysteries and allegories. One can only wonde r if the reason their morality is kept secret is because the ir morality is not sound and of benefit to the general public. That would certainly explain why they want to keep it buried, away from the gaze of the citizens of the world. Another Mason, George Steinmetz in his book entitle d FREEMASONRY, ITS HIDDEN MEANING, says: \"It is in the ancient symbols of Freemasonry that its real secrets lie concealed and these are densel y veiled to the Mason as to any other. The most profound secrets of Masonry are not revealed in the Lodge at all. They belong only to t he few.\" 411 150"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19 THE FREEMASONS So the secrets of the Masons do not even belong to all of the Masons. Some Masons know and some other Masons do not know the meanings of the secrets. But the inter esting thing is that the Masons who do not know are being lied to by those who do. Albert Pike confirmed that this st atement was true by writing this in the book that used to b e read by all Masons inside the Scottish Rite, Southern Juris diction, Masonic Order, entitled MORALS AND DOGMA: \"The Blue degrees [the first three degrees of the 32] are but the outer court or portico [a covered w alk] of the Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the Initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false i nter- pretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them; but it is intended that he shall imagine that he sh all understand them. Their true explication is reserved for the Adepts, the Princes of Masonry.\" 412 The initiate is being lied to by his own fellow Mas ons! One brother is lying to another! Some of the Masons are concealing the true meaning of the secrets from oth er Ma- sons. And this is the way that the powerful Masons operate, the organization that men of rank, wealth, office a nd talent are joining? Pike repeated that position inside the same book, b ut on another page: \"Masonry conceals its secrets from all except the Adepts and Sages, or the elect, and uses false expl ana- tions and misinterpretations of its symbols to misl ead those who deserve only to be misled; to conceal the Truth, which it calls Light, from them, and to draw them away from it.\" 413 It might be informative at this juncture to identif y just what an \"adept\" believed in.

It would certainly seem so. Manly P. Hall also revealed the truth that not all Masons understand the meaning of the secrets inside the Te mple. He wrote this in his book entitled LECTURES ON ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY: \"Freemasonry is a fraternity within a fraternity — an outer organization concealing an inner brotherho od of the elect. ... it is necessary to establish the existence of these two separate yet interdependent orders, the o ne visible and the other invisible. The visible society is a splendid camaraderie of 'free and accepted' men enjoined to devote themselv es to ethical, educational, fraternal, patriotic, and hu- manitarian concerns. The invisible society is a secret and most august fraternity whose members are dedicated to the servi ce of a mysterious arcanum arcandrum [defined as a se- cret; a mystery.] Those brethren who have essayed to write the history of their craft have not included in their d is- quisitions [a formal discourse or treatise] the sto ry of that truly secret inner society which is to the bod y Freemasonic what the heart is to the body human. In each generation only a few are accepted into the inner sanctuary of the work .... ... the great initiate-philosophers of Freemasonry are ... masters of that secret doctrine which forms the invisible foundation of every great theological and ra- tional institution.\" 415 He further amplified this thought when he wrote the se comments in another of his books, this one entitled THE LOST KEYS OF FREEMASONRY: 152"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19 THE FREEMASONS \"The initiated brother realizes that his so-called symbols and rituals are merely blinds, fabricated b y the wise to perpetuate ideas incomprehensible to th e average individual. He also realizes that few Masons of today know or appreciate the mystic meaning concealed within these rituals.\" 416 Other Masonic writers have confirmed that there are two classes of Masons. Kenneth Mackenzie added this con firma- tion: \"At the present day there are many secrets not usually given, and indeed the condition of Masonic education, except among a certain class, is very lo w. There are many good Masons well acquainted with the ritual, and even the lectures, but they fa il from want of taste and opportunity to grasp the subtler philosophy of Freemasonry.\" 417 The Masons are quick to point out that they do not tell even their more intelligent fellow Masons what the secrets are; they ask them to figure it out for themselves. But, Pike says, they start the process by hinting that the Ma sons \"wor- ship\" something other than the God of the Bible in the first degree. Apparently, if the Mason can figure it out for hims elf just who the other Masons worship, he gets to be one of them. This is what Pike wrote in MORALS AND DOGMA: \"It is for each individual Mason to discover the secret of Masonry .... Masonry does not inculcate her truths. She states them, once and briefly; or hints them, perhaps, dar kly; or interposes a cloud between them and eyes that would be dazzled by them. That rite [the Scottish Rite] raises a corner of th e veil, even in the Degree of Apprentice [the first d egree of the Blue lodge] for it there declares that Mason ry is a worship.\" 418 Other clues that Masonry is not a fraterni ty of phil- bhropic gentlemen who meet on a regular basis for fel- 153"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19 THE FREEMASONS lowship and works of charity are contained in other parts of Pike's book MORALS AND DOGMA, or in the writings of Manly P. Hall: \"Every Lodge is a Temple ....\" 419 \"Masonry is a worship.\" 420 \"... Masonry is a religious and philosophic body.\" \"Every Masonic Lodge is a temple of religion; and its teachings are instructions in religion.\" 422 Since Masonry claims that it is a religion, it woul d be helpful to the student to define the term and see i f Masonry meets the requirements. A religion is defined as being either of these defi nitions: 1. A belief in a divine power to be obeyed and wor- shipped as the creator and ruler of the universe. 2. Any system of beliefs, practices, ethical values resembling, suggestive of or likened to such a system. By the second definition, the Masons certainly qual ify as a religion. But the Masons themselves deny that thi s is so. This view was presented in 1986 by Bill Mankin, a 3 2nd degree member of the Masonic Lodge, on a series of television programs concerning the Masons. The discussions wer e part of a television program called The John Ankerberg S how. Mr. Mankin said: \"We [the Masons] have no creed, no confession of faith in a doctrinal statement. We have no theology ; we have no ritual of worship. We have no symbols that are religious in the sense of symbols found in a church or a synagogue. Our symbols are related to the development of character of the relationship of man to men. They a re working tools to be used in the building of life.\" 423 The word religion is defined in another dictionary as: 154"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19 THE FREEMASONS 1. A belief in a divine or superhuman power to be obeyed and worshiped as the creator and ruler of the universe. 2. Any specific system of belief in conduct and rit- ual, often involving a code of ethics and a philos- ophy. So, by the definition of a religion contained in ei ther dictionary, the Masons are a religion. That can be determined by a brief review of what the Masons do inside thei r temple. 1. The Masons worship a god, (they call him the Great Architect of the Universe); 2. They pray to this god inside their temples. For instance, during the Entered Apprentice degree, the first of the three inside the Blue Lodge, the Worshipful Master, the equivalent of the President of the lodge, prays: \"Vouchsafe thine aid, Almighty Father of the Universe ....\" 424 3. They believe that this god in their temples hear s prayer. The same prayer in the Entered Appren- tice degree continues: \"... and grant that this Candidate for Masonry may dedicate his life to thy service.\" 425 4. They believe that their worship inside the templ e will grant them immortal life. In the pamphlet prepared by the John Ankerberg Show, they quoted the Masonic manual which describes what the white apron worn by the Mason stands for: \"He who wears the lambskin as a badge of a Mason is thereby continually reminded of purity of life and conduct which is essentially necessary to his gaining admission into the Celestial Lodge Above.\" 426 155"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19 THE FREEMASONS 5. They believe in the one god who is common to all religions. The same statement of the Grand Lodge of Maryland continues: \"Thus, Masonry is a great fellowship of men of all countries and ages who are capable of discovering in the religious teachings of all humanity, some of them crude indeed, the fundamental truth COMMON TO THEM ALL: that God is the Father of all mankind ....\" 427 [emphasis by author] Any student of worldwide religions is inevitably dr awn to this conclusion: every religion has a different vie w of God. Every religion conceives the duties and functions o f their deity to be different; and some religions do not ev en believe in one God, (some have many gods). But there is one thing that is probably common to all religions: all posse ss a belief that there is a force of evil in the world. The Bible calls this force Lucifer, Satan, or the d evil. Henry Clausen, the Past Sovereign Grand Commander o f the Scottish Rite, told his readers in his book ent itled CLAUSEN'S COMMENTARIES ON MORALS AND DOGMA that there was only one god, and that one of the pu rposes of Masonry is to teach its initiates just who that one god is: \"The true knowledge of the One Supreme Deity is given.\" 428 So the Masons openly state that there is only one g od, and that this god is somehow different than the one that is worshipped by the religions of the world. If the student of Masonry will read the statement o f the Grand Lodge of Maryland again, with the thought tha t the religions of the world do not agree on the definiti on of their god, but do agree that there is a force of evil, th e statement starts to make some sense. As has already been illustrated in this study, the Masons consider Lucifer to be a god. 6. The Masons believe in a life after death. They b e- lieve in a \"celestial lodge above.\" 156"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19 THE FREEMASONS 7. The Masons believe in a place where that life continues after death. During the initiation ceremony into the first degree of the Blue Lodge, the initiate is told: \"I'd like to present you, Brother (name), with this lambskin, or white leather apron, which is an emblem of innocence .... He therefore who wears a lambskin as a badge of a Mason is con- tinually reminded of that purity of life and conduct which is essentially necessary to his gaining ADMISSION INTO THE CELESTIAL LODGE ABOVE.\" [emphasis by author.] 429 But, even with all of this contrary evidence, the M asons continue to deny that Masonry is a religion separat e from any other. And, to further compound the problem, the Masons continue to teach that their religion is a continua tion of another ancient worship. Albert Pike stated in his book MORALS AND DOGMA: \"... the Sun, Moon and Mercury ... are still the three Great Lights of a Masonic Lodge.\" And then he told the reader just what (or who) thes e lights represent: \"The three lights represent the Sun, the Moon and Mercury; Osiris, Isis, and Horus.\" 430 So one of the lights inside the Masonic temple repr esents Osiris, the sun-god. There are other connections in side the Masonic religion back to the god of the Egyptians: \"Osiris, Adoni, Adonis, Atys, and the other Sun- Gods - had also a tomb, and a religious initiation; one of the principal ceremonies of which consisted in clothing the Initiate with the skin of a white lamb . And in this we see the origin of the apron of white sheep-skin used in Masonry.\" 431 157"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19 THE FREEMASONS It is to be remembered that the Masons teach \"the t rue knowledge of the One Supreme Deity.\" Is it possible to infer from their own words that they know just who that \" Supreme Deity\" is? Pike admitted that his writings conceale d a secret mystery. He wrote this about the words in his book entitled MORALS AND DOGMA: \"If you reflect, my Brother, ... you will no doubt suspect that some secret meaning was concealed in these words.\" 432 The evidence that Mr. Pike was concealing the truth about this secret from his fellow Masons has been p resented in previous chapters of this study. And the fact th at the Masons do not want the general public to know the t ruth about this hidden god is confirmed by at least two cir- cumstances. 1. Mr. Pike stated that his book was not \"intended for the world at large,\" 433 and 2. A copy of the book that turned up in a used book store had the following phrase stamped on the in- side cover: \"esoteric book, for Scottish Rite use only; to be returned upon withdrawal or death of recipient.\" So, whatever secret is contained inside his book, P ike does not want it to be known by either the public or by his fellow Masons. Albert Pike taught his readers a simple, but very pro- found Masonic truth on the bottom of page 324 in hi s MORALS AND DOGMA: \"What is Superior is as that which is Inferior, and what is Below is as that which is Above, to for m the Marvels of Unity.\" 434 Notice that Pike capitalizes the words \"Superior,\" \"Infer- ior,\" \"Above,\" and \"Below,\" just as one would do wh en capi- talizing the name of a deity. It appears that one o f the things that is reversed is the understanding of the nature of the deity. 158"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19 THE FREEMASONS That teaching was just a few paragraphs after anoth er statement of Pike's: \"The conviction of all men that God is good led to a belief in a Devil, the fallen Lucifer or lightbeare r ....\" 435 Applying the principle that was taught in the last para- graph to the sentence contained above it, it is pos sible to see that Pike considers Lucifer to be the God that is g ood, and that the God of the Bible is the devil, the god of evil. That is what that statement about \"that which is Below is a s that which is Above\" means. That means that the God in t he heavens is the god that is below, and the god who i s below is the god in the heavens. So the Masons do believe in a god: it is in the fal len lightbearer, Lucifer. There can be no other reasona ble ex- planation of what Mr. Pike just wrote. And that thought will continue to be developed as t his study continues. Even though the Masons continue to publicly deny th at their Order is a religion, they say it is in some o f their wri- tings. One example that this is so comes from the p en of Albert Mackey, a Mason, in his ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF FREEMASONRY: \"Look at its ancient landmarks, its sublime cere- monies, its profound symbols and allegori es — all inculcating religious observance, and who c an deny that it is eminently a religious institution; and o n this ground mainly, if not alone, should the religious Masons defend it.\" 436 He repeats that claim in another book he wrote enti tled TEXTBOOK OF MASONIC JURISPRUDENCE: \"The truth is, that Masonry is undoubtedly a religious institution, its religion being of that u niversal kind in which all men agree.\" 437 Another writer, apparently not a Mason, shed a litt le light on the nature of the worship of the Masons. He wrot e that 159"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19 THE FREEMASONS they worshipped the Egyptian trinity of Is is, Horus, and Osiris: \"... God has seventy-two known names and one ineffable name, unknown to man .... The supreme isiac initiation ... has as its sole purpose the transmission of this name, which con- stituted the Word. Freemasonry in its first three degrees is certainly very close to the Isaic rites. Few Masons are aware that their work within the temple is carried out under the aegis of the Egypti an trinity .\" 438 But Albert Pike apparently was one of those Masons who did know. He wrote: \"Masonry is: identical with the Ancient Mysteries.\" 439 a successor of the Mysteries.\" 440 Manly P. Hall repeated the claim: \"... in Masonry, the ancient religious and philosophic principles still survive.\" 441 Another writer, but in this case apparently not a m ember of the Masons, wrote this in his book entitled SERP ENT IN THE SKY: \"Now, the wisdom of the Egyptian Temple did not survive Egypt intact, or in its original form, but percolated down to our day through more or less underground groups without any apparent central organization — ... Freemasons ... and others.\" 442 And Henry Clausen, the Past Sov ereign Grand Commander, also confirmed that Masonry is connected to the ancient mysteries: \"We look toward a transformation into a New Age using, however, the insight and wisdom of the ancie nt mystics.\" 443 160"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19 THE FREEMASONS It appears that the evidence presented so far has a llowed the student of Masonry to draw the following conclu sions: 1. The Ancient Mysteries, carried down to some of the worships of today, worshipped a sun-god, a veiled reference to Lucifer, the fallen angel of th e Bible. This worship of the devil was concealed throughout the generations by giving him a different name. 2. There were two worships inside each sun-god temple: one for the average citizen, and another for those who had been initiated into the true meanings of the worship: that their god was in truth Lucifer. 3. By the Masons own admissions, they too worship the god of the ancients: the sun-god, Lucifer, known as the devil of the Bible. 4. The Masons of today conceal the truth of whom they are worshipping from their brothers inside the lodge by intentionally lying to them. 5. And probably the overwhelming majority of Ma- sons today do not know this truth, which can be inferred from the fact that the Adept Masons admit that they conceal this truth from their fellow Masons. And men of rank, wealth, office and power continue to join. 161"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Chapter 20 Those Who Object But are there others who know that certain Masons worship Lucifer? Are there others who know that the Masons want to bring about the New World Order? Are there warnings being issued for any one who will listen? Captain William Morgan, A Mason who exposed the secrets of the Masonic Lodge in 1826 in his book en titled FREEMASONRY EXPOSED, wrote this: \"The bane [defined as the ruin] of our civil institutions is to be found in Masonry, already powerful and daily becoming more so. I owe my country an exposure of its dangers.\" 444 The publication of this book was not looked upon w ith favor by the Masons after it was made public. The C aptain paid with his life for his attempts to warn Americ a. The introduction to the original edition identified his murderers as being the Masons themselves. It said: 162"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20 THOSE WHO OBJECT \"... the author ... was kidnapped and carried away ... by a number of Freemasons ....\" 445 The Masons, however, do not believe that Captain Mo rgan was murdered. Albert G. Mackey in his ENCYCLOPAEDIA says this: \"There are various myths of his disappearance and subsequent residence in other countries. ... it is certain that there is no evidence of his death that would be admitted in a Court of Probate. \" 446 Even though the Masons deny that the Captain was murdered, the newspapers of the day reported that h is murder was fact, and it was widely accepted in Amer ica that members of the Masons were responsible for his deat h. As a result of the national furor over the killing, this nation's first third political party, called the Anti-Masons Party , sprang up as a protest to the activities of the Masonic Order . A former Mason and Minister from New York, William Preston Vaughn, also attempted to warn America in 1 830: \"If the lodge went unchecked, the United States would have a Masonic monarchy for its government, a Masonic church, a Masonic way to a Masonic heaven, and blood and massacre and destruction to all who subscribe not to the support of the Monarch.\" 447 John Quincy Adams, the sixth President of the Unite d States, also had strong feelings about the Masonic Order. He wrote this in 1833: \"I do conscientiously and sincerely believe that the Order of Freemasonry, if not the greatest, is o ne of the greatest moral and political evils under whi ch the Union is now laboring.\" 448 He continued by saying that Masonry was: \"a conspiracy of the few against the equal rights of the many; anti-Republican [here he was not refer - 163"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20 THOSE WHO OBJECT ring to the Republican Party, but to the concept of a republic as a form of government] in its sap [meani ng vitality.]\" 449 \"I am prepared to complete the demonstration be- fore God and man, that the Masonic oath, obligation s and penalties cannot by any possibility be reconcil ed to the laws of morality, of Christianity, or of the la nd.\" 450 Millard Fillmore, the thirteenth President of the U nited States, made this statement: \"The Masonic fraternity tramples upon our rights, defeats the administration of justice, and bids def iance to every government which it cannot control.\" 451 Another who spoke out against the Masons was Ulysse s S. Grant, the eighteenth President, who said this: \"All secret oath-bound political parties are dangerous to any nation, no matter how pure or how patriotic the motives and principles which first br ing them together.\" 452 John Marshall, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Cou rt in the early days of this nation, was a member of the Masonic Lodge. Apparently he changed his mind and later rec anted, He made this charge: \"The institution of Masonry ought to be abandoned as one capable of much evil, and incapabl e of producing any good which might not be effected b y safe and open means.\" 453 Another warning came from John G. Stevens, a Bapt ist clergyman, who denounced his Masonic ties by publis hing his views in AN INQUIRY INTO THE NATU RE AND TENDENCY OF SPECULATIVE MASONRY. Included in his writings were these conclusions: \"Masonry was a state within a state and that one da y Masons would overthrow the democratic governme nt of the United States and would crown one of their 'gra nd kings' as ruler of this nation.\" 454 164"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20 THOSE WHO OBJECT Another minister who came out of Masonic Order was Charles G. Finney, who left the Order when Captain Morgan was murdered. He wrote a little pamphlet entitled \" WHY I LEFT FREEMASONRY,\" in which he made these observa- tions: \"... in taking these oaths I had been grossly deceived and imposed upon. Indeed I came to the deliberate conclusion that my oaths had been procur ed by fraud and misrepresentations; that the instituti on was in no respect what I had been informed it was; and ... it has become more and more irresistibly pl ain to me that Masonry is highly dangerous to the State , and in every way injurious to the Church of Christ. \" 455 But perhaps the most ringing criticism of the Mason s came from Pope Leo XIII, the Catholic Pope from 187 8 to 1903. He wrote these words in an encyclical entitle d HU- MANUS GENUS: \"Their ultimate purpose: namely, the overthrow of that whole religious and political order of the wor ld which the Christian teaching has produced, and the substitution of a new state of things in accordance with their ideas, of which the foundations and laws shall be drawn from mere naturalism.\" 456 The Pope went on later in his Encyclical to explain what he meant by the term Naturalism: \"... the fundamental doctrine of the naturalists .. . is that human nature and human reason ought in all things to be the mistress and guide.\" 457 \"... the naturalists teach ... that marriage belong s to the genus of commercial contracts, which can rightly be revoked by the will of those who made them, and that the civil rulers of the State have p ower over the matrimonial bond.\" 458 165"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20 THOSE WHO OBJECT So the Pope correctly noted that the Masons were co m- mitted to creating a New World Order: they wanted t o create a \"new state of things\" by overthrowing the \"whole religious and political order.\" Then he identified the new wo rld they wanted to replace it with: one based upon reason. He continued his discussion of why he was concerned about the Masons: their endeavor to obtain equality and community of all goods by the destruction of every distinction of rank and property.\" 459 Here the Pope states that the Masons share the visi on of Karl Marx, the Communist, who wanted to \"abolish pr ivate property.\" The Pope said that the Masons wanted to destroy \"the distinctions of property.\" The Pope's fate after he wrote these warnings to th e world was perhaps revealed in a Time magazine artic le on June 18, 1984.

This is why he shared his concern: \"The New Masonry did not aim to destr oy churches, but, with the aid of the progress of idea s, it prepared to replace them.\" 461 According to Mr. Fay, the Masonic religion wanted to replace the Christian religion! Another writer on the subject of the Masons is Arth ur Edward Waite, who wrote this in his book e ntitled THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF FREEMASONRY: \"The Latin Church [apparently meaning the Catholic Church] has agreed to regard Freemasonry . .. as ... those forces which are at work in the world against the Church in that world.\" 462 166"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20 THOSE WHO OBJECT But more current examples of Christian churches war ning its members, as well as the world, can be located. It is not just the Catholic Church which is concerned about m ember- ship in the Masonic Order. The Orthodox Presbyterian Church met at Rochester, New York, on June 2-5, 1942, and they issued a report o n the Ancient Order of Free and Accepted Masons. The foll owing was part of their conclusions: \"... Masonry is a religious institution and as such is definitely anti-Christian. ... membership in the Ma- sonic fraternity is inconsistent with Christianity. \" 463 Furthermore, another church body, this time the Lut heran Church-Missouri Synod, passed a resolution in 1975 calling for \"specialized literature for persons who belong to anti- Christian sects and cults.\" One of the six booklets that resulted from the call was one on the Freemasons ca lled \"HOW TO RESPOND TO THE LODGE.\" But one of the more dramatic studies of the Masons occured a short time ago in England, when the Churc h of England released a report on them after a summer se ssion examined the Order. The article that appeared in th e Arizona Daily Star, released by the Associated Press on Jul y 14, 1987, said that: '\"Church of England leaders overwhelmingly endorsed a report yesterday that called Freemason rituals blasphemous ....' The report: Freemasonry and Christianity: Are They Compatible?\" said some Christians found Ma- sonic rituals disturbing and 'positively evil.'\" 464 Perhaps the best summary of the whole concern about the Masonic Order came from an ex-Mason, Edward Ronayne , in his book entitled THE MASTER'S CARPET. Mr. Ronayne said this: \"Masonry ... is a system which has not the least shadow of support, either from history, from script ure, from reason, or from common sense, but, in fact, is diametrically opposed to them all.\" 465 167"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20 THOSE WHO OBJECT But, men of rank, wealth, office and power still jo in it. 168"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Chapter 21 Albert Pike One of the Masonic writers frequently cited in this study as being an expert on Masonic affairs has been Albe rt Pike, the Sovereign Grand Commander of the Southern Juris diction of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry from 1859 to hi s death in 1891. So it might be helpful to know a little about his past. He has been described by fellow Masons in a rather flattering manner. Carl Claudy has written this: \"Pike was ... one of the greatest geniuses Free- masonry has ever known. He was ... a teacher of the hidden truths of Freemasonry. 466 Manly P.

He said that he was: \"... the world's greatest Masonic scholar.\" And he praised: \"... the tremendous genius of Albert Pike.\" 468 Perhaps Pike's finest accomplishment for the Masoni c cause was his book entitled MORALS AND DOGMA, pub- lished in 1871 by the Supreme Council of the Thirty -Third Degree for the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States. There is some disagreement as to whether or not thi s book is to be read by all Masons seeking higher degrees ins ide the Masonic Order. This author was told by members of t he Masons in Tucson in 1985 that the book was still gi ven to all Masons for their perusal. However, Rex Hutchens, a 32nd degree Mason, and the author who wrote a new book e ntitled A BRIDGE TO LIGHT for the Masons in 1988, said this in his book: \"MORALS AND DOGMA was traditionally given to the candidate as a gift upon his receipt of the 14th Degree.\" 469 His use of the word \"was\" implies that it is no lon ger given to the Masonic candidate. However, Mr. Hutchens had words of praise for it. H e wrote: \"Contained within its pages are some of the most profound teachings of the Rite.\" 470 Henry Clausen, one of Mr. Pike's successors as Sove reign Grand Commander of the Masons, also praised his boo k: \"... an inspired and classical compilation of Pike' s own research ....\" 471 Other Masonic scholars who have come after him ha ve revered his name. This comment came from Albert Mac key: 170"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 21 ALBERT PIKE \"His standing as a Masonic author and historian ... was most distinguished, and his untiring zeal w as without a parallel.\" 472 The Masonic Order as a body must have thought highl y of Mr. Pike as well because they permitted him to r ewrite the Scottish Rite rituals. But perhaps the greatest example of the influence o f this man was reported by General Gordon Granger, who had an occasion to meet with both Mr. Pike and then Presid ent Andrew Johnson, a fellow Mason. This event occurred in March of 1867, and was later testified to by Genera l Granger in front of the House Judiciary Committee. They wer e investi- gating charges that President Johnson should be imp eached, and they felt that the General's recollections of t hat meeting might be helpful. The General told the committee: \"They talked a great deal about Masonry. More about that than anything else. And from what they talked about between them, I gathered that he [meaning Pike] was the superior of the President in Masonry. I understood from the conversation that th e President was his subordinate in Masonry. That was all there was to it ....\" 473 But that wasn't all there was to it. On June 20, 18 67, the President received a delegation of Scottish Rite of ficials in his bedroom at the White House where he r eceived the 4th through the 32nd Degrees of the Scottish Rite. But the important revelation is that the General ha d tes- tified that the President of the United States was the subordinate to Albert Pike in Masonry! And the importance of that fact can be gathered fro m the oath the initiate takes during the third degree, called the Master Mason's degree, inside the Blue Lodge. The i nitiate takes the following oath: (emphasis by author) \"Furthermore, I DO PROMISE and swear THAT I WILL OBEY ALL regular signs, SUMMONSES, or to- kens GIVEN, handed out, sent, or thrown TO ME FROM THE HAND OF A BROTHER MASTER MA- 171"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 21 ALBERT PIKE SON or from the body of a just and lawfully constituted lodge of such ....\" 474 The capitalized words when taken together read: \"I do promise that I will obey all summonses given to me from the hand of a brother Master Mason.\" That means that the President of the United States had to take orders from Albert Pike should he order him to do so! The significance of that startling proposition will become more evident as additional evidence of just what Mr . Pike be- lieved in is presented in further chapters of this study. There is a hierarchy in the United States! And Presidents who are Masons take orders from othe r Masons! 172"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Chapter 22 Hiram Abif The Masons have wrapped their initiation ceremony around a legend involving an individual named Hiram Abif. The Masons have constructed this legend themselves from two brief references to him in the Bible. This information on Hiram comes from Mackey's ENCY- CLOPAEDIA: \"When King Solomon was about to build a temple to Jehovah [called Solomon's temple,] the difficult y of obtaining skillful workmen to superintend and to execute the architectural part of the undertaking w as such, that he found it necessary to request of his friend and ally, Hiram, King of Tyre, the use of so me of his most able builders.

The reason for t hat was because the other workers at the Temple were \"appre ntice Masons,\" not entitled to a share of the secrets of the Master Mason. \"Fifteen Fellow Crafts [masons but not possessors of the secrets] seeing the temple about to be compl eted and being desirous of obtaining the secrets of a Ma ster Mason ... whereby they might travel into foreign countries, work and receive Masters' wages, entered into a horrid conspiracy to extort [the secrets] fr om [the Master] or take his life. ... twelve of them recanted, the other three, however persisted in their murderous design.\" 476 According to the legend, Hiram Abif was slain by th ese three \"ruffians\" at \"high twelve,\" because he refus ed to share the secrets. The three ruffians were named Jubela, Jubelo, and Jubelum. The Masons admit that the death of Hiram is \"a pure ly symbolic event ....\" Therefore, the student must lo ok else- where for an explanation of what his symbolic death means. In addition, they further admit that the story is n ot based completely on the two brief mentions of Hiram in th e Bible: \"Thus the Biblical account of the story of Hiram is occasionally at variance with the legend as told in Masonic literature.\" 477 The remaining parts of the legend of Hiram Abif are not pertinent to this study, so they will not be discus sed here. However, it will be helpful for further discussi on in later chapter of this book for the following commen ts to be added at this juncture. 174"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 22 HIRAM ABIF Rex Hutchens, a 32nd degree Mason, has placed an important piece into the puzzle in his book entitle d A BRIDGE TO LIGHT. He gives his readers this explanat ion as to what the symbolic death of Hiram means: \"What are the symbolic meanings of the attacks upon Hiram? Hiram is first accosted at the south gate of the Temple where the instrument of the attack is the ru le. In Greek, the word for a 'rule' whether a measuring instrument or a code of conduct, is canon. Thus we see the bureaucracy of the early Church establishing th e Canon Law to regulate conduct. This law was to be obeyed with unquestioned loyalty, hence it is an apt symbol of the suppressi on of freedom of speech which might question the divinity and justice of these laws; therefore Hiram, with th e rule, is struck where the organs of speech are. The instrument of attack at the west gate of the Temple was the square ...; it represents the merger of civil and religious power intending to control man' s emotions, telling him not only what he can do but a lso what he can believe. Thus Hiram is struck near the heart, the tradi- tional seat of the affections. The setting maul, an instrument of brute force, is a fitting symbol of the blind, unreasoning mob. It fears the force of the intellect and seeks the destructio n of the products of the mind. Hiram is killed at the east gate by a blow to the head, the seat of the intellect.\" 478 So Mr. Hutchens is telling his reader that the \"ruf fians\" that killed Hiram Abif were not individua ls seeking the secrets of Masonry from Hiram, the Master Mason, bu t were concealed symbols of \"the Church,\" the \" church and the state,\" and the forces fearing the power of man's \" reason.\" This is an amazing revelation! It is rare that the Masons share the exact interpretation of their secrets as they have done in this instance. Remember that the contents o f Mr. Hutchens' book have been approved by the Supreme Co uncil of the 33rd degree of the Scottish Rite of Freemaso nry. This explanation has official sanction! They want us to know that 175"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 22 HIRAM ABIF the enemies of the Masons are the Church, the State , and opposition to \"man's reason.\" In another part of his book, Mr. Hutchens provides the reader with another explanation of the symbols. Thi s addi- tional explanation of the true meaning of the symbo ls is strikingly similar to the first. \"... the Master Hiram is the symbol of intelli- gence, liberty and truth and the assassins are the symbols of tyranny, ignorance and intolerance or fanaticism.\" 479 So he equates the church and the state with tyranny , ig- norance, intolerance and fanaticism. As will be sho wn in another part of this study, the Masons have pledged them- selves to avenge the death of Hiram! They have pled ged themselves to destroy the state and the church! So, the real purpose of the Masons has been discove red. The Masons are not a philanthropic organization out to assist men to better themselves. They have a hidden purpose. And it takes but a little fortitude to discover wha t that purpose is. Their purpose is to destroy organized religion, and the state, just like the Illuminati and the Communist P arty! They have said so in their own literature! There can be no doubt!

Hall in his book entitled THE SECRET TEACHINGS OF ALL AGES: \"... the sanctuary of wisdom wherein dwell the real rulers of the world - the initiated philosophe rs.\" 485 It appears as if Mr. Hall is indicating that thos e who have been initiated into Lucifer worship are the re al rulers of the world.

The great institution of materiality has failed. Religion wanders aimlessly in the maze of theo- logical speculation. Only the illumined reason can carry the under- standing part of man upward to the light.\" 488 Private property (called \"materiality\" by Mr. Hall) has fa i l e d . Religion has not succeeded in solving man's problems, The people will soon demand that someone else with a new get of solutions step forward. And those with the Light of Lucifer are waiting to step forward to rule. There is no adequate explanation as to why some peo ple want to rule others.

History is strewn w ith the carnage of those who wanted to rule the world. Masons, believers in the New Age Movement, the Comm u- nists, the Illuminati and others want to control hu man be- havior. The moral mind of the population in general cannot comprehend this desire for power; all that the citi zens of the world can do is become aware of that strong compuls ion, and to try to prevent those who desire power over other s from gaining control.

Students of the Masons can know just what the initi ation rites of the various degrees consist of. Many indiv iduals, such as Masons, ex-Masons, and historians who have resea rched the Masonic Lodges, have described the exact conten t of the ceremonies in a variety of books and articles. For instance, it is possible to know how Masons pro tect themselves from harm by reading part of the oath th e Mason takes during the initiation ceremony of the T hird degree, called the Master Mason degree. The initiate binds himself to this oath: \"Further, I will keep a worthy brother Master Mason's secrets inviolable, when communicated to an d received by me as such, murder and treason excepted . 181"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24 MASONIC OBLIGATIONS Further, I will not cheat, wrong or defraud a Master Mason's Lodge, nor a brother of this Degree, knowingly, nor supplant him in any of his laudable undertakings, but will give him due and timely noti ce, that he may ward off all danger.\" 490 That means that any Mason who determines that a fel low Mason has committed, or is about to commit, a crime , \"murder and treason excepted,\" will be oath-bound n ot to report him to the proper authorities. A Mason who t ells a fellow Mason that he is going to blackmail a non-Ma son, can know that the hearer will not report him. And, if the first Mason learns that the blackmailin g Ma- son is about to be arrested for his crime, the firs t Mason must report his discovery to the other Mason. But these examples of Masonic oaths are but a part of the evidence. The student can learn about the other com mitments that the initiated Mason obligates himself to. Another book that explains the obligations that Mas ons assume is one entitled the MASONIC HANDBOOK, and it further explains what these commitments are. This w ritten manual explains what the Mason should do if he is s elected on a jury and observes the defendant identifying hi mself as being a member of the Fraternity: \"If you're on a jury, and the defendant is a Mason, and makes the Grand Hailing sign [a secret sign that identifies one Mason to another,] you mus t be sure not to bring the Mason guilty, for that wou ld bring disgrace upon our order. It may be perjury, to be sure, to do this, but then you're fulfilling your obligation, and you know if you live up to your obligations you'll be free from sin .\" And the HANDBOOK advises the member that it is per- missible to cheat or swindle certain people: \"If you cheat, wrong, or defraud any other society or individual, it is entirely your own business. If you cheat the Government even, Masonry can- not and will not touch you, but be very careful not to cheat, wrong or defraud a brother Mason or a lodge, 182"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24 MASONIC OBLIGATIONS whoever you may defraud; live up to your obligation and you'll be free from sin.\" And this advice to the Mason further extends to the crimes of murder and treason: \"You must conceal all the crimes of your brother Masons, except murder and treason, and these only a t your own option, and should you be summoned as a witness against a brother Mason be always sure to shield him, prevaricate, don't always tell the whol e truth in this case, keep his secrets, forget the mo st important points. It may be perjury to do this, it is true, but you'r e keeping your obligations, and remember if you live up to your obligation strictly, you'll be free from si n.\" 491 The Mason also redefines the two words adultery and chastity: \"Furthermore do I promise and swear that I will not violate the chastity of a Master Mason's wife, mother, sister, or daughter, I knowing them to be such, nor suffer it to be done by others, if in my power to prevent it.\" 492 Critics of this part of the initiation ceremony obs erve that this restriction, in essence, allows the Master Mas on to en- gage in adultery with any other wife, mother, siste r, or daughter, just as long as that woman is not connect ed to another Master Mason. It would appear that a better reading of that oath would be something like this: \"Furthermore do I promise and swear that I will not violate the chastity of anyone's wife, mother, sister or daughter ... especially be they connected to a f ellow Master Mason.\" But that is not what the oath taken by the Third De gree Mason says. That oath implies that permission is gi ven to violate any other woman, just as long as they are n ot con- nected to another Master Mason. 183"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24 MASONIC OBLIGATIONS A brief summary of this advice was offered by Carl Claudy in his book entitled INTRODUCTION TO FREE- MASONRY. He wrote: \"We keep our brother's secrets, guilty or innocent. It makes no difference in what way our brother stumbles. We are not told to stretch forth the hand in aid if, and perhaps and but! Not for us to judge, to condemn, to admonish ... for us only to put forth our strength unto our fail ing brother at his need without question and without stint.\" 493 So, the Mason protects his fellow Masons, even if t hey commit murder or treason. And the Masons teach thei r fellow Masons that certain forms of adultery are acceptabl e. As has already been explained, the Mason takes oath s to obey orders from his superiors inside the Masonic O rder. Albert Mackey told all Masons this truth in his boo k entitled THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF FREEMASONRY under the title of \"Obedience:\" \"The first duty of every Mason is to obey the mandate of the Master. The Masonic rule of obedienc e is like the nautical imperative: 'Obey orders, even if you break owners.'\" 494 So, the Masons obey orders, protect criminal activi ties, lie if necessary, and are free to commit adultery with anyone other than a fellow Mason's wife, child, mother or sister.

Mr. Hall has instructed his readers just how import ant the 33rd degree is: \"Philosophically, the Thirty-third degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite represents the i n- nermost sanctuary of Masonic mysticism.\" 495 The 33rd degree is reportedly the smallest circle o f the entire Masonic Lodge, having the least number of me mbers of any degree inside the Lodge. It is believed by many that this is where the ultimate power resides. In fact, the 3 3rd Degree Council, the one that resides in Washington D.C., c laims to be The Mother Council of the World, and The Mother Juris- diction of the World. 185"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25 THE 33RD DEGREE One of the reasons why this degree is so important is be- cause it appears that it possesses the knowledge of the final secret of the Masons. In fact, the candidate receiv ing the 32nd Degree is told that \"he still has not reached the l ight.\" 496 One of the symbols explaining this truth to the 33r d degree Mason is the symbol of this degree: the Phoe nix bird. The dictionary defines the Phoenix bird as an Egypt ian myth, a beautiful, lone bird which lived in the Arabian d esert for 500 years and then consumed itself in fire, rising renewed from the ashes to start another long life. The Phoenix bird is dramatically depicted on the co ver of Albert Pike's book entitled MORALS AND DOGMA. It sh ows up as well on the covers of pamphlets circulated by the 33rd degree Masons. It is an object of jewelry worn arou nd the neck by 33rd degree Masons. The Masons know what the symbol means. Manly P. Hall tells his readers that: \"the Phoenix [bird] is the symbol of the Reborn in Wisdom.\" 497 And that: \"the phoenix [bird] was regarded as sacred to the sun ....\" 498 So the Phoenix bird is a symbol of the sun, and of the re- birth of man into a new religion: the religion wher e wisdom and reason become god. Others in their writings have indicated that they a lso un- derstand the symbology of the Phoenix. Fred Gitting s, in his book entitled SECRET SYMBOLISM IN OCCULT ART, wrote this: \"the phoenix bird will live for a period of five hundred years, at the end of which it builds itself a nest of precious spices. The nest completed, the phoenix sings a doleful song and then flaps its win gs to set the nest on fire. The bird is soon burned to ashes, and from this mass of carbon there miraculously springs to life a new phoenix. 186"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25 THE 33RD DEGREE ... we may see in it [this myth] certain ideas which must have appealed to them [the occultists.] From the ashes of burned material forms there could spring forth new life.\" ... the phoenix ... is linked with the Sun ....\" 499 The phoenix bird symbolizes a rebirth, not only of an indi- vidual inside the Masonic religion but also of a ne w civili- zation arising out of the ashes of the ruined one. According to this symbol, the world has been destroyed by the re ligious teachings of God, and as soon as these beliefs are eliminated from the world, a new civilization will be built up on a new religion. That religion will be constructed on a be lief in the unrestricted use of man's reason. This appears to be the true meaning of the Phoenix bird utilized as a symbol by the 33rd degree Masons. But it appears that there is one more secret of the Ma- sonic Order and it is taught to the initiates of th e 33rd de- gree. This explanation of the final secret is one t hat is not available to any of the other 32 degrees. It appear s that this secret is only hinted at in these other degrees, bu t is actually described to at least some of the initiates of the 33rd degree. Evidence has been presented in previous chapters th at the Masons conceal the fact that they are out to avenge the mur- der of their legendary hero, Hiram Abif. Their writ ers have told their readers that the three assassins of this Master Mason are described as being actual individuals in the actual rituals, but are in truth symbols of the real assas sins, the institutions of the church and the state. So the re al goal of the Masons is the actual destruction of organized r eligion and national governments. Rex Hutchens, a 32nd Degree Mason, has written simp ly to make that point clear in his book entitled A BRI DGE TO LIGHT. He explained that these statements were true : \"The axe [used as a symbol in the 22nd degree] should remind the Mason of the march of civilizatio n and progress which required him to hew the poisonou s trees of intolerance, bigotry, superstition, unchar itable- ness and idleness to let in the light of truth and reason upon the human mind.\" 500 187"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25 THE 33RD DEGREE According to this position, mankind's problem is th at he has not been allowed free exercise of his \"reason\" by a God who restricts man with a series of \"Thou shalts\" an d \"Thou shalt nots.\" If religion were out of the way, the \" illuminated mind\" of the super-intelligent could build a paradi se here on earth. The unrestricted use of man's mind is the so lution to the problems of the earth. According to this view, religion has been the sourc e of all of man's problems. All that must be done is to abol ish religi- on and the world will be a paradise. That is the tr ue meaning of Mr. Hutchens' writings. He then explains what the ebony crucifix utilized i n the 18th Degree means: \"The ebony crucifix (black, meaning evil, dark-ness ) represents the world's treatment of those who striv e to make known the truth. The Lost Word, one recalls, is a representative of many things - the loss of reason, intellect and the mor- al sense and the loss of a true conception of Deity . In the world represented in this apartment, Man has ma de not only God, but the Devil, in his own image.\" 501 According to this theory, God is a figment of man's mind. He doesn't exist. If God doesn't exist, what mankin d calls religion is fictional. Man does not need religion; in fact, religion has caused immense problems all over the w orld. When religion disappears, man can use his mind to s olve man's problems. Reason will discover man's morality , and all of the problems of the past will disappear. Mr. Hutchens then went on to explain what the axe d is- played in the 30th degree meant: \"The Great Order (Templars) naturally revolted against a Church which demanded of its members an absolute surrender of the reason as well as of the will.\" 502 Once again, the church restricts mankind by not all owing him to obey his instincts or base passions. Religio n teaches that these must be kept in check by a moral code, o ne that is given to him through the Bible. For instance, relig ion teaches 188"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25 THE 33RD DEGREE that man is truly free if he does not take the life of his fellow man, steal his neighbor's property, take his neighbor's wife, and if he conducts himself in all of his deal ings with honesty and integrity. According to the Masons, this teaching of God restr icts mankind's \"reason as well as his will.\" They feel t hat this is an intolerable situation and remedies must be sough t. But since many in the world would not wish to willingly give up their religious views, and would rebel if they disc overed that others are seeking to destroy their religion, the c onspirators have to meet in secret. Those with these plans must surround themselves with others who are not aware of their g oals so that they can deny that their activities are what t hey truly are. So the conspirators work inside secret organiz ations, keeping the truth from their fellow members, and on ly teach- ing a few individuals the true goals of their secre t society. This is the true meaning of what Mr. Hutchens is wr iting. He went on to explain what the additional symbols o f the \"skull, tiara and crown\" meant. These objects are d isplayed as well as the axe in this 30th degree ceremony. Mr. H utchens explained what these objects represent: \"The crown represents all those kings and em- perors who have usurped or abused power, reigned fo r themselves and not for the people and robbed a free people of their liberty .... The tiara is not a symbol of any particular re- ligion or creed [This is not true. On a previous pa ge, he states that the tiara is a \"Pope's tiara,\" meani ng that it is a symbol of the authority of the head of the Catholic Church] but of the patron of ignorance and ally of despotism [obviously the Pope] which in eve ry age has made dupes of men and enslaved humanity through fear and superstition.\" 503 This thought was continued in another section of hi s book: \"... a grave voice announced [during the 30th degree initiation ceremony] the duties of a philoso pher and a Knight Kadosh [the name of the 30th degree.] The candidate learns that the Knight Kadosh 'now pursues with feet that never tire and eyes that nev er 189"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25 THE 33RD DEGREE sleep, the personifications of the three assassins of Hiram, the Incarnations of Evil which these three were but the tools;\" 504 And Mr. Hutchens amplifies these thoughts with this comment in his explanation of the 32nd degree: \"To be a Soldier of the True Religion [the \"True Religion\" is a knowledge that Lucifer is the true g od of the world] is to recognize the corruption of the true religion given to man. Thus, we may combat, with reason and truth, all spiritual tyranny over the so uls and consciences of men.\" 505 These words contain some real truth in a concealed form. With this understanding of what Mr. Hutchens just w rote, it is now possible to summarize the truth contained in his writings. The following is a fair interpretation of what this author is saying in his explanation of the symbols utilized in the 30th degree. 1. The crucifix used in this degree is black, meaning that it is evil and darkness. The crucifix is the symbol of Christianity, and has been for nearly 2,0 00 years. But here, Mr. Hutchens tells the reader that the crucifix is a symbol of evil and darkness. The Christian Church is considered by this Masonic writ - er to be darkness and evil. 2. The Church has treated the Masons, those who are secretly preaching a new religion, with contempt. This claim of the Masons has been discussed in previous chapters. 3. The Masons feel that the Church has deprived man of his ability to utilize his reason by asking that mankind obey God's Moral Absolutes. Mr. Hutchens apparently wants man to \"know good and evil,\" the exact knowledge that the devil offered man in the Garden of Eden. 4. The Bible claims that God made man in His own image. It is the contention of the Mason that the exact opposite is the truth: man has made God in hi s image. Since God is the product of an active imagination, there is no God. 190"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25 THE 33RD DEGREE Mr. Hutchens then quotes from a book written by Alb ert Pike called LEGENDA: \"Men are good. Evil institutions alone have made them bad; and it is the duty of Masonry and every Knight to aid in leading them back to the truth.\" 506 The Christian position is that all men are sinners, and that they must improve themselves by freely choosin g moral alternatives; but here Mr. Hutchens quotes Mr. Pike who takes the opposite position: it is the environment that has made man evil. In fact, man is good. Man is not at fault; if only man could change the environment, man would be per- fect. The two positions are diametrically opposed t o each other. But the Masons will set the record straight when th ey establish their control over all of mankind. The 33rd degree of the Masons has been described as representing \"the innermost sanctuary of Masonic my sticism.\" So this degree is the innermost center of the entir e Masonic Order. Here must reside the final mystery. And it a ppears that the public can know what that final mystery is . The motto of the 33rd degree is ORDO AB CHAO, trans - lated by the Masons as meaning: Order out of Chaos. 507 According to the Masons, the present world is in ch aos be- cause of organized religion, but it will soon be ma de right. And the 33rd degree Masons apparently are volunteer ing for that task. Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the Illuminati, put the problem into the same perspective: \"Liberty and Equality are the essential rights that man in his original and primitive perfection r e- ceived from nature. Property struck the first blow at Equality; poli- tical society or Governments were the first dispos- sessors of Liberty: the supporters of Governments a nd Property are the religions and civil laws; therefor e to reinstate man in his primitive rights of Equality a nd Liberty, we must begin by destroying all Religion, all civil society and finish by the destruction of all proper- ty.\" 508 191"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25 THE 33RD DEGREE But there is evidence that not all 33rd degree Maso ns re- ceive the remaining \"light\" when they go through th e initia- tion ceremony. One who can testify to that evidence is Jim Shaw, a 33rd degree Mason who apparently became a Christian betw een the 32nd and 33rd degrees. But Mr. Shaw went to Was hing- ton D.C., the site of the initiation ceremony into the 33rd degree anyway. He told what happened to him during the three days of the ceremony in his book entitled THE DEAD- LY DECEPTION: \"The first day: We [all of the candidates for the 33rd degree] were called into one of the offices, one at a time, and interviewed by three members of the Supreme Council . I was ushered into the office and seated. The very first question I was asked was 'Of what religion ar e you?' Not long before this I would have answered with something like 'I believe the Ancient Mysteries, th e 'Old Religion,' and I believe in reincarnation. However, ... I found myself saying, 'I am a Christian.' After they sent me back out, I sat down and thought about it. When the next man came out, I asked him, 'Did they ask you if you are a Christian ?' He said, 'Yes, they did.' 'What did you tell them?' I asked, and he replied, 'I told them 'No, and I never intend to be!' Then he said a strange thing to me, 'They said I'm going higher,' and he left through a different door, looking pleased.\" 509 So according to this 33rd degree Mason, there are t wo layers inside that degree exactly as there are thro ughout the rest of the Masonic Lodge. Apparently, the one who states that he is a Christian does not proceed further. Mr. Shaw, now a Christian minister, reported that nothing special happened during the other two days, so he returned to his home. But there was an interesting comment that he made about who else was present during those three days of ceremonies: 192"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25 THE 33RD DEGREE \"There were some extremely prominent men there that day, including a Scandinavian King, two former Presidents of the United States, an internationally prominent evangelist, two other internationally pro m- inent clergymen, and a very high official of the fe deral government ....\" 510 Unfortunately for the student of the Masonic Order, Reverend Shaw did not identify who these gentlemen were. However, he did state the reasons why he has left M a- sonry: \"Having left Freemasonry after 19 years and attained the 33rd degree, I feel ... a duty to warn others to avoid the satanic trap of Freemasonry.\" 511 The Reverend shares the view of this writer: Masonr y is satanic! They worship Lucifer, also known as Satan, the devil! Someone has published part of the initiation ceremo ny of the 33rd degree. That part of the ritual is include d on pages 363 and 364 of a book entitled OCCULT THEOCRASY, written by Edith Starr Miller. This book was not pu blished until after her death in 1933. The following is what takes place inside the 33rd d egree initiation ceremony: \"For the Sovereign Grand Inspector General the 33rd is the last degree of the Rite. The Order is t he Great Avenger of the assassinated Grand Master [the 33rd degree is the avenger of the death of Hiram Ab if] and the grand champion of humanity, for the innocen t Grand Master is man, man who is Master, King of Nature, man who is born innocent and unconscious. [Hiram is a symbol of all men.] But he has fallen under the blows of three assassins, three scoundrels have thwarted his hap- piness and rights and have annihilated him. The three infamous assassins are Law, Property and Religion. [Here is the true explanation of the three assassins of Hiram: they are Law, meaning government; Property, meaning the right to own 193"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25 THE 33RD DEGREE private property; and Religion, the concept that ma n is to live by God's moral absolutes.] Law, because it is not in harmony with the rights of the individual man and the duties of social man in society, rights which belong to all. Duties are but the immediate consequence of the rights inherent in all , for the enjoyment of all rights. Property, because the earth belongs to nobody and its fruits belong to all in proportion as they are required by each for the needs of his own well bein g. Religion, because religion is but philosophies evolved by men of genius and adopted by the people in the belief that they would increase their well bein g. Neither law, property nor religion can be imposed on man as they annihilate him by depriving him of his most precious rights. They are assassins on who m we have sworn to wreck vengeance, enemies against whom we have declared war to the death and without quarter. Of these three infamous enemies it is on religion that we must concentrate our most deadly attacks, because no people has ever survived its religion. O nce Religion is dead, Law and Property will fall to our mercy, and we shall be able to regenerate society b y founding on the corpses of the assassins of man, Masonic Religion, Masonic Law, and Masonic Prop- erty.\" 512 So, the final secret of the Masonic Order has been made public! The student of the Masons can now know what their goals are. The Masons are out to destroy the right to private prop- erty; the right to worship a God in an organized re ligion; and the right to set up a government based upon a conce pt that government exists to protect man's God given rights to life, liberty and property. The Masons teach: \"You are here to think, if you can think; And to learn, if you can learn.\" 513 Those who wish to expose the Masons can think! And they can learn! 194"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25 THE 33RD DEGREE And what they can learn after thinking is simple: Some of the Masons worship Lucifer!

And the student can know because some of the Masons have told them! They stand convicted by their own words! 195"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Chapter 26 The Humanists There is a religion in America today that embodies many of the beliefs of the Masons, the New Age Movement, and the Communists. It is called the Humanist Religion. This religion even has a dictionary definition: Humanism: a modern, nontheistic, rationalist movement that holds that man is capable of self- fulfillment, ethical conduct, without recourse to s uper- naturalism. Some call this religion Secular Humanism, and the w ord Secular is defined as \"of relating to worldly thing s as distin- guished from things relating to church and r eligion.\" The word is connected to the Latin word saecu laris, meaning worldly. 196"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26 THE HUMANISTS The English word \"Secular\" is connected to the tran slation of the Latin phrase found on the back of the dollar bill, \"Novus Ordo Seclorum,\" meaning the New World Order. Some powerful people have identified themselves wit h this religion. One of these was former Vice President Wa lter Mon- dale, later an unsuccessful candidate for the Presi dency in 1984 as a Democrat. He made his support known durin g a speech to the 5th Congress of the International Hum anist and Ethical Union held at the Massachusetts Institu te of Technology in August of 1970. Mr. Mondale said: \"Although I have never formally joined a human- ist society, I think I am a member by inheritance. My preacher father was a humanist ... and I grew up on a very rich diet of humanism from him. All of our family has been deeply influenced by this tradition including my brother Lester ....\" 514 The former Vice-President has been so moved by his religious views that he has been a contributor to a magazine called The Humanist. Jimmy Carter, then the President of the United Stat es, sent the American Humanist Association a telegram i n April of 1978, in which he praised them for their activit ies: \"Those who participate in the Annual Meeting of the American Humanist Association are furthering a movement that greatly enhances our way of life. The work of your organization in this area is, therefore, especially gratifying to me, and I welco me this opportunity to applaud your important accomp- lishments.\" 515 The Humanists have issued two manifestos in which t hey have stated what their religion believes in, and an y student can determine just what those positions are. The first one was issued in 1933, and has been call ed limply THE HUMANIST MANIFESTO I. The introduction t o that document reads, in part, as follows: 197"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26 THE HUMANISTS \"The time has come for widespread recognition of the radical beliefs throughout the modern world. Th e time is past for mere revision of traditional attit udes. Science [apparently meaning Evolution] and eco- nomic change [meaning Communism] have disrupted the old beliefs. Religions the world over are under the necessity of coming to terms with new conditions cr e- ated by a vastly increased knowledge and experience . In every field of human activity, the vital move- ment is now in the direction of a candid and explic it HUMANISM. In order that religious Humanism may be better understood, we, the undersigned, desire to make cer - tain affirmations which we believe the facts of our contemporary life demonstrate.' There is a great danger of a final, and we believe fatal, identification of the word RELIGION with doctrines and methods that have lost their signific ance and which are powerless to solve the problems of human living in the 20th century. While this age does owe a vast debt to the traditional religions, it is none the less obvious that any religion that can hope to be a synthesizing and dynamic force for today must be shaped for the need s of this age. To establish such a religion is a majo r necessity of the present. It is the responsibility which rests upon this generation.\" 516 What was just expressed in those paragrap hs of the introduction can be summarized in a few short sente nces: 1. Science and economic changes have shown the world that religion no longer has the answers to man's problems, 2. Humanism has the new answers. 3. We can thank \"religion\" for what it has done in the past, but it is time to move on to new beliefs. 198"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26 THE HUMANISTS 4. And humanism is the new religion that can replace the old. This Humanist Manifesto contains fifteen planks of their beliefs, but only five are pertinent to this study. The First of these states: \"First: Religious humanists regard the universe as self-existing and not created.\" Since the universe has always been, and was not cre ated, there is no reason to believe in a creator. So the humanist religion is an atheist one, believing that there is no god. \"Second: Man has emerged as the result of a con- tinuous process.\" The Biblical view is that man and animals were all cre- ated within a period of six days. The Humanists bel ieve that evolution is a more satisfactory explanation of the origins of both the universe and of man. And that the process has tak- en billions of years. The Humanists have stated tha t evo- lution is part of their religious view of man. \"Fifth: ... the nature of the universe ... makes unacceptable any supernatural or cosmic guarantees of human values.\" There is no prayer answering god in the universe, a nd there are no God created moral absolutes. \"Sixth: We are convinced that the time has passed for theism [a belief in one God,] deism [a b elief in the existence of a God on purely rational ground s without reliance on revelation or authority] ....\" Once again, the Humanists profess their belief that God does not exist. Obviously, modern man is too sophis ticated to believe in a god whose existence cannot be proven. \"Fourteenth: The humanists are firmly convinced that existing acquisitive and profit-motivated soci ety has shown itself to be inadequate and that a radica l 199"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26 THE HUMANISTS change in methods, controls and motives must be instituted. A socialized and cooperative economic order must be established to the end that the equitable distri - bution of the means of life be possible.\" 517 It will be remembered that Karl Marx, the so-called \"father of Communism\", supported the concept of a \" socialized and cooperative economic order.\" He stated that pos ition in his writings. He wrote: \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.\" And he added this additional comment, which many consider the very essence of Communism: \"In one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with your property. Precisely so: that is j ust what we intend.\" 518 That is what the Humanists believe! The Humanists, just like Karl Marx, do not approve of an economic system that encourages the right to own pr ivate property. They believe in the economic system known as socialism, just like Karl Marx. The beliefs of the Humanists can be summarized by s tat- ing that the religion stands on a stool with three major legs: evolution, atheism, and communism. There should be not doubt as to what they believe in. Any student can r ead it in the two Manifestos. This 1933 edition of the HUMANIST MANIFESTO was signed by thirty-four men, only two of whom have an y bear- ing on this study. One was Professor John Dewey of Colum- bia University, the father of so-called \"progressiv e education,\" and the other was Lester Mondale, the brother of th e Vice- President. Professor Dewey's religious views on life have had a dramatic effect on education in America. In 1974, Saturday Review magazine published their \" gold- en anniversary issue,\" and as a part of their comme moration of those 50 years, they asked various American lea ders to 200"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26 THE HUMANISTS name the \"most influential figure\" in their respect ive fields of endeavor. 519 The individual that they named as the \"most influen tial figure in American education\" during the period of 1924 to 1974 was: John Dewey! One dean of a major university in California was qu oted as saying: \"It has to be Dewey .... I'd allege that he is the only great educator in our history.\" Another educator said that Dewey: \"towers above everyone else.\" And another educator said: \"No individual has influenced the thinking of American educators more ....\" John Dewey was a Socialist/Communist, an atheist, a nd believed in the fraud known as evolution. He believ ed that there were \"no moral absolutes,\" and that man shoul d de- velop his own set of \"moral\" values. He believed th at Christianity was \"powerless to solve\" man's problem s. Yet this is the individual who \"has influenced the thinking of American educators\" the most. To further illustrate the convoluted thinking of th is man, one only needs to examine a quote attributed to him : \"There is no God, and there is no soul. There are no needs for the props of traditional religion. With dogma and creed excluded, then immutable truth is also dead and buried. There is no room for fixed, natural law or permanent moral absolutes.\" These opinions are absolutely incredible, and revea l just how shallow and confused Professor Dewey's thoughts were. 201"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26 THE HUMANISTS He claimed that when religion was removed from the environment, \"immutable truth\" would be \"dead and b uried.\" This is impossible! The word \"immutable\" is defined as being unchangeab le. The professor was admitting that truth was \"immutab le.\" He was saying that \"unchangeable truth\" could be changed! That which is unchangeable cannot be changed! By it s own definition! Yet Professor Dewey said it could be! He also said that there was \"no room for ... perman ent moral absolutes.\" That which is permanent cannot be done away with. It can only be ignored. But if they are permanent, they will still remain. Professor Dewey believed that that which is unchang eable can be changed. He believed that that which is perm anent can be done away with. Professor Dewey was out of touch with reality. Those who are out of touch with reality are defined as being insane. Those who believe that that which is unchange- able can be changed are insane! Yet Professor Dewey has \"influenced the thinking of American educators more than any other educator.\" And his religious beliefs are becoming the official religion of America. In 1973, on the fortieth anniversary of the issuanc e of the first Manifesto, the Humanists issued the second Ma nifesto. This one basically reaffirmed what the first Manife sto said: \"As in 1933, humanists still believe that traditional theism, especially faith in the prayer- hearing God, assumed to love and care for persons, to hear and understand prayers, and to be able to do something about them, is an unproved and outmoded faith. No deity will save us; we must save ourselve s.\" 520 Once again, the Humanists stated their belief that God does not exist. Since there is no God, man is on hi s own. Since man is on his own, man needs to create his ow n re- ligion, and the Humanists have done just that. The Second Principle of the Humanist Manifesto II s tates: 202"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26 THE HUMANISTS \"Promises of immortal salvation or fear of eternal damnation are both illusory and harmful. Rather, science affirms that the human species is an emer- gence from natural evolutionary forms ....\" Here the Humanists restate their conviction that ma n is nothing more than a highly evolved animal. It is a fact of modern reality that this position is no longer the sole theory of origins being offered to the world by the scient ific community. The Theory of Evolution is currently bei ng challenged by what is known as Creation Science. Th is ap- proach is rapidly proving, using scientific data, t hat evolution is a fraud and a hoax. Scientists of world renown a re deser- ting their long held evolutionary beliefs after bei ng exposed to this competing theory. The scientist who has the in tegrity to compare the two theories side by side is discoverin g that evolution is not scientific. Debates between the ev olutionists and the creationists on college campuses all over t he world are being won by the creationists. As a result, sci ence is slowly returning to the position held by the scient ific world before Charles Darwin revolutionized it with his un provable and unsound theories known as Evolution. In spite of this, Evolution is an official part of the Humanist religion. The Third Principle reads: \"Ethics is autonomous and situational, needing no theological or ideological sanction. To deny this d is- torts the whole basis of life.\" There is no God, therefore there are no God-given M oral Absolutes. The words of these Absolutes, such as \"T hou shalt not,\" have no relevance to today's societies, and b ecause this is true, man does not have to obey these teachings. He is therefore free to decide these matters for himself. It follows, therefore, that Religion will shortly pass away. Al l that needs to be done is for it to be officially buried by the Humanists, New Agers, Masons and Communists. This new \"moral\" philosophy has an official name, S itua- tional Ethics, and will be examined more in detail in a subse- quent chapter of this study. The Fourth Principle states: 203"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26 THE HUMANISTS \"Reason and intelligence are the most effective instruments that humankind possesses. There is no substitute: neither faith nor passion suffices in i tself.\" Here the Humanists side with the Masons who have deified reason. As was just discussed, this view ho lds that man's mind is the ultimate savior of mankind. Human ists strive to create an environment where man can utili ze his mind to save humanity. That means that religions mu st be removed from that environment so that man will be f ree to utilize his mind so that he can solve man's problem s without religious interference. The Sixth Principle reads: \"In the areas of sexuality, we believe that intolerant attitudes, often cultivated by orthodox religions and puritanical cultures, unduly repress sexual conduct. The right to birth control, abortio n and divorce should be recognized.\" According to this Principle, religions in America h ave been \"unduly repressive\" in their teaching about mankind 's sex- uality. They have taught the world that abortion is murder (believing that abortion is a violation of the Mora l Absolute \"Thou shalt not kill.\") The Humanists believe that birth control must be available, and abortion on demand p ermitted. The Eighth Principle reads: \"We must extend participatory democracy in its true sense to the economy, the school, the family, the workplace and voluntary associations.\" The Christian and Jewish religions for centuries ha ve taught that the husband is the head of the househol d. But the humanists would change that, by allowing the en tire family to decide the direction that the family is g oing to take. If the family is having difficulty in making a deci sion, such as whether to take a vacation in the mountains or a t the seashore, the family is to decide democratically: e ach person is to have one vote. And if there are three childre n and their choice is the seashore, and the majority rules, the two parents, and the family, will visit the seashore. T he fact that 204"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26 THE HUMANISTS the parents know that they cannot afford the vacati on at the ocean is to have no bearing on the decision. The ma jority rules! It is almost inconceivable that a \"rational\" mind could . conceive of such a program for a family unit, but t hat is what the new Humanists propose. And not only must the family experience the joys of parti- cipatory democracy, so must the workplace. Imagine the ex- perience of having a work force of 5,000 deciding h ow much the production will be that day, and at what price they will be offered, and to whom they will be sold. This is what the Humanists want. And the Humanists want the students to have a say a s to what will be taught that day in school. Allowing fi ve year olds to determine the subjects to be discussed will practically eliminate education as an instructional tool. The Eleventh Principle reads: \"We believe in the right to universal education.\" Karl Marx, who declared himself a \"humanist,\" in th e Communist Manifesto, wrote this in the Tenth Plank: \"Free education for all children in public schools. \" The education of the children used to be the direct re- sponsibility of the family. Parents were originally the teachers of this nation's children, and later were thought a ble to pay for the educational needs of their own children onc e this na- tion went to a system of public education. But here the Hu- manists side with the Communists who believe that e ducation should be the concern of the entire society. In oth er words, those couples who have either decided against havin g chil- dren of their own, or elderly parents, who have alr eady raised their children, were to be made to support the educ ational costs of the parents who produce children. The concept that parents without children should pa y for the education of the parents with children came dir ectly from the writings of Karl Marx, the communist. He wrote \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.\" Marx taught that parents without children had to pa y for those parents with children. 205"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26 THE HUMANISTS The Twelfth Principle reads: \"We deplore the division of humankind on nation- alistic grounds. ... the best option is to transcen d the limits of national sovereignty and move toward the building of a world community .... We thus reaffirm a commitment to the building of world community ....\" The world government is coming, and the Humanists a re proud to announce their support for it. The Fourteenth Principle reads: \"... excessive population growth must be checked by international concord.\" The thought that some held the position that there was a \"population explosion\" was discussed in my book ent itled THE UNSEEN HAND, and was shown to be a fraud. This is w hat I wrote: \"Oregon, a rather small state by comparison to others in the United States, has a total of 95,607 square miles inside its borders. The world has approximately four billion (4,000,000,000) inhabita nts. If the entire population of the world moved to Oregon, and left the remainder of the world complet ely devoid of human life, a family of four would have a piece of Oregon approximately 50' by 53'. This is a bout half the size of a typical residential lot in a sub - division.\" 522 The idea that the world is exploding because there are simply too many people on the earth is a fraud, but the Humanists believe it. In fact, that belief in a lie is a part of their official belief structure. And, not only do t hey acknowledge the non-existent \"problem,\" they wish t o involve government in solving it. Governments deciding to \" control populations\" is the thing that makes dictators exce edingly happy. So the population explosion was not an explosion at all, but was being offered for other purposes. Those who were frightening the population of the world into beli eving that 206"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26 THE HUMANISTS government had to intercede to control a non-existe nt problem had a hidden agenda. The operative word is the word \"control,\" and would have gladdened the heart of an y dictator. The type of government necessary to coerce people i nto controlling the non-existent \"population explosion\" is one that should frighten any thinking person. But this thought has apparently not occurred to tho se who ascribe to the Humanist religion. The last paragraph of their Manifesto contains a su m- mation of their basic beliefs: \"We further urge the use of reason and c om- passion to produce the kind of world we want ....\" So the Humanists have linked themselves with the ot hers who look to man's reason as the solution to all of the problems caused, in their way of thinking, by the r eligions of the world. This second Manifesto was signed by 102 individuals including some very familiar names: Isaac Asimov, author, Alan F. Guttmacher, Planned Parenthood Federation, Lester Mondale, brother of the former Vice-Presiden t, Andre Sakharov, Academy of Sciences, Moscow , USSR, and Joseph Fletcher, Visiting Prof., School of Medicine, University of Virginia.

Mrs. O'Hair has had an interest in the religious vi ews of Humanism for many years. She was once the editor of the magazine entitled THE FREE HUMANIST, and was electe d to the Board of the American Humanist Association i n 1965, and was elected in 1973 for a second four year term . In public statements she has been quoted as saying that \"there's absolutely no conclusive evidence\" that Je sus ever lived and that Christianity has never \"contributed anything to anybody, anyplace, at any time.\" She has called rel igion \"the mental excrement of primitive man,\" and has said th at: \"religion is the wildest form of insanity. I would turn every church into a home for the aged or out- patient clinic, etc. Christianity, which is anti-sc ience, anti-life, anti-sex, anti-woman, anti-freedom, anti - peace, is detrimental to the United States.\" She has not confined her activity to just the praye r-in- school issue, either. Her attack on Christianity ha s gotten her involved in other issues. In December of 1974, she supported the Lansman-Mila m petition (RM 2493) to the Federal Communications Co m- mission (the FCC.) This petition asked them to impo se an immediate freeze on all: \"applications for reserved educational FM and TV channels ... by any and all 'Christian,' Bible, 'Re ligious,' and other sectarian colleges and institutions.\" 523 In September of 1977, she filed suit in the federal court to remove the motto \"In God We Trust,\" from all U.S . cur- rency.

The articl e that reported her activity quoted her as saying: \"I'm going to try to have the mayor and the minister who leads the prayers arrested. They're interjecting religious activity into a governmental meeting.\" 525 Two years later, in 1979, the Supreme Court unanimo usly rejected her suit about the removal of the \"In God We Trust\" motto from all American currency. The judge who rul ed against her in the District Court was quoted as say ing that the motto: \"has nothing whatsoever to do with the estab- lishment of religion. Its use is of a patriotic or ceremonial character and bears no true resemblance to a governmental sponsorship of a religious exercise. Moreover, it would be ludicrous to argue that the u se of the national motto fosters any excessive govern- mental entanglement with religion.\" 526 One of her more recent cases involved a group that she was the founder and the President Emeritus of, cal led the Society of Separationists. They sued the state of Texas, claiming that they had been systematically exclu ded from jury duty because of their refusal to swear an oath to God. They claimed that the oath that all prospective jur ors must take before they are sworn in as members of a panel that requires them to be sworn in \"so help me God,\" was a viola- tion of \"the constitutional separation of church an state. 527 That was an interesting, but not persuasive, ar gument because the Constititution of the United States con tains no such statement in its wording. There is no re quired \"sep- aration of church and state.\" Those are the words o f Thomas Jefferson and not of the Constitution. 209"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26 THE HUMANISTS The First Amendment to the Constitution of the Unit ed States reads: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an es- tablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free ex ercise thereof; [the remainder of the Amendment protects other rights and does not concern itself with the r ight to religious freedom.] Notice that Congress is prohibited from establishin g a na- tional religion. Notice furthermore that the states may do so if they so choose. That is because of the Tenth Ame ndment to the Constitution that reads: \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the St ates, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" So, Congress has no authority to require anyone to believe in any particular religion. There is no reason why the na- tional government may not print a motto such as \"In God We Trust\" on its currency. Mrs. O'Hair's string of failures has affected her f amily as well. All of her activity for the cause of atheism has failed to induce one of her two sons to believe in the theory . Her son, William Murray, the child she filed the su it to restrict prayer in public schools for, later became a Christian. He said in a letter in May, 1980, that he was publi cly apologizing to the American people because: \"the part I played as a teenager in removing prayer from public schools was criminal. I removed from our future generations that short time each da y which should rightly be reserved for God. Inasmuch as the suit to destroy the tradition of prayer in scho ol was brought in my name, I feel gravely responsible for the resulting destruction of the moral fiber of our youth that it has caused.\" 528 In June of 1988, he told us a little about what his mother believed in. He told the world in an interview that : 210"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26 THE HUMANISTS \"My mother was always a Marxist.

He said: \"Many people identify me as being the son of atheist leader Madlyn Murray O'Hair. Granted, she i s my mother, but her identification as an atheist 'le ader' is not quite true. It was never her intent to be an atheist leader, but a Marxist leader.\" He reminisced about his childhood with his mother w hen he added these thoughts: \"... I'm able to reflect upon the change in my own life [Mr. Murray, as mentioned previously, has sinc e become a Christian] from being raised in a home where there was hatred toward freedom; hatred toward free enterprise; and hatred toward God.\" It wasn't until 1988, however, when some of the tru th about Mrs. O'Hair's lawsuit came out. The Houston C hronicle told the world in its June 18, 1988 newspaper, that : \"Madalyn Murray O'Hair ... said she invented a non-existent public interest group so it would not appear that she was fighting the battle alone. 'I lied like **** [expletive deleted] during the whole thing. The public wasn't willing to listen to just one single woman alone with two kids tugging at her ... so what I did was invent the Maryland Committee for the Separation of Church and State, which reall y didn't exist.\" Others of national and international renown have em - braced the Humanist religion as well. Another who publicly did was Karl Marx, the Communi st. He also claimed Humanism as his own. He wrote: 211"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26 THE HUMANISTS \"Communism as a fully developed naturalism is humanism ....\" 529 And in 1970, the New Program of the Communist Party , U.S.A., stated: \"Marxism is not only rational; it is humanist in the best and most profound meaning of the term.\" 530 But Humanism is not just a word in a dictionary. It is be- coming the official religion of the United States. The proof that Humanism has received official sanction as the religion of the United States starts with a Supreme Court de cision in a 1961 case called Torcaso versus Watkins. The Cour t ruled that Humanism was to be officially sanctioned as a religion when they declared: \"Among religions in this country which do not teach what would generally be considered a belief i n the existence of God are Buddhism, Taoism, Ethical Culture, Secular Humanism and others.\" 531 The Court ruled that the First Amendment to the Con - stitution granted the same protection and imposed t he same limitations on the \"religion of Secular Humanism\" a s are applicable to other religions. And in 1965, the Supreme Court in another case wrot e that: \"... a humanistic belief that is sincerely professe d as a religion shall be entitled to recognition as r e- ligious under the Selective Service Law. 532 The result of this decision is to exempt anyone fro m the draft who professes that his religion is called Hum anism. So the Supreme Court has correctly identified Human ism as a \"religion.\" And even the Humanists declare tha t their religion is a religion. The President of the Americ an Human- ist Association wrote this: \"Humanism is a religion without a God, divine revelation or sacred scriptures.\" 533 212"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26 THE HUMANISTS And Sir Julian Huxley, a signer of the Humanist Man ifest II, wrote this in a Humanist Association promotiona l bro- chure: \"I use the word 'humanist' to mean someone who believes that man is just as much a natural pheno- menon as an animal or plant; that his body, mind an d soul were not supernaturally created but were pro- ducts of evolution.\" 524 And to show that the government of the United State s has officially recognized the Humanists as a religi on, the American Humanist Association has been granted a re ligious tax exemption. So, as has been illustrated, Humanism is based upon a belief in three major philosophies: Communism, evolution and atheism. And it is being taught in the schools of America (t his will be explored in a later chapter of this study.) In 1987, some parents with young children in the Al a- bama public school system found the teaching of thi s religion in their tax-supported schools to be objectionable. They filed suit to prevent their children from being taught a religious view in violation of their own personal religious v iews. An article that appeared in the Arizona Daily Star rep orted what happened: \"A federal judge ordered Alabama officials yester- day to remove 36 textbooks from public schools, say ing they furthered a belief in humanism and denied the role of religion in American society. The sweeping ruling, a victory for 624 conser- vative Christians who pressed the lawsuit, found fo r the first time that secular humanism is a religion that is unconstitutionally advanced in the nation's publ ic schools. [U.S. District Judge W. Brevard Hand] found that five home economics textbooks, published by such giants as McGraw Hill Book Co., advance religious tenets in violation of the First Amendment's prohib i- tion against governmental establishment of a religi on. 213"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26 THE HUMANISTS In addition, Hand found that 31 history and so- cial studies textbooks, also published by major hou ses, were 'not merely bad history, but lack so many fact s as to equal ideological promotion.'\" 535 The Alabama Civil Liberties Union was not pleased w ith the decision. The article quoted their executive di rector Mary Weidler as saying: \"This decision confirms our worst fears of federal censorship over local public school matters. It sev erely threatens non-sectarian public education in Alabama and around the nation.\" This concern about \"federal censorship\" by the Alab ama Civil Liberties Union is very puzzling. Their posit ion that the removal of textbooks from the public schools by the federal government constituted \"censorship\" revealed a blat ant hypoc- risy. Because in the \"Creationism Science versus Ev olution Science\" court case also in Alabama a few years lat er, the American Civil Liberties Union, presumably the pare nt of the Alabama organization, took the opposite position. I n that case, they argued that Creationism science textbook s should be removed from the students in Alabama's science c lass- rooms. It was their position that the Creationism S cience could not be taught side by side with the theory of Evolution in science classes in the state. They argued that o nly Evolu- tion could be taught. In other words, they argued in favor of the censors hip of Creationism textbooks from the classroom. Their objection in that case was basically that the Crea- tionism textbooks taught a religious view of scienc e in opposi- tion to the traditional Evolutionist view. In other words, those who claim to protect America's \"Civil Liberties\" wa nted the books removed in one case, but not in the other. They claimed that the Creationists wanted to teach a re- ligious view in the science classes, and they urged that the court to remove the textbooks. The Christians claim ed that the Humanists were teaching a religious view in oth er class- rooms in the school districts, and the Civil Libert ies Union objected when the judge removed the books. 214"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26 THE HUMANISTS This doesn't make sense, unless those claiming to p rotect America's \"civil liberties\" wanted only the Humanis t religion taught in the public schools. That conclusion fits the facts. If they were concerned about \"federal censorship of school matters,\" they should have been consistent. They sh ould have allowed the state to utilize Creationism science te xtbooks be- cause they \"feared federal censorship.\" But they didn't. The \"civil libertarians\" are not c onsistent. Censorship is not called censorship if your side do es the censoring. And the American Civil Liberties Union wants to be the censor. 215"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Chapter 27 Situation Ethics \"If we are gods, we can develop our own truth.\" But if Humanism succeeds and religion is removed fr om the American lifestyle, the Christian style of mora lity will be done away with as well. That means that the Humanis ts must have a moral view to offer in its place. And they do: it is called Situation Ethics. The dictionary defines \"situation ethics\" as: \"A system of ethics according to which moral rules are not absolutely binding but may be modifie d in the light of specific situations.\" The Humanists have declared their support of this c on- cept. They have included it in their Humanist Manif esto II: \"Third: We affirm that moral values derive their source from human experience. 216"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 27 SITUATION ETHICS Ethics is autonomous and situational.\" 536 Douglas Grothuis, author of UNMASKING THE NEW AGE, wrote: \"Once you've deified yourself [made yourself into a god,] which is what the New Age is all about, there is no higher moral absolute. It's a recipe for ethical an- archy.\" 537 In essence, the New. Agers are saying: All moral va lues are situational. The situation determines what's ri ght or wrong, and since situations constantly change, what 's right today may be wrong tomorrow. The New Age Movement, the Humanist Religion, and th e Communists have made a god out of man; they have de ified mankind. The new morality for a man-god is whatever he decides it is, and that is what the New Age-Humanis ts- Communists have done. Their new morality is called Situa- tion Ethics. Dr. Arthur E. Gravatt, M.D., defined the term for a scien- tific journal: \"... moral behavior may differ from situation to situation. Behavior might be moral for one person a nd not another. Whether an act is moral or immoral is determined by the law of love;' that is the extent of which love and concern for others is a factor in th e relationship.\" 538 But it was another who coined the phrase \"Situation Eth- ics.\" That honor belongs to Joseph Fletcher, who fi rst used the word in a speech to Harvard alumni in 1964. He was a professor at the Cambridge Episcopal Theological Se minary. This is what he believes: \"... for me there are no rules - none at all .... ... anything and everything is right or wrong according to the situation — what is wrong in some cases is right in others .... 217"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 27 SITUATION ETHICS ... a situationist would discard all absolutes exce pt the one absolute: always to act with loving concern .\" 539 By this definition, mass murderers would not be in error if they professed that their acts were based on a l ove for humanity, and that they had committed their murders with \"a loving concern.\" If, for example, one of these m urderers killed people in an area polluted with radioactive wastes, and said that these acts were being committed because t he murderer did not want them to be affected by the po llution, and that he loved them, the act would be acceptable ac- cording to those who believed in Situation Ethics. This \"morality\" known as \"Situation Ethics\" is the under- lying philosophy of the Communists/Socialists who m urder a percentage of a nation's population in a quest for their goal of Communism or Socialism. The advocates of these \"-is ms\" claim that their goal is so desirable that those wh o they murder must give way for the good of all humanity. The corollary of this position is \"The end justifies th e means.\" The Communists in Russia murdered up to 42 million people in the Communist Revolution of 1917 because the Communist society was deemed to be worth all of the carnage by the murderers. It is certain that Adolf Hitler felt that his murde rs of some 50 million people during World War II were not wrong because the \"Third Reich\" that would result after t he war was over would be worth it. Chou En-Lai and Mao Tse Tung murdered as many as 64 million people in their Communist Revolution that s tarted in 1923 and ended in 1949 and one can know that they f elt that the price the dead people had to pay for the rest o f the Chinese was worth the end result. It will be remembered that Adam Weishaupt, the foun der of the Illuminati, wrote that \"the ends justified t he means.\" Weishuapt wrote further that \"no man [would be] fit for our Order who [was] not ready to go to every length .\" 540 Only one with no moral values, in other words, one who believed in Situation Ethics, would be \"willing to go to every length.\" John Robison, the exposer of the Illuminati, wrote: \"Nothing was so frequently discoursed of as the propriety of employing, for the good purpose, the m eans 218"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 27 SITUATION ETHICS which the wicked employed for evil purposes; and it was taught, that the preponderancy of good in the ultimate result consecrated every mean employed.\" 541 A modern day exponent of the Situation Ethics philo sophy is actress Shirley MacLaine. She has written: \"There is no such thing as evil. Evil is fear and u n- certainty. Evil is what you think it is. This business of 'evil' and 'satan' was a ridiculou s concept to me.\" 542 And the Masons also believe in Situation Ethics. Ma son H. L. Haywood wrote in his book entitled GREAT TEAC H- INGS OF MASONRY: \"Human experience ... is the one final authority in morals. Wrong is whatever hurts human life or destroys human happiness .... Acts are not right or wrong intrinsically but ac- cording as their effects are hurtful or helpful.\" 543 And he repeated the thought in another of his books , THE MEANING OF MASONRY: \"What is good for me may be evil for you; what is right to do at one moment may be wrong the next.\" 544 And Albert Pike agreed with this comment in his boo k MORALS AND DOGMA: \"... all truths are truths of Period, and not truth for eternity.\" 545 Mr Pike held that there were no absolutes. All trut hs were only for the period. This view is called Situa tion Ethics. Mr. Pike called his book MORALS AND DOGMA. Situa- tion Ethics is a particular view of morality.

Those commandments were called Moral Abs o- lutes. Mr. Hall was saying that Jesus never taught that, and that human reason would not accept the principle th at there were moral absolutes. Human reason has concluded th at keeping a divine commandment is not \"reasonable.\" Friedrich Nietzsche, whose powerful dissertation on THE GENEALOGY OF MORALS sought to make \"a revaluation o f all values,\" wrote that \"so-called evil was good, a nd what was habitually believed to be good was evil.\" 547 The Communists are also taught that there are no ab so- lutes in life. Nikolai Lenin, the Russian Communist , certainly believed in Situation Ethics. His revolution in 191 7 murdered, as has been discussed before, nearly 42 million peo ple, to achieve the goal of Communism for the Russian peopl e. He wrote: \"Communism is power based upon force and limited to nothing, by no kind of law and by absolutely no set rule.\" 548 \"The dictatorship of the proletariat is nothing els e than power based upon force and limited by nothing — by no kind of law and by absolutely no rule.\" 549 \"We must combat religion.

It will continue to exist throughout all of time. Lenin admitted that in his view, these \"truths\" wer e eter- nal. Yet he admitted that Communism would \"abolish\" these \"eternal truths.\" That which is eternal cannot be abolished. Unless your thinking is as convoluted as that of Ni kolai Lenin! Lenin was just as insane as John Dewey! He continued with other similar thoughts: \"We, of course, say that we do not believe in God. We do not believe in eternal morality. We repudiate all morality that is taken outside of human, class concepts. We say that our morality is en- tirely subordinated to the interests of the class s trug- gle.

Everything is moral which is necessary for the annihilation of the old exploitin g social order and for uniting the proletariat. In what sense do we repudiate ethics and morality?

This young man had an enormous influenc e on the outcome of the Russian Bolshevik Communist Revo lution of 1917, and the resulting deaths of approximately 42 million people, because his writings had an enormous influe nce on Nikolai Lenin. Nechayev wrote: \"Our cause is terrible, complete, universal and pit i- less destruction .... Let us unite with the savage, criminal world, these true and only revolutionists of Russia.\" 555 Only a believer in Situation Ethics could ever say such a thing. There are no moral absolutes when complete d estruc- tion is your goal. And that was the goal of this re volutionary. He continued: \"The revolutionary is a doomed man. He has no personal interests, no business affairs, no emotion s, no attachments, no property and no name. Everything in him is wholly absorbed in the single thought and the single passion for revolution. The revolutionary knows ... he has broken all bonds which tie him to social order and the civilized wor ld with all its laws, moralities and customs and with its generally accepted conventions. The object is perpetually the same: the surest and quickest way of destroying the whole filthy order. 222"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 27 SITUATION ETHICS The revolutionary ... despises and hates the existi ng social morality ....

Kill in public places if these ba se rascals dare to enter them, kill in houses, kill in vil- lages. Remember, those who will not side with us will be against us. Whoever is against us is our enemy. And we must destroy enemies by all means.\" 556 What this young revolutionary wrote about was unres trict- ed Situation Ethics, where there absolutely is no r ight and wrong. NechayeVs thoughts are the logical result of this type of thinking. Once the revolutionary accepts this et hical code, anything is permitted. Murder, looting, pillaging, and torture become acceptable behavior. And this is the ethical code of the Humanist. Situation Ethics leads some into a position of hati ng the entire society, and of wishing to destroy the whole social fabric, the \"old world order.\" Then those who wish to fill the void can remake the world. And the new world that w ill be created will be called The New World Order. Remember that Nechayev wrote that the revolutionary in- tended to \"destroy the whole filthy order.\" The goa l of the revolutionary was to destroy the \"old world order\" and replace it with the \"New World Order.\" Perhaps the major purpose of Situation Ethics was m ade clear in a book written by Aldous Huxley entitled B RAVE NEW WORLD REVISITED. He identified the destruction of the individual as the primary goal of this new ethi cal teaching. He wrote: \"... a new Social Ethic is replacing our traditiona l ethical system — the system in which the individual is primary. 223"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 27 SITUATION ETHICS ... the social whole has greater worth and signi- ficance than its individual parts, ... that the rig hts of the collectivity take precedence over ... the Right s of Man.\" 55?

He is the pastor of a fundamentalist church in that community and he taught his congregation that they had the scriptura l obliga- tion to teach their children themselves. And, to ac complish this end, the church voted to open a Christian scho ol in the summer of 1977.

They also believed that the First Amendme nt to the Constitution of the United States protected the ir right to freedom of religion. That First Amendment reads in part: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, OR PROHIBITING THE FREE EXERCISE THEREOF ....\" Since government was prohibited from passing a law abridging the free exercise of their religious righ ts, the church felt that they would not be interfered with. This church was the first in Nebraska to open a Chr istian school without licensing their teachers. So, they w ere the first to be challenged by the state government of Nebrask a. Later, in August, the Nebraska Department of Educat ion entered the school and told the Pastor that the sch ool was breaking state law because they had not certified t heir in- structors. They cited Rules numbered 14 and 21, whi ch they said were procedures for getting the school license d, and for licensing their faculty. The Pastor explained their position, but his argume nts were not listened to. Later, The sheriff came and a rrested the Pastor, and the case went to a county court. The Pa stor also used as his defense Article 1, Section 4 of the Neb raska State Constitution which read: \"All persons have a natural and indefeasible [de- fined as that which cannot be undone or made void] right to worship Almighty God according to the dic- tates of their own consciences ... nor shall any in ter- ference with the rights of conscience be permitted. Religion, morality and knowledge, however, being essential to good government, it shall be the duty of the legislature to pass suitable laws to protect ev ery denomination in the peaceable enjoyment of its own mode of public worship, and to encourage schools an d the means of instruction.\" The Pastor then testified: 226"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 28 THE ATTACK ON RELIGION \"... the primary objection of the Faith Baptist Church to accepting licensure from the State is the violation of Ephesians 1:22 which reads: 'The God of our Lord Jesus Christ gave him [Jesus] to be the head over all things of the churc h.'\" And Colossians 1:18: '... and he [Jesusl is the head of the body, the church ....' The Pastor continued to resist, and the judge rewar ded that resistance with several terms in prison. Pastor Sileven wrote an explanation as to why he re fused to allow the state to control his school in his boo k entitled THE PADLOCKED CHURCH: \"We came to the firm conclusion, unanimously, that Christ could not be submitted to the authority of the state, leaving the state the right to determine the philosophy of the curriculum or the qualifications of the teachers.\" 558 In addition, the Pastor looked at the activities of the judge who ruled in this case: \"The judge who presided in our case admitted that he did not look at the First Amendment [to the U.S. Constitution] before deciding our case. He als o admitted that he defines education as non-religious ; therefore, he defines away our religious beliefs an d rights.\" 559 The Pastor and the members of the Faith Baptist Chu rch continued to believe that the operation of a school to teach the children of the church's members was a part of the church's ministry. The state countered with the arg ument that they were not qualified to determine what thei r children were to be taught, nor capable of determining who s hould teach them.

The desire to destroy the family unit is, as has be en briefly alluded to in previous sections of this stu dy, one of the goals of the New Age-Humanist-Communist movement. Marilyn Ferguson, the New Age writer, has written t his about the family unit in her book entitled THE AQUA RIAN CONSPIRACY: \"Many sociologists anticipate the 'evolution' of monogamy.

The word is defined a s: 1. The practice or state of being married to only one person at a time. 2. The practice of marrying only once during life. The dictionary added an appendage to the second definition: it said that that definition was \"rare. \" And indeed it is. The tradition in America that the husband takes him self a wife, and then remains faithful to that spouse fo r the re- mainder of their life together is a Judeo-Christian one. In other words, it comes from the beliefs and teaching s of two religious faiths. Since this is not something that is written instinc tively into the hearts of all men, and since man is given free choice, man is free to accept or reject the created institu tion of the family. The married man does not have to have but o ne wife and to remain faithful to her. It is only religion that has taught him that the monogamous marriage is the pref erable lifestyle. Marilyn Ferguson, a New Age writer, writes further: \"Traditional monogamy contravenes the growing sense that the greatest good of human existence is deep interpersonal relationships, as many of these as is compatible with depth. ... younger people are trying to devise and invent a form of marriage appropriate to a new era.\" 561 As has been previously illustrated, the New Age Movement and the Communist Movement want to destroy the family. Here, one of the major New Age writers says that it is the young people who are attempting to devise a new marriage institution. The children are being taught to change the marriage contract by those in the New Age Movem ent 230"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 THE ATTACK ON THE FAMILY who have written the textbooks, or encouraged a dialogue with the intent of changing their attitudes. Even the definition of a family, meaning a male hus band, a female wife, a child or children, has to be redef ined for the New Age. Marilyn Ferguson has told us that this has already taken place: \"The American Home Economics Association rede- fined the family in 1979 as 'two or more persons [meaning two men, or two women as well as one man and one woman] who share resources, share respon- sibility to one another over time. The family is that climate that 'one comes home to;' and it is this network of sharing and commitme nts that most accurately describes the family unit, reg ard- less of blood, legal ties, adoption, or marriage.'\" The American concept of marriage is that of a male hus- band, and a female wife. Homosexual or lesbian marr iages are not legal. But that can change anytime those wh o make the laws decide to change it. The New Agers apparen tly want to change the laws to allow the marriage of two men or two women. A major step in changing the traditional definition of the family just occurred in the state of New York. The headline of the July 6, 1989 article that discussed the chan ge, reads: \"Court rules gay couple a 'family.'\" The article reported: \"New York's highest court ruled today that a partner in a long-term homosexual relationship may take over the couple's rent-controlled apartment wh en the lover who signed the lease dies. ... the Court of Appeals ordered a lower court to reconsider its decision to evict a New York City ma n from a rent-controlled apartment he shared ... with his now-dead lover. ... the court expanded the definition of a 'family'.... 231"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 THE ATTACK ON THE FAMILY The word is crucial because state law says only 'family members' may take over rent-controlled apartments when the tenant of record dies. The court said that the definition should include adults who show long-term financial and emotional commitment to each other, even if they don't fit th e traditional meaning of a 'family.'\" 562 So, even the definition of a family is under attack . It will have to be changed if the family is to be destroyed . As discussed, there are some who want the family un it to be destroyed altogether. The destruction of the fam ily unit has been the goal of the Communists and Socialists for over 140 years. Karl Marx, the so-called father of Commu nism, wrote that that was the goal of the Party: \"Abolition of the family! Even the most radical flare up at this infamous proposal of the Communists.\" 563 And Robert Owen, the so-called father of Socialism, wrote: \"In the new moral world, the irrational names of husband and wife, parent and child, will be heard n o more. All connection will the result of affection; the child will undoubtedly be the property of the whole community.\" 564 And the process of the change from the idea that th e raising of the child should be the responsibility o f the family to that where the child will be raised by the state has already started in some of the Communist countries. One of those countries is Cuba. The Cuban people were once basically a religious pe ople, with the overwhelming majority belonging to the Cat holic Church. But much of that has changed since Fidel Ca stro, the Communist, converted that nation into a Communi st country. These comments are from a 1988 article in the New American magazine: \"Heterosexual relations in Cuba are characterized by rampant promiscuity and widespread prostitution. 232"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 THE ATTACK ON THE FAMILY The abject poverty to which Castro has reduced the island encourages prostitution. The institution of marriage has almost lost its meaning in Cuba. Many persons marry and divorce frequently. ... the Castro regime has worked to destroy family ties and to break the control of parents over their children. The Communists in Cuba have baited children with the offer by setting up live-in schoo ls in the countryside. At these schools students study ha lf a day and then must work in the fields for the other half. While attendance at these 'escuelas en el campo' [meaning camp schools] is not mandatory, students o f junior high and high school levels are encouraged t o attend. Even students who do not attend the live-in school must participate yearly in a six-week work period deep in the rural areas of Cuba. The Castro regime relies heavily upon the use of hundreds of thousands of unpaid school children to work in the fields each year. Under the cover of educational programs, the Castro regime exploits ch ild labor and disrupts parental authority.\" 565 It is interesting that the leader of Cuba, Fidel Ca stro, sets the example for infidelity and promiscuity in the mar- riage union. He has five known children born out of wedlock to different mothers. 566 Other Communist nations have shown their commitment to the destruction of the family. The Communists in China have also been at least partially successful in the ir drive to destroy the family unit. Those who have studied tha t nation's past know that the family unit had been the corners tone of their civilization for centuries. One Chinese citizen who was able to flee his countr y after the Communists took control in 1949 was Reverend Sh ih-ping Wang, the East Asia director of the Baptist Evangel ization Society. He testified before the House Committee on Un- American Activities about what happened to the fami ly when Communism seized control of China: \"The family unit is broken up. Husbands and wives are separated in different barracks. The chil dren 233"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 THE ATTACK ON THE FAMILY are taken away from the parents and placed in government-run nurseries. Husbands and wives meet only once a week for two hours ~ they have no other contact .... The parents may see their children once a week and when they see them they can show no affection toward their children. Names are taken away from children and they are given numbers. There is no individual identity.\" 567 Some of the measures to control the family unit in China are rather subtle, while others are not. For instan ce, any couple wishing to get married must have permission of the Communist Party. Political dissidents, for one, are not permitted to marry. Once any couple is granted that permis- sion, even the decision as to how many children the couple can have in these so called \"marriages\" is a decisi on of others. One who testified to that fact was another Chinese refugee, Dr. Han Suyin, a native of Peking, who rep orted in an address to the Swiss Society of Surgeons in 1975 that the: \"residents of each neighborhood in the People's Republic of China meet annually to decide how many babies will be born during the next year and to whi ch families. Priority is given to newly married women without children. As a guarantee against chance or mistakes , contraceptive pills are distributed on each street every morning.\" 568 This policy of allowing the \"people\" to decide just how many children each couple can have in China has led to the practice of infanticide, meaning the intentional ki lling of babies. The government does not allow any couple to have more than one child, and this edict has caused the following problem: \"a leading newspaper of Southern China [has] reported that during 1980, eight female infants wer e found dead, abandoned in front of the local party headquarters .... Most had been suffocated.\" 569 234"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 THE ATTACK ON THE FAMILY The article continued by explaining why only female children were being killed by distraught parents: \"Should a couple's first [and only] child be a girl , many parents fear that they will be left without an heir or source of support in their declining years. Thus, in certain areas some parents have begun murdering their first-born female offspring.\" Other options are available for those parents who d o not have the courage to murder their children. A recent report, in March of 1989, reported that some parents have deve loped another method of allowing their children a way to survive: \"An estimated 25 million 'illegals' are living in Red China. They are unregistered children who are not immigrants or aliens, but native-born Chinese whose parents hide them and keep them unregistered by the government because of its official 'one fami ly- child' policy. The unregistered children cannot attend govern- ment schools, receive government aid of any kind, o r work for the government in any capacity.\" 570 This decision to allow only one child to a couple i n China is enforced by other practices: \"If a couple persists in having a second child, one of the parents is forced to buy all grain rations a t twice the regulation prices for the next seven year s. The third child does not get the identity card that entitles him to food rations.\" 571 But if the Communist Party discovers that a Chinese woman got pregnant without their permission, they f orce her to have an abortion. Jonathan Mirsky, in an article for The Nation, wrote that women who got pregnant without p ermis- sion had been kidnapped on Communist Party orders a nd forced to have an abortion, even if she was in the third trimester of her pregnancy. This \"one-child per family\" concept poses another p roblem: what does the Communist Party do if the woman gives birth 235"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 THE ATTACK ON THE FAMILY to twins? That question was answered by an American who visited Red China. Stephen Mosher was a graduate student at Stanford University working on his doctorate when he was ask ed to do research for his thesis in China. He consented, and went to live in a small village in the southern part. His d iscoveries of life in that nation astounded him. These are his co mments about what happens when a Chinese woman gave birth to twins: \"... an official ... demanded that she specify whic h of the two she wished to raise. The mother could no t answer him, so the official made the decision for h er, disposing of one of the newborn babies.\" 572 The practice of abortion has become so widespread t hat the United States government has estimated that mor e than 78 million were performed in Red China between the years 1971 and 1982. But the Chinese Communists place other obstacles in the way of a Chinese couple. These obstacles hinder the ability of the couple to enjoy married life. \"It is now mandatory for women to work in the fields. They do, and they still do all the housewor k.\" Obviously, a Chinese woman forced to work in a fiel d does not have time to be involved in the full-time raisi ng of I family. The utter despair of some of the women in China bec ause of these Communist imposed conditions has led to a new problem: \"Peasant girls in the remote southern region of China are taking their lives in unprecedented numbers.\" 573 Girls are committing suicide in record numbers in R ed China because of the pressure on the marriage, the abortion problem, and the requirement that they can give bir th to only one child. But the problem in China is not too many Chinese. It is simply to much Communism. 236"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 THE ATTACK ON THE FAMILY The Communists have imposed Communism, also called the New World Order, on the Chinese people, and it has failed, just as could have been predicted by anyone who had studied the history of Communism. The Communist system does not work; it has never worked; and it is not working in China. And there is an easy way to prove that that stateme nt is correct. Off the shore of Communist China lies the islands k nown as Formosa or Taiwan. This separate Chinese nation has not bought the fraud known as Communism. It is basicall y allowing its citizens to enjoy the right to private property. The Taiwanese government is supporting the economic system known as the Free Enterprise System. Former Congressman Eldon Rudd of Arizona illustrate d the difference between Communism and Freedom: \"With 270 times the land area and 58 times the population, the Gross National Product [the G.N.P.] of Mainland China [Communist China] is only 10 times the G.N.P. of Taiwan. The figures I have cited illustrate beyond contra- diction the material abundance created by freedom's climate. In my view, this is the smallest and least im- portant of the remarkable differences between the People's Republic of China [meaning Communist Chi- na] and the free government of Taiwan. The true dif - ference is spirit — the human condition, the absenc e of compulsion and regimentation, the presence of indi- vidual opportunity.\" 574 So the problem in China is not too much population. It is too much Communism. It is too much \"New World Order.\" So the family unit in China, the cornerstone of the ir civil- ization for centuries, has essentially been destroy ed by the Communist Party. And it was not destroyed by mistake. It was planned that way. And the Bolshevik Communists in the Soviet Union ha ve nearly duplicated the \"success\" of the Chinese Comm unists. 237"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 THE ATTACK ON THE FAMILY The September, 1988 Reader's Digest magazine carrie d an article called Should We Bail Out Gorbachev? in whi ch they discussed life in the Soviet Union. This is one of the com- ments made in that article: \"At least 13 million urban families still must live in communal apartments or dormitories, sharing bath , kitchen and even bedrooms with other families. In Moscow, newly constructed apartment complexes are crumbling.\" 575 So a great percentage of the Russian families do no t have a place to live separate from other people. Married life does not seem exceptionally attractive to a young couple contem- plating marriage. So, if the Communists are trying to destroy the family in Russia, one of the ways to do it woul d be to not construct enough government owned apartments or hou ses. And that is exactly what they have done. Also, the Soviet Union is utilizing the same infant icide that is occurring in Red China. \"Topping the world in legal abortions is the Soviet Union ~ where there are an estimated eight million annually of the 30 million worldwide. According to the Moscow News, an astounding nine of 10 of the first pregnancies in the U.S.S.R. end in the legal killing of the unborn child. The corresponding figures in the United States, reports the Alan Guttmacher Institute in New York City, is one of three of the first pregnancies term i- nating in abortion and 1.6 million abortions annual ly.\" 576 Those who support the concept of legal abortions of ten claim that those who charge that life begins at con ception are wrong. Their position is that life begins at birth. But th ere are others who are claiming that even that date is not adequate, and that life should start at some later date.

He has been quoted as saying th at he foresees the day when: \"no newborn infant will be declared human unless it has passed certain tests regarding its genetic endowment.

And now the reader can understand what some of the Humanists think of the value of human life. Once an indi- vidual denies the existence of God, he becomes god himself, and he can decide all of those things that other pe ople feel God used to decide. Such things as: the right to li fe, the right to property, etc. But the attacks on the family in America are a litt le more subtle. But they are real, none the less. In 1988, the Supreme Court decided that a husband h as no right to stop his wife from having an abortion. The appeals court, which passed the decision onto the S upreme Court, had stated that the husband \"has no right to veto [his wife's] decision [to have the abortion] as such [a] decision concerns only her.\" 578 This decision certainly had a long-lasting effect u pon the marriage where both parties to the marriage contrac t are supposed to have a say in any decision that affects both parties. But the latest attack on the family is a new phenom enon called \"child abuse.\" The National Committee for th e Prevention of Child Abuse advises there were 1.2 mi llion reports of child abuse in 1984. Those who have paid attention to this or more current figures are suitably outrag ed, having been conditioned to believe that this abuse is ramp ant inside the American society. However, the reason that the response to these stat istics can be called hysteria, is this comment from Dougla s Besharov, the first director of the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, who has charged that over 60 per cent of 239"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 THE ATTACK ON THE FAMILY these complaints are totally unfounded. And others have said that that figure might be as high as 80 percent. And in most of the remaining cases, the injury actu ally involved neglect ~ failure to provide what some soc ial worker deemed to be adequate food, clothing or shelter — a far cry from the sordid crimes widely publicized in the pre ss. One foreign nation which responded to the hysteria was Sweden, which passed a law in 1979 punishing parent s who spank their children. The Parade magazine article t hat re- ported on the law mentioned the case where a father told his son not to take his younger brother out on a bicycl e ride. The son disobeyed his father, and the father gave him a spanking on the buttocks. The son marched down to the local police station an d re- ported his dad for spanking him. A jury later found the fa- ther guilty and fined him. In America, this hysteria has led to a horrendous i n- trusion of the government into private family matte rs, much of which appears to be unwarranted and some of whic h is de- monstrably harmful to the children involved. The definitions of \"child abuse\" have basically mad e crimi- nals out of nearly every parent in America. A feder ally funded study, sponsored by the National Institute o f Mental Health, and released in November of 1985, defines t he vic- tims of \"violence against children\" as being those who have \"slapped or spanked,\" or \"pushed, grabbed, or shove d\" their children. It would be difficult to find any parent in America that wouldn't be included in those categories. The broad definition of \"child abuse,\" which makes every parent in America into a criminal, makes sense if t he ob- server remembers that there are people in America t oday who want to destroy the family. The way for them to ach ieve their goal is to convince the world that families abuse t heir chil- dren, and that \"social workers\" do not. Then, when the au- thorities come to take the children away from the p arents of America, the overwhelming majority of the remainder of the citizens will accept the action as being required b y the con- ditions. And the traditional family, as was known in America for centuries, will exist no longer. And some will be pleased. Textbooks are beginning to teach that the family un it is a relic of the past. Arthur W. Calhoun wrote a book e ntitled A 240"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 THE ATTACK ON THE FAMILY SOCIAL HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN FAMILY. It was a social service textbook utilized as a vehicle to ed ucate stu- dents that the society must assume traditional resp onsibilities assumed by the family. Mr. Calhoun wrote: \"The view is that the higher and more obligatory relation is to society rather than to the family; t he family goes back to the age of savagery while the s tate belongs to the age of civilization. The modern indi - vidual is a world citizen served by the world, and home interests can no longer be supreme. But as soon as the new family consisting only of the parents and the children stood forth, society s aw how many were unfit for parenthood and began to re- alize the need for community care. As familism of the wider sort ... weakens, society has to assume a larger parenthood. In general, society is coming more and more to accept as a duty the task of guaranteeing wholesome upbringing of the young ... the child passes more a nd more into the custody of community experts [called teachers or social workers] who are qualified to pe r- form the complexer functions of parenthood ... and which the parents have neither the time nor knowl- edge to perform.\" 579 The family unit in America is decaying, and the thi nking is that society must hire \"experts\" who are capable of the raising the children instead of the parents. So, su ddenly \"child abuse\" articles started showing up in the ne wspapers of America. When the \"experts\" say that it is time to take the children away from all of the parents, the society will accept the decision because it appears to be the proper so lution. An organization known as Friends of Earth decided t hat the solution is to \"license\" parents: \"If the less stringent curbs on procreation fail, someday perhaps childbearing will be deemed a pun- ishable crime against society unless the parents ho ld a government license. Or perhaps all potential parents will be required to use contraceptive chemicals, the governments iss u- ing antidotes to citizens chosen for childbearing.\" 580 241"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 THE ATTACK ON THE FAMILY In addition to the family causing all of this harm to child- ren, parents are also producing too many offspring. The con- tention is that the world is simply over-populated. Fortunate- ly, for the planners, the same Friends of Earth has become aware of this problem and they are offering their s olution: \"... we should set a goal of reducing population to a level that the planet's resources can sustain ind ef- initely at a decent standard of living ~ probably l ess than two billion.\" 581 When one considers that the world has approximately five billion people on it now, one can only wonder how t he Friends of Earth are going to eliminate 3 billion p eople. So far, the solutions do not include plans to simply p oison or shoot billions of people, but one can only wonder w hat the Friends of Earth will offer the world if the people do not vol- untarily solve this purported problem. The organization does not rule out the use of force to stop the \"population explosion,\" however. They continued : \"Ultimately, those policies may have to embrace coercion by governments to curb breeding.\" 582 It doesn't take much imagination to envision the si ze of a government that would have the ability to prevent e very cou- ple in the world from producing unwanted pregnancie s. Nor does it take superior intelligence to see what the next step would be should all of these \"voluntary\" metho ds fail. If the world population will not voluntarily stop prod ucing too many children, then coercive measures must be emplo yed. But, it can be assumed that the Friends of the Eart h be lieve that those 3 billion people will understand w hen they come to exterminate them. Don't forget, it is for t he good of humanity! But in the future, the parent who believes that he or she is capable of raising children will become a crimin al.

The family destroyers hav e resorted to cleverness to disguise their original intent: th ey do not want the parents to know that the destruction of th e family is their goal. So they conceal their purposes by qu ietly causing problems that create intense pressures on t he family. One of the methods utilized is that of inflation. Inflation is simply defined by a dictionary as an i ncrease in the money supply, causing prices to go up. That means that whoever controls the money supply controls the price level. Increase the money supply, and prices rise. Decrease the money supply and prices go down (called Deflati on.) Once Inflation or Deflation has been documented, the gov ernment economists point with pride at the supposed perpetr ators: the public. They never direct their attention at the re al culprit in America: the privately owned Federal Reserve system . This private banking establishment has complete con trol over the quantity of money in circulation. Therefor e, they have the ability to create Inflation or Deflation w henever they choose to do so. The rising price level without a corresponding incr ease in a family's income causes the wife in a family unit who has chosen to care for her own child at home to leave t he nurtur- ing of the children to others in order to seek gain ful employ- 243"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 THE ATTACK ON THE FAMILY ment so that she can increase the family's earnings . The parents are forced to place their children in a gov ernment run school. This enables the planners to teach the children what they want taught at an earlier age. And it pla ces the mother in a position where she sees less and less o f her children, and the children see more and more of the govern- ment trained substitute \"parents.\" The planners have been extremely successful, as the number of working mothers has been steadily increas ing. According to a report issued in 1987, more than 44 percent of women work outside the home, compared to only 32 pe rcent in 1960. Of women with children under one year of a ge, close to 50 percent are currently employed, a figure that has doubled since 1970. 584 But, what happens to the child when they are placed into day care centers? Are they better off? One group of indi- viduals who feel that they are not are the doctors inside the American Academy of Pediatrics who have reported th at the children placed in these centers are subject to all sorts of diseases caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites. They are more than 12 times as likely to catch flu viruses a nd 15 to 20 times more likely to catch other diseases than c hildren under maternal care. So the day care center has a negative impact on the health of a child placed there by a working mother. When the child gets sick, the mother must take time off from her job to care for the child, or to place the child in the ha nds of the medical fraternity. If the mother gets paid by the hour, and only gets paid when she is on the job, this frequen t sickness costs the family additional revenue. And the only t ime that the mother sees her child, other than evenings or w eekends, is when the child is sick and not feeling well. Thi s does not tend to support warm mother-child feelings. But there is another lesser known problem when the mother is not directly involved in the care of the child. Until fairly recently, the assumption that care by the mo ther was the best kind of child care went unchallenged. John Bowlby's widely acclaimed book entitled MATERNAL CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH, published in 1951, concluded that th e \"warm, intimate, and continuous\" care of the mother or permanent mother substitute was essential to the \"d evelo- pment of character and mental health.\" He called th e absence of this mother-child relationship \"maternal depriva tion\" and 244"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 THE ATTACK ON THE FAMILY said that it was likely to result in \"maladjustment of the child.\" This was the consensus view of the vast majority of psy- chologists, psychiatrists, pediatricians, and the g eneral public until the medical and professional organizations ca pitulated to the demands of the feminist movement in the 1970s. The continuing debate over Dr. Jay Belsky's recent \"here- sy\" is testimony to the power of the feminist/day c are lobby in academic and professional circles. Belsky, a pro fessor of child psychology at Pennsylvania State University, was, a decade ago, one of the influential voices that saw no harm in institutional child care. Now, he says, convincing research shows that non-maternal care for more than 20 hours per week for children under a year old is a \"risk facto r.\" Day care at that young age can impede secure parent/child re lation- ships and lead to rebellious and aggressive behavio r, or shy and withdrawn behavior in the preschool and early y ears. His views have caused him much grief, as colleagues and femi- nists have come down hard on him for his views. The y have impugned his research, his credentials, and his mot ives. 585 Even Dr. Benjamin Spock, certainly no \"conservative \" in other matters, has also resisted the push for group child care, especially before the age of three. He has taken a position that appears to be out of character for him. He has written: \"It is stressful for children to have to cope with groups, with strangers, with people outside the fam - ily.\" 586 And another \"certified Harvard liberal,\" Professor Burton White, warns parents: \"Unless you have a very good reason, I urge you not to delegate the primary child-rearing task to a ny- one else during your child's first three years of l ife.\" 587 But the debate is certain to continue. Those who wa nt to destroy the family will continue to urge mothers to leave the home and \"become fulfilled in the workplace.\" When the mother goes into the workplace to \"become fulfilled ,\" or to increase the family's income, she leaves the care o f the chil- dren to others. 245"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 THE ATTACK ON THE FAMILY Those who warn against such practices will continue to be scorned by the feminists and others who have a hidd en agenda: they want to destroy the family. Another subtle pressure against marriage was concea led inside a headline in a local newspaper that read: \" New tax laws to increase 'marriage tax' for many.\" The arti cle defined the term \"marriage tax\" as a term used to: \"describe the extra tax burden paid by a married couple when compared with the tax paid by two singl e people with the same total income.\" 588 So, those individuals smart enough to know how the tax laws work against them decide not to get married. And in some cases, the destruction of the family ha s not gone unnoticed. Newsweek magazine of January 12, 19 81, carried an article by Dr. Jonathan Kellerman, a psy chologist, and author. He wrote this: \"However, when one examines the role government has played in its relationship to the family, it is clear that not only has there been no support, on the contrary there has been a systemati c erosion of the family, perpetuated by executive, legislative and judicial branches of government. The trend of the last two decades toward more government intervention and control has carried wit h it a clear message to families: you are not compete nt to decide how to live your life — we know better.\" 589 And some in America have discovered that the psychologist was correct. An article in the Arizona Republic reported that \"Family life [was! harmed by governme nt, poll says.\" The article quoted pollster George Gallup, w ho said that: \"nearly half of those who responded to his organization's 1980 survey on the American family b e- lieve the federal government has an unfavorable in- fluence on family life.\" 590 And the government is once again using the tax laws to discriminate against families with full t ime mothers. The 246"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 THE ATTACK ON THE FAMILY present tax code favors families whose mothers ente r the work force over families with full-time mothers. Th ose par- ents who do not send the mother out into the work f orce must subsidize those who do. Secondly, the tax laws are weighted heavily against parental choice in child care. Most surveys indicat e that working parents generally prefer leaving their chil d with relatives, neighbors or friends. Current tax laws d o not recognize these forms of child care as legitimate; thus, par- ents who choose to use them do not receive an incom e-tax credit for the costs of child care. So many parents choose to have the government assist them in the costs of the ir child care by providing a tax credit and give their child ren over to the government to raise them. And lastly, current or proposed legislation concern ing child care tax credits discriminate against the man y church- related day care facilities. These laws prohibit fu nding for any child care facility \"unless all religious symbo ls and arti- facts are covered or have been removed.\" A classic example of the unrestrained use of govern ment force against a child care facility occurred in 198 4, when the State of Texas attempted to completely shut down th ree chil- dren's homes run by Pastor Lester Roloff. He, like Pastor Silevin before him, refused to allow the state to l icense his homes for the children who had been voluntarily pla ced there by their parents. The state of Texas went to court, but in 1981 a state district judge denied its request for an injunc- tion against the Pastor's homes, concluding that th e licensing procedure as applied to the church running them wou ld vio- late the constitutions of both the United States an d Texas. The federal Court of Appeals affirmed the trial cou rt's de- cision. However, the state Supreme Court rejected the churc h's contention that licensing would interfere with reli gious free- dom. The Chief Justice did not object to the qualit y of the care provided by the Roloff homes; his concern was the sim- ple fact that they would not submit to licensing. H e noted that the homes have \"a good record of high quality service,\" and that they could \"easily satisfy licensing requi rements, but had chosen not to do so.\" So the state wanted certain restrictions on the car e provi- ded children in Pastor Roloffs homes. Several of th ose restric- tions were so incredible that they show that the ma jor reason 247"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 THE ATTACK ON THE FAMILY the state went after the child care facilities was simply that they were too successful. The first of these restrictions was (not a complete list): 1. \"You should not threaten a child with the displeasure of Deity.\" In other words, you couldn't tell a child that he w as a sinner. Remember that these children had been place d in these homes because they had become disciplinary pr oblems to their parents. The parents, who had seen their c hildren become involved in prostitution, drugs and criminal activity, had turned to the Pastor for help in turning their child around. They turned to him because he was a Christi an Pas- tor, and because he had demonstrated success in hun dreds of similar cases before. These parents loved their chi ldren and wanted them to stop their criminal and anti-social behavior. They cared for them enough to voluntarily place the m in a program that had proven successful. Only a very sma ll per- centage of these children had been placed in these homes by the court system. One of the reasons the Pastor was successful was be cause he turned the children to religion. But the state t old him he could not use that as a method of correcting the ch ild. The second restriction was: 2. \"The institution shall see that each child is supplied with personal clothing suitable to the child's age and size. It shall be comparable to the clothing of other children in the community.\" The Pastor and his staff felt that much of the clot hing the children were wearing was too suggestive and improp er. So they attempted to provide the children with modest clothing less stimulating and provocative. They felt that th is restric- tion would place the children back into the clothin g that in many cases had caused them to have problems before their arrival at the Roloff homes. The third restriction was: 248"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 THE ATTACK ON THE FAMILY 3. \"Children should be encouraged to form friendships with persons outside the insti- tution.\" It would be fair to observe that such friendships w ere fre- quently what brought the children to the homes in t he first place. The fourth restriction was: 4. \"The opinions and recommendations of the children in care shall be considered in the development and evaluation of the program and activities. The procedure for this shall be documented.\" Letting the inmates run the prison sounds like an e xcel- lent idea until the prisoners suggest that the rest raining bars should be removed. Many of these children had becom e disci- pline problems mainly because they had decided that they could best run their own lives. When this determina tion had failed, the parents placed them into Pastor Roloff s homes so that they would learn some discipline. But the stat e wanted them to learn how to run their own lives again. The purpose of all of this incredible pressure on t he Roloff homes appeared to be the desire of the state to wea ken the ability of the Roloff homes to be successful with t hese trou- bled children. A secondary purpose appeared to be t he desire to weaken the family, and encourage the state to de vise methods that would remove the control of the childr en from the parents and to give them over to the state. Perhaps the role model that the family destroyers w ant to emulate is the Soviet Union, where enormous pressur es are intentionally placed upon the Russian family. Parade magazine carried an article about an America n family which had returned to Russia in 1987 after h aving lived there in the late 1960's. The wife in the mar riage has written a book about modern life in that nation, an d these are some of her observations. \"... the average young married woman in the So- viet Union ... is a prisoner of the Soviet custom a nd doctrine, which calls for a wife, without her husba nd's help, to perform the tough, rough, rugged househol d 249"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 THE ATTACK ON THE FAMILY chores — the laundry, the cleaning, the cooking, th e moving, the shopping, the child-caring — all of the se in addition to holding down her own job outside the home eight hours a day.\" 591 In Russia, work is a duty of its citizens. That obl igation has been written into their Constitution. Article 12 reads as follows: \"Work in the U.S.S.R. is a duty and a matter of honour for every able-bodied citizen, in accordance with the principle: 'He who does not work, neither shall he eat.' The principle applied in the U.S.S.R. is that of socialism: 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his work.'\" It would appear from a cursory examination of these sen- tences that work in Russia is for men only. The fir st para- graph refers to work being a male occupation: \"HE w ho does not work ...,\" and the second says: \"... according to HIS ability.\" However, the first paragraph says that \"W ork is a duty ... for every able-bodied citizen.\" Women are \"able bodied citizens\" just like men. Therefore, the Constitutio n makes it clear that this work requirement is for both sexes. Women must toil for the Russian economy as well as men. This means that married women are obligated to work as well as single women. The fact that the married wom an must work for the state obviously leaves the children fr ee to be raised by the government. And that is the desired r esult of that provision in the Constitution. And the fact that the married woman must work for t he society means that she has less time to spend with her fam- ily. The article continued with some of the obstacles th at the Russian economy puts on the wife during the typical day: \"... the Soviet woman ... rises early, not much past 6, prepares breakfast for the family, gets the children off to school, goes to her own work. Durin g lunch, it's hurry up and wait. Instead of enjoying her breather, she bolts down her food and races to the nearest store, where she waits and waits and waits to 250"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 THE ATTACK ON THE FAMILY buy whatever approximates the needs of her family. Almost always there's a shortage of meat, fruit, vegetables, soap and quality products of anything.\" The Soviet economic system, called Communism, has b een proven to be a failure by 6000 years of experience. The Com- munist system destroys the incentive to produce and the population suffers from the lack of consumption goo ds. No Communist would be bold enough to admit that it is the sys- tem that has failed. So contrived explanations are offered to explain the shortages. There is no food because a \"drought\" reduced farm y ields. \"Military equipment spending priorities\" have repla ced pro- duction quotas for consumption goods. It is certainly conceivable that those in charge wa nt the married family to suffer these pressures, so that f ew in the married population will be happy. The entire system is inten- tionally designed to be a failure, and no one would dare cor- rect it. It is clear that pressure on the family is the desi red product of Communism. The article confirmed this with this comment: \"No wonder so many Soviet men drink, sulk and accuse their wives of frigidity and indifference. N o wonder the Soviet Union is so rife with divorce.\" The married woman in Russia is obviously too tired to care for her husband, and the result becomes predic table: a rising divorce rate. And no one blames those who have intentionally crea ted an economic system that was certain to put those pr essures on the family. The planners have experienced their desired result: marriage has become the least desired relat ionship in Russia. Perhaps the entire scenario was placed into perspec tive on the side of the government \"experts\" by B. F.

And those running the society continue to destroy i t. The strategy is not new. In fact, it has been the s trategy of this conspiracy for centuries. They cause the problem. Then they solve the problem with more government. And the people are convinced that their solution is desir- able, generally because that is the only solution o ffered. And the end result is less freedom for the people. And it works nearly every time. 252"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"Chapter 30 The Right of Association One of the cornerstones of freedom is the right to nego- tiate a contract with another individual or a group of indi- viduals.

Forcing one individual into a contract that that in dividual did not freely enter into is called slavery or invo luntary ser- vitude.

One of the functions of government is to protect pe ople from contracts that were not freely entered into. T hese con- tracts are to be declared null and void, and are to have no legal force or effect. One of the basic purposes of The New World Order is to restrict the right of the individual to be free fro m the coercive force of another. These definitions of slavery and involuntary servit ude are currently being challenged by those who wish to ens lave man- kind. Examples of how slavery is becoming fashionab le are appearing in every segment of society, and courts a re making slavery the law of the land. A legal contract is defined as one in which two or more parties agree to certain terms in order to reach mu tually ac- ceptable goals. If one party is forced into any con tract against his or her will, the contract is declared to be nul l and void and therefore unenforceable. As was discussed, one of the functions of the court s of the United States is to enforce valid contracts between two con- senting individuals. Once an individual enters into a contract, the other party has the right to have the terms of the con- tract met, even if the first party decides later no t to perform as required. But, todays courts are enforcing contr acts where one party was forced into the terms of the contract . Or, in other cases, where one party did not agree to the t erms. In those cases, the courts have chosen to force that p arty to abide by the terms of a contract that they were unw illing to make. This is simply called slavery. A good case in point was a Supreme Court ruling in 1987 where they forced the Rotary Clubs, a group of men volun- tarily joined together for friendship and acts of c harity, to accept women as members. The article that reported on this ruling said: \"The Supreme Court, toppling another sex barrier, declared yesterday that state civil rights laws may force Rotary International and similar all-male pri vate clubs within the state to admit women as members. By a vote of 7-0, the justices concluded that a California anti-discrimination statute requiring wo men 254"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30 THE RIGHT OF ASSOCIATION to be admitted to Rotary clubs within the state doe s not violate the right of members to choose their ow n associates.\" 593 A review of the comments of the Supreme Court revea l exactly how words have lost their meaning, and are to mean exactly what the Court says they mean. First of all, the Court agreed that these clubs wer e \"pri- vate.\" That meant that the members were not publicl y invit- ing others into their organization. They were exerc ising their right to associate with whomever they chose to asso ciate with. These men, acting as free individuals, were c hoosing to associate in a voluntary manner with only those peo ple they wished to associate with. This is a right of free men. The Court was forcing them into a contract with peo ple that they freely chose not to associate with. After the court decision, one can only wonder what would have happe ned if the Rotary Clubs decided to disband because they wi shed to associate only with men. Would the Court have force d them to continue their meetings? And, then what would ha ve hap- pened if no one chose to attend? Would the court ha ve jailed the missing members? How would they have known whet her a person's failure to attend was the result of a le gitimate illness or because he chose not to attend? Would th e court have forced him to provide a doctor's excuse to exp lain his absence? The Court said that this use of court ordered force did not violate the \"right of members to choose their own a ssociates.\" The Court admitted that the men had this right, and then ruled that they didn't have this right. This is dou ble-talk of the highest order. Freedom does not mean that certain people are free to force other people into associations that the first have deemed advisable. Simply stated: Free men discriminate. Slaves do not. Free men have the right to \"choose their own associ ates.\" Slaves do not. 255"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30 THE RIGHT OF ASSOCIATION Therefore, when the Court ruled that the Rotary Clu bs had not chosen correctly, and forced them to associ ate with individuals that they had freely chosen not to asso ciate with, the men in the Clubs were no longer free to \"choose their own associates.\" The Court has decided that slavery was preferable t o freedom. In another flagrant violation of a free man's right of association, the U.S. Justice Department filed suit against a Christian conference center, claiming that it viola ted federal civil rights laws when it prohibited the Mormons fr om using the facilities to espouse their own teachings. If one individual has the right to associate with w homever that individual chooses to associate with, a group of indi- viduals also have that right. In this case, the discrimination charges were levie d by a Mormon group that was denied permission to rent the facili- ties to hold their own conference and teach Mormon religious beliefs. The director of the center stated that he had turned them down because the Mormon view of Christianity d iffered markedly from the beliefs of the owners of the cent er. Should a court determine that the Inn is a \"public accommo dation\" on the basis of offering meals and overnight lodgin g, the de- cision could signal increased governmental control over other religious conference facilities, or, for that matte r, any \"public\" facility. Should a hotel be allowed to refuse the rental of a room to a group advocating the violent overthrow of the govern- ment? Should a hotel be allowed to not rent to a group ad vo- cating violent animal sacrifice if they determine t hat when the group asks for facilities for the purpose of co nducting their religious rites? Just where does the right of one group to practice their religion end, and where does the right of the hotel to rent to anyone they choose to begin? In another case, the Minnesota Court of Appeals als o ruled against the right of free association. In 198 6, they upheld a $300-a-day fine levied against a chain of health clubs for failing to bring a halt to employment pra ctices in- volving religious discrimination. The owners of the health clubs argued that they could not comply with the or der to cease discrimination against non-Christians because they felt 256"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30 THE RIGHT OF ASSOCIATION that they had the right to employ only those who ag reed with their religious views. In other words, they believe d that they had the right to employ only fellow Christians if t hey had freely chosen to do so. 594 The court ruled that they were wrong. And even an organization as \"all-American\" as the B oy Scouts of America does not have the right to freely chose their associates. In 1983, the 2nd District Court o f Appeals decided that the Boy Scouts did not have the right to refuse membership to those young people who were homosexua l. 595 It is not a stretch of this \"logic\" to imagine that the courts will soon decide that a church does not have the right to reject the application for church membership of an ad- mitted \"atheist.\" This would be \"religious discrimi nation.\" But, to further confound the problem, it appears th at this nation's courts do not have a clear and definite po licy about discrimination. In 1987, a state court of appeals ruled that boys c ould be barred from playing on girls' high school teams to prevent them from dominating the game and displacing the gi rls. 596 So, the result of these and similar decisions is to clearly say to the world: you will discriminate when ordered to do so, but you may not freely choose to discriminate. The courts have now made it mandatory that you can \"freely associate\" only with whomever they decide t hat you can \"freely associate with.\" And if you do not choose to \"freely associate\" with someone, they wish you to \"freely associate\" with, the courts will force you to \"freely associate\" with that pers on. That is simply called court ordered slavery. Obviously, \"slavery\" is no longer \"slavery.\" And \"freedom\" is no longer \"freedom.\" Furthermore, if the above cited examples were not enough, even certain Senators in the United States Senate have admitted that they no longer know what the two words mean. In April of 1989, Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, introduced Senate Bill 781, a bill called the National Service Act of 1989. This bill calls for the Admini stration to 257"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30 THE RIGHT OF ASSOCIATION \"develop a comprehensive, mandatory national service pro- gram.\" The Senator offered the curious public a brief expl anation of his bill in a news release dated April 13, 1989. In it, he explained that: \"This legislation will establish a program leading to a comprehensive, fair and mandatory system of community or military service to the nation.\" 597 The bill stipulates: \"... that both men and women between 16 and 26 would be required to serve either in the community of in the military. They would serve 24 hours a month and two weeks during the year for two to four years.\" 598 The Senator's news release stated that this bill wo uld be \"fair.\" Somehow, forcing someone to serve the natio n is now deemed to be \"fair.\" Slavery used to be defined as forcing one individua l to serve another. Slavery used to be called \"madness.\" Now it is being called \"fair.\" But that is what the Senator says in his news relea se. The news release further explained why the Senator had chosen to introduce the bill: \"This program will allow us to combine the re- sponsibilities of citizenship with a concerted effo rt that addresses vital community and national defense need s that, otherwise, will be unmet in the years ahead.\" So \"mandatory service\" to the government has now be - come a \"responsibility of citizenship.\" Man was created to be free! Man was not created to be a slave of government! In fact, government was created by men to be the se rvant of mankind! Man was not to be the servant of government! America used to be called \"the land of the free and the home of the brave.\" 258"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30 THE RIGHT OF ASSOCIATION Now, one will be mandatorily obligated to serve the na- tion. That is the new \"requirement of citizenship.\" Freedom is not mandatory service! To show that there is bi-partisan support of this c oncept of \"fairness,\" Arizona's other Senator, Dennis DeCo ncini, a Democrat, also publicly announced his support of th e idea. Senator McCain had a somewhat revealing experience be- fore he ran for this office. He was a pilot in the so-called Vietnamese \"war\" and was taken captive by the North Viet- namese after his airplane was shot down. He spent s everal years in a Vietnamese prisoner of war camp, prior t o being released after the end of the \"war.\" The Senator was not \"free\" to leave the prisoner of war camp. He was a \"slave\" of the Vietnamese. He was th ere \"in- voluntarily.\" He had to do as he was told. One can only presume that if anyone should understa nd the words \"slavery,\" \"involuntary\" and \"mandatory,\" it should be the Senator. But, for some reason, he does not. And, ap- parently, neither does Senator DeConcini. It is ironic that both of these men had taken the s ame oath when they became Senators. That oath reads: \"I do hereby swear or affirm that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I w ill bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will take this obligation freely without any mental rese rva- tion or purpose of evasion; and that I will well an d faithfully discharge the duties of the office on wh ich I am about to enter, so help me God.\" These two Senators took an oath to defend the Const itu- tion of the United States when they became Senators . If either had taken the time to read the document in i ts en- tirety, they would have read the 13th Amendment whi ch was passed after the Civil War of 1861-1865. There are some historians who claim that that war was fought to en d slavery. That amendment reads: \"Neither slavery not involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the Un ited States.\" 259"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30 THE RIGHT OF ASSOCIATION If Senator McCain's bill makes all of America's you ng peo- ple \"slaves\" of the government, or requires \"involu ntary servi- tude,\" and the only \"slavery\" or \"involuntary servi tude\" that is legal is as a \"punishment for a crime,\" it follo ws that citizenship in America must be termed a \"crime,\" th e punish- ment for which is \"involuntary servitude.\" So \"slavery\" becomes \"freedom,\" and \"freedom\" becom es \"slavery,\" in the convoluted thinking of these two Senators. \"Involuntary servitude\" becomes \"fair.\" \"Mandatory service\" becomes a \"responsibility of citizenship.\" America's founding fathers had no such problem with un- derstanding the difference between the two words \"f reedom\" and \"slavery.\" They wrote this in the Declaration o f Indepen- dence: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by the ir creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happines s.\" A \"self-evident truth\" is one that is not debatable . It is true simply because it is true. No one can say that a \"self- evident truth\" is false, because man's mind tells h im that it is true. Man cannot debate whether these rights bel ong to mankind, because they are not debatable. These rights were deemed to be \"inalienable\" by tho se who wrote the Declaration. That word is defined as: \"that which may not be taken away or trans- ferred.\" The Declaration went on to say that \"liberty\" was o ne of those inalienable, self-evident rights. The word \"liberty\" is defined in a dictionary as: \"freedom or release from slavery, imprisonment, captivity, or any other form of arbitrary control.\" Liberty is freedom. Freedom from government.

The decla- ration proclaimed: \"... scientific and atheistic propaganda is an inte - gral part of the Communist education of the working people, and has as its aim the dissemination of sci en- tific, materialist knowledge among the masses and liberation of believers from the influence of relig ious prejudices.\" 604 But even more recently, Victor Mikronenko, the curr ent head of the Young Communist League, called Komsomol , was interviewed by New York Times reporter Bill Keller in Feb- ruary, 1988. Mr. Keller reported that Mikronenko: \"said he sees no reason to change the policy banning believers [in God] from Komsomol. Atheist education is one of the primary tasks of the youth organization.'\" 605 The Communists see education as a vehicle to re-edu cate young children away from religion and a belief in G od. Similar attempts have occurred and are occurring in America. The Masons have lent their support to public educat ion. Henry C. Clausen, 33rd degree Mason, and the Sovere ign Grand Commander for the Scottish Rite of Freemasonr y until a short time ago, wrote a little pamphlet entitled DEVILISH DANGER. In this he makes the case for Masonic suppo rt of public education. He wrote: \"So, we [presumably he spoke for all Masonry] say again: Hands off our public schools! Keep churc h/ state forever separated! Stay American!\" 606 The Supreme Commander of the Masons said he was concerned that the Supreme Court in 1983 had grante d per- mission for the state of Minnesota to allow a tax d eduction for undercollegiate private/church school tuition. He felt concern, apparently, that the private school parent s were getting a religious exemption over those who were n ot reli- 264"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 31 THE ATTACK ON EDUCATION gious. As far as could be seen in his pamphlet, he expressed no concern about why Christian parents, who wished to pay for a private education for their children in a pri vate school, should be forced to pay for two educations, one of which the parents never utilized. The issue involved the reasoning behind the require ment that parents who provide an alternative education f or their children have to pay for two educations: the one th ey use, and the one they don't use. The issue is not about religion: it is about freedom! But Mr. Clausen did not see it that way. He apparently wants all children taught what the go v- ernment wants taught in government schools. And secondly, Mr. Clausen apparently did not recogn ize the fact that \"non-religious\" people have the same God-given right to take their children out of government scho ols and teach them at home as do \"religious\" people. The Mason also did not answer the question posed by Sam Blumenfeld, an author of great merit who writes on the subject of education. He posed this question in his book en- titled NEA: TROJAN HORSE IN AMERICA: \"If the [states] can forbid the slightest hint of religion in its public schools on the grounds that it violates the separation of church and state, how ca n it then justify its massive intrusion into the life of a church school?\" 607 This is a legitimate question and one that the Huma n- ists/Illuminati/Communists/New Agers appear to be u nwilling to answer. And Mr. Blumenfield makes this observation as well: \"... the government does not have the right to compose a prayer for use in its own schools, but in Nebraska and elsewhere it claims the right to regu- late the curriculum of a church school that doesn't even want government support and would be denied it even if it wanted it on the grounds that such support would violate the establishment clause [meaning the First Amendment prohibiting the \"es- tablishment of a religion.\"] 608 265"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 31 THE ATTACK ON EDUCATION The Humanists added their support for public educat ion with this, the 11th Principle in the HUMANIST MANIF ESTO II: \"We believe in the right to universal education.\" 609 Some have told the world why they want the state to educate the children. Ashley Montague wrote this: \"Every child in America comes to school 'insane' at the age of six because of the American family struc - ture.\" 610 Others who saw the problem of children being brough t up with what they consider to be the poisonous attitud es of re- ligious parents was the National Training Laborator ies, a pro- gram run by the National Education Association, the national teacher's union. They wrote: \"Although they [the children of religious parents] appear to behave appropriately and seem normal by most cultural standards, they may actually be in ne ed of mental health care, in order to help them change , adapt, and conform to the planned society in which there will be no conflict of attitudes or beliefs.\" 611 The humanists apparently see it as a problem when t he parents control what their children are taught. The parents have complete control of their children for at leas t the first five or six years of their lives. Then the state be gins the educational process when the child is placed into e ither kin- dergarten or the first grade. One of the major concerns of the humanists is that the parents might instill some religious values in thei r child before the public school begins their formal traini ng program. One who voiced that opinion was Paul Blanchard who said this in 1976: \"I think that the most important factor moving us toward a secular [meaning worldly] society has been the educational factor.

This is part of what he wrote: \"I am convinced that the battle for humankind's future must be waged and won in the public school classrooms by teachers who correctly perceive their role as the new proselytizers of a new faith: a re- ligion of humanity that recognizes and respects the spark of what theologians call divinity in every hu - man being. [There is that thought again that man is god.] These teachers must embody the same selfless dedication as the most rabid fundamentalist preach- ers.

Counts of Columbia University. He wrote that he saw the need to change the purpose of educa tion in a 1932 monograph entitled DARE THE SCHOOLS BUILD A NEW SOCIAL ORDER? He made his views very clear as t o what he thought the purpose of education was with t hese comments: \"Ignorance must be replaced by knowledge, com- petition by cooperation, trust in Providence [meani ng a belief in God] by careful planning, and private c ap- italism by some form of socialized economy ....\" 614 267"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 31 THE ATTACK ON EDUCATION With all of this discussion about what education sh ould or should not be, one would think that all of the d ialogue has caused education to become a science of precise def inition. By now, the purposes of education should have been car efully thought out, so that there should be no further deb ate as to what it is. However, such is not the case. In 1979, a newsletter called EDUCATION USA reported that at least one judge stated that no one knew wha t education was. That rather revealing conclusion was offered by a judge in a court case involving a mother who s ued the San Francisco Unified School District in 1976 becau se her son, who was a high school graduate, could not read or write. She sought damages for remedial education and the w ages her son would be unable to earn because of his lack of educational skills. The judge disagreed, according to the newsletter, saying: \"Schools have no legal duty to educate. If there is no legal duty to educate, there can be no malpra c- tice where education fails.\" 615 The judge in the district court that heard the case reported that \"schools have no legal duty to educat e,\" because the purpose of education was not known. Not even th e edu- cators know what they are to do with the children f orcibly brought to their schools. The judge in the appeals court explained: \"The science of pedagogy [defined as the art or science of teaching] itself is fraught with differe nt and conflicting theories ....\" As a result, he said, there is no way to assess the school's negligence when they do not educate any ch ild. So the courts do not know what the purpose of educa tion is. But some of the educators know. It is to make certa in that the child in the government schools no longer believes in what his parents have taught him. They certainly kn ow that the purpose of education is to remove all religious values taught by parents. That is what they are clearly sa ying! 268"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 31 THE ATTACK ON EDUCATION Some in America do know why they want the children in the government schools. The judge was wrong. Some k now, and some want the parents to send them their childr en. But the child still does not learn the three essent ials of a good education: what used to be called the \"3 R's: reading, 'ri- ting and 'rithmetic.\" The pablum offered all of the children, and the holding back of the bright child to teach t he slow child, has caused a nation of anxious, dull student s. The sight of children in school unable to learn has caused medical doctors and psychologists to create a whole new field of childhood diseases called either Atten tion Deficit Disorder or Minimal Brain Disfunction. Children are now termed to have Learning Disorders. Children are now called Learning Disabled. The \"bible\" of the psychiatric industry, known as t he Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorde rs, gives the symptoms of this new disease: (only a partial l ist): A. Inattention: At least three of the following: exhibiting activity like: often failing to finish things he or she starts; often doesn't seem to listen; easily distracted; has difficulty con- centrating on schoolwork or other tasks re- quiring sustained attention; etc. B. Impulsivity: At last three of the following: exhibiting behavior like: often acts before thinking; shifts excessively from one activity to another; etc. C. Hyperactivity: At least two of the following: exhibiting behavior like: running about or climbing on things excessively; has difficulty staying still or fidgets excessively; etc. And quite often after the child has been diagnosed as having this disorder, he or she will be given Rital in, a drug that is supposed to cause normal behavior. The drug also has another name: people on the streets call the drug \" speed.\" But the drug has negative reactions: it can cause nervousness, insomnia, skin rashes, dermatitis, nau sea, dizzi- ness, headaches, drowsiness, blood pressure and pul se changes, fast heart beat, and weight loss. But the drug is still being prescribed. 269"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 31 THE ATTACK ON EDUCATION Because of all of these concerns, parents all over the United States are withdrawing their children from t he public schools and either teaching them at home or placing them in private or Christian schools that teach religious v alues. And all of this activity has not gone unnoticed by the Humanists/ New Agers/Communists. Two researchers wrote a report in the February, 198 0 PHI DELTA KAPPAN about this new challenge to the go v- ernment school system. They concluded that the tren d of re- moval will continue, and perhaps accelerate: \"as fundamentalists remain locked into rigid, theologically based positions on many issues while American society moves forward.\" They say that the fundamentalists have a right to: \"march resolutely toward the values of their past, but one may question whether they should take a growing percentage of America's youth there with them.\" 616 Obviously, declining public school attendance figur es have caused some government school officials to become c oncerned, because the placing of children in a private school removes them from the indoctrination of the public school s ystem. So, many states have taken steps to close many of these schools down. One glaring example of the misuse of the power of t he state government occurred on January 14, 1986, when thirty state and local government officials, including nea rly a dozen uniformed and plain-clothes officers surrounded the church and school of the Santa Monica Foursquare Church in South- ern California. What had provoked this show of force? Were the teac hers beating the children? Were they forcing them to tak e drugs? Were they teaching the children that cannibalism wa s a mor- al option? No, the school was operating without a state issued li- cense.

He said: \"Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are ind ispen- sable supports ....

There are nations in the world today that have move d away from the religious concept of a Creator and th ose na- tions live under a totalitarian form of government. One such nation is the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the USSR. Article 124 of their constitution plainly states th at move away from God: \"In order to ensure to citizens freedom, of con- science, the church in the U.S.S.R. is separated fr om the state, and the school from the church.\" That provision in the Russian constitution is an ex act ex- pression of the philosophy of the New Agers/Communi sts/ Masons/Humanists, who are working for the same goal s as the Russians Communists. In addition, Russian law a dds some interesting restrictions on the religious righ ts of its citizens: \"Religious associations must be registered with Government authorities ....\" This is the reason that private school administrato rs and fundamentalist preachers in America have objected t o licens- ing their private schools. Communist nations register their churches. Communist nations control their churches through re gis- tration. Free nations do not. America is trying to register its churches. The result will be the same. Other Russian laws say: \"Religious associations may not ... give material help to their members; organize for children, young people and women special prayer or other meetings, circles, groups, departments, for Biblical or liter ary study, sewing, working or the teaching of religion .... Surveillance over the activities of religious associations ... shall be exercised by the registra tion agencies.\" 273"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 32 RUSSIAN LAWS It is almost as if the New Agers/Humanists/Commu- nists/Masons had written the Russian Constitution and its supporting laws. Th net result of the Russian Constitution and simil ar laws is that there is no religious freedom. The Gul ags, the Russian concentration camps, house about 6 million prisoners. It has been estimated that one half of those prison ers, over-3 million people, are there simply because they dared to wor- ship a God in a nation that says it is illegal to w orship. So religion in America must be destroyed, just as i t has been in Russia. The Russians have put their concern s in their writings, just as others in America have done so. The Program of the Communist International, adopted at the Sixth World Congress in 1928, states: \"One of the most important tasks of the cultural revolution affecting the wide masses is the task of systematically and unswervingly combatting religion -- the opium of the people. The proletarian government must withdraw all state support from the church, which is the agency of the former ruling class; it must prevent all church interference in state-organized educational affairs and ruthlessly suppress the counter-revolutionary activ ity of the ecclesiastical organizations. Lunarcharsky, the Russian Commissioner of Edu cation, phrased it as clearly as possible when he said: \"We hate Christians and Christianity. Even the best of them must be considered our worst enemies. Christian love is an obstacle to the development of the revolution. Down with love of one's neighbor! What we want is HATE .... Only then can we conquer the universe. Karl Marx repeated the same thought. Religion had t o be destroyed: \"Religion is the sign of the oppressed creature, th e sentiment of a heartless world, as it is the spirit of spiritless conditions. It is the opium of the peopl e.\" 621 274"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 32 RUSSIAN LAWS And the Communists have attempted to do exactly tha t in Russia. Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the Russian disside nt now living in America, wrote this as a warning to the A merican people: \"In my country the communist powers took military steps against the Christian faith. Millions of peasants were slaughtered in order to eradicate faith from the very roots of the people. Millions of hours of propaganda time were used in order to burn the faith from the hearts of the chil dren. Despite this, communism has not destroyed the Christian faith. Christianity went through a period of decline, but it is now growing. The political atheist literature maintains that Marxism continues what Christianity began, that it makes possible what Christianity failed to achieve. But this [is a] sleight of hand. Socialism [meaning Communism in Russia] is, in fact, absolutely opposed to Christianity.\" 622 One of the major tenets of basic Christianity is th at each man has but one life, and that upon his death his s pirit does not return to earth in the body of another individu al. The New Agers believe in reincarnation. This view holds the oppo- site position: that the spirit of an individual com es back to earth in another body after death. Therefore, if it is deemed necessary that a Christian must die because Communi sm must succeed, those who share the belief in reincar nation have no problem with making certain that the Christ ian dies. And the reason for that is because it is their beli ef that his, or her, spirit will return and inhabit the body of another in- dividual. This is why the Communists can slaughter millions of innocent people and show absolutely no remorse. Constance Cumbey, a researcher into the New Age rel i- gion, has explained their views on reincarnation wi th these words: \"The movement teaches the Law of Rebirth or re- incarnation. This is basically a teaching that man does not really die, but that he instead is endlessly re born into new life cycles until such time as he perfects 275"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 32 RUSSIAN LAWS himself sufficiently to qualify for endless res t (Nir- vana.)\" 623 Another departure from the traditional Christian te aching in America is the theory of Evolution. This non-sci entific \"science\" holds that man is nothing more than a hig her form of animal, that he has evolved from a simple one ce lled or- ganism. The New Agers have carried the theory of evolution one step further. They believe that certain men have \"e volved\" to a higher form of mankind. This evolutionary super-s pecies is one step above the rest of mankind. \"... the New Agers claim they are a 'new species.' They have 'evolved' into 'Homo Noeticus' [the remai n- der of the human species are Homo Sapiens.] They have 'evolved' by employing mind-expansion techniques such as meditation and the 'other tech- niques.'\" 624 So, those who have utilized \"mind expansion techniq ues\" are better off than the rest of mankind. \"Smarte r\" means \"better.\" One who has written about the differences between C hris- tianity and this new thought is the Masonic writer Manly P. Hall. He wrote an explanation of the differences be tween these opposing religious views: \"The Christian theory of redemption is unique in that it emphasizes salvation as attainable in spite of vice rather than because of virtue; in fact, the pr ime saving virtue for the Christian is acceptance of th e di- vinity of Jesus Christ. That a viewpoint so philosophically unsound could have gained so firm a foothood in the number and power of its adherents is more than passing strange . Like all external things, it will finally pass away and be remembered only for that which it contribute d to the inner realization of its devotees.\" 625 The Humanists have also stated that they believe th at re- ligion as an institution will pass away. The prefac e to the HUMANIST MANIFESTO II states that position: 276"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 32 RUSSIAN LAWS \"As in 1933, humanists still believe that tradi- tional theism, especially faith in the prayer-heari ng God, assumed to love and care for persons and under - stand their prayers, and to be able to do something about them, is an unproved and outmoded faith.\" 626 And this is the reason they believe that: \"We find insufficient evidence for belief in the ex - istence of a supernatural ....\" 627 Since there is no God, man does not have to believe in re- ligion anymore. In fact, \"We are convinced that the time has passed for theism....\" 628 And to show that those who wish religion to perish are in control of the situation, one has only to look at s ome of the events occurring in contemporary America. The attac k on re- ligion in the United States has already started. In fact, ministers are being attacked just as they were in early America. For instance, one of the earliest attacks on religi on in America occurred in 1771. Three Baptist ministers, all from the same church in Ruther Glen, Virginia, were arre sted and imprisoned for preaching without a government licen se. Through the able defense of Patrick Henry, the mini sters were acquitted, establishing for other ministers th eir right to preach and conduct church ministries free of govern mental interference. Yet, almost 200 years later, this same church was f ined $250 a day for once again refusing to obtain a lice nse from the state, this time for failure to obtain a licens e to operate its educational ministries. An organization formed to fight such cases for the cause of religious freedom is the Coalition for Religious Freedom, located in Washington D.C. They reported in 1987 th at: \"the last 15 years have seen more religious freedom cases than any time since the American Revo - lution.\" 629 277"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 32 RUSSIAN LAWS The battle lines are being drawn.

Man must be free to acquire and then be al lowed to possess property, the sustenance necessary to maint ain his right to life. Benjamin Disraeli, the Prime Minister of England be - tween 1874 and 1880, reported that the secret socie ties wanted to destroy the right to own private property in the form of land. He wrote: \"They do not want constitutional government ... they want to change the tenure of the land, to driv e out the present owners of the soil and to put an en d to ecclesiastical [meaning religious] establishment s.\" 630 Mr. Disraeli implied, quite correctly, that it was the re- ligious establishments that taught that man had the right to 279"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 33 THE ATTACK ON PROPERTY private property. It is the church that teaches sup port for this human right by teaching that one individual ha s no right to steal from another individual. This teaching is found in both the Old and New Test a- ments of the Holy Bible. The Commandment \"Thou shalt not steal\" is found in Exodus 20:15 in the Old Testament, and in Matthew 1 9:18 in the New. In fact, in the New Testament, it is a dir ect com- mandment of Jesus himself. That means that no man has the right to take the pr op- erty of another. The secret societies that the Prim e Minister was referring to want to \"change the tenure,\" meani ng the ownership, \"of the soil.\" This means that they want to abolish private property. So it is the church that stands in the way of those who wish to abolish the right to private property. And it is the church that must be destroyed to elim inate mankind's right to private property. The Illuminati also saw the connection between the churches and the Biblical teaching. Adam Weishaupt wrote: \"The baneful [meaning one causing of distress ] influence of accumulated property was declared an i n- surmountable obstacle to the happiness of any natio n whose chief laws were framed for its protection and increase.\" 631 Karl Marx, the Communist, echoed the concept that c er- tain individuals did not possess the right to own p rivate prop- erty. He wrote: \"The emancipation of labor demands ... an equi- table distribution of the proceeds of labor.\" 632 Marx envisioned a government large enough to divide the property accumulated after labor. He wrote this: \"From each according to his abilities, t o each according to his needs.\" 633 Those who have the ability to produce must have the ir property taken away and given to those who have the need for that property. 280"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 33 THE ATTACK ON PROPERTY He then continued: \"... the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private pro p- erty.\" 634 And the Humanists want to participate in the debate about the right to own private property. They also do not be- lieve that man has the right to own and possess pro perty. They have verbalized it in the Fourteenth Principle in the HUMANIST MANIFESTO II \"The humanists are firmly convinced that existing acquisitive and profit motivated society has shown it- self to be inadequate and that a radical change in methods, controls and motives must be instituted. A socialized and cooperative order must be estab- lished to the end that the equitable distribution o f the means of life be possible.\" 635 A \"socialized and cooperative order\" would be one w here the government takes from those who have the abilit y and gives it to those who have the need. That is precis ely what Karl Marx advocated. So those who wish to abolish private property have in- cluded it in their religion. In America, the attack on private property is very subtle: those who wish to destroy man's right to possess pr operty do not directly identify that as their goal. They conc eal their purposes behind other issues, but the end result is the same. The right to private property is slowly being erode d. Perhaps the main weapon utilized in the battle is t he government's power to tax. As taxes increase, the p ublic has less and less ability to purchase property. Another method that the attackers use to destroy pr ivate property is inflation. This tool takes an ever incr easing per- centage of the earnings of the working class. Infla tion, as has already been discussed in this study, is defined as an in- crease in the money supply, resulting in a rise in the price level. A deflation is caused by a decrease in the m oney sup- ply, causing prices to drop. Therefore, the busines s cycle is caused by those who control the money supply. And t he pur- pose of the business cycle is to take property from some and 281"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 33 THE ATTACK ON PROPERTY to give it to others. Those who know what course th e money supply is going to take are certainly able to take advantage of their prior knowledge and can make exorbitant profits. So inflation is a method of depriving some people o f their private property without their knowledge. That means that those who cause inflation can also pre- vent it. The controller of the money supply in the United States is the privately owned Federal Reserve, [cal led by this author the Private Reserve] and their purpose is to use their ability to cause business cycles through inflation and deflation to destroy the right of the people to own private p roperty. But, few in America understand that that is their p urpose. So the plunder continues. And the God-given, inalienable, \"self-evident\" righ t to priv- ate property continues to be slowly eroded. Just like Karl Marx and the Humanists want. 282"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"Chapter 34 The Attack on Nationalism One of the things that Lucifer did when he fell, ac cording to the Bible, was to \"weaken the nations.\" The concept of national boundaries is one created b y the creator God. The Bible says this in Acts 17:24, 26: \"God that made the world and all things therein ... [and] hath determined ... the bounds of their h abita- tion.\" So, if the designer of national boundaries was God him- self, it would follow that those who are out to det hrone the Creator would be anxious to abolish the nations of the world. And this is precisely what they are doing. Professor John Robison, the exposer of the Illumina ti, wrote that inside that secret society: 283"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 34 THE ATTACK ON NATIONALISM \"... patriotism and loyalty were called narrow- minded prejudices ....\" 636 And the reason that they were so considered was bec ause the founder, Adam Weishaupt, himself believed in th e de- struction of the nation. He wrote: \"With the origins of nations and peoples the worlds ceased to be a great family, a single kingdom .... Nationalism took the place of human love ....\" 637 And he proposed a solution: \"Diminish patriotism, then men will learn to know each other again as such ... [and] the bond of union will widen out. Nations shall vanish from the earth.\" 638 About seventy years later, the Communists were quic k to join those who desired the destruction of national boundaries. Karl Marx wrote in THE COMMUNIST MANIFESTO: \"The Communists are further reproached with de- siring to abolish countries and nationalities.\" 639 And the Humanists have also joined the chorus. They , too, have added their voice in the move to destroy nation- alism. The Twelfth Principle of the HUMANIST MANIFE STO II reads as follows: \"We deplore the division of humankind on nation- alistic grounds. ... the best option is to transcend the limits of national sovereignty and to move toward the buildin g of a world community in which all sectors of the hu - man family can participate. Thus we look to the development of a system of world law and a world order based upon transnationa l federal government.\" 640 Manly P. Hall, wrote that he shared the concerns of Marx and Weishaupt, and expressed the hope that someday soon national borders would be abolished. He wrote: 284"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 34 THE ATTACK ON NATIONALISM \"... the existence of contiguous states or nations has been the excuse for their exploitation.\" 641 \"Patriotism is merely an accentuated egotism which embraces the members of the tribe or nation t o which the egotist himself belongs. Long regarded as a virtue, patriotism will yet demonstrate itself to be a most pernicious attitude .\" 642 Someone more contemporary has also written about th e need to eliminate national borders. Zbigniew Brzezi nski, Pres- ident Jimmy Carter's National Security Advisor, wro te this in his book entitled BETWEEN TWO AGES in a chapter ent i- tled \"International Prospects:\" \"... the fiction of [national] sovereignty ... is c lear- ly no longer compatible with reality.\" 643 And Mr. Hall tells his readers that the future of t he nation-state is bleak. The day is coming when they will be an obsolete remnant of the past. He wrote: \"... we are approaching a nobler era when nations shall be no more; when the whole earth shall be und er one order, one government, one administrative body. \" 644 So, the ultimate purpose of all of this attack on n ational- ism is to tear down national borders so that they c an be re- placed with a borderless world, a one world governm ent. The New Agers/Humanists/Communists/Masons want a one world government. They are confident that their goal will be achieved soon because they are creating the cond itions that will persuade the people that they should adop t the world government when it is offered. The family unit; the right to own private property; the na- tional borders; the right to believe in a creator G od; these be- liefs will all be destroyed because the world must receive a world government supported by the planners inside t he secret societies and the new religious groups. The enemy has been identified. It is not the church es, the family, nationalism or patriotism, or the right to worship a God. It is simply the belief in Lucifer. 285"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 34 THE ATTACK ON NATIONALISM Lucifer, the god of the New World Order, the New Ag e, some of the Communists and some of the Masons, want s to bring the world a one world religion, based upon a belief in man, and the unbridled power of man's mind and reas on.

A transcript of that speech has been printed in the New York Times and a perusal of those words is very rev ealing. The President spoke about George Bush, his Vice Pre sident, and the individual who was seeking the Presidential nomina- tion of the Republican Party. The President said: \"With George Bush, I'll know, as we approach the new millennium ....\" 646 The President did not explain what he meant by the phrase \"the new millennium,\" (a millennium is a tho usand year period) but one can get a clue by reviewing hi s use of two other phrases in that speech. He ended that par agraph with these words: \"With George Bush ... we'll have a ... nation confi - dently willing to take its leadership into the unch arted reaches of a new age.\" 647 Here he actually used the phrase \"a new age.\" But perhaps the President actually explain ed what he meant by these phrases when he ended his speech wit h these words: \"That's a new day - our sunlit new day --.\" 648 The President chose to refer to the \"new day\" as be ing a \"sunlit\" new day. As has been illustrated, the Maso ns know that the sun has been a symbol of Lucifer for 6000 years. Did the President know that when he referred to the new day as being \"sunlit?\" 291"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 36 REAGAN AND BUSH One can only wonder what he meant by the use of the se words, since he did not explain them. But it is cer tain that he used them. It should be expected that he knew wh at he was saying when he gave that speech. And it is impr obable that some clever speech writer had him say these wo rds with- out his knowledge or approval. It is also improbabl e that he read them without a realization of what he was sayi ng. The only conclusion that is fair is that he had to know . Three nights later, on Thursday night, Vice Preside nt George Bush accepted the Republican nomination for the Presidency of the United States. He also spoke to t he conven- tion and the American people on national television . His speech has also been recorded in the New York Times , and a perusal of that speech reveals that he too used som e rather cryptic language. During that speech, the Vice-President spoke about the thousands and tens of thousands of volunteer organi zations in America. He said that they constituted the true mea ning of a \"community.\" He contrasted that understanding with that of the \"liberals,\" whom he said had a rather narrow de finition. His exact words were: \"And there is another tradition. And that is the idea of community - a beautiful word with a big meaning, though liberal Democrats have an odd view of it. They see 'community' as a limited cluster of interest groups, locked in odd conformity. In this view, the country waits passive while Washington sets the rules. But that is not what community means, not to me. For we are a nation of communities, of thousand s and tens of thousands of ethnic, religious, social, bus- iness, labor union, neighborhood, regional organiza - tions, all of them varied, voluntary and unique. This is America [and then the Vice President named a group of volunteer organizations, like the Disabled American Veterans.]\" And then he ended that paragraph with this state ment: \"... a brilliant diversity spread like stars, like a thou- sand points of light, in a broad and peaceful sky.\" 649 292"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 36 REAGAN AND BUSH The President was referring to a large number of vo lun- teer organizations (he referred to them by the unsp ecified numbers \"thousands and tens of thousands.\" That mea nt that he didn't know how many there were.) He later refer red to these organizations, so numerous that he admitted t hat he didn't know the exact number of them, by the precis e number of. \"a thousand,\" The only explanation that makes s ense is that he was referring to something else when he use d the phrase \"a thousand points of light.\" Notice that he also referred to these organizations as if they were \"light\" in a broad and peaceful sky. As has been illustrated, \"light\" has been regarded as the \"truth\" from the sun-god Lucifer for six thousand y ears. The number \"[a] thousand\" is the precise number of year s that the millennium is predicted to last under the leade rship of Lord Maitreya. Was George Bush referring to the thousand years of the millennium led by Lord Maitreya? One can only wonder. George Bush continues to expla in that he was referring to \"thousands and tens of tho usands\" of volunteer organizations. And it is extremely unlikely that he will confirm t hese interpretations, if he is referring to the thousand year reign of Lord Maitreya, because he obviously would not wa nt the American people to know. However, he referred to that phrase again at the en d of his speech. He said: \"I will keep America moving forward, always for- ward — for a better America, for an endless, enduri ng dream and a thousand points of light. That is my mission. And I will complete it.\" 650 George Bush used that phrase repeatedly during his debates with the Democrat nominee Michael Dukakis. He re- ferred to it again during his campaign across the U nited States. And he used it again in his inaugural addre ss after he was sworn in as President of the United States i n 1989. But there are other clues. On March 16, 1989, a radio station played a part of a speech the President delivered somewhere in the Uni ted States. The President said: 293"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 36 REAGAN AND BUSH \"What are we doing to prepare ourselves for the new world coming just 11 short years from now?\" Here the President linked the \"new world\" coming in the year 2000, just \"eleven short years from now\" to hi s previous comments. He was saying that he was aware that the New World Order was on its way, and would be here in el even years. 1989 plus eleven is the year 2000. But the final piece of the puzzle was an article th at ap- peared in the Arizona Daily Star on January 3, 1989 . The headline written by the Associated Press read: \"Millennium group expects Bush at '99 Egypt bash\" The article reported that: \"President-elect Bush is spending this New Year's holiday at Camp David, Maryland, but in 10 years he may be in Egypt. Organizers of the Millennium Society say he's already committed to ushering in the next century a t the Great Pyramids of Cheops in Giza.\" The article then reported that Mr. Bush had sent th e society a telegram that they quoted: '\"Barbara [Mr. Bush's wife] and I wish you the best of luck in the next year, and we're looking fo rward to your celebration in Egypt in 1999,' Bush said.\" 651 The organization that Mr. Bush sent the telegram to was called the Millennium Society. As was pointed out e lsewhere, a millennium is a period of 1000 years. So the Soci ety is going to the Great Pyramid to bring in, not the nex t century as the article reported, but the next millennium, t he next 1000 years. And lastly, the location of the big par ty is the Great Pyramid of Cheops, the site of the ancient in itiation ceremony into Lucifer worship. This party was mentioned in an article that appeare d in the June 27, 1988 Wall Street Journal. That article 's headline read: 294"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 36 REAGAN AND BUSH \"To Mark Year 2000, Some Events Will Be Out of This World\" The article was about the \"imminent arrival of the new millennium,\" and some of the plans that were being made by a variety of people and organizations. It went on t o report: \"One group has booked the Great Pyramid of Cheops in Egypt for a monumental bash on the eve of the new millenium.\" The article identified the group that had arranged the party as the \"Millennium Society.\" George Bush is going to the Great Pyramid in the ye ar 1999 to bring in the millennium reign of Lucifer, a period called the New Age, or the New World Order. Is that conclusion a misreading of the evidence? Ca n one say that this interpretation of all of this evidenc e is incorrect? Is there another possible interpretation? The only way to know the answer to those questions for sure is to wait until the year 1999.

One of those voices is that of Alexander Solzhenits yn, the ex-Russian who is now living in America.

He wrote: \"I sought for the greatness and genius of America in her commodious harbors and her ample rivers, and it was not there. I sought for the greatness and ge nius of America in her fertile fields and boundless fore sts, and it was not there. I sought for the genius and greatness of America in her rich mines and her vast world commerce, and it was not there.
