He's Already Here! Big Brother is planning to enslave yout How? Elec- tronically, via the National Security Agency! It's true. Big Brother, as defined by George Orwell's book, 1984, is no longer futuristic fiction. Orwell was off in his title— 1984 — by about 20 years (2004 is a more realistic date), however, the scenario he described is now closer to truth than fiction. 1 am convinced that the NSA and its affiliates will be the database source for the functioning of the Big Brot her dictator- ship, and in this book I shall document the foundat ion for my convictions. Big Brother isn't on his way—he's already here! Fur ther- more, he is on the brink of taking control of the e ntire world —politically, economically, and theologically. Conc urrently, he will enslave everyone electronically in cyberspa ce, by means of a sophisticated network of global computer ization that will operate through an advanced form of the I nternet and the National Security Agency, simultaneously. The hub for this global activity in America will be the NSA Headquarters, located at Ft. Meade, Maryland. Indee d, Big Brother's technological headquarters will be located at the NSA's main facility at Ft. Meade.

George Orwell's 1984: A Big-Brotherly Vision Of the Antichrist 1984 —the only thing preventing actual activation of Orw ell's Big Brother in 1984 was the lack of sufficient tech nology to carry out the program, as described in the Book of Revelation (13:16-18). I'm sure that the prayers of the righte ous standing in the gap were responsible for the 20-year delay. However, technology has advanced to the degree that keeping track of people, their finances, activities, et al, is no longer limited merely to an author's fertile imagination. What is interesting to me—or perhaps curious is a b etter word—is 1997's new crop of Fall television programm ing. Before this year, the name \"National Security Agenc y\" was relatively unknown, and its activities even less pu blicized. Now numerous dramas and science fiction programs ha ve incorporated the activities of the NSA (as well as the FBI and others) into the fabric of their storylines, and wi thout excep- tion, the NSA and its operatives always are portray ed as \"the bad guys,\" with global access to anything through t heir satellites and other technology. It is depicted as an outfit who operates by \"the end justifies the means\" method, a nd invariably the NSA operatives tramp all over civil rights and the Constitution in their efforts to achieve their own ends— just or unjust! Even the first TV movie of the popu lar mystery program, Murder, She Wrote!, featuring \"mystery writer Jessica Fletcher,\" was written around the mystery of the se cret being covered up by the NSA about some satellite/computer encryption codes that were flawed, leaving the whol e system unprotected, and how they were killing people to pr event the information from becoming public knowledge.

I believe this dictator-type character soon will ma nifest himself as the incarnate devil-man of the apocalyps e, the Antichrist, the end-times \"beast-man\" described in the Books of Daniel and Revelation. He will be the wors t dictator the world ever has known—he will make Adolf Hitler look like a choir boy. Orwell's fictional character soon will become real in the form of the Biblical Antichrist—the \"man\" wh ose number is \"666\" (Rev. 13:16-18). This scripture dec lares that no one will be able to buy or sell (in other words, transact any business) without the mark of this dictator in either their right hand or forehead.

In order to accomplish their goals, the leaders of the NSA must—of necessity—confiscate your right to privacy (or convince you to relinquish it \"for the greater good \"). The whole system is a trade-off; we allegedly need the benefits that such a trade-off enables and must willingly give up our individual freedoms because it is for the greater good.

Even if all these benefits were as helpful and benign as they appear in the pr opaganda, and assuming they actually would work, would you be willing to give up everything, including your privacy, to t he control of Big Brother? And the assumption that these \"bad things\" actually could be stopped by such surveillance and control is highly doubtful, anyway. Let's not be naive in o ur evaluation of the circumstances. . .when have you ever known t he criminals, mafia, et al, to be unable to find a way around any system?

When Orwell wrote this famous (or infamous) novel i n 1949, he was depicting society as he visualized it some 35 years into the future. The story is set in an alleg edly imaginary, so-called \"utopian\" future where freedom of thought and action utterly have disappeared, and humans are und er the constant scrutiny of an all-powerful, all-enslaving global government, symbolized by Big Brother, a male dictator whom the world must both worship and follow. Poster s and television screens everywhere warn citizens that \"B ig Brother is watching you.\" Children are taken from their par ents and raised by the state (and thoroughly indoctrinated o r brain- washed with Big-Brotherism). Love and traditional family relationships are stric tly for- bidden, and the secret police monitor and control A LL individual thought for \"political correctness.\" (An d the liberals of the 1990's thought they invented the concept of \"politically correct\"! It didn't originate with them—it just cam e into existence under their manipulation of the equality laws.) In Orwell's scenario, all movement is constantly under surveil- lance and personal privacy is both nonexistent and illegal.

It prob ably would have been called \"the Mark-of-Big-Brother,\" rather than the Mark-of-the-Beast, but the result would have been t he same, without a doubt. One major piece of futuristic tech nology that he didn't overlook was the interactive televis ions—it could look at you as easily as you could look at it . Now with fiber optics cables, et al, your television likely will be the place where all transactions—business, entertainment, com munica- tions, etc.—will occur. Already, you can order spec ial events programming through your interactive screen, and ba nks are encouraging you to switch to banking at home on you r own system, instead of writing those old-fashioned paper checks or requesting that old-fashioned paper money. Once the capability exists to use your television to reach i nto your home or bank account or medical records, how long d o you suppose it will be before someone starts abusing th e oppor- tunity? George Orwell, The Socialist Grolier's 1994 Multimedia Electronic Encyclopedia has some very interesting things to say about George Orwell. \"Orwell was a SOCIALIST\" (meaning Communist) (emphasis adde d). Then it defines socialism as: A comprehensive set of beliefs or ideas about the nature of human society and ITS FUTURE DESIRABLE STATE [emphasis added]. Grolier's continues the link, by way of Marx and En gels, right down to the Communist Manifesto. The only logical c on- clusion is that socialism is the initial stage of c ommunism. Can you see this progression in world affairs today ? So, then, in reality, who was George Orwell? Availa ble evidence documents that he was a socialist, i.e., a communist, and his futuristic vision of a totalitarian Big-Bro ther-led Utopia, as depicted in 1984, was far more than merely a"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"8 BIG BROTHER NSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" novel—it was actually his forecast of things to com e in an all-encompassing system of tyrannical communism. The Origin of the Philosophy of Communism Orwell's thought leaves us with the question of who \"invented\" the communist philosophy in the first pl ace. It is common knowledge that it was Karl Marx, but what is not common knowledge is the fact that Marx was a devout satanist. That's right! The man who invented the most tyranni cal form of government in history was a very religious devil worshipper! Satan worship is a religion, you know. Are you begi nning to see where this is headed? Read on. Orwell and The New World Order Orwell's book seems more like a futuristic snapshot of the coming New World Order of global communism than som e outdated novel, doesn't it. In fact, there is nothi ng outdated about this book; it is just now coming into its own . But could it be that Orwell \"borrowed\" his Big Brother ideas from Marxist theologies? You see, socialists/communists hate God and Christ (or deny Their existence), and for years hav e persecuted and exterminated God's people. This has occurred be cause communism is both a political and theological syste m. It is important to understand that communism is more than just a political system. It is also a religious system o f devout Anti- christism. From history, we can see clearly that Satan is the real \"founder\" of communism—not Karl Marx. Marx was simp ly a tool the devil used to implement his plan. Indeed, the politics of communism is radically religious Satanism. I won der if Marx ever admitted publicly that \"the devil made hi m do it\"? Not Really a Novel?

Could Grolier's be saying here that 1984 never was intended to be a novel, but rather a forecast of things to c ome in our modern, technologically advanced world? I believe s o! This amazing admission by Grolier's begins to sound like your typical \"paranoid, right-wing extremist\" philosophy . Right? The fact that the opposite philosophical position i s true is what makes this admission so amazing! Accordingly, when the satanic New World Order achie ves power and authority, what will exist is a slickly r epackaged system of global communism. However, since the word communism now is regarded as a negative thing throughout the world, the Big Brother ministers of propaganda will put a \"kinder, gentler\" face on it, calling it \"global democracy in a global village.\" This is just one example of t he kinds of perestroika deceptions and Orwellian newspeak disinforma- tion (lies) that former Soviet President Mikhail Go rbachev utilizes as he travels and speaks internationally. His goal is to have brainwashed everyone thoroughly in the next two years in preparation for the Second October Communi st Revolution of the world—a New World Order of global com- munism. The goal is to conquer the world by the yea r 2001. At that time, Big Brother NSA's databases can be us ed by Satan's communists to control everyone! Orwell's 7984 Should Have Been Titled 2004! As I pointed out previously, Orwell was not off in his predic- tions, just in the time table. The year 2004 would have been more accurate. Just before he died, however, Orwell made the following comment about our probable future: I do not believe that the kind of society I describ e [in 1984] necessarily will arrive, but I believe. . .that some- thing resembling it could arrive.

At least he was intellectually honest enough to adm it the truth! Orwell's statement pretty much says it all, doesn't it? Is it mere coincidence that globalists everywhere n ow advo- cate a similar-sounding New World Order? Is it coin cidence that at the same time highly advanced Big-Brother-s tyle surveillance technologies exist that easily could p ermit a global, tyrannical despot to take full electronic c ontrol of the world? Coincidence? / think not! Ah, enter Antichrist, the final Big Brother. George Orwell's 1984 versus Aldous Huxley's Brave New World [Order] In the 1930's—even before Orwell—Aldous Huxley wrot e a book titled Brave New World. It described how a so-called \"fictional,\" futuristic, totalitarian government mi ght control its populace with modern technology, propaganda, an d drugs. Huxley had this to say about such possibilities in 1947, just a few years before the National Security Agency was established. The theme of Brave New World is not the advance- ment of science as such; it is the advancement of science as it affects human individuals. . . .The sciences of matter can be applied in such a way that they will destroy life or make the living of it impos- sibly complex and uncomfortable. . . .A really effi- cient totalitarian state would be one in which the all-powerful executive of political bosses [Big- Brother Antichrist] and their army of managers control a population of slaves who do not have to be coerced, because they love their servitude. To make them love it is the task assigned, in present- day totalitarian states, to the ministries of propaganda, newspaper editors, and school teachers. [Emphasis added.]"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 11 Huxley's ideas regarding efficiently run dictatorsh ips deserve more investigation and discussion, but I'm sure you get the general picture. Mind-controlling propagand a, news, and education (or as Orwell called it, newspeak) will prepare us mentally to love the coming Mew-World-Order tyranny under Big Brother, the devil. Big Brother's New World Order Cinder Antichrist The Bible informs us that in the \"last days,\" just before the return of Jesus Christ to inaugurate His 1000-y ear millen- nial reign, the spirit of Lucifer, the Antichrist, Satan-the-Beast, would lead the world for a final, horrible, seven-y ear period called the Great Tribulation. The Bible says this man, whose number is 666, will head a global system of government (presently being called the Ten-Region Mew World Or der), and he will cause the entire world to worship him a nd receive his mark in their right hands or foreheads (Rev. 13:16). Scrip- ture says that without this ID Mark, no one will be able to buy or sell anything, anywhere! Everyone will be ow ned and controlled by Big Brother, the Antichrist. And Big Brother's MSA will do the dirty work by identifying and contr olling everyone electronically. Big Brother's Internet-Connected Electronic ID And Money System Throughout all of recorded history, such an evil sy stem of global computerized control never before has been p ossible . . . until now, that is! Indeed, Satan's evil system of electronic servitude is being installed right before our very eyes, though few see it. This new system has been named by its s ecular designers \"LUCID 2000™.\" The LUCID 2000™ internatio nal identification system will operate through the worl dwide Internet Super Information Highway, about which we are hearing so much today. In addition, a new Internet monetary system, called Internet Commerce, soon will permit a digital,"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"12 BIG BROTHER NSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" international, cashless society of electronic buyin g and selling to emerge fully. And remember to keep in mind, all of this data will flow either directly or indirectly throug h the NSA. The LUCID 2000™ ID system, in conjunction with the NSA and Internet Commerce, soon will enslave us all elec- tronically. No buying or selling of any kind will b e permitted without first accessing Lucifer's Internet. Of cour se, use of the Internet will be restricted to only those who h ave positively identified themselves, first with an international ID smart card (probably the LUCID 2000™ \"MARC\" card), then with a computer chip implanted in the skin of their right hands (an RF1D biochip transponder). If their projected date stays on target, after 2001 people will have lost all contro l over their freedom, privacy, and money via this new diabolical system of electronic surveillance and control! The LGCID 2000™ system is a new, extremely complex and sophisticated international system of networked , com- puterized identification databases that will transf er informa- tion on us digitally and instantaneously anywhere i n the world. And, as stated above, the global Internet wi ll serve both as an electronic identification system (the LCJC1D Net) and as an entirely new medium through which all electro nic cyber-bartering must pass. The internationally comp uterized Internet (via NSA databases) will create the global \"electronic village\" that's being touted daily by corporate, go vernment, and media officials everywhere. Once in place, all buying and selling will be force d through this new cyber-system of Electronic Commerce. In other words, the system will function as our new, computerized, electronic cyber-money— E-Money. Soon, cyber-money will be the only authorized form of monetary exchange. Thereafter, currency and coin will have been illegalized entire ly, so that the mere possession of it will have become a crimin al offense in the New World Economic Order. And without curren cy, there will be no way to circumvent this new electro nic barter- ing system. In this way, Big Brother can access inf ormation on everything you do, and ultimately control you. R emember"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 13 what Orwell said, \"Big Brother is watching you!\". . .and he was right. Contrary to Huxley's opinion that we will \"love our servitude\" and not have to be \"coerced\" in to the new system, the Bible tells us that the global dictator, the Antichrist, will force everyone to worship him by means of financial coercion. In other words, the world's populace will be told that they first must worship the Beast, then be positively marked in their right hands by Big Brother's new ID system, an implantable biochip. If they refuse, they'll be unable to trans act any business globally. Talk about a new, high-tech kind of ID system, this is it! LUCID 2000™, or something even more advanced, will become Lucifer's ID system for the N ew World Order. No one will escape its effects, and no secto r of our lives will remain untouched. Big Brother's NSA will be watch- ing you! Of course, neither Huxley nor Orwell empha sized that the penalty for refusing to be coerced into worshiping the dictator and becoming part of the New World Ord er system would be the loss of your head (read a little further in the Book of Revelation). The Year 2000—Big Brother's Target Date In his 1990 book entitled, The Keys of This Blood: Pope John Paul II versus Russia and the West for Control of the New World Order, author Malachi Martin, a former Vatican insider and intelligence expert, had this to say about worl d conditions near the year 2000 under the New-World-Order system of global government. Willingly or not, ready or not, we are all involved in an all-out, no-holds-barred, three-way global compe ti- tion. Most of us are not the competitors, however. We are the stakes.

[Emphasis added.] Martin continues with some amazing and most astute remarks. The competition is all-out because, now that it has started, there is no way it can be reversed or called off. ... No holds are barred because, once the competi- tion has been decided, the world and all that's in it — our way of life as individuals and citizens of the nations; our families and our jobs; our trade and commerce and money; our educational systems and our religions and our cultures; even the badges of our national ident ity, which most of us have always taken for granted [Aut hor's Note: Refer to my book, America's Identity Crisis and the Coming International ID Card] — all will have been powerfully and radically altered forever. No one can be exempted from its effects. No sector of our lives will remain untouched .... Indeed, the three rivals [the Pope, Russia, and the West] speak about this New World Order not as something around some distant corner of time, but as something that is immi- nent. As a system that will be introduced and installed in our midst by the end of this final decade of the second millennium [the year 2000]. . . .What these competitors are talking about, then, is the most pro- found and widespread modification of international, national, and local life that the world has seen . .. the millennium end game. . . .The final contender i n the competition for the New World Order is not a single individual leader of a single institution or territory.

It certainly appears so. A New Age Cinder Big Brother, The Antichrist Malachi Martin and the Pope have made some very sca ry, remarkable, profound, and yet enlightened statement s here, haven't they?

Big Brother's National Security Agency: The Antichrist's Tool for Techno-Tyranny The following quote by Senator Frank Church regardi ng the National Security Agency's surveillance capabil ities pretty much confirms everyone's fears in this regard. At the same time, that capability could be turned around on the American people and no American would have any privacy left, such [is] the capability to monitor everything: telephone conversations, tel e- grams, it doesn't matter. There would be no place to hide. If this government ever became a tyranny, if a dictator ever took charge in this country, the techno- logical capacity that the intelligence community has given the government could enable it to impose total tyranny, and there would be no way to fight back, because the most careful effort to combine together in resistance to the government, no matter how priv ately"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 17 it was done, is within reach of the government to k now.

Accordingly, th ere is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the sinister National Security Agency, and its sister intelligence organizations, such as the Central Intelligence Agency, will be used by the Beast to accomplish this diabolical plan.

(When we get to it , note carefully the term \"backdoor.\")] Network security a ppli- cations present significant challenges for the Nati onal Information Infrastructure [translate that \"Interne t\"]. NSA will initiate programs that address authenticat ion, wireless interoperability, and real-time operating aspects of network security. NSA will develop authenticatio n techniques (e.g., biometric) for network access control and will create a mechanism for establishing standa rds of security and interoperability in emerging wirele ss PC's and cellular networks. NSA and NIST will integ rate Smartcard and biometric technology to permit authen ti- cation of a person to a network. In collaboration w ith NIST and hardware and software manufacturers, NSA will develop technology to integrate real-time and data communications in a secure multimedia, multi-termin al network environment. [Emphasis added.] Now, before we move on, let's examine in laymen's t erms what was covered in that previous paragraph. On the whole, it adds up to the fact that they want positive (bio metric) identi- fication on all of us, and they're getting there as fast as they can, at the expense of the taxpayer. . .you're footing the bill for your own surveillance and control! But let's redefine some of their specific terms (above). In addition to the \"Author's notes\" I have inserted into the copy furnished above, it is important that I commen t on a number of the other phrases in the revealing termin ology (double-speak). \"Information security is A primary mission\" —they have many, and personally I'm more concerned about what they are planning to do with the information t han with how they are \"protecting\" it and us. The term \"wireless interoperability\" means they can observe and/or access information from a number of desig-"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"THE BIGGEST SECRET IN THE WORLD — THE NSA 33 nated sources via wireless operation, such as a cel l phone, wireless PC, or other such devices. They readily te ll us that the \"authentication [identification] techniques\" th ey plan to use are biometric in nature, and if you aren't appr oved \"for network access,\" you won't be doing any business on the Super Information Highway. Note that they want \"int eropera- bility\" again in the \"emerging wireless PCs and cel lular networks.\" This just means that they want all futur e wireless communications networks to develop their systems on the drawing boards with \"interoperability\", supposedly so they can \"talk\" with anyone, but basically they don't wa nt some entrepreneur out there developing and encrypting a system that they don't have the capability of accessing (s urveillance). You notice they claim that \"they will integrate Smartcard and biometric technology;\" prior to this revelation, it was assumed that the international banking industry was the organi- zation planning to biometrically identify us by tyi ng biometrics with the Smartcard, specifically Citicorp, et al (and I'm con- vinced that they still are heavily involved). . . n ow we find MSA claiming it is part of their mission to establish a standard for this positive identification. \"In collaboration with NIST and hardware and softwa re manufacturers,\" means that they are using your tax dollars to underwrite private companies, to have them devel op these \"security\" devices (more will be mentioned later in this chapter and further in the next chapter). Finally, they want to \"develop technology to integr ate... in a secure multimedia multi-terminal network'—interpr et \"multimedia\" as \"anyone\" and \"multi-terminal\" as \"a nywhere,\" and you will arrive at the fact that this is an oxy moron— because once anyone (interoperability) has access t o anyone, anywhere, there's nothing secure about it! Below are several more statements about their mission which 1 must ad dress. Over the past few years there has been a significan t research program funded by ARPA, NSA, and other government agencies.... [Author's note: ARPA has"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"34 BIG BROTHER NSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" been very instrumental in this area; again NSA is f ooting the bill, via the taxpayer]. . . . ARPA, NSA, and other agencies have conducted and sponsored research programs to develop. . . speech recognition [and it is their goal to teach their ma chines to read foreign languages, in addition to those for which we are footing the bill]. [Emphasis added.] Another paragraph that they consider a \"near-term g oal\" is the development of a computer that will analyze the in- formation and tell the \"human\" what is relevant. What? You mean you're not ready to let your computer analyze your information and determine what you ought to know? T hen you'd better not read the next paragraph! A major effort needs to be initiated for developmen t of efficient and reliable text summarization technology. . . . Prototype development for text summarization and relevance feedback from users is a near-term goal of the program. [Emphasis added.] Now, speaking of secure, how secure do you feel let ting a computer analyze your data? What if it sees somet hing that it dismisses as unimportant (or not relevant), but might make you alter your determination on a subject, if some small piece had not been overlooked? Mo matter how sophisticate d the hardware, the best computer is no better than the o perator who feeds it the data. What if they had a fight wit h their spouse before breakfast, and the kids were late for school, and by Murphy's Law if their day could get any wors e, it probably would? It all boils down to that decades-o ld acronym: GI - GO (garbage in, garbage out). Still think you want your computer to summarize your data and tell you what i t wants you to know?

But by 1994—just ten more ye ars— the situations he described not only were possible, they were impending! Even before Orwell, in the 1930s, Aldous Huxley wro te a book titled Brave New World, about which Huxley had this to say in 1947: The theme of Brave New World is not the advancement of science as such; it is the advancement of science as it affects human individuals . . . .The sciences of matter can be applied in such a way that they will destroy life or make the living of it impossibly complex and uncomfortable.... A really efficient totalitarian state would be one in which the all-powerful executive of political bosses and their army of managers control a population of SLAVES who do not have to be coerced, because they LOVE THEIR SERVITUDE. To make them love it is the task assigned, in present-day totalitarian states, to the ministries of PROPAGANDA, newspaper editors, and school teachers. . . .Unless we choose to decentralize and to use applied science, not"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"THE BIGGEST SECRET IN THE WORLD — THE NSA 37 as the end to which human beings are to be made the means, but as the means to producing a race of free individuals, we have ONLY TWO ALTERNATIVES to choose from; either A NUMBER of national, militarized totalitarianisms, having as their root the terror of the atomic bomb and as their consequence the destructio n of civilization. . .or else ONE SUPRANATIONAL TOTALITARIANISM, called into existence by the social chaos resulting from rapid technological progress in general and atomic revolution in particular, and developing, under the need for efficiency and stability, into the welfare-tyranny of Utopia. . . .

It was also by far the most secret U.S. intelligence agency. Estab lished not by legislation (as was the Central Intelligence Agency—CIA) but under an order signed by President Truman on October 24, 1952, the NSA quietly came in to being on November 4, 1952, a day when the attention of the news media was focused on the presidential election. The level of secrecy was so high that Tru man's order not only carried the Top Secret classificatio n but was labeled with a code name that was also secret. Charged with the responsibility for all Department of Defense [DOD] activities relating to communications intelligence, the NSA operated an array of listenin g posts around the world, decrypted and analyzed the interc epted messages, and created U.S. signal intelligence [SIG INT] capacities—codes and ciphers, together with transmi s- sion methods and devices, with heavy emphasis on the"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"THE BIGGEST SECRET IN THE WORLD — THE NSA 41 NSA's location between Washington, DC, and Baltimor e, Maryland."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"44 BIG BROTHER NSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" Note NSA's unguarded entrance on the road approachi ng the NSA facility at the Ft.

National Security Agency The largest and most secret of the intelligence age ncies of the U.S. government, the National Security Agenc y (NSA), with headquarters at Fort Meade, Maryland, h as two main functions: to protect U.S. government com- munications and to intercept foreign communications . It protects government communications by encipherin g messages and taking other measures to ensure their secrecy. In its foreign intelligence function the N SA marshals a vast corps of intelligence analysts who use sensitive electronic equipment to monitor, decipher , and translate the communications of foreign governments . It could follow space rocket launchings in the form er USSR and can overhear conversations between aircraf t pilots and ground-control personnel in remote areas of the globe. The NSA was established in 1952 as a sep - arately organized agency within the Department of Defense. It replaced the Armed Forces Security Agen cy. . . .The National Security Agency (NSA) is responsible for collecting signals intelligence from all over the world and for overseeing the integrity of American secret communications. [Author's note: Can you see what an easy step it is to move from exclusively military/g overn- ment secret communications to personal, banking, buying, selling, trading, et al, communications, since they have been made \"responsible. . . for overseein g the integrity of American secret communications\"?] Some sources suggest that there is a third highly secret"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"46 BIG BROTHER NSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" national intelligence agency responsible for satell ite surveillance. . . . responsible for satellite surveillance. . . . A second form of clandestine collection is known as signals intelligence—the interception of electronic com- munications and other emissions. Signals are interc epted by a variety of methods, including the tapping of t ele- phone lines and the monitoring of radio transmissio ns. . . . [Emphasis added.] Grolier's has this to say regarding the economic impact of NSA on the surrounding urban areas: Maryland's economy is dominated by activities in th e Baltimore-Washington metropolitan areas, and these have changed markedly in the decades since World War II. Baltimore's traditional heavy manufacturing and port and rail activities have declined. At the same time, the growth of the federal government and government - related activities have spilled from the nearby Dis trict of Columbia to Maryland, including Baltimore. Today , government-related business is of major economic importance to the state. Federal-government install a- tions include Andrews Air Force Base, the Goddard Space Flight Center, the Agricultural Research Serv ice, and Fort Meade, including the National Security Age ncy, Aberdeen Proving Ground, and Fort Detrick in the Ba lti- more metropolitan area. It is easy to see how an organization with three fa cilities and a payroll for 80,000 ± employees could have a treme ndous impact on the economics of the surrounding communit y.

David Kahn, author of The Codebreakers and Hitler's Spies, provides even more accolades for this publication. This is the most important book ever written about American intelligence. Andrew has done what hardly any other studies do—tell how the intelligence gathered by so many people at such risk and cost is actually us ed by the most powerful men in the world. Next, 1 would like to quote some relevant passages from this book, from the following pages (respectively): 197, 198, 250, 273, and 537. . . .On October 24 Truman signed a top-secret eight - page presidential memorandum entitled \"Communica- tions Intelligence Activities,\" putting into effect the main recommendations of the committee, with one signific ant addition. In keeping with its enhanced authority, A FSA was renamed the National Security Agency (NSA). Whereas CIA was brought into being by an act of Con - gress, NSA was thus founded by a secret presidentia l signature. The date of its foundation, November 4, 1952, was deliberately chosen to keep it out of the news. ... Before long, both the new agency's budget and its personnel outstripped those of the CIA. NSA possessed the largest bank of computers in the world. For more than two decades, however, even its existence was unknow n to the vast mass of American people. Those in the k now in Washington joked that NSA stood for \"No Such Agency.\""},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"THE BIGGEST SECRET IN THE WORLD — THE NSA 49 ... In 1947, Truman promoted the National Security Act, which founded the CIA. In 1948 he authorized t he beginning, and during his second term the rapid exp an- sion, of peacetime covert action by U.S. intelligen ce agencies. And in 1952, as one of his final acts as presi- dent, he founded NSA. During his twenty-year retirement, Truman sometimes seemed amazed, even somewhat appalled, at the size and power of the intelligence community he had brou ght into being .... [Even as late as 1964 he wrote to Look magazine] that he had never intended CIA to do more than get \"all the available information to the pres ident. It was not intended to operate as an international agency engaged in strange activities.\" NSA was so secret t hat Truman did not mention it at all.

The above occultic insignia was designed by NSA in 1965, under the direction of then NSA Director Lt. Gen. M arshal] S. Carter, US Army. Its design is blasphemous and s atanic! For example, the information brochure to which I re ferred earlier that was supplied to me by the Public Affai rs Office in Fort Meade, Maryland, conveys the nature of the occultic and freemasonic thought that was incorporated into the insignia's design at the time it was created. This is a very important spiritual issue. Therefore, I'm going to spend a con- siderable amount of time analyzing this evil symbol because it is vitally important that we fully comprehend it s satanic origin. Accordingly, let's first consider what the NSA itself has to say about its insignia, then we'll analyze w hat occultic and freemasonic literature (including The Secret Teachings of All Ages by Manly P. Hall) reveal about this kind of symbol- ism. The NSA's brochure reads this way: The created [symbol] is described as: an insignia w hich shall be a circle [meaning Lucifer is eternal] bordered white. In the Chief semicircle border, the words National Security Agency. In the base semicircle border, the words United States of America, separated on either side by a five pointed star, silver; in a field, blue, a n American eagie [an occultic phoenix bird] displayed, wings inverted, all proper.

The shape of the insignia, a circle, represents perpetuity of its continuance, the SYM- BOL OF ETERNITY [emphasis added]. It should be extremely obvious to anyone who has ha d even a little Bible training that the NSA is mocking and blaspheming God with this occultic claim to divine power. For instance, let's turn to the appropriate Scripture in the Bible for a better understanding of this heresy. In Matthew 16:19 (KJV), Jesus told Peter the Apostle this: And 1 will give unto thee the KEYS of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven [emphasis added] . Jesus Christ gave to Peter (not to the NSA) the keys to heaven and the power to \"loose and bind.\" Furthermore, only the kingdom of God is perpetual and eternal, not the satanically inspired National Security Agency! When we pray for our leaders, as God has ordained, let's re member to pray for all of the deceived souls at the NSA wh o war (usually unaware) against God's kingdom in these la st days. Now let's dissect the insignia and study the symbol ism of each part (where available 1 have inserted illustra tions).

Author Manly P. Hall warned us clearly not to doubt free- masonry's occultic presence and influence in the Great Seal's symbolism on page \"XCI\" (91) of his book as follows : If any one doubts the presence of Masonic and occult influences at the time the Great Seal was designed, he should give due consideration to the c om- ments of Professor Charles Eliot Norton of Harvard, who wrote concerning the unfinished Pyramid and the All- Seeing Eye which adorned the reverse of the Seal, as follows: \"The device adopted by Congress is practic ally"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"58 BIG BROTHER MSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" incapable of effective treatment; it can hardly look otherwise than as a dull EMBLEM OF A MASONIC FRATERNITY.\" [Emphasis added.] Furthermore, on the same page Hall had this to say about who really created the United States in 1776: Not only were many founders of the United States Government Masons, but they received aid from a secret and august [majestic] body existing in Europe which helped them to establish this country for a PECULIAR AND PARTICULAR PURPOSE KNOWN ONLY TO THE INITIATED FEW [meaning to bring forth The New World Order]. The Great Seal [of the United States] is the signature of this exalted body—unseen and for the most part unknown — and the unfinished pyramid upon its [the Seal's] reverse side is a trestle board [supporting structure] sett ing forth symbolically the task to the accomplishment of which the United States government was dedicated from the day of its inception. [Emphasis added.] Manly P. Hall's occultic explanation of America's n ational insignia should clarify what's presently going on s piritually in this country, because the five Latin words inside the satanic circle of the Masonic pyramid, with Satan's \"All- Seeing Eye,\" translate to read: \"Announcing the birth of the New World Order\" (ANNUIT COEPTIS NOVUS ORDO SECLOREM). Note in Hall's statement above how he freely admits that freemasonry is \"occultic\" in nature. But what does the word occultic mean? Rodale's Synonym Finder sums it up fairly succinctly as follows: \"Occultism —cabalism, mysti- cism, esoterism, supernaturalism, theosophy, spirit ualism, mediumism, magic, black magic, sorcery, witchcraft, and diabolism [of the devil].

I realiz e that for some of you, I may be \"telling you more than you want to know\" about the NSA, but 1 feel it's necessary, since the NSA presently has the capacity to track, eavesdrop, and monitor/ watch everybody, and they are enhancing their techn ical abilities of surveillance and control even more eac h year, funded by \"black chambers projects\" (undesignated f unds used for top secret expenditures, hidden in the bud gets of other legitimate intelligence organizations; referr ed to by Portland's major newspaper, The Oregonian, May 20, 1997, as \" 'black budget'. . . hidden inside false accoun ts. . .within the Pentagon's budget\"). NSA is becoming the \"clearing house\" or \"watchdog\" into which the other intelligence gat hering organizations, both direct and indirect [defined in the next chapter] are funneling the information they collect . They cur- rently have the second largest supercomputer in the world (allegedly) and are linked by satellite with World Wide Web's \"CERN\" database center in Europe, as well as NSA's own facilities scattered throughout the world. In order to improve the way they are perceived by the nation, in additi on to an all-out \"PR.\" campaign, they are trying to \"declass ify\" their secretive image by declassifying some of the older documents (30 to 40 years) whose data is no longer sensitive to national security. Don't fall for this illusion. . .the thin gs that are really going on at present—and that will affect your lives in the immediate future—are still very much classified/Top Secret.

Breakdown of the NSA Insignia The National Security Agency conveys to Luciferians many occultic messages with its esoteric insignia. This insignia uses two five-pointed stars inside a satanic \"eternal ci rcle.\" Again, Manly P. Hall explains the occultic significance of these symbols in his book, The Secret Teachings of All Ages. And in spite of the fact that the stars are not inverte d, Hall still refers to them as pentagrams (p. CIII—103). This book of pre- Masonic occultists is a rare and prized possession of the Masonic Order. It displays and defines/explains man y occultic, freemasonic drawings that define the true satanic o rigin of this kind of thought. Please take a moment to perus e the following illustrations from this publication, in a ddition to those appearing above. Freemasonic writer Manly P. Hall defines the circle occult- ically in this manner: The circle is the Plan of Divine Activity [esoteric language meaning Lucifer's unholy plan]. According to Qabbalists, the life of the SUPREME CREATOR [he means Lucifer here because Satan is the god of free - masonry] permeates all substance, all space, and al l time, but for diagrammatic purposes, the Supreme, A ll- Inclusive Life is limited by circle 3, which may be called \"the boundary line of Divine existence.\" The Divine Life permeating the area bounded by circle 3 is focused at Point 1, which thus becomes the personification of the impersonal life and is termed \"the First Crown.\" The creative forces pouring through Point 1 come into"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"THE BIGGEST SECRET IN THE WORLD — THE NSA 61 Note the \"nine\" five-pointed (penta- gram) stars inside the satanic circle, along with \"nine \" drops, symbolizing the Ninth Degree of freemasonic initiation rites, during which Masons become \"born again. \"Also note the satanic \"skull & bones \" in the center of the serpent-circle, symbolizing death.

[Emphasis added.] What Hall is really saying here is that \"the circle \" is nothing more than a secret, hidden, or esoteric symbol of w orship. This Luciferic circle symbol is typical of various witch craft circles used internationally by devil worshipers, in fact, the initiation rites of freemasonry and witchcraft are virtually i dentical. This is why Masons call their meeting lodges \"Mason ic Temples.\" A temple is a place of worship and Masons secretly worship Satan in their \"Blue,\" \"Scottish Rite,\" and \"York\" lodges or temples. Below I am going to quote a number of excerpts from Hall's comprehensive book on occultism/mysticism and its h istory, filtering down to modern times. Please receive this warn- ing: you will note that there is much reference to the B ible and the scriptures therein; to Paul and other apost les; to God; even to the great \"1 Am.\" This is a perfect case of distorting the truth and making it a lie. Without exception, w hen they interpret biblical truths, they twist them out of s hape or use them out of context, so that they no longer constit ute sound doctrine. Anytime an author readily admits that the historical evidence documents an occultic history, you can rest assured that it does, and any use of scripture will be twis ted, out of context, and manipulated to support some occultic m ystical principle, including their use of symbolism, both g raphic and verbal. Every pagan nation had (and has) not only its state religion, but another into which the philosophic el ect alone have gained entrance. Many of these ancient cults van- ished from the earth without revealing their secret s, but a few have survived the test of ages and their myst erious symbols are still preserved. Much of the ritualism of free- masonry is based on the trials to which candidates were subjected by the ancient hierophants before the keys of wisdom were entrusted to them. [Author's note:"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"THE BIGGEST SECRET IN THE WORLD — THE NSA 69 these are also the keys to loose and bind, mentione d earlier, that Jesus gave expressly to Peter and the Church.] Few realize the extent to which the ancient secret schools influenced contemporary intellects and, thr ough those minds, posterity. Robert Macoy, 33 °, in his General History of Freemasonry, pays a magnificent tribute to the part played by the ancient Mysteries in the rearing of the edifice of human culture. He says, in part: \"It appears that all the perfection of civilization, and all th e advance- ment made in philosophy, science, and art among the ancients are due to those institutions which, under the veil of mystery, sought to illustrate the sublimest truths of religion, morality, and virtue, and impress them on the hearts of their disciples. . .

In the Mysteries it was customary to refer to initiates as phoenixes or men who had been born again, for just as physical birth gives man consciousness in the physical world, so the neophyte, after nine degrees in the womb of the Mysteries, was born into a con- sciousness of the spiritual world. This is the mystery of initiation to which Christ referred when"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"70 BIG BROTHER NSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" he said, \"Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God\" (John iii:3) ... [p. 90 (XC), emphasis added]. DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT! They are misusing this scrip- ture to support their theory of reincarnation. . .t he phoenix bird goes down in flames, then is resurrected, or \" rises from the ashes.\" Hall says, \"The phoenix is a fitting sy mbol of this spiritual birth.\" Not even close! They carefully ma nage to ignore the Bible's words about \"it is appointed unt o man once to die, and after that the judgment.\" We will not r ise from the ashes \"seven times seven,\" as Hall claims. For the human race, it will be \"ashes to ashes, and dust to dust\" until the day the Lord returns to resurrect the \"dead in Christ,\" which in one place the Bible tells us will rise fir st, and in another place \"those who are alive will not precede those who are asleep [dead].\" But the ones (in Christ)who are alive and remain will be changed in the twinkling of an eye. . . and so shall they ever be with the Lord. Quite a different scenario than Hall postulates. However, he wants us to know that this occultic/Mas onic mysticism had (and still has) great influence on th e affairs of the United States. He continues on page 90 (XC): European mysticism was not dead at the time the United States of America was founded. The hand of the Mysteries controlled in the establishment of the new government, for the signature of the Mysteries may still be seen on the Great Seal of the United States of America. Careful analysis of the seal dis- closes a mass of occult and Masonic symbols, chief among them the so-called American eagle —a bird which Benjamin Franklin declared unworthy to be cho sen as the emblem of a great, powerful, and progressive people. Here again only the student of symbolism can see through the subterfuge and realize that the American eagle upon the Great Seal is but a conven-"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"THE BIGGEST SECRET IN THE WORLD — THE NSA 71 tionalized phoenix, a fact plainly discernible from an examination of the original seal .... In a colored sketch submitted as a design for the Great Seal by William Barton in 1782, an actual phoenix appears sitting u pon a nest of flames. This itself demonstrates a tenden cy towards the use of this emblematic bird. [Emphasis added.] On page 91 (XCI), Hall has this to say: If any one doubts the presence of Masonic and occul t influences at the time the Great Seal was designed, he should give due consideration to the comments of Professor Charles Eliot Norton of Harvard, who wrot e concerning the unfinished pyramid and the All-Seein g Eye which adorned the reverse of the seal, as follo ws: \"The device adopted by Congress is practically inca pable of effective treatment; it can hardly (however arti stically treated by the designer) look otherwise than as a d ull emblem of a Masonic fraternity\" (the History of the Seal of the United States). . . . Not only were many of the founders of the Uni ted States Government Masons, but they received aid fro m a secret and august body existing in Europe, which helped them to establish this country for a peculiar and particula r purpose known only to the INITIATED FEW. The Great Seal is the signature of this exalted body— unseen and for the most part unknown —and the unfinished pyramid upon its reverse side is a trestleboard setting forth symbolically the task to the accomplishment o f which the United States Government was dedicated fr om the day of its inception. [Emphasis added—you will recognize part of the above from earlier use, but I wanted you to see it context.] On page 99 (XCIX) Hall goes into the mythological s earch for the Holy Grail and the Spear of Longinus (alleg ed to be"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"72 BIG BROTHER NSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" the weapon used to spear the side of Christ at the crucifixion to assure that He was dead). He concludes his exami nation of the evidence with this bit of heresy: \"Moreover, to the Christian, the search for the Holy Grail is the sea rch for the real Self...\" (The capital \"S\" on self is Hall's.) As Hall continues to lay his foundation for the fac t that free- masonry is built upon occultism and mysticism, he f eels that we should have a basic knowledge about the \"black a rts— black magic.\" The Theory and Practice of Black Magic Some understanding of the intricate theory and prac - tice of ceremonial magic may be derived from a brie f consideration of its underlying premises. First. The visible universe has an invisible counterpart, the higher planes of which are peopled by good and beautiful spirits; the lower planes, dark and foreb oding, are the habitation of evil spirits and demons under the leadership of the Fallen Angel and his ten Princes. Second. By means of the secret processes of cere- monial magic it is possible to contact these invisi ble creatures and gain their help in some human under- taking. Good spirits willingly lend their assistanc e to any worthy enterprise, but the evil spirits serve only those who live to pervert and destroy. Third. It is possible to make contracts with spirits whereby the magician becomes for a stipulated time the master of an elemental being [demon]. Fourth. True black magic is performed with the aid of a demoniacal spirit, who serves the sorcerer for th e length of his earthly life, with the understanding that after death the magician shall become the servant o f his own demon. For this reason a black magician will go to inconceivable ends to prolong his physical life, since there is nothing for him beyond the grave. The most dangerous form of black magic is the scientifi c perversion of occult power for the gratification of per-"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"THE BIGGEST SECRET IN THE WORLD — THE NSA 73 sonal desire. Its less complex and more universal f orm is human selfishness, for selfishness is the fundamental cause of all worldly evil. A man will barter his eternal soul for temporal power, and down through the ages a mysterious process has been evolved which actually enables him to make this exchange. In its various branches the black art includes nearly all forms of cere- monial magic, necromancy, witchcraft, sorcery, and vampirism. Under the same general heading are also included mesmerism and hypnotism, except when used solely for medical purposes, and even then there is an element of risk for all concerned. [Author's note: This is a position by Hall on this subject that even most \"intellectual\" Christians refuse to acknowledge.] Though the demonism of the Middle Ages seems to have disappeared, there is abundant evidence that i n many forms of modern thought. . . black magic has merely passed through a metamorphosis, and although its name be changed its nature remains the same [p. 101 (CI), emphasis added]. As Christ was leaving, one of the last commissions He gave to His disciples and the Church included \"casting o ut demons\" until His return. Knowing that this function is no longer a very frequent part of the ministry of the local chu rch, one preacher 1 knew impertinently asked in a sermon, \"I f there are no more demons to cast out, where'd they all go ?\" Of course, this is a rhetorical question. . . since, l ike the angels, they don't die—there are still plenty to go around (possibly by different names, as Hall suggests). When He left , Christ seemed to think there would be plenty, since He was so specific in His instructions to continue casting th em out till His return. Therefore, we cannot agree with Hall's previous paragraph that demonism disappeared in the Middle A ges, although we do agree with him that the black arts j ust keep changing their names and reappearing. . . maybe they 're the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"74 BIG BROTHER NSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" phoenix bird! On page 117 (CXVII), Hall gets into the fundamental s of Qabbalistic teachings, including what I call the \"o ccultic/Ma- sonic circle\" with its mystical, complex mathematic al interpre- tations (it is pictured above). This is the section where he de- scribes \"I AM\" as a point in the middle. In the chapter titled \"The Mystery of the Apocalyps e\" (page 185, CLXXXV), he addresses, from a mythological position, the prophecies we find in the biblical Book of Reve - lation. Naturally, everything means something other than the Christian sound doctrine, which we espouse, but wha t else would you expect? (That, too, is a rhetorical quest ion!) Did you think 1 forgot The Mew World Order? Mot so! Hall discusses \"the new order\" of things, people, and th e world to come many times, especially on page 203 (CC1II), following his statement that \". . .eventually civilization wi ll destroy itself in one great cataclysmic struggle...\" and of course the \"new order\" will be built upon the foundation o f the former world order (by then allegedly defunct ),to which he furthers refers as: \" . . .this spherical ant-hill in Chaos.\" The final paragraph in his book (p. 204, CC1V) sums up the lie and encourages you to \"jump right in\"—in much the s ame way as we would present salvation to a non-Christia n, then invite him to accept Christ. Remember how we all ha ve been taught that in the Church there could not be a coun terfeit if there were not an original truth to copy and dis tort. Well, I think this is one of Satan's biggest counterfeits . . . .Only transcendental philosophy knows the path. Only the illumined reason can carry the understandi ng part of man upward to the light. Only philosophy ca n teach man to be born well [Author: Now, who can det er- mine how or where he is born, or to whom?], live we ll, to die well, and in perfect measure be born again. Into this band of the elect —those who have chosen the life of knowledge, of virtue, and of utility [hardly a b iblical definition of the elect]—the philosophers of the ag es invite YOU [emphasis added]."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"THE BIGGEST SECRET IN THE WORLD — THE NSA 75 The Leadership of the NSA Lieutenant General Kenneth A.

His experience and education appear to make him imm i- nently qualified to run this agency, or at least as well as anyone can be expected to. I suspect at the moment that it may be a case of \"the tail wagging the dog\" around the NSA /CSS. His education is also very impressive. He holds a B .A. degree in Political Science from Florida State University, an M.A. degree in National Security Affairs from the Naval Postgrad- uate School, Monterey, California, and is a graduat e of the Harvard University Program for Senior Executives in National and International Security in Massachusetts, as wel l as the US Air Force's Air War College, Alabama. General Minihan has worked in the intelligence fiel d for most of his very impressive military career. It sta rted at Langley Air Force Base and concluded with his prese nt assignment as Director of both the NSA/CSS at Fort Meade, with one stint along the way as Chief of the Office of Support to Military Operations and Plans at the NSA. The general is a native Texan and a family man, mar ried to Barbara Gleason of Elkhorn, Wisconsin, with thre e children, Mike, Tom, and Katie. This has been a condensed \"di gest\" version of General Minihan's resume, but the unabri dged version is available on NSA's website, if you care to pursue it. General Minihan is obviously a very bright, talente d, and respected intelligence leader.

It is further possible that he has strong ties to the New World Order globalists and that he may take orders directly from them. How I Was Able to Obtain This and Other Unclassified Information about the Illustrious National Security Agency Ooops! I almost wrote notorious instead of illustrious. I wonder if that's what is referred to as a \"Freudian slip\"? According to Miriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition, it is \"a slip of the tongue that is motiva ted by and reveals some unconscious aspect of the mind.\" In th at case, I'd better confess... it was probably a Freudian sl ip! Although the internal operations of the National Security Agency are kept highly secret, there is quite a bit of superficial, publicly obtainable information available if one me rely knows where to look. Obtaining this information requires doing a little basic research and investigation and making a few phone calls. But with a little investigation, some common sense, and a small amount of cash, one readily can acquire a s ubstantial amount of information about the NSA. For example, I spent about a month gathering the above and below informa tion and documentation. As a former police investigator and a commercially licensed pilot with a strong background in aeronautics, 1 us ed this knowledge, background, and training to contact the Federal Aviation Administration in order to obtain aeronaut ical air- space charts of the NSA's facility in Maryland.

It is a land where computers literally talk back and forth to each other and where, using what is known as \"brute force,\" they are able to spit out solutions to comp lex statistical problems in nanoseconds rather than the decades it once might have taken.

Scientists sue to reveal CIA's spy budget The Federation of American Scientists sued the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on Monday to force it to reveal one of Washington's worst-kept secrets : the size of the budget for U.S. espionage. The amount of the \"black budget,\" is hidden inside false accounts and classified compartments within t he Pentagon's budget. It has been reported to be about $29 billion a year, give or take a billion. The CIA spends about $3 billion a year. The agency' s director and the secretary of defense allocate most of the rest to military intelligence services such as the"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"92 BIG BROTHER NSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" National Security Agency (NSA), which conducts elec- tronic eavesdropping, and the National Reconnaissan ce Office (NRO), which builds spy satellites. [Read details about the NRO and CIA in the next chapter on \"Siste r\" Organizations of the NSA.) Intelligence spending is officially a state secret, and it has been since the CIA was created 50 years ago. But the veil of secrecy has slipped somewhat. The Federation of American Scientists, founded in 1945 as a research group concerned with national security policy, has decoded some of the secret sec tions of the Defense Department's budget where intelligen ce spending is hidden. But the number remains official ly classified. [ Some of the findings of the FAS on sp ecific topics are examined later in this chapter.] Although I seriously question the validity of the i nformation contained therein, the FAS website reveals the foll owing details of the NSA budget and staff (which I suspec t probably are grossly underestimated because they really don' t want the \"enemy\" to obtain this info and use it against them in some way). Budget and Personnel While the CIA budget is regularly the subject of pu blic reports which are generally rather consistent, the NSA budget is less frequently subject to press specula- tion, and published reports vary widely, with some estimates running as high as $10 billion. A principal source of confusion is the distinction between NSA proper and the associated military elements of the Central Security Service (CSS). These service eleme nts have historically been quite expensive, encompassin g many thousands of personnel at overseas ground stat ions. In fact, the NSA turns out to be not much larger th an that of CIA, and surprisingly, much more readily di scern- able from official public sources."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"THE BIGGEST SECRET IN THE WORLD — THE NSA 93 The annual R-l and P -l military budget documents provide total figures for RDT&E and procurement for all Defense Agencies, as well as funding for each indiv idual agency, except for NSA and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). Simple arithmetic reveals the total f or these two agencies, and since NSA is much larger th an DIA, the bulk of this remainder must be NSA. Contracts with NSA are routinely announced by the Defense Dep art- ment, which shyly refers to NSA as the \"Maryland Pr o- curement Office.\" Unfortunately, there was until recently no \"O-1\" fo r the operations and maintenance account, but each ye ar testimony is given to Congress which displays the o pera- tions and maintenance budget for Defense Agencies. As with the R-1 and P-l, this display provides a total figure for all Defense Agencies, as well as funding for ea ch individual agency, with a few exceptions. One of th e amusing examples of the foolish inconsistency with which the \"secret\" budget is publicly discussed is the presentation of the operations and maintenance budg et, which coyly provides an aggregate figure for intelli- gence and communications (about $2.8 billion).

Please note that a listing of telephone n um- bers is provided at the end of this handbook should you have any questons or concerns. Introduction In joining NSA you have been given an opportunity to participate in the activities of one of the most impor- tant intelligence organizations of the United States Govern- ment. At the same time, you have also assumed a tru st which carries with it a most important individual r espon- sibility—the safeguarding of sensitive information vital to the security of our nation. While it is impossible to estimate in actual dollar s and cents the value of the work being conducted by this Agency, the information to which you will have acce ss at NSA is without question critically important to the defense of the United States. Since this informatio n may be useful only if it is kept secret, it requires a very special measure of protection. The specific nature of this pro- tection is set forth in various Agency security reg ulations and directives. The total NSA Security Program, how - ever, extends beyond these regulations. It is based upon the concept that security begins as a state of mind . The program is designed to develop an appreciation of t he need to protect information vital to the national d efense, and to foster the development of a level of awarene ss which will make security more than routine complian ce with regulations. At times, security practices and procedures cause personal inconvenience. They take time and effort a nd on occasion may make it necessary for you to voluntarily forego some of your usual personal perogatives. But your"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"THE BIGGEST SECRET IN THE WORLD — THE NSA 109 compensation for the inconvenience is the knowledge that the work you are accomplishing at NSA, within a framework of sound security practices, contributes significantly to the defense and continued security of the United States of America. [He might just as well st and up and wave the flag!] I extend to you my very best wishes as you enter up on your chosen career or assignment with NSA. Philip T. Pease Director of Security INITIAL SECURITY RESPONSIBILITIES Anonymity Perhaps one of the first security practices with wh ich new NSA personnel should become acquainted is the practice of anonymity. In an open society such as ours, this practice is necessary because information whic h is generally available to the public is available also to hostile intelligence. Therefore, the Agency mission is best accomplished apart from public attention. Basically , anonymity means that NSA personnel are encouraged n ot to draw attention to themselves nor to their associ ation with this Agency. NSA Personnel are also cautioned neither to confirm nor deny any specific questions about NSA activities directed to them by individuals not affiliated with the Agency. The ramifications of the practice of anonymity are rather far reaching, and its success depends on the cooperation of all Agency personnel. Described belo w you will find some examples of situations that you may encounter concerning your employment and how you should cope with them. Beyond the situations cited, your judgment and discretion will become the deciding factors in how you respond to questions about your employment."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"110 BIG BROTHER NSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" Answering Questions About Your Employment Certainly, you may tell your family and friends tha t you are employed at or assigned to the National Sec urity Agency. There is no valid reason to deny them this information. However, you may not disclose to them any information concerning specific aspects of the Agen cy's mission, activities, and organization. You should a lso ask them not to publicize your association with NSA. [T he secrecy begins!] Should strangers or casual acquaintances question you about your place of employment, an appropriate reply would be that you work for the Department of Defense. If questioned further as to where you are employed within the Department of Defense, you may reply, \"NSA.\" When you inform someone that you work for NSA (or the Department of Defense) you may expe ct that the next question will be \"What do you do?\" It is a good idea to anticipate this question and to formulate an appropriate answer [in other words, plan your lie in advance!]. Do not act mysteriously about your em ploy- ment, as that would only succeed in drawing more attention to yourself.

In fact, they are told to st udy it carefully, as the security is explained in greater detail furt her on in the Handbook.

SIGINT itself is compose d of three elements: Communications Intelligence (COMINT), der ived from the interception and analysis of foreign commu nications; Electronics Intelligence (ELINT), technical and int elligence information derived from electromagnetic radiations , such as radars; Telemetry Intelligence (TELINT), technic al and intelligence information derived from the intercept ion, proc- essing, and analysis of foreign telemetry. 1 find it almost amusing that these scientists stat e that: \"All requirements levied on NSA must be for foreign inte lligence. Yet, the precise definition of foreign intelligence is unclear\" [emphasis added]. In the same paragraph they state: \"NSA limits its collection of intelligence to foreign co mmunications and confines its activities to communications links having at least one foreign terminal. Nevertheless, this is based upon an internal regulation and is not supported by law or executive branch directive. Although NSA limits itself to collecting communications with at least one foreign terminal, it may still pick up communications between two Americans when international communications are involved. . . .Whe never NSA chooses particular circuits or 'links' known to carry foreign communications... it collects all transmissions that go over those circuits. Given current technology, the only way for NSA to prevent the processing of communica- tions of CIS citizens would be to control the selec tion, analysis, or dissemination phases of the process\" [emphasis added].

This FAS paper describes the CSS Com ponents, as well as NSA's Directorates and Groups. Unlike other intelligence organizations such as CIA or DIA, NSA is particularly reticent concerning its internal organizational structure. The following de scrip- tion is based on the best available current informa tion.

Meade, MD. The rest of the workforce is scattered at CONUS and ove rseas field locations. NSA is one of the largest employers in the state of Maryland. Its workforce r epresents an unusual combination of occupational specialties including engineers, physicists, mathem aticians, linguists, computer scientists. NSA reportedly has about 20,000 employees in Maryla nd, with a $831.7 million payroll in 1990 (1). This estimate is consistent with the approximately 5 mil lion square feet of NSA office space at Ft. Meade, somewhat less than the Pentagon, which houses somew hat more than 20,000 personnel. Other published estimates that NSA has between 38,000 and 52,000 em ployees clearly also include the personnel of the Central Security Service military components, as we ll as contractor personnel (2). NSA FACILITIES FOCUS PLAN - 1989 (3) NSA conducted the most significant upgrade of NSA's facilities in its history, based on a blueprint, t he Facilities Focus Plan, prepared and approved in 198 9. The 1989 Facilities Focus Plan provided for the upgrading of over 2.5 million square feet of space and will involved the movement of over one-half of the NSA work force. When completed, NSA will have achie ved a long-sought goal of a minimum of 70 square feet of office space per person across NSA. In 199] alone, NSA added over one million square fe et of new space to the NSA inventory by opening the new REE Building, the SPL state-of-the-art micr oelectronics Production Facility, the System Processing Center, and the Columbia Annex. These fa cilities were occupied by thousands of NSA employees. In addition, the total renovation of the Headquarters Building was 60 percent complete and the offices were partially re-occupied, providing w ork space for another 1,000-plus employees. As NSA moved people into these new spaces, the areas they leave were fully renovated and other employees moved into expanded spaces, (a process NSA called \" decompression\"). In 1992 NSA completed the renovation of SAB I for parts of ISL and begin the renovations of FANX 2 for the National Cryptologic School and FANX 3 for another key component. In addition to executing the Facilities Focus Plan, many other major facilities projects are under way or have been completed. The Twin Towers Utility Upgrad e on the Headquarters Building provided improved air conditioning for people and equipment. The 3,000-ton Chiller Plant constructed in front of the Headquarters Building provided much-needed cool ing for OPS I occupants. The Chiller Plant's Main Distribution Loop delivers over 430,000 gallons of chilled water per hour to OPS 1.

Extensive asbestos removal was conducted in OPS I and the Hea dquarters Building to provide an asbestos-free environment for NSA employees. Upgrades in 1991 and 1992 included the installation of additional landscaping and efforts to repaint a nd clean up the corridors prior to President Bush's vi sit in 1991, along with the addition of a marble si gnpost at the intersection of Route 32 and Canine Road, an d the redecorating of the OPS 2B lobby — all of which were intended to \"create a dignified and prof essional look,\" at NSA. But some work spaces remained overcrowded and unattractive (with some of fices working under such crowded conditions that everyone in each row must interrupt their work to m ove each time a teammate enters or exits the aisle) . Work space requirements and safety regulations were not complied with. NSA DRAWDOWN PLAN - 1992 (4) In 1991 NSA planners anticipated possible personnel and Operations and Maintenance budget cuts, and began planning for reduced lease, utility, and faci lity support costs commensurate with projected budg et reductions. The NSA Drawdown Plan was approved by t he Critical Issues Group (the current Board of Directors) in January 1992, briefed to and approved by DIRNSA in February 1992, and presented to and approved by several Congressional staffs in March 1 992, The Plan's strategy focused on the reduction of nin e leased buildings. This would not only decrease re nt and utility costs, but also such facility support c osts as security, grounds, maintenance, bus service , mail runs, and local travel time. Another major goal of the plan is to accommodate th e 1992 NSA agency restructure by consolidating several key components into fewer buildings, bringi ng many of the elements in closer proximity to NSA Headquarters at Ft. Meade and enhancing the efficie ncy of SIGINT resources and support services. The Technology and Systems Organization will be housed in NBP 1, R&E, and CANX; Operations elements are to be consolidated at the Ft. Meade complex. Se veral Support Services elements will be relocated t o the OPS 3 and APS 20 buildings, and the Information Systems Security Organization will be consolidated in FANX 3 and OPS 3. Over the course of the four year implementation, th e Drawdown Plan will affect 21 NSA-owned or leased buildings — over 1.2 million square feet wil l be involved — and 506 organizations, ranging from 10 to 200 people will be moved. The plan compromises m ore than 1,700 activities, ranging from building designs and construction to furniture and communica tions installation to the actual organizational mov es. The plan is further complicated by over 3,000 const raints, or dependent activities. Constraints are activities that must precede or succeed one another . Therefore, if one activity is delayed, it can del ay another activity, which in turn delays two more act ivities, which in turn delay several more activitie s, and so on and so on... These constraints, combined with the large volume of work to be accomplished, are what make this plan so complex. From the beginning, the Drawdown Plan assumed an ag gressive schedule. However, since the original plan was devised, two major changes occurred. The first involved a key aspect of the plan, the le asing of NBP 1. Prior to the 1992 NSA reorganizatio n, the building had been completely designed for its n ew occupants, the majority of whom were coming directly from the OPS 1, OPS 2B, and APS 20 buildin gs However, as a result of the Agency"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"122 BIG BROTHER NSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" reorganization, the slated occupants of the buildin g completely changed; elements from throughout NSA were scheduled to move to NBP I, home of the new Te chnology and Systems Organization This meant that the floor plans, seating arrangements, communi cations systems, etc, had to be readjusted. The Drawdown team was able to rectify the situation wit h no delay to the already tight schedule. The second major alteration involved the relocation of the Naval Security Croup (NSC) from its Nebraska Avenue headquarters to OPS 3, a direct res ult of the Federal Base Closure Act. Prior to the decision to relocate NSG, FANX 3 was scheduled to b e rehabbed, floor by floor, over the course of 3 years. However, because DDI personnel must vacate t heir OPS 3 spaces to make room for the 1995 arrival of NSG, the rehab of FANX 3, DDI's new home , must be completed in 18 months. This aggressive schedule requires that the entire FANX 3 building be empty during the rehab. The Drawdown Plan had to be altered to allow for temporary reten tion of ITB and indefinite retention of APS 20 to accommodate the FANX 3 personnel. This major revisi on did not lengthen the original 4-year Drawdown schedule The NSA Drawdown Plan includes the termination of l eases for FANX 1, APS 8, and APS 9; the complete renovation and occupancy of FANX 2; the co nsolidation of the National Cryptologic School in FANX 2; the consolidation of the Operations Organiz ation in the Headquarters complex; and the transfer of all personnel from FANX 3 in preparation of the building rehab, with scheduled completion by mid-1995. Equally significant is the complete interior constr uction and occupancy of NBP 1 When leased in 1992, NBP 1 was essentially a \"hollow building.\" Crews ha d to construct everything from floors and ceilings to heating and air conditioning systems to communicati on lines and sprinkler systems to walls and furnitu re. By late 1996, the plan's scheduled completion date, NSA will fully reoccupy the newly renovated FANX 3 and termination of leases for Parkway Center, APS 5, APS 10, APS 11, APS 13, and the International Tower Building. The implementation of the NSA Space Drawdown Plan r equired the combined efforts of many organizations — the Support Services Organization f or design, construction, maintenance, custodial, transportation, furnishings, and security operation s; the Army Corps of Engineers for project lease management; the Technology and Systems Organization for communications fit-up and support, the Plans, Policy, and Programs Organization for financ ial programming and budgeting. Focusing on quality customer support, the Space Dra wdown Plan tries to minimize the inconvenience to NSA personnel as much as possible. Other than the t ime required to pack and unpack, moves are completed overnight, with minimal office downtime W henever possible, customers may retain their telephone numbers at their new location And, althou gh double (and sometimes triple) moves are occasionally necessary, the team takes great pains not to \"hopscotch\" their customers all over the Age ncy The NSA Space Drawdown Plan is a team effort, requi ring the coordination of many different Agency elements, which continued until the final move was completed in late 1996. FORT GEORGE G. MEADE Ft. Meade, Maryland Fort Meade's mission is to provide a wide range of support to 56 tenant organizations from all four services and to several federal agencies. Major ten ant units include the National Security Agency (NSA ), the US Army Intelligence and Security Command, the Naval Security Group Activity, and the 694th Intelligence Wing (US Air Force)."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"THE BIGGEST SECRET IN THE WORLD — THE NSA 123 Fort George G. Meade, Maryland, is an Army installa tion dedicated to providing support to servicemen, women, DoD civilians and their families. Located mi dway between the cities of Baltimore, Washington, DC, and Annapolis, near the communities of Odenton, Laurel and Columbia, The installation lies four miles east of Interstate 95 and one-half mile east of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway between Maryland State Routes 175 and 198. Fort Meade is ho me to approximately 9,200 military personnel as well as 29,000 civilian employees. Approximately 7, 500 family members reside on post. The economic impact of Fort Meade to local civilian communities is approximately $2 billion annually. This reaches the community in the form of $300 million in military p ayroll, $1.2 billion in civilian payroll, and nearl y $500 million in contracts. Virtually a city in itself, F ort Meade has 65 miles of paved roads, and 28 miles of secondary roads and 1,670 buildings. There is also a bank, modern exchange mall, credit union, post office, hospital, chapels and many other facilities . Fort George G. Meade became an Army installation in 1917. Authorized by an Act of Congress in May 1917, it was one of 16 cantonments built for troops drafted for the war with the Central Powers in Europe. The present Maryland site was selected on J une 23, 1917. Actual construction began in July. Th e first contingent of troops arrived here that Septem ber. The post was originally named Camp Meade for Major General George Gordon Meade, whose defensive strategy at the Battle of Gettysburg proved a major factor in turning the tide of the Civil War i n favor of the North. During World War I, more than 100,000 men passed through Fort Meade, a training s ite for three infantry divisions, three training battalions and one depot brigade. In 1928, when the post was renamed Fort Leonard Woo d, Pennsylvanians registered such a large protest that the installation was permanently named Fort Ge orge G. Meade on 5 March 1929. This action was largely the result of a rider attached to the Regul ar Army Appropriation Act by a member of the House of Representatives from the Keystone State. Fort Meade became a training center during World War II. Its ranges and other facilities were used by more than 200 units and approximately 3,500,000 men between 1942 and 1946. The wartime peak-military personnel figure at Fort Meade was reached in March, 1945-70,000. With the conclusion of World War II, F ort Meade reverted to routine peacetime activities, but later returned to build-up status. Many crises, including Korea, West Berlin and Cuba, along with Vietnam-related problems, were to come. One key post-World War II event at Fort Meade was t he transfer of the Second US Army Headquarters from Baltimore, on 15 June 1947. This transfer brou ght an acceleration of post activity because Second Army Headquarters exercised command over Army units throughout a then seven state area. A second important development occurred on 1 January 1966, w hen the Second US Army merged with the First US Army, The consolidated headquarters moved from F ort Jay, NY, to Fort Meade to administer activities of Army installations in a 15-state area . In August 1990, Fort Meade began processing Army Re serve and National Guard units from several states for the presidential call-up in support of O peration Desert Shield. In addition to processing R eserve and National Guard units, Fort Meade sent two activ e duty units-the 85th Medical Battalion and the 519th Military Police Battalion-to Saudi Arabia. In all, approximately 2,700 personnel from 42 units deployed from Fort Meade during Operation Desert Sh ield/Desert Storm. The National Security Agency was established by pre sidential directive on 4 November 1952. In 1957 NSA consolidated its headquarters operations at For t George G. Meade, Maryland. Its headquarters complex at Fort Meade is dominated by two high-rise buildings completed in 1986 and dedicated by then President Ronald Reagan in a special ceremony. The complex includes an operations building, a technica l library and other facilities which house logistics and support activities.

The remainder are civilians who are permanently assigned and who reside in the Baltimore/Washington area. A large number of the agency's semi-skilled and cle rical employees have been drawn from the local area . NSA has developed special educational programs, in conjunction with local high schools, to help prepar e students for employment with the agency. NSA works with US employment offices and civic groups in the area to promote employment of the handicapped. Graduates coming from high schools and college campuses may move into one of three broadly defined professional occupational areas. Some specialize i n cryptology (making and testing US codes and ciphers ), others become specialists in the data-processing fields, and the remainder (especially mathematician s, scientists and engineers) will work in research and development. NSA has always placed great emphasis on the trainin g and development of its people. The establishment of the National Cryptologic School as a separate pr ofessional structure is a true symbol of this conce rn and represents further enhancement of the agency's already extensive training activities.

Menwith Hill Harrowgate, UK Menwith Hill in the UK is the principal NATO theate r ground segment node for high altitude signals intelligence satellites (16). Although this facilit y is jointly operated with the UK's General Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), GCHQ is not pri vy to the intelligence down-linked to Menwith Hill, since tapes containing the data are returned via air to the United States for analysis. Menwith Hill Station was established in 1956 by the US Army Security Agency (ASA). Inside the closely-guarded 560 acre base are two large operati ons blocks and many satellite tracking dishes and domes. I n i t ia l operations focused on monitoring int ernational cable and microwave communications passing through Britain. In the early 1960s Menwith Hill was one of the first sites in the world to re ceive sophisticated early IBM computers, with which NSA a utomated the labor-intensive watch-list scrutiny of intercepted but unenciphered telex messages. Since then, Menwith Hill has sifted the international messages, telegrams, and telephone calls of citizen s, corporations or governments to select information of political, military or economic value to the United States. Every detail of Menwith Hill's operations has been kept an absolute secret. The official cover story i s that the all-civilian base is a Department of Defense co mmunications station. The British Ministry of Defen ce describe Menwith Hill as a \"communications relay ce ntre.\" Like all good cover stories, this has a stro ng element of truth to it.

The British government constr ucted new communications facilities and buildings for STEEPLEBUSH, worth L7.4 million. The expansion plan includes a 50,000 square foot extension to the Operations Building and new genera tors to provide 5 Megawatts of electrical power. The purpose of the new construction was to boost an cater for an 'expanded mission' of satellite surveillance.

Rosman Research Station Rosman, NC The Rosman Research Station is located in the Pisga h National Forest of North Carolina's Smoky Mountains, near Balsam Grove, NC, off Route 215 app roximately 11 kilometers north of Route 64. The station, which closed in 1994, was operated by appr oximately 250 NSA, Bendix Field Engineering and TRW employees. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration b egan operations at the Rosman Spaceflight Tracking Station in 1963, and ceased activities the re in January 1981. During NASA's tenure the statio n supported a number of space projects, including the Apollo and Apollo-Soyuz missions. The station at Rosman was turned over to the General Services Admi nistration by NASA on 1 February 1981, The facility was converted by the Department of Defense for use as a Communications Research Station, a process which was completed in early July 1981. Ini tially there were approximately 35 contract personn el living in the area, but when the project became ope rational in July, this number increased to approximately 75 employees. The NSA role at Rosman apparently began almost immediately thereafter. By 1985 this number was reported to have grown to 2 50 employees, with annual payroll at $5 million, an average of $20,000 a year [The Asheville Citizen 20 June 1985]. For FY85 NSA requested $500,000 for construction of an electric substation to provide a dditional electric transformer capacity that is req uired to support station operations. It is difficult to asce rtain the total number of satellite receiving anten na at the facility. These at least include two very large dis hes, approximately 27.5 feet in diameter (the size of the biggest dish left by NASA), and a smaller 6.2 meter radome. The Rosman Station was used to intercept telephone and other communications traffic carried by commercial and other communications satellites in g eostationary orbit over the Western hemisphere. Potential targets of interest could include Latin A merican military, diplomatic and commercial traffic as well as domestic US traffic and drug traffickers in the Caribbean. 1.

He served in various Army commands and received numerous decorations includin g the Distinguished Service Medal, the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, and the Legion of Mer it. General Canine died in March 1969 at age 73. • RADM Jefferson R. Dennis, USN, was Deputy Director of Operations at NSA when he died in February 1958 at age 49. Admiral Dennis had a long and distinguished career in Navy cryptology, including Commander, Naval Security Group. • Dr. Howard T. Engstrom was Deputy Director of NSA f rom October 1957 to August 1958. Dr. Engstrom died in November 1964 at age 65. He served in the Navy, attaining the rank of Captain, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal. Dr . Engstrom also served as Deputy Director of Research and Development for NSA. • LTGEN Graves B. Erskine, USMC, died in 1973 at the age of 76. Though General Erskine never served at NSA, he was Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Special Operations, who oversaw NSA in its early days. He later was the DOD represe ntative to the United States Communications Security Board. General Erskine had a long and dist inguished career in the Marine Corps. During World War II he was awarded the Distinguished Servi ce Medal, the Silver Star, and the Legion of Merit. • Henry I.

The y have included a photo of the Menwith Hill, OK, project, with the following caption: \"Overseas collection site with c overed antennae.\" One of the other foreign NSA observation/listening posts is located in Alice Springs, Australia. This linked facility (owned by the NSA) is also known as \"Pine Gap.\" Jus t to bring you up to speed on Pine Gap operations, 1 am extrac ting several quotations from the excellent 554-page refe rence book, The U.S. Intelligence Community, Third Edition (1995), by Jeffrey T Richelson, published by Westview Press , Inc. I will be quoting Richelson through a number of chapt ers in this book, but the following comes from the chapter titled \"Signals Intelligence,\" beginning at p. 180. RHYOLITE/AQUACADE and MAGNUM satellites have been controlled since the beginning of their r espec- tive programs from a facility in Alice Springs, Aus tralia, commonly known as Pine Gap. Officially, the facilit y is the Joint Defence Space Research Facility and is co de- named MERINO. The facility consists of seven large radomes, a huge computer room, and about twenty other support buildings. The radomes (which resembl e gigantic golf balls with one of the ends sliced off ) are made of Perspex and mounted on a concrete structure . They were intended to protect the enclosed antennas against dust, wind, and rain and to hide some of th e operational elements of the antennas from Soviet im aging satellites. The first two radomes at Pine Gap were installed in 1968 and remain the facility's largest. . . .The se venth radome, which was built in 1980, houses a second co m- munications terminal."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"THE BIGGEST SECRET IN THE WORLD — THE NSA 151 Originally, the main computer room was about 210 square feet, but it was expanded twice in the 1970s to its present size—about 60,000 square feet. Its imme nse size requires that operators at each end of the roo m communicate with each other using headphones. . . .The Signals Analysis Section is staffed solely by CIA personnel—no Australian citizens or contractor personnel are included. Many of the individuals in the section are linguists who monitor the voice interce pts. As of January 1986 there were 557 people employed at Pine Gap—273 Australians and 284 Americans. Although in theory Pine Gap is a joint facility, th e fifty- fifty relationship holds only with respect to the g ross number of personnel and is achieved by counting Aus - tralian housemaids, cooks, and gardeners who work a t the base as \"equal\" to the CIA personnel who conduc t the actual operation. . . .Two other major control stations are located i n the United Kingdom and Germany. In 1972-1974 NSA began augmenting its listening posts at Menwith Hill (whi ch it took over from the Army in 1966) and Bad Aibling , West Germany, to permit the planned CHALET system to downlink its intercepted communications to those sites. Information received at either location can be transmitted directly via DSCS satellite to Fort Meade [emphasis added]. Outside Input In case you may be considering the possibility that only right-wing radicals and/or Christians are concerned about the way things are headed with the tracking, spying , listening, surveillence techniques of the NSA and its sister o rganizations (see the next chapter), I will share a few comments /articles from the \"loyal opposition,\" neither Christian nor right wing. An article by Charles Dupree appeared in the public ation, Claustrophobia, August 1993, Vol. 2, No. 7. Here is what is said about Dupree:"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"152 BIQ BROTHER NSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" "},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"THE BIGGEST SECRET IN THE WORLD — THE NSA 153 Approximate location of NSA's Alice Springs/Pine Ga p facility."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"154 BIG BROTHER NSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" Charles Dupree writes user documentation for a Silicon Valley software company. In recent years he has become concerned at the intrusive power of the National Security Agency, but this is probably just the effect of his antisocial habit of reading [emph asis added]. The Internet address for this article, titled \"MSA: The Eyes of Big Brother,\" is: (http://www.austinlinks.com/Crypto/claustrophobia.h tml) After referencing his resources (primarily the book s we have already mentioned), he makes some pertinent observa tions connecting what is occurring in this arena to the B ig Brother's activities in the Orwell book, 1984. Then the following topics are discussed: The Creation of the MSA; Watching an d Listening; Project Shamrock; The Huston Plan; Proje ct Minaret; and concluding with Uncontrolled Activitie s. The MSA doesn't appear to be controlled by or answer to anybody, even Congressional committees inquiring about their concern with the legality of their operations. . . accordin g to Dupree's article, such a concern never crossed their minds ( and probably was the least of their concerns). The MSA has taken care to be sure that they are exempted from the same legal restrictions concerning US citizens and eavesdroppi ng without the wiretap authorization that regulates ot her agencies, corporations, and individuals. In an inquiry by one of these committees, Dupree re ports: \". . .CIA director William Colby had testified that the MSA was not always able to separate the calls of CIS citize ns from the traffic it monitors. The general counsel of the MSA, Roy Banner, joined Allen as witness. He was as ked if, in his opinion, the MSA could legally intercept overseas telephone calls from U.S. citizens despite the legal pro- hibition on wiretapping. He replied, 'That is correct.'. . .When the committee's chief counsel said to Allen, 'You b elieve you are consistent with the statutes, but there is not any statute that prohibits your interception of domestic commun i-"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"THE BIGGEST SECRET IN THE WORLD — THE NSA 155 cations.' When deputy director Buffham was asked about the legality of domestic aspects of the Huston Plan , he said, 'Legality? That particular aspect didn't enter into the dis- cussions.' \" [Emphasis added.] Dupree begins his conclusion with the following ast ute observation: The unchecked ability to intercept and read communi - cations, including those of U.S. citizens within th e country, would be dangerous even if carefully regulated by e lected officials held to a public accounting. And finally, Dupree concludes with a statement by S enator Schweiker of one of the committees investigating th e MSA. Senator Schweiker of the Church committee asked NSA director Allen if it were possible to use NSA's capabilities \"to monitor domestic conversations wit hin the United States if some person with malintent des ired to do it,\" and was probably not surprised by Allen' s \"1 suppose that such a thing is technically possible.\" Cer- tainly Senator Church feared the possibility: \"That capability at any time could be turned around on the American people and no American would have any privacy left, such is the capability to monitor everything: telephone conversations, telegrams, it doesn't matter. There would be no place to hide. If this government ever became a tyranny, if a dictator ever took charge in this country, the tech- nological capacity that the intelligence community has given the government could enable it to impose tota l tyranny, and there would be no way to fight back, b ecause the most careful effort to combine together in resi stance to the government, no matter how privately it was d one, is within the reach of the government to know. Such is the capability of this technology. \"I don't want to see this country ever go across th e"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"156 BIG BROTHER NSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" bridge. I know the capability that is there to make tyranny total in America, and we must see to it that this a gency and all agencies that possess this technology opera te within the law and under proper supervision, so tha t we never cross over that abyss. That is the abyss from which there is no return. ...\" [Emphasis added.] And that was written some time ago, before the NSA' s latest increase in supercomputers! Imagine what the Senato r might say if this were written today, knowing that the NS A now measures its computer power by the \"acre.\" Senator Schweiker was inferring with absolute accuracy the informatio n implied by the hearings with the NSA's leaders and counsel, and he also accurately extrapolated that information to it s ultimate conclusion, if left to continue uncontrolled and un supervised, with no accountability to the citizens and/or Congr ess. Again, I urge you to visit the website cited above and obtain copies of this article. In June, 1992, the Houston Chronicle requested an inter- view with the NSA to discuss NSA's activities regar ding cryptography. Apparently NSA wasn't willing to have a face- to-face interview with the Chronicle's reporter, but to further their \"we-have-nothing-to-hide\" image, agreed to an swer in writing questions presented to them. (See the next two pages.) The October 12, 1996, edition of The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon's, major newspaper, contained an article by John Hendren (Associated Press) titled \"A career of secr ecy.\" It deals with companies trying to safeguard financial trans- actions. The sidebar reads: \"A company founded by a n ex- researcher of the National Security Agency develops high- tech keys to keep transactions private.\" Doug Kozla y was the founder of Information Resource Engineering, and he seems to have pushed ALL the right buttons on every front , although he obviously views each as \"progress\" and a boon to mankind in the future. . .which if you have read my previou s book, The Mark of the New World Order, you will recognize as NOW!"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"THE BIGGEST SECRET IN THE WORLD - THE NSA 157 "},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"158 BIG BROTHER NSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" "},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"THE BIGGEST SECRET IN THE WORLD — THE NSA 159 Here is a quote from the article.

Four million times a year, Uncle Sam makes computer - ized payments totaling $2 trillion to private compa nies. Not a dollar goes through unless the electronic key Kozlay invented turns in an electronic lock, verify ing that the transaction is authentic and hacker-free. [Auth or's note: That sounds as if you are putting all your eg gs in one basket and trusting Mr. Kozlay with the supposedly only key. Then he tells us how safe it is.

There is much information available about the \"clip - per-chip\" and other devices to gain access to so-ca lled \"private\" information.] A former researcher for the cloak-and-dagger National Security Agency, Kozlay turned espionage into entrepreneurship and founded Information Resou rce Engineering in 1983. He makes the codes and scram- bling devices that let seven of the nation's top 10 banks and 1,400 European financial institutions and finan cial transactions safely across computer networks. . . . Kozlay ponders issues such as what money will look like in the future. He carries one likely form : a proto- type electronic checkbook. People are counterfeiting checks using a lot of new technology that everybody has access to today, such as personal computers and laser printers, he said. He envisions future consumers using electronic cash cards with all the anonymity and easy spending of paper money. He sees us wearing tiny personal computers as we now wear wristwatches [emphasis added]."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"160 BIG BROTHER NSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" Biometrics—A Rapidly Growing Industry Biometrics — it no longer sounds like a term from the latest sci-fi movie. In fact, the concept has been develop ed and implemented in many different areas of business, ba nking, government, etc. Why? Because as technology progres ses toward the end times, absolute positive identificat ion will be mandatory. A machine is unable to tell if a piece o f paper or plastic is really presented to it by you, rather than just another stolen document. Therefore, it must have so me kind of link to a part of your physical anatomy. . . som ething that is unique only to you. Presently, equipment is tied in to your fingerprints, palm prints, eyes (retinal scanning), thermal scanning of the blood vessels in your face (a face scan), voice recognition, DNA genotyping, and some others which the high-tech industries have implemented in the cause of security and limited access. As with any new technology, lots of people want to get in on the ground floor and advance to the cutting edge , where the monetary proceeds loom large. (If you are consi dering an investment in such an enterprise, please be warn ed: these newer companies may be obsolete before time to pay their first dividends, especially if they are not adequat ely able to fund research and development to stay ahead of the curve. At present, technology is doubling about every 18 m onths. These high-tech corporations see the handwriting on the wall, and they are doing all the research and development they can to try to advance with the rapidly moving progr ess; other- wise, they will be producing things that are no lon ger needed, or can no longer be used.)

They claim that membership is inexpen- sive and urge anyone to join who could benefit from infor- mation about this technology. The media has not overlooked the importance of biom etrics and its possible future implications. The E. E. Times Online, February 2, 1997, Issue: 939, contained an article by Larry Lange titled: \"Biometry: Human-Tracking System goes global,\" with a dateline of Stanford, California. Biometric identification using such technologies as fingerprint and retinal scanning is well under way worldwide. After debuting in Australia in 1987, national computerized fingerprint systems exist in several countries. The Japanese telco giant NTT is developing a fingerprint-recognition method, and th e U.S. Department of Energy's Sandia National Labora- tories is assessing equipment from several vendors in the retinal scanning industry, including EyeDentify (Baton Rouge, LA) and Recognition Systems, Inc. (Ca mp- bell, CA). Transponder technology is routinely implanted in animals; the pet market most predominantly, at 3 million ID chips and counting. LifeChip, produced b y the Destron Fearing Corp.

Available for $10 at l ocal animal shelters, the chips are small enough to inje ct with a syringe, and the ID number is read by a handheld scanner.

Even ski resorts are p utting the chips inside lift tickets. Widespread tracking of human beings is not far away. The Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) [funded by the MSA] recently awarded Eagle Eye Technologies (Oak Hill, VA) a contract to build a bracelet-sized mobile terminal designed for compatibility with existing satellite communication systems. The contract is overseen by the U.S. Army Space and Strategic Defense Command at Huntsville, AL. Suggested uses, according to Eagle Eye, include \"tracking Alzheimer's patients, childr en, executives, probationers and parolees, and military personnel\"— a market that could conceivably EN- COMPASS THE WORLD'S entire populace in just a few decades. So-called smart cards are widely catching on, too. The DoD's Multi Technology Automated Reader Card (MARC) looks to \"record, revise, and transfer medical-trea tment data\" and store soldiers' \"readiness information,\" such as personal, legal, and medical information.

NSA Enters the Picture Now, you might be asking just how the NSA ties in w ith all this, especially on a global scale, supported b y GS tax- payers' funds. Below is another article obtained fr om the Internet titled \"Spying,\" originating in Great Brit ain. The GS citizens definitely are not the only ones concerned with the activities of the NSA, particularly in Europe and o ther global sites. Read these concerns, expressed from England. Who runs Britain? It's not really a trick question; I'm not after \"The 100 biggest multi-nationals who con- trol 85% of world trade and most of the governments ,\" not \"The llluminati\" nor \"Thatcher!

The areas in question are electronic listening posts operated by the American National Security Agency (NSA), the most famous of which is that at Menwith Hill near Harrogate in North Yorkshire, although the NSA does operate other posts, including one in the West Country and a brand new ultra high-tech operation a t Edzell in Scotland. Menwith Hill has been the scene of repeated protest trespasses by a local woman, a Ms. Percy; the Ministry of Defence has been trying for some ye ars to get a British Court to issue an injunction banni ng Ms."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"THE BIGGEST SECRET IN THE WORLD — THE NSA 165 Percy from the site. However, although the MoD oste nsibly owns the site (they requisitioned the hill during t he war), they do not occupy it, and they refuse to say who d oes; courts in the past have refused to grant an injunct ion against trespassers unless the occupier of the land applied. The NSA, not \"officially\" occupying the la nd, didn't want to appear in open court, hence Ms. Perc y's irritating picnics continued. The MoD is now having another crack at an injunction, this time in the Hi gh Court. Amongst other issues the Court will effectiv ely have to rule on whether Britain has sovereignty ove r foreign bases on our soil. But the Court will have to reach its decisions with no official information about th e base, its operations, its inhabitants, even other bases o r establishments with which it might come into contac t— because Malcolm Rifkind, the Defence Secretary, has issued a public interest immunity certificate preve nting the disclosure of any relevant information to the C ourt, or anyone else. So British Courts aren't allowed to know about these activities on British soil. Max Madden, MP for nearby Bradford West, asked to look around the base; he was told it \"wasn't appropriate.\" MPs from both sides of the Commons have asked questions about the NSA in Parliament; no answers have been forth- coming. The question has to be \"Does the Government know what's going on inside these bases?\" and if it doesn't know, how on earth can it control it? What I can tell you that a British Court can't hear, is that the NSA and the British GCHQ (the Government Communications Headquarters) are working together and are both upgrading their operations to monitor British and European telecommunications.

This new development of an ongoing project is known as Steeplebush 2, but don't tell anybody 'cus that's a secret. What isn't secret, and what plants all this firmly in the flesh of reality rather than paranoia, is that the Govern- ment has finally done the \"decent\" thing and placed GCHQ's spying on its own citizens on a legal footin g. The Intelligence Services Act 1995 allows GCHQ to \"monitor or interfere with electromagnetic, acousti c, or other emissions\" without a warrant, or Home Office permission, or even a Court order of course. Over i n the States it's also no secret that the American Govern ment has for some years now been frantically pressuring computer manufacturers to manufacture chips and software that cannot hold a code that the Government cannot read.

It protects government communications by enciphering [encoding/encrypting] messages and taki ng other measures to ensure their secrecy. In its fore ign intelligence function, the MSA marshals a vast corp s of intelligence analysts who use sensitive electronic equip- ment to monitor, decipher, and translate the commun i- cations of foreign governments. It could follow spa ce rocket launchings in the former USSR and can overhe ar conversations between aircraft pilots and ground-co ntrol personnel in remote areas of the globe.

The group has representation from over 50 civilian and defens e agencies [now it is over 200]. Its main goal is to stimulate the development of reliable, reasonably priced biometrics through the establishment of testing standards, test beds, and education. The Consortium can be seen at its new location on the worldwide web. [Emphasis added.] NSA Is Behind the National ID Card The NSA is a major supporter of the Biometric Conso rtium, both in encouragement and funding, and they are beh ind all the efforts to identify us nationwide! NSA funds th e FBI's NCIC 2000 program. . .which, in turn, funds all sta te DMV's to promote the new drivers' licenses/voter registra tions (\"motor/voter\" national ID cards). It's just one bi g web, and the NSA is the spider! In 1993, the National Security Agency created yet a nother sister organization (see the next chapter for other \"sisters\" of the NSA) at its main facility in Fort Meade, Mar yland. . ."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"THE BIGGEST SECRET IN THE WORLD — THE NSA 169 one that specializes in the biometric identificatio n of people. It was named the \"Biometrics Consortium.\" Mr. Joe C ampbell, Senior Electronics Engineer, is in charge (the full address, phone/fax numbers, website, and E-mail addresses we re printed above). According to NSA's \"party line/hype,\" the Biometric s Consortium was formed in 1993 for precisely the sam e reasons given in the above article from Advanced Card and Identification Technology Sourcebook. With those stated goals in mind, just why is our government so intensely in terested in \"biometrics\"? And what does the term mean, anywa y? I've told you about some of the current methods routinel y used, but I need to fill in the gaps with a more comprehe nsive study. The term biometrics is defined as \"automated methods of verifying or recognizing the identity of a living p erson based on physiological or behavioral characteristic s\" [bold emphasis added]. Physiological characteristics are: finger- prints, hand geometry, eye retinal patterns, and fa cial features. In addition to the physiological characteristics, t here are reliable behavioral characteristics that are unique to you and no one else. They include: signatures, voice patter ns, and computer keyboard keystroke dynamics. Why would the government want to act as a central clearing house for these identification methodologies? Well, it should be obvious by now that the government wants to positively identify you so it can positively CONTROL YOU! So, there you have it! Not only is the NSA already storing nearly all available personal information on us in its databases that's been collected, consolidated, and centralized from various civilian and military networks globally (in cluding credit reporting agencies, the OS Postal Service, d river's license bureaus, and others), they now are funding, control- ling, and orchestrating many new \"civilian and defe nse\" programs designed to \"stimulate the development\" of better ways to positively identify us. It should be obvious that no one will be able to escape their system. Note above how the NSA informs us of their reason for creating this new"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"170 BIG BROTHER NSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" agency in the first place: Indeed, it was formed \"t o provide a central organization for the GS Government's interest in biometric technology.\" What this actually means (in all practical reality) is that the NSA is now planning to consoli- date, take charge of, and orchestrate all identification matters in the United States. Remember, the key word here is CENTRALIZE. In other words, the NSA will con- trol all identification data on everyone from its d ata- bases at Fort Meade! It is my sincere opinion that in the future, NSA will be \"centralizing\" this data on a g lobal scale; in fact, we know that they already are involved in much intelli- gence-gathering on foreign soil, all of which is co llected and funneled into the main database at Fort Meade. Various dictionaries define the word centralize as: \"To bring to a central point or under central control. . .to converge, to consolidate, to come together as one, to focalize, to stream- line, to unify, to join, to confederate, to nationalize\" [empha- sis added]. In addition, the word central is defined as \"consti- tuting or being near a center.\" Therefore, we shoul d under- stand clearly from this that it is the stated GOAL of the \"almighty\" MSA to become the principal identification authority in America! Look out, America, here comes the satanically enslaving Mew World Order! Big Brother isn't coming. . .he's already here! More Information About the Biometrics Consortium If we haven't proven our case that the NSA owns the Bio- metric Consortium, it won't be difficult to do. The \"G.S.

This growth in el ectronic transactions has resulted in a greater demand for f ast and accurate user identification and authentication . Biometric technology is a way to achieve fast, user - friendly authentication with a high level of accura ry. This presentation will highlight some of the benefits of using biometrics for authentication. Emerging application s, both within the Government and industry, will be di s- cussed. Also presented will be an overview of the C IS Government Biometric Consortium and how this group is bringing together technologists from Government and industry to work together on improved standards. The next section in their paper is called Overview, and it is possibly more than you want to know, but for tho se who are interested in details, I am duplicating it in i ts entirety. Biometrics are automated methods of recognizing a person based on a physiological or behavioral chara cter- istic. Examples of human traits used for biometric recog- nition include fingerprints, speech, face, retina, iris, hand- written signature, hand geometry, and wrist veins. Bio- metric recognition can be used in identification mode, where the biometric system identifies a person from the entire enrolled population by searching a database for a match. A system also can be used in verification mode, where the biometric system authenticates a person's claimed identity from his/her previously enrolled p attern. Using biometrics for identifying and authenticating human beings offers some unique advantages. Only biometri c authentication bases an identification on an intrin sic part of a human being. Tokens, such as smart cards [in w hich they also are involved heavily], magnetic stripe ca rds, physical keys, and so forth [or any combination of the above], can be lost, stolen, duplicated, or left at home [the next step, of course, is the biochip implant—t o coin a current slogan, \"You can't leave home without it! \"]."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"186 BIG BROTHER MSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" Passwords can be forgotten, shared, or observed. Wh ile all biometric systems have their own advantages and disadvantages, there are some common characteristic s needed to make a biometric system usable. First, th e biometric must be based upon a distinguishable trai t. [I reported earlier in this chapter about the check printing company that was incorporating a photo, in digital format, for your personal checks. No one could see your pic ture, not even you, but when you cash the check, it is fe d into a machine that reads the digitized photo and prints it on a screen for visual verification.] For example, for nearly a century, law enforcement has used fingerprints to identify people. There is a great deal of scientifi c data supporting the idea that \"no two fingerprints are a like.\" Newer methods, even those with a great deal of scie ntific support, such as DNA-based genetic matching [just another form of biometrics], sometimes do not hold up in court. Another key aspect is how user-friendly is the system. Most people find it acceptable to have thei r pictures taken by video cameras or to speak into a micro- phone. In the United States, using a fingerprint se nsor does not seem to be much of a problem. In some othe r countries, however, there is strong cultural opposi tion to touching something that has been touched by many other people. While cost is always a concern, most imple- mented today are sophisticated enough to understand that it is not only the initial cost of the sensor or the matching software that is involved. Often, the life -cycle support cost of providing system administration sup port and an enrollment operator can overtake the initial cost of the hardware. Also of key importance is accuracy . Some terms that are used to describe the accuracy o f bio- metric systems include false-acceptance rate (percentage of imposters accepted), false-rejection rate (percentage of authorized users rejected), and equal-error rate (when the decision threshold is adjusted so that the false-ac cept- ance rate equals the false-rejection rate). When di scussing"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"THE BIGGEST SECRET IN THE WORLD — THE NSA 187 the accuracy of a biometric system, it is often ben eficial to talk about the equal-error rate or at least to c onsider the false-acceptance rate and false-rejection rate together. For many systems, the threshold can be adjusted to ensure that virtually no imposters will be accepted . Un- fortunately, this often means an unreasonably high number of authorized users will be rejected. To sum marize, a good biometric system is one that is low cost, fa st, accurate, and easy to use. [Emphasis added.] Examples of Biometric Applications Again, I will be duplicating this entire section; t hereafter I will be highlighting from the sections on \"Curren t Applica- tions\" and \"Planned Applications.\" There are many examples of biometrics being used or considered in Federal, State, local, and foreign go vern- ment projects. One use is to provide robust authent ica- tion for access to computer systems containing sens itive information used by the military services, intellig ence agencies, and other security-critical Federal organ iza- tions. Physical access control to restricted areas is another key application. There are many law enforce - ment applications, mostly for fingerprint recogniti on, at the Federal, State, and local levels. Other law enf orce- ment applications include home incarceration and physical access control in jails and prisons. Perha ps one of the most extensive applications of biometrics is for entitlements [funds received in some way from the l ocal, state, or federal governments]. Fraud in entitlemen t programs is estimated by the General Accounting Off ice at over $10 billion per year.

Many types of financial transactions are also potential applic ations; e.g., banking by phone, banking by Internet, and bu ying and selling securities by telephone or by Internet. Fraud on cellular telephone systems has increased dramati cally and is estimated by some sources at over $1 billion per year. Biometrics are being considered to reduce thi s fraud. Telephone credit card fraud is also a signif icant problem that may benefit from the use of biometrics . There are also commercial applications for computer access control, access to web site servers, access through firewalls, and physical access control to protect s ensitive information. [Author's note: As we learned from per sonal interviews with the developers of LUCID 2000™, et al, the \"firewall\" is a device created to keep the sepa rate entities from interfering with one another's busine ss activities, i.e., the bank records from the insuran ce records, from the medical records, etc., etc. Of co urse, there would not be a need for firewalls if they did n't plan to \"centralize\" or consolidate everything in one pl ace on the same smart card, MARC card, driver's license , biochip, et al.] Here are some of the Current Applications for biome trics, some of which are common knowledge and some of whic h may surprise you.

Many commercial computer lines have sprouted from earlier designs for NSA use. A good example of this computer industry/government partnership was HAR- VEST, a cooperative project in the 1950's between N SA and IBM [note the very early NSA/1BM connection her e] to build a new, state-of-the-art second-generation gen- eral-purpose processor. To be successful, HARVEST h ad to have a super high-speed memory and high-speed tape drives, beyond anything then in existence. Dev eloped over a five-year period, the most innovative new co m- ponent of this advanced processor was TRACTOR, the high-speed tape drive system. HARVEST went on line in 1962, and it was finally retired in 1976. Since the beginning of the computer age, a partnership between NSA and the American computer industry has existed. This partnership has fostered the develop- ment of computers for cryptologic processes [Emphas is added.] Actually, quite a bit of information is presently a vailable on the Internet regarding the kinds of advanced sup ercom- puters the NSA now uses. But suffice it to say at t his point, most of NSA's high-dollar, sophisticated supercompu ting technology is based on something called nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is the technological method of creat ing ultra-small micro mechanical devices on an atomic scale. How can this be possible!?! In the Bible we are tol d that in the last days knowledge would increase, with the implica- tion that it would increase exponentially.

He will b e able to \"watch\" and control everyone and everything on earth. . . He does not have the ability that God has to be omn ipresent, so this technology will provide him with the abilit y to be \"technically\" omnipresent.

The National Security Agency Even Manufactures Some of Its Own Computer Chips The NSA even has its own \"special processing\" manuf ac- turing facility for making its own highly classifie d computer chips. NSA states in one of its published documents available on the Internet that \"NSA has exacting requirements for special computer chips. Because of the difficulty of satisfy- ing its needs on the commercial market, and because of the highly classified nature of some of the chips, in 1990 NSA opened a facility to fabricate otherwise unobtainable devices to support the needs of the DOD\" [emphasis added]. What kinds of chips are these? The NSA designed and made the Clipper Chip, the Skipjack, and the Capstone Ch ip.

The NSA is, indeed, developing a co mputer system of Orwellian proportions. New ARPA/Sematech 0.25 Micron-sized Computer Chips will be Capable of Storing One Billion Bits of Data! Sematech Corporation in Austin, Texas, now manufac- tures and markets computer chips that are 0.35 microns in size. That's equivalent to about 1 /200th the size of a s trand of human hair. If that capability alone were not en ough to boggle one's mind, Sematech is now perfecting the m anu- facturing of even smaller chips that will be about 0.25 microns in size. In 1988, Mr. Robert Noyce began leading Sematech in the development of these advanced technologies. Mr. Noyce is none other than the founder of Intel Corporation, as well as the physicist genius who invented the original silicon- chip integrated circuit. His invention brought about the entire PC revolution and led to the extensive use o f microchips in all of today's consumer products.

In oth er words, ARPA and NSA were right there helping Sematech with all the money it could handle in order to get quantum c omputing science rolling. An interesting thing about Sematec h, however, is the fact that one of its major \"partners\" is Texas Instru- ments Corporation. Coincidentally(?)

Project Lucifer: IBM's Demonic Connection to NSA During the late 1960's, IBM board chairman, Thomas Watson, Jr., set up a cryptology research group at IBM's research laboratory in Yorktown Heights, New York. Led by Horst Feistel, the research group concluded its wor k in 1971 with the development of a very advanced new CIPHER CODE named \"LUCIFER\" (the dictionary defines cipher as \"an arithmetically computable code\").

A 16-year veteran of IBM, Tuchman was asked to lead a data security products group that would transform Lucifer into a \"highly marketable commodity.\" The Lucifer Cipher was ready for market in 1974. Aided by Carl Meyer, a German-born electrical engin eer who had earned his doctorate from the University of Pennsyl- vania, Tuchman soon discovered that Lucifer would r equire \"considerable strengthening before it could withsta nd massive commercial use.\" The team then spent the following two years improving the Lucifer Cipher by giving it more comp lex functions. The strengthening process involved inten se \"val- idation,\" whereby experts would bombard Lucifer wit h sophis- ticated \"cryptanalytic\" attacks. Finally, in 1974, \"the Lucifer Cipher was ready for market.\" During the same year, the GS National Bureau of Sta ndards (NBS) decided to search for a cipher encryption met hod that could serve as a government-wide standard for the storage and transmission of data.

This is n ot one of the \"secret projects\". . . in fact, it is publicized wi dely. Dr. Creusat is a fine gentleman with the best of intentions and im peccable credentials and experience. But LUCID 2000™ inevita bly will be tied with the NSA supercomputers, so I am includ ing a very brief overview at this point. In the July/August, 1994 edition of The Narc Officer magazine, page 69ff, an article appeared titled: \"Y ear 2000 & 'L.U.C.I.D.© System': A Milestone to Curtail Terror ists and International Organized Crime.\" He gives an introdu ction spelling out all the horror stories we have heard i n the last few years, and how they have increased more recentl y, about drug deals, money laundering, organized crime, terr orists, et al.

This is where the aforementioned \"firewall\" alleged ly will be used, to prevent cross-contamination (my choice of words) between entities whose information is on the card a nd to limit who has access to which part (supposedly to protect the privacy of your many assorted transactions and prev ent unauthorized exchange of information). Next, we are given the \"curtail the terrorists and inter- national organized crime\" speech, i.e. \"Threat to t he World Security,\" \"Challenge to World Governments,\" and \"G lobal Threat to the Quality of Life.\" In this section (pa ge 70), he defines Major Drug-Producing Countries and Major Dr ug- Transit Countries, then identifies the countries in volved in either or both of these. Next he defines and identi fies Major Money Laundering Countries, followed by a report on alliances between terrorists and international organized crim e. Creusat defines and provides examples of \"Criminal organiza tion,\" and gives quite a breakdown on terrorists, includin g defi- nitions for the terms terrorism, international terrorism, and terrorist group. Since this publication is specifically designed for law enforcement use worldwide, Creusat included in the article an extensive listing of terrorist groups currently associated with international organized crime. The listing pro vides the name of the terrorist group, and any aliases under which they may have operated, the origins of the group, the ar ea(s) of operation, and who is supporting their activities. Now, for law enforcement, this is a wonderful collection of info rmation to have available; however, in my opinion and by their own admission, the use of LUCID 2000™ will not end ther e.

On page 74, Creusat says, \"There are a number of major criminal organiz ations, two of which have a worldwide grasp and are directl y impair- ing world security: The Colombian drug cartels and the Chinese criminal groups organized around Triad secr et societies.\" Then he describes ten groups, with brie f comments on their activities. Dr. Creusat sees the LUCID 2000™ System as a \"uni- versal application to the Criminal Justice System a nd the future antagonist to terrorist and international or ganized crime. \" Creusat concludes: Properly employed L.U.C.I.D. © would curtail the ne w breed of international organized crime challenging governments throughout the world. The System Pro- posal will create a climate that makes it more difficult and expensive for such criminals to operate.

Declassification of NSA Documents Under the Freedom of Information Act everything old er than 25 years supposedly is to be declassified and made available to anyone seeking information on a partic ular subject. This is operating on the premise that anyt hing 25 years or older has little if any remaining value as sensitive data. Again working on their image, the NSA issued a press release on April 2, 1996, titled, \"The National Sec urity Agency Releases Over 1.3 Million Pages of Declassif ied Documents.\" Of course, this was to promote good wil l and enhance their image with the general public. They s till will not release any documents which might reflect badly on their activities in those early days, and other documents are \"released\" with black marked out lines of the thing s they still don't want made available for general distribution or dis- closure. Mainly what has been released so far are t he com- munications by the KGB and other entities that took place during the Cold War era. There is a massive list of documents which you may research at NSA's location on the Int ernet, with instructions how to obtain something you may d esire to see first hand. Suing the NSA Much unnecessary to-do has been made in some public a- tions about a lawsuit brought against the NSA. I be gan to investigate this suit, its ramifications, and its u ltimate dis- position. The Clerk's Office of the U.S. District C ourt, Wash- ington, DC, gladly made available all documentation pertain- ing to said action. The suit was filed in the Unite d States District Court on February 20, 1992, and was brough t by petitioner John S. Akwei. His statement justifying the suit read: \"Prevented from obtaining gainful employment by defendants [NSA], who utilized National Security Ag ency"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"THE BIGGEST SECRET IN THE WORLD — THE NSA 215 offices and resources to control and at their will illegally dis- continue my employment.\" After hearing his detailed list of allegations, the Court determined that there was not \"any identifiable leg al cause of action. Accordingly, it will be dismissed as fri volus pursuant to 28 O.S.C. s/s 1915(d). It is this 6th day of Mar ch, 1992, hereby ORDERED that this complaint is dismissed. St anley Sporkin, United States District Court.\" Of course, I certainly wouldn't put it past the NSA to do something like this, or even worse, but that was no t the case in this suit. If you read the plaintiff's allegatio ns, you readily will understand why this was determined to be a fri volous lawsuit and ultimately dismissed. It appears that h e had a bigger case of paranoia than any genuine, legitimat e, provable complaints. In addition to this action, the NSA has been sued s everal times during its 40-year history, including a suit filed by Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden in the 1970's.

Also worthy of consideratio n are the Defense Mapping Agency, the intelligence co m- ponents of the unified commands, and the intelligen ce elements of the Department of Commerce. These intel li- gence elements, along with those mentioned directly above, can be grouped into five categories: • national intelligence organizations, • Department of Defense intelligence organizations, • military service intelligence organizations, • the intelligence components of the unified commands , • and civilian intelligence organizations.

Later in this chapter I will expand on this information, but for now, here is a brief e xplanation of how I define the two terms: Direct Intelligence Organizations — Designed for intelligence-gathering purposes only. Indirect Intelligence Organizations — All other private and governmental organizations with a specified purpose other than intelligence gathering (i.e., the IRS who gathers plenty of information on folks, but the purpose[?] allegedly is to collect income tax, not just information). These groups indirectly and ultimately download data into the direct intelligence organization's database. One more definition you should recognize is for the \"Black Chambers Projects,\" or some variation on that name. Basically, it's all that super secret stuff, particularly secr et funding of projects it wants to keep under wraps. The NSA, either directly or indirectly, is affiliat ed with many external, national, and international governmental organiza- tions and private corporations that have a working agreement to exchange information on citizens. (Although I su spect— with a few notable exceptions—that most of the info rmation \"exchanging\" is going in one direction. . .toward t he expand- ing of the NSA database.)"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"224 BIG BROTHER NSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" Sister Organizations of the NSA (Little Brothers) In this chapter, I will address the many major grou ps linked with the NSA, identifying them either as \"direct\" o r \"indirect\" suppliers of gathered information. As I promised pr eviously, I will define more extensively \"direct\" organizatio ns as those whose primary purpose is to intercept, decode, and report on intelligence for government use and security. I define \"indirect\" organizations as those who collect infin ite amounts of data on individuals for governmental use (i.e., IRS, Postal Service, Department of Motor Vehicles, Voter Regist ration, Social Security, et al) and/or nongovernmental use (such as credit bureaus, insurance companies, banks, et al), but whose data we now find channeled into the NSA supercomput ers. On the Internet (http://www.odci.gov/ic/usic/chart. gif) a circular chart is presented (see next page) showing the partici- pation of the governmental organizations under the director- ship of the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). As I explained to you previously, the DCI also serves as head of t he CIA, but seems to have less control over intelligence-gather ing activi- ties than the head of the NSA. You will note that t he CIA is listed as an independent agency, while the Departme nts of State, Energy, and Treasury are listed as indirect agencies, meaning nonmilitary/security spying groups, but all spokes in the intelligence wheel are under the DCI. As I p roceed, I will tell you a little about each of these, without going into too much detail because of space constraints. There are 12 of them (excluding the NSA which already has been c overed extensively), plus many other direct and indirect f oreign and/ or national agencies to investigate, documenting th eir tie- in with the NSA or other groups with whom informati on is exchanged/shared.

Here is what they write about encryption of electro nically transmitted messages/information: Encryption: The President and the Vice President are seeking to create a new policy for commercial encryption to strengthen the security of electronic information worldwide while also protecting law enforcement and intelligence concern s. This system, called key management, would allow infor- mation to be protected by strong encryption, while permitting encryption key recovery and access by authorized individuals within a framework of rigorous privacy safeguards. Yeah, right! Remember when I previously mentioned t erms such as \"clipper chip,\" and others? They are provid ing them- selves with a back door key to your encryption with \"key recovery,\" while setting up their own systems to pr event similar intrusion into their encrypted information. The sooner they can get us all on total electronic dependence, the sooner they can learn what little is left to learn about u s that they don't already know! Although, with all the database sharing that is occurring, it is probably very little. On July 15, 1996, by another of those handy little Executive Orders, Clinton established a \"one-year Critical In frastructure Protection Commission. The Commission will recommen d ways, both executive and legislative [How about that!

By this one Executive Order (July 15, 1996), a Commission has been established to recomme nd ways to include in their infrastructure everything essential to the personal life of the individual—utilities, f inancial activities, vital human services (which undoubtedly would include health needs, food, transportation/trucking /rail freight/airlines, et al)—'to strengthen the security of the nation.\" Until Clinton receives the report of the Commission , he has directed the FBI to work (share) with other federal agencies, as well as state and local governments, to provide security for our \"critical physical and cyber assets.\" Those could be called \"Cyberia\" assets.

(1996). Central Intelligence Agency The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is one of sev eral organizations responsible for gathering and evaluat ing foreign intelligence information vital to the secur ity of the United States. It is also charged with coordina ting the work of other agencies in the intelligence comm unity —including the National Security Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency. It was established by the National Security Act of 1947, replacing the wartim e Office of Strategic Services. The CIA's specific tasks include: advising the pres i- dent and the National Security Council on internati onal developments; conducting research in political, eco - nomic, scientific, technical, military, and other f ields; carrying on counterintelligence activities outside the United States; monitoring foreign radio and televis ion broadcasts; and engaging in more direct forms of es pio- nage and other intelligence operations. Throughout its history, the CIA has seldom been fre e from controversy. In the 1950's, at the height of t he cold war and under the direction of Allen Welsh Dulles, its activities expanded to include many undercover oper a- tions. It subsidized political leaders in other cou ntries; secretly recruited the services of trade-union, chu rch, and youth leaders, along with businesspeople, journ alists,"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"238 BIG BROTHER NSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" academics, and even underworld leaders; set up radi o stations and news services; and financed cultural o rgani- zations and journals. After the failure of the CIA-sponsored Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba in 1961, the agency was reorganize d. In the mid-1970's, a Senate Select Committee and a Presidential Commission headed by Nelson Rockefelle r investigated charges of illegal CIA activities. Amo ng other things, they found that the CIA had tried to assas- sinate several foreign leaders, including Fidel Cas tro of Cuba. It had tried to prevent Salvador Allende from winning the 1970 elections in Chile and afterward h ad worked to topple him from power. Between 1950 and 1973, the CIA had also carried on extensive mind-control experiments at universities, prisons, and hospitals. In 1977, President Jimmy Ca rter directed that tighter restrictions be placed on CIA clan- destine operations. Controls were later also placed on the use of intrusive surveillance methods against G .S. citizens and resident aliens. [Author's note: Ways around this restriction since have been discovered and put into use by the major intelligence gatherers. As you wil l recall from the previous chapter, NSA trainees now are \"pr actic- ing\" on us, by monitoring our private communication s.] Late in the 1970's, however, fears arose that restr aints on the CIA had undermined national security. The agency's failure to foresee the revolution in Iran (1979) gave new impetus to efforts at revitalization. Pres ident Ronald Reagan and his CIA director, William J. Case y, loosened many of the restrictions, but such activit ies as the mining of Nicaraguan harbors in 1984 as part of the covert campaign in support of the Contra rebels and the still-unclear role of the CIA in the Iran-contra af fair focused renewed public attention on the agency. Following Casey's death in 1987, Reagan appointed William Webster, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to be the CIA director. His reputati on for"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"THE NSA'S SISTER INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATIONS 239 integrity helped restore the agency's image, but in telli- gence failures during the Gulf War (1991) tarnished his tenure. He was succeeded by Robert M. Gates (1991-9 3) and James Woolsey (1993-94). In 1994, in the worst spy scandal in CIA history, a career officer, Aldrich H. Ames, was arrested by th e Federal Bureau of Investigation and admitted spying for the USSR and Russia for nine years. Woolsey resigne d under fire and, after disclosure in 1995 of clandes tine CIA links to U.S. government-proscribed death squad s in Guatemala, was succeeded by ,Deputy Secretary of Defense John Deutch, who immediately retired much of the agency's hierarchy. [Emphasis added.] Of course, the effect of such a move is to concentrate the power in the hands of fewer people, and therefore, fewer safe- guards. As I told you previously, Deutch has been r eplaced by George Tenet, formerly Deputy DCI and President Clinton's second nominee to fill the position. Tenet served a s Acting DCI for some months until his unanimous confirmatio n in the Congressional hearings, and subsequently was sw orn into office on July 11, 1997. Whereas Deutch was a membe r of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and the Tril ateral Commission (TC), as well as a director of the CITIC orp bank (major promoter of smart cards), it appears—surpris ingly— that Tenet is a member of neither. John M. Deutch Deutch was sworn in on May 10, 1995, as DCI and hea d of the CIA, and he has lasted about two years. He h olds a Ph.D. from MIT, where he joined the faculty in 1970 . He has served in a myriad of government assignments. I fin d it ironic, considering his position as DCI and head of the CIA , that he is a member of the Commission on Protecting and Red ucing Government Secrecy. Talk about your oxymorons!

The Washington Post reported on March 20, 1997: \"President Clinton yesterday nomina ted George J.

As I assume this posit ion, I haven't the slightest doubt what you, the Preside nt, and the American people expect from me and the excep- tional men and women that 1 will lead. In pursuit o f our mission, you must know that first and foremost: • That the Intelligence Community is working to protect the lives of Americans everywhere. • That we are working to protect our men and women in uniform and to ensure that they dominate the bat tle- field whenever they are called and wherever they ar e deployed. • That we are protecting Americans from threats posed by terrorists, drug traffickers, and weapons of mass destruction.

We are account able to you, the President, and to the American people f or all that we do. A special part of the privilege you have given me i s the opportunity to lead the men and women of the Intelligence Community. They are simply unmatched i n their dedication, drive, and devotion to duty. They bring not only their expertise to work, but a deep convic tion that national security is neither a nine-to-five jo b nor just a career, but a public service of grave import ance. Working with them every day has driven home for me a vital point: as important as sophisticated techno logy is to our work, intelligence is primarily a human e n- deavor. And so, for me, our people must always come first. My goal for our people is a simple one: That they should consistently be the nation's premier experts in their field—whether they are engaged in analysis, o pera- tions, or scientific and technical pursuits. If we—your intelligence team—tackle these challenge s with energy, decisiveness, conviction, and integrit y—we will live up to the high expectations that you, the Presi- dent, and the American people rightly have for your intelligence service. We will be the best intellige nce service in the world. As Director of Central Intell igence, I will aspire to nothing less. Implicit in all that I have said are four commitmen ts that will guide me every day that I serve in this o ffice: • To the President, you, Mr. Vice President, and all others who rely on our Nation's intelligence ca pabili- ties—We will deliver intelligence that is clear, ob jective, and without regard for political consequences.

What distinguishes our intelligence ser vice from all others is the link with the American peopl e that comes through strong Congressional oversight—it is vital to maintaining the trust and faith of our cit izens. And 1 will not violate this trust. • To the men and women I will lead over the next several years—We will be partners. I've told you th at 1 want leaders who will take care of their people. Th is starts with me. 1 will care about your work at all levels, be there when you need me, and stand up for you whe n times get tough. Together we will ensure that Ameri can intelligence is the nation's first line of defense in a world that still holds plenty of surprise and danger. • To the American people I would say— Your intelligence service is committed to protecting you r country from all those who would threaten it. We wi ll honor the trust that you have placed in us, and we will serve you with fidelity, integrity, and excellence.

It is also re ported that SCS personnel [agents] use Consular Service an d Diplomatic Telecommunications Service as \"cover\" when \"forward deployed,\" so it would stand to reaso n that they might operate from a \"State Department\" facility when in the United States in order to main tain the plausibility of their cover.

Intelligence authority, Jeffrey T. Ric helson, author of The U.S. Intelligence Community, wrote one Foreword, which he begins: The world of signals intelligence is one that gover n- ments have traditionally tried to keep hidden from public view. The secrecy attached to it by the United King dom and its allies in the Second World War, particularl y code- breaking operations, carried over into the Cold War . Whether their adversaries were attacking them with weapons or diplomatic strategies, the concern was t he same—that revelations about methods and successes would lead an adversary to change codes and ciphers and deny the codebreaker the ability to read the fo e's secret communications. Next Richelson enlightens us about the UKUSA Securi ty Agreement of 1948, formalizing close cooperation be tween five countries—the United States, the United Kingdo m, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Although the tr eaty has never been made public, it has become clear that it provided not only for a division of collection tasks and sha ring of the product, but for common guidelines for the classifi cation and protection of the intelligence collected as well as for personnel security. (As we will discover shortly, when it was determined that an area was not covered by any satellite \"foot print,\" immediate steps were taken to seal the breach. The old adage, \"The sun never sets on the British empire,\" is beco ming accurate once again.) Naturally, the secrecy factor does not escape Riche lson.

State- sponsored terrorism was a crime against humanity as long as it wasn't being practiced by the allies, wh en it was studiously ignored. In the national interest it became necessary to say \"ouch\" and frown and bear certain reprisals of our intelligence partners.

In Chapter 4 he introduces the r ole of the UKUSA in fighting the Cold War. He tells about the origin of the agreement then continues, \"The UKUSA agreeme nt served to establish a post-war alliance between the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand for covertly intercepting and analysing radio communications fro m coun- tries all around the world.

Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) As DISA didn't have its own spoke on the wheel, but falls under the DoD, I am going to discuss it here before moving on to the remainder of the 13 spokes. DISA is an intricate division of the DoD. It is def ined in Internet literature as: \"DoD agency responsible for information technology and is the central manager of major port ions of the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII).\" In f act, the web is replete with information on DISA and its numerou s tentacles. Its website address is: (http://www.disa.mil/), and the Home Page carries the announcement: \"Read Me First!—You are"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"THE NSA'S SISTER INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATIONS 281 entering an Official CIS Government System.\" Inform ation contained in these many pages reveals that Lieutena nt General Albert J. Edmonds, USAF, is both the Director of DI SA and the Manager of the National Communications System ( NCS). The Mission of DISA is stated as: \"To Plan, Enginee r, Devel- op, Test, Manage Programs, Acquire, Implement, Oper ate and Maintain Information Systems for C41 (Intelligence) and Mission Support Cinder all Conditions of Peace and War.\" The NSC assists the President and the Executive Office of the President in exercising wartime and nonwartime emer gency telecommunications, and in the coordination of the planning for and provisioning of National Security and Emerg ency Pre- paredness (NS/EP) communications for the Federal Go vern- ment under all circumstances. Another arm of D1SA is the White House Communicatio ns Agency (WHCA). Its mission statement incorporates t he DISA statement (cited above) and declares that WHCA will be the preeminent provider of information systems providin g tele- communications to the President and his White House staff, as well as the National Security Council, CIS Secre t Service, and others. Also operated by DISA is the DISA Information Syste ms Center (DISC), however, instead of having a mission to support the President, et al, its mission is to support the DISA Director, headquarters, and line organizations worldwide. D1S A/DISC Information Resources Division is responsible for o perating and maintaining DISA's WWW Internet System, among o ther duties. DISA has devised a strategy for the Defense Informa- tion System Network (DISN), stating their mission i s to provide strategic information to the warriors engag ed in battle, \"and others as required by the DoD, under a ll con- ditions of Peace and War.\" They are located in Arli ngton, Virginia, and complete details may be obtained from their website: (http://www.disa.mil/DISN/disnhome.html).

The continued major role of U.S. service intelligen ce organizations is partly a function of bureaucratic politics and partly a function of U.S. military requirements . A military force with large service components, each with wide-ranging functional and geographical responsibi l- ities, may be better served in terms of intelligenc e support by organizations that are not too detached from the service components. Additionally, some strategi c intelligence and collection functions may be best p er- formed by service organizations. Thus, some intelli gence tasks—such as producing information about foreign aerospace or submarining technology—may be carried out most efficiently by the services most directly affected, in this case the Air Force and Navy, benefiting bot h the services involved as well as national policymakers. . . .the past several years has seen the disestabli sh- ment and/or consolidation of formerly separate intelli- gence organizations in each of the major services. . .

However, coupli ng the fact that they now have the largest computing capability in the world with the extensive evidence that is available , it is a logical assumption. To begin toward that goal, the Assistant Secretary of Defense issued his Plan for Restructuring Defense Intelligence. The plan instructed each military service to \"consolidate all existing intelligence commands, ag encies, and elements into a single intelligence command wit hin each Service.\" Army Intelligence Even though the chart is less than complex, when co mpared with some of the other organizational charts, it is far reaching, with many operations contained within the scope of each category.

Under a shroud of deep secrecy, the NRO was establi shed in 1960. The first public revelation of its existen ce came in 1973 as the result of an error made in a Senate rep ort.

It is so secretive that its very existence was offi cially denied until 1992, even though its been around 35 y ears. It manufactures expensive spy satellites for the CI A, the Navy, the IRS, the Republican National Committee, Arnold Schwartznegger, and God knows who else, and is responsible for keeping track of all these satel lites, spy missions, and other important stuff. So, imagine the NRO's embarrassment to discover that it had lost track of more than TWO BILLION DOLLARS that Congress had previously appropriated to it. Now, two billion dollars is bigger than a br ead basket, so it's not easy to just—poof!—lose it.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) The next major intelligence-gathering organization in our wheel is not operating under the auspices of the Do D, in fact, I believe there is some question as to whether they consider themselves answerable to anybody! (Technically, the y are under the DOJ—Department of Justice.) But, just as the other groups are migrating toward the \"condense and cen- tralize\" mode, the FBI is doing likewise. They are collecting fingerprints from all over, to be converted into di gitized, computer-friendly format, storing criminal and terr orist information, and trading data with the NCIC and Int erpol (and ultimately with the NAS, I'm sure).

It was establi shed in February, 1992, as the entity to house the consolidation of the FBI's criminal justice information services [here is some more of that consolidation of information]. The CJIS Division is the focal point and central re posi- tory for criminal justice information services in t he FBI. It serves as a customer-driven organization providi ng \"high tech\" identification and information services to local, state, Federal, and international criminal j ustice communities. This division is responsible for the day-to-day ope ra- tions of the Fingerprint Identification Program, th e National Crime Information Center (NCIC), and the Uniform Crime Reports (OCR) program which includes the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS ). The CJIS Division is also responsible for the devel op- ment of the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identi fica- tion System (IAFIS), and for partnering with the FB I's Information Resources Division concerning the devel op- ment of the NCIC 2000 System. The FBI must ensure that these systems, as well as any future systems, completely integrate in order to provide the criminal justice community the identifi cation and information services it needs as we move into t he 21st century [emphasis added]. Revitalization The FBI is in the process of updating (they call it \"revitaliz- ing\") several of its main criminal justice programs . A brief synopsis of the changes follow: The revitalization of the current NCIC system, NCIC 2000, will include enhancements to existing NCIC"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"THE NSA'S SISTER INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATIONS 313 hardware and software, as well as new functionality . This functionality includes the capability to transmit p hoto- graph and fingerprint images between a user's patro l car and the NCIC 2000 computer, where the fingerprint image will be rapidly searched against the database for wanted and/or missing individuals. The CJ1S Divisio n is partnering with the Information Resources Divisi on on this project. N1BRS is the enhancement of the current UCR pro- gram, which provides an accounting of the extent an d nature of criminal activity. NIBRS is an incident-b ased reporting system, meaning data is collected on each single crime occurrence and its components. Analysi s of these facts can provide vital information about crime and its impact on victims, offenders, property, arr estees, and the U.S. society as a whole. The IAFIS will consist of several integrated segmen ts including Identification Tasking and Networking (IT N), which will provide for the submission of electronic fingerprint images; the Interstate Identification I ndex (III) [sometime called \"Triple I\"], which is the national system for the exchange of criminal history records; the A uto- mated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS), whi ch provides automated fingerprint comparisons and iden ti- fies candidates for fingerprint examiners to use in the identification of criminals; and the Fingerprint Im age Conversion Operation (FICO), which represents the conversion of approximately 32 million fingerprint cards to electronic images for IAFIS use.

FBI Arrests seven in bombing plot Seven people connected with a right-wing militia we re arrested Friday on charges of plotting to blow up t he FBI's national fingerprint record center and two ot her federal buildings in West Virginia. Agents began making the arrests after Floyd Raymond Looker, leader of the Mountain Militia, gave bluepr ints of the FBI complex to an undercover agent in exchan ge for $50,000, the FBI said. The agent was posing as a middleman for a fictitious international terrorist group. The blueprints of the new $200 million FBI complex in Clarksburg were obtained by a Clarksburg firefig hter who belonged to the militia, the FBI said. The fire department keeps the blueprints in case of a fire. \"There was a plot. It was ended before it could be con- summated,\" said John P.

There was no imm e- diate threat to our facility.\" O'Connor said the militia targeted two other federa l facilities in the state. He declined to identify th em. Law officers confiscated plastic explosives and det ona- tors Friday at five sites in West Virginia, Pennsyl vania, and Ohio. The arrests came after a 16-month investigati on. The fingerprint complex is known as the FBI Crimina l Justice Information Services Division. Opened last year, it contains fingerprint records that the FBI has co llected from police departments nationwide. The identificat ion division provides information to state and local po lice departments. The fingerprint center eventually will use computer programs for converting fingerprints into electroni c images. Automated criminal record-keeping also will be avai l- able for background checks, whether the person is seeking a job at a day-care center or trying to buy a gun. The seven defendants, including Looker, were jailed without bail pending hearings next week. The charge s included conspiring to make bombs, transporting ex- plosives across state lines, and conspiring to plac e explosives near the FBI complex.

The informant had gone to the FBI 16 months ago after becoming disenchanted with the group's activi ties, which included making and testing home-made explo- sives, U.S. Attorney William D. Wilmoth said Saturd ay. At least one militia member, according to the in- formant, believed the FBI complex contained a cland es- tine operation that might be a command center when the government turned against the people under the \"new world order,\" according to court documents. Prosecutors do not believe the alleged conspiracy w as linked to anti-government groups in other states. \"I don't want it to appear to be some nationwide conspiracy or anything more grave than the charging documents show.

You see, no matter how v igilant we are, nor how we vote, nor how much we get involved in attempting to forestall the onslaught of the New Wo rld Order .. .ultimately, these attempts will be futile—they are doomed to fail—because the Bible guarantees us in the Book of Revelation that these events, indeed, will occur. Combating Terrorism President Clinton, a New World Order man himself, h as been given the perfect opportunity to increase and extend the surveillance activities of the government agenc ies, under the guise of protecting us from terrorism—both insi de and outside our borders—because of the unfortunate acts of violent terrorism that occurred during his term in office. They've been wanting this power for a long time, an d this provided the perfect excuse. On August 5, 1996, President Clinton made a speech titled \"Combating Terrorism,\" which, by September 28, 1996 , was available on the Internet at this address (6 pages) : (http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/EOP/NSC/factsheets/te rror.html) Because of its availability, I won't quote it here in its entirety, but 1 do want to quote some of it, and list some of the \"Record of Accomplishment\" about which they brag so proudly . (Whenever they brag about accomplishments, you can kiss another freedom or another piece of your privacy \"G oodbye.\") \"In this fight. . . American Leadership is indispen sable. . . .

The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (CALEA) requires the telephone companies to ensure that their systems and networks have both the capability and capacity to accommodate all federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies' court-approved intercepts in the face of new or changing telephone technology that could otherwise prevent electronic surveil- lance [emphasis added]. Heaven, forbid! Perish the thought that we actually might regain some of the lost privacy on our phone conver sations . . . but don't get too excited.

I'm sure there are many more, but today 1 wa nt to address just these three, following a few comments of generic nature on the Treasury Department. The Office of Intelligence Support was established in 1977. It succeeded the Office of National Security (ONS). The Special Assistant (head of this division) and his s taff support the Secretary of the Treasury in his roles as chief economic and financial adviser to the President, head of the second largest law enforcement department in the federal g overnment, and the official responsible for the integrity of t he country's currency. FINCEN The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has more tentacles than an octopus, with all of them poking somewhere in your financial business. For a complete study on FINCEN, let me refer you to Chapter 11, p. 205, in my previ ous book, The Mark of the New World Order. I referred earlier to the government making the ban k tellers become their personal informants on financial activ ities of their clients. All that falls under the FINCEN cate gory. From the Treasury Department's info about FINCEN on the Internet, I would like to quote the following: . . . FinCEN is the nation's central point for broad-based financial intelligence, analysis, and"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"350 BIG BROTHER NSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" information sharing. . . . Its information sharing network, which includes most federal, as well as state and local law enforcement agencies through- out the nation provides increasingly sophisticated ana- lytical tools. . . . FinCEN's experience in attempting to curtail money laundering makes it especially sensitive to crimes facili- tated by the capabilities of advanced information t ech- nology. An example of such technology is the emerge nce of financial services collectively known as \"cyberp ay- ments.\" FinCEN has a vested interest in understandi ng this new technology, to assess the potential for it s crim- inal misuse, and develop policy guidelines which wi ll help protect the integrity of our financial system. [Em- phasis added.] I'll bet they are VERY concerned about cashless ele ctronic transfers of funds, but wait. . . maybe not as conc erned as they sound. Remember the \"back-door key\"?

(Remember Waco and Ruby Ridge?) ATF is a bureau of the Treasury Department, with la w enforcement, regulatory, and tax collection mission s for alcohol, tobacco, explosives, arson, and firearms. John W. Magaw, formerly Director of the CIS Secret Service, became Director of the BATF effective September 30, 1993, by appoint- ment. On their Internet website: (http://www.atf.treas.gOv/@_ATF/NRT_SRT/nrt_srt.htm ) they give some startling statistics concerning thei r operations since 1979. Although no statistics are given on the number of deaths and injuries caused by terrorists, I have a feeling that the figures wouldn't be very far apart, if you omit any statistics from armed conflicts (wars). National Response Teams (NRTs) Presently, ATF maintains four regional NRTs, organi zed by geographical region, to help Federal, state, and local investigators in overcoming the difficulties inhere nt in large-scale arson and explosives crime scene invest iga- tions. Each team, consisting of special agents, exp losives technicians, and forensic scientists, is equipped t o respond to major incidents within 24 hours of a req uest by State or local authorities. Major incidents can easily overwhelm the resources of local law enforcement or fire department personnel. This specialized response cap a- bility is the only one of its kind offered by a Fed eral law enforcement agency. Since 1979, NRTs have been activated on 304 occasions to incidents that CAUSED 264 DEATHS, 1,923 INJURIES, and $1.8 billion in PROPERTY DAMAGE [emphasis added]."},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"THE NSA'S SISTER INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATIONS 353 International Response Team (IRT) Designed around the NRT concept, ATF initiated the IRT to provide assistance to the U.

Through the IRT, ATF provides technical and forensic assistance to foreign police and fire service agencies. The IRT has responded to num er- ous foreign arson or explosives-related incidents, in- cluding the 1992 and 1994 bombings of the Israeli Embassy and a Jewish community center in Argentina.

(A little more about the SSA later.) The biggest complaint about the IRS lately has been their waste of vast resources, with nothing much to show for it. They have been operating on obsolete computers and such since the 1980's, which accounts for some of the pr oblems they are having. A number of articles have been wri tten addressing the problems of the IRS and the amount i t is spending compared with the amount of unpaid taxes i t is allowing to slip through its fingers. The April 7, 1997, edition of TIME magazine (pp. 58-62), carried an article by Richard Stengel, of Washingto n, DC, titled \"An Overtaxed IRS,\" with a subtitle accusing : \"Its klutzy computer system costs the Federal Government $150 b illion a year in uncollected taxes and makes the agency an easy mark for cheats.\" Here are some excerpts: . . . Like the old Soviet Union, grand and powerful on the outside but an antiquated shambles within, the IRS has profound problems with outdated technology and outmoded thinking that have undermined its self-de- scribed mission: \"To collect the proper amount of t ax revenue at the least cost.\" The agency better known for turning the thumbscrews on tax miscreants is collecting something like $150 billion a year less than the proper amount, and mis - spending billions doing it. . . .Over the past decade it has spent nearly $4 bi llion in an attempt to bring its computers up to date.

With all the requests and funding, the final price tag for what ultimately became known as the Tax Systems Modernization plan was around $8 billion.

The Treasury Department wants to \"rectify\" that sit uation by taking stronger control from the top; others in Congress say it is a failed, wasteful system and needs fresh blood with top management skills to solve its many problems. T hat is the basis of the ensuing fight. Rob Portman (R-Ohio ) and Bob Kerry (D-Meb.)

We will say \"Goodbye\" to the Intelligence Wheel, an d as soon as I introduce you to the Canadian version of the NSA, we will be moving on to examine and discuss other d irect or indirect intelligence gatherers, government or p rivately owned. Canada's Intelligence Community As I mentioned when discussing New Zealand's intell igence activities, an organization exists called UKUSA. He re is what the Canadian's have to say about it. Canadian SIGINT [signals intelligence] activities t ake place, and can only be understood, in the wider con text of the UKUSA SIGINT community, a secret SIGINT alliance that traces its origins to the Second World War. The post-war continuation of this intelligence alli ance was formalized in 1948 with the signing of the still-secret UKUSA SIGINT co-operation and information-sharing agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States. The member agencies of the UKUSA community include the Communications Security Establishment [CSE—Canada's equivalent to the NSA], the United States National Security Agency (NSA), the United K ing- dom's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), Australia's Defence Signals Directorate (DS D), and New Zealand's Government Communications Secur- ity Bureau (GCSB). A number of other countries' SIG INT agencies also participate in the UKUSA community, including those of Germany, Japan, Norway, South"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"364 BIG BROTHER NSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" Korea, and Turkey. These countries are sometimes de - scribed as \"Third Party\" members of the agreement. In addition, some countries, such as China, host UKUSA SIGINT stations or share SIGINT on a more limited b asis. [Emphasis added.] According to the Internet printout, CSE maintains l iaison officers for these various groups, and permanent li aison officers at MSA HQ at Fort Meade, Maryland. The cur rent liaison with the MSA is John Eacrett. There are als o MSA and GCHQ liaison officers at CSE HQ. Communications Security Establishment (CSE)— The Canadian Sister to the NSA Officially begun on September 1, 1946, it began ope rations on September 3, 1946, and, as with many of the CIS agencies, it began as one thing and evolved over the years in to the present CSE. The current Chief of CSE is A. Stewart Woolner. The formal mandate (mission) of CSE is a classified docu- ment, presumably approved by the Cabinet; it never has been laid out in statute. As with the MSA, the CSE may \" intercept signals that begin and end in Canada, that begin in Canada and end abroad, or the reverse.\" So, in the process of gathering their \"foreign\" int elligence data, they are collecting and storing information o n Canadian citizens simultaneously. \"It would appear, therefor e, that CSE's 'foreign intelligence' mandate does permit it to inter- cept many types of communcations that do involve Ca nadian participants. In fact, the Department of National D efence has admitted that CSE occasionally intercepts communica tions that involve or contain information about Canadians :.... In addition, the government has confirmed that CSE mai ntains a data bank, DND/P-PU-040, 'Security and Intelligen ce Infor- mation Files,' that contains 'information concernin g [Canadi- ans] identified as potential risks to national secu rity.' \" Once you have started targeting \"potential risk\" su bjects, you then are trying to \"catch\" somebody, even befor e a crime"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"THE NSA'S SISTER INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATIONS 365 has been committed.

Just what is Public Key Cryptography? We are told t hat conventional cryptography uses a single mathematica l key for both encryption and decryption, whereas Public Key Cryptography uses two keys instead of one. One key is kept private and the other key is made public. Next they define the digital signature and spell ou t its function in the system, then they address the quest ion of the Public Key Infrastructure. A Public Key Infrastructure is a network which make s possible secure financial electronic transactions a nd exchanges of sensitive information between relative strangers. A PK1 will provide confidentiality, auth entica- tion, integrity, and non-repudiation support to inf orma- tion technology applications and electronic commerc e transactions. It works partly by establishing a dir ectory which will contain each user's Public Key and ident ifica- tion (digital signature).

Equifax is one such large company, but here I will address only the TRW company, and its sale to the Experian company. Since the purpose and function of a credit bureau is quit e evident, I won't bother to describe it. I just want to famil iarize you with some of the activities of one of the largest. It's still a case of more merging, bigger and better, etc. February 7, 1996, it was announced that TRW reporte dly was selling its Information Systems & Services Unit for nearly $1 billion. The division—one of the biggest sources of credit reports earns about $604 million in annual revenue. It is important to point out that TRW's Information Syste ms & Services collects and disseminates a lot more than just credit information. On November 8, 1996, it is stated, \"Experian is the group of information businesses formerly owned by TRW.\" A ccording to this report, the transaction was valued at more than $1 billion, there are still unnamed investors, and in addition to the above sum, TRW still retains a 20% interest.

They say it has been corrected, but who can say? Once all this data is purchased by, or traded with the NSA, we will be well on the way to total centralization of data on everybody, especially when you add to that the info rmation on the medical and insurance computers. Conclusion The thrust of this whole chapter has been to raise your awareness level of where all this information is go ing, who is collecting it, and where they are sending it. 1 want to stress the importance of all this merging and centralizing and sharing, because they are evolving into a much more powerful, consolidated, (eventually) single database.

In the preceding chapters, I have gone to great len gths to explain all about the National Security Agency (NSA ) and its affiliates in the information-gathering game. I have told you a little bit about the LUCID identification sys tem, bio- metrics, and supercomputers. That is because I firm ly believe that the NSA is covertly constructing the supercomputer from hell! The reason I added the word literally to this chapter title is because even though the hardware, software, and databases are created in the earthly realm, the system (or it s successors) ultimately will be used in the spiritual/physical r ealm. That is, these perfectly innocuous inventions, in and of themselves are just that—innocuous. And please don't jump on t he phone or E-mail and lambast the designers and/or pr oducers of this technology. They are sincere gentlemen who have been deceived into believing that they truly are helping with progress to make things better for the human condition. Rath er than criticizing or offending them, please pray for them that the Holy Spirit would open their eyes. These technological capabilities, however, placed i n the hands of those with ulterior (spiritual) motives, w ill enable them to proceed with the final stage of our electro nic global surveillance and control, as described in the above passage from the Book of Revelation.

Combine, centralize, and share are some of the buzzwords used by the gatherers of infor- mation. Their goal is to have all information in one location (1 believe it will be the NSA), accessible by every body. The development and purchase of supercomputers by the N SA is making this possible. Their secret funding of re search and development projects, university science projects, and other companies has provided them with the \"biggest and b est\" in computer technology. With the last book I wrote, The Mark of the New World Order, we just were beginning to learn about supercomputer s and their amazing capabilities, with their gigabytes of memory, or as they are called, GFlops (1 billion calculatio ns per second). As knowledge is doubling every 18 months o r less, today we have teraflops. . . in fact, we now have a 4-teraflop computer at a laboratory in New Mexico (government pur- chased, of course)—a teraflop is 1 trillion calcula tions per second. And now, even that is too slow—can you just imagine what they are doing with all that capability if 4 t rillion calcula- tions per second is too slow?!? Now we are learning about \"scalable,\" \"massively parallel,\" and petaflops —that's I quad- rillion calculations per second. With that kind of computing power, you could store everything in your databases and know everything about everything—current to any given ti me. Now, of course, what they are selling the world is the efficiency and economy of having all your eggs in o ne basket, and guarding only that basket. If you can eliminate overlaps and gaps in ID systems (with accompanying statistic al data), and if you only have to go to one source, internati onally, to find what you need (whether info on terrorists, wea pons runners, drug cartels, money launderers, crime fami lies, Russian Mafia, etc.), think how much time you will save (time is money, you know) and how much money you can save if"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"402 BIG BROTHER NSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" you delete redundant government organizations, doin g essentially the same thing, except for their respec tive depart- ments.

To avoid an open rebellion and a civil war, the pro pagators of the New World Order system aren't likely to \"kic k the sleeping dog.\" Rather, it is much more effective to lull us into a state of complacency about the long-term implicat ions of what they are doing by giving us one little \"conven ience\" after the next, each progressively more advanced than the previous one. . .desensitizing us, if you will. This book is a warning to wake up and see what's go ing on around you. I want to make it clear that these t hings are merely \"technologies,\" they are not spiritual, nor can they send you to hell. Furthermore, accepting the mark o f the beast is not something one will do unconsciously. With all their dire implications, neither the MARC card (des cribed in The Mark of the New World Order), the national ID card (probably based on the LUCID 2000™ system), the imp lant- able biochip, Big Brother NSA's petaflops supercomp uters, nor data fed to NSA by its sister organizations (I call them the \"Little Brothers\"), are, in fact, THE mark (of the beast) to which scripture refers, even though biochip impl ants seems to be the technology available which most closely m atches that described in Revelation 13 (in the hand or forehead). Receiving the mark of the beast is going to be a ma tter of worship, not merely of economics (being permitted to buy or sell). Notice, it does not say you will be forced to receive the mark, but you will be caused to receive it. . .in other words, by coercion you will choose to receive it because of the pressure brought to bear upon you, both economi c pressure and peer pressure. Revelation 13:16 clearl y specifies that those who reject the mark will be excluded fro m the world economic order the Antichrist is creating.

We may not be there yet, but Vice President Al Gore has stated his firm intentions of having us all on the Web by the year 2000, and he has implemented sufficient progra ms to see that that goal probably will be accomplished, e xcept for the staunchest of holdouts. For example, the govern ment is no longer issuing checks for retirement, benefits, etc. All funds are transferred directly into your bank accou nt by direct deposit. And if anyone wants to hold out for an act ual pay- check, it won't be issued by the government; it will be is sued by some other bank, and you won't receive it until several days after your fellow direct-deposit employees are spending their money. Although a high-ranking politician made a recommend ation that all babies have an implant behind their ear be fore they leave the maternity ward (and in England one matern ity hospital is already putting them into the ID bracel ets to prevent kidnapping or mixing up babies), that would defeat the purpose as described in the Book of Revelation, namely, getting everyone to worship the Antichrist (Beast), and, as indicated in the first scripture previously quoted, those who refuse to worship and take the mark will be killed. Therefore, it isn't likely that someone will knock you out and inject an implant into your body. It is probable that the enforcement of this \"worshi p\" (which they undoubtedly will try to pass off as cooperatio n with the global authorities—i.e., dissenters must be elimina ted for the good of the rest of the populace) will fall to the United Nations (UN) troops, just a broader scale of the CIN \"peace -keeping missions\" going on around the globe even today. (By the way, the military intelligence gathered for these joint UN or NATO operations is courtesy of NSA satellites and collec tion systems scattered around the world. . .which are now being shared with Russia and other communistic countries.) Just how this enforcement will be carried out is described very p lainly in Revelation 20:4:"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"404 BIG BROTHER NSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" . . . and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither had received his [Antichrist's] mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands;. . . [emphasis added]. Before I continue discussing the punishment, I want to point out something else for your consideration. Please n otice in both the first scripture quoted and the one just ab ove, there is reference to worshiping the beast or his image. This has brought much speculation by Christians who stay abr east of the latest technology and its implications in light of biblical prophecy. The consensus seems to be that all of tha t \"petaflops power\" is going to be used to scan and track all th ings from satellites, revealing things in \"real time\" and ena bling the creation of holographic images or interactive virtual reality. By the means of holographic technology, the image o f the beast may be created, and by satellite hookups all over the world, the image may be seen and worshiped. If any organiza- tion possesses the capability to pull this off, it is the NSA! Since Satan is not like God, i.e., he is not omnipr esent, he must counterfeit that impression by technological m eans. A Time to Lose Your Head Mo, I didn't make a mistake on this subhead. It is better to lose your head than to lose your eternal soul by selling out to the devil and taking the mark of the beast.

Now, back to the punishment—the penalty for rejecti ng the Antichrist is the loss of one's head—not a very pleasant thought! But as with all things prophesied in the B ible... it will come to pass! This is a matter of your eternal destiny, and God created man with a free will—the ability an d privilege of making the choice of whom he will serve. Therefo re, you can't go to hell by accident, nor can anyone else s end you there (by forcibly injecting you with the mark—you still would have to choose to worship the beast). It is a decision I strongly advise that you not postpone; it is late and the time for choices is now, before it is too late. At the end of this chapter, 1 have given you full instructions on how to make this cho ice and seal your eternal destiny with the Lord in heaven, rather than in hell with Satan and his demons. Accept Christ to day. Be Not Deceived! Many places in the Bible we find the phrase, \"1 wou ld not have you ignorant.\" My sentiments exactly! Many oth er places in scripture, particularly in the words of Jesus, w e are admon- ished, \"Take heed that ye be not deceived.\" This is a primary part of the mission of this ministry—I want to warn you about deceptions lurking out there just waiting to ensnar e us. We find that warning from Jesus in Matthew 24, Mark 13, and Luke 21, et al. In Matthew 24, Jesus is educating his disciples about the end times. They were curious: \" Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the s ign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?\" (24:3). Since Jesus didn't want them \"ignorant,\" He spent n early the entire chapter of Matthew 24 (and many other pl aces in scripture) telling them (and us) what could be expe cted to be seen by the generation that was alive upon earth when the \"end\" arrived. He began His reply by saying, \". . .Take heed that no man deceive you, For many shall come i n my name, saying, \"I am Christ\"; and shall deceive many \" [eastern"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"406 BIG BROTHER MSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" religions and New Age gurus, et al] (24:4,5). Then He tells about all the terrible events leading up to the end . But right in the middle of the chapter, He returns to the war ning not to be deceived: \"For there shall arise false Christ s, and false prophets. . .\" (24:24). How does this tie in with the NSA and the burgeonin g technology? Jesus describes other terrible events t hat will occur and tells us that even though we won't know the day nor hour (24:36), we can know the season (24:32). And we know the season by recognizing that the events we s ee happen- ing all around us with greater frequency and intens ity are, in fact, fulfillments of Jesus's prophecies in scri pture. It is imperative that we understand that Jesus was trying to let us know when the \"end times\" would arrive. He said, \" . . .when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near , even at the doors\" (24:33). Then He clinches it by telling us t hat \" . . .this generation [the one that witnesses these events] sh all not pass, till all these things be fulfilled\" (24:34) [emphas is added]. The NSA Didn't Originate the Concept of a New World Order, But It May Help Bring It to Pass! What is the real origin of the New World Order? It is my opinion, being convinced by the evidence I have ama ssed, that we are that generation of which Christ spoke, and that all things found in Matthew 24 (and other related p rophetic books, i.e., Daniel, Ezekiel, Revelation, et al) will be fulfilled in our lifetime. Never—before now—has technology be en sufficiently advanced to carry out such a worldwide endeavor . . .which fulfills yet another prophecy: \"In the l ast days knowledge shall increase\"—with the implication that it will increase exponentially. And if you don't believe th at is happening—when knowledge is doubling every 18 month s or less, and Gflops have been left behind by terafl ops and the forthcoming petaflops, and the new semiconducto rs on the drawing board are shrinking from 1/200th the th ickness of a human hair (.25 microns) down to 1/1000th the thickness of a hair—then you need to \"wake up and smell the c offee,"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"THE BOTTOM LINE: THE SUPERCOMPUTER FROM HELL 407 folks!\" Ever since the Tower of Babel (in the Book of Genes is), Satan has been attempting to create a New World Ord er where people would worship him as the God of this world. Scripture indicates that God, indeed, will permit this to occ ur at the end of the age. For the past 200 years, specificall y subsequent to May 1, 1776, the Luciferians, New Agers, witches , Satanists, socialists/communists, fascists/nazis, liberals, et al, all have been using a new term to describe this final form o f global enslavement under the Antichrist. The term they hav e been using is the \"New World Order.\" It should be obvious by now that there is ample evi dence to support my conclusion that this final New World Order is about to occur. Scripture says that the devil will divide the world into 10 kingdoms, and, indeed, that has occur red under the Treaty of Rome, which divided the world into ex actly 10 regions, the United States and Canada being region number one of this New World Order occultic world governme nt. (By the way, just a point of information: \"Treaties\" su percede all other regulations of government, including the Cons titution. So when our government signs the papers committing us to a trade treaty, or a disarmament treaty, or an envi ronmental treaty, the terms of that treaty are given preceden ce over any other national law, and usually are enforced by som e arm of the UN.) Jesus warned us that deception would be rampant dur ing this time—so much so that He specifically warned us even the elect of God would be deceived and believe the lie of this New World Order under the devil, if it were possibl e. He implied that only the elect could not be fooled, and this is why so few today are able to discern the truth of w hat's occur- ring. Most people—unfortunately, even most Christia ns— are blind to what's happening in terms of the proph etic scriptures, as they apply to the times in which we live.

The Lord tells Ch ristians that they should not be asleep like the rest of the worl d; rather we should be awake, aware, and watchful regarding t hese end times events. Unfortunately, most are dead asleep or blind to what's happening. The signs of the Lord's second coming— the end of the age, the New World Order under the A ntichrist and his 666 economic mark system, and Armageddon—al l are apparent so visibly, even in our secular news m edia, that no one should miss the signs of His soon return. Pentagon Calls for Armageddon in the Year 2001 Even The New York Times indicated in a 1992 article that the Pentagon is planning for a total mobilization f or global war in the year 2001. Many top fundamentalist/evangelicals subscribe to t he dispensational belief that there will be a total of 6000 years from Adam until the end of the age, when Christ ret urns with His believers to fight and win the battle of Armage ddon, ushering in the millennium—the 1000-year reign of p eace. 1, too, subscribe to this belief. Numerous chronolo gical studies have been done throughout the years and are availab le for your perusal at most Christian bookstores and libra ries. These studies indicate that the years 2001-2004 may concl ude this 6000-year period. Can We Trust Our Calendars? Probably not, but calculating to the best of our ab ility, and taking into consideration all known calendar errors and changes, etc., somewhere around the year 2004 this age should end. There is a little-known book called The Epistle of Barnabas, included in a respected work by Lightfoot entitled The Apostolic Fathers. Although no one can attest for certain that this is the same Barnabas who accompanied Paul in the"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"THE BOTTOM LINE: THE SUPERCOMPUTER FROM HELL 409 Book of Acts, it is believed to be true. In Chapter 15 of the Epistle of Barnabas, this 6000-year plan is mentioned specifically as God's total plan from begin- ning to end. It says that at the conclusion of 6000 , the sabbath millennium will begin. Let me reiterate, I am not setting dates for either the end of the age or the return of Christ (although the Bible definitely indicates, in Jesus' own words, that we should be a ble to see these events and properly infer that the end is nea r). Neither am 1 implying that the Epistle of Barnabas is some missing part of the Bible. As a matter of fact, there are m any other extrabiblical historical books that indicate that \" 6000 years\" holds some special significance, and may indeed wit ness the conclusion of all human history. Revelation 20 impl ies this, because it mentions six times that there will be a thousand- year millennium of true peace, under the true God o f this world, Jesus Christ, in a true New World Order, of which this present New World Order is merely an evil counterfe it—just as Satan counterfeits other manifestations of God's power. Matthew 24:36 only restricts us from knowing \"the d ay and hour\" of the end, but other scriptures (24:33, et al) say we will know when it is very \"near, even at the doors, \" because we will witness the events outlined in Matthew and other prophetic books. So be very clear—I am not saying t hat I know the day nor the hour nor the specific year, ho wever, I do believe that the 6000-year plan may hold prophet ic signifi- cance; all signs seem to indicate that things are a bout to wrap up soon. . . and we were told to watch the signs. It appears that Lucifer's final hour is at hand and the Great Tribulation period is about to begin, being ushered in by the c urrent New World Order troops. It is not overly significant wh ether it begins in 2000, 2004, or even a little later; the f act remains that we were told to be watchful and aware, so that the Day of the Lord should not overtake us as a thief in th e night. What Makes New Agers Think They Are New? It is interesting to note, if you browse in any New Age book-"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"410 BIG BROTHER NSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" store or acquire any occultic literature, that the New Agers, the Satanists, the Freemasons, the occultists, and the witches (in other words, all of Satan's representatives in whatever form, shape, or title) all are talking about someth ing very significant that they are expecting to occur about the year 2000—a harmonic convergence for a New Age which will bring about a global transformation. They indicate in their books and other literature that the old age under Christ ends, and the new age under Lucifer begins around that ti me. This is why New Agers call themselves \"New Agers.\" They are looking forward expectantly to the New Age under Lu cifer in the year 2000±. Other Signs for Which to Watch One of the signs pointed out by Christ that would s ignal the advent of the end of the age is worldwide famin e. A Los Angeles Times article dated January 1, 1993, says: \". . .global food shortage looms by the year 2000.\" There are ju st too many \"coincidences\" occurring during this generatio n to warn us that some type of major transformation is i n the works for the end of this century/millennium. All b ut the blind (especially the willfully blind) can see it clearly . President George Bush, a staunch promoter of the Ne w World Order, wanted to insinuate the New World Orde r into every area of our lives, but in particular the mili tary, defense, and \"police action\" portion of our nation.

Following the p ublication of the above article, Bush stated that he hoped tha t this would encourage the Soviets to do likewise. Good luck! The Old New World Order In Ecclesiastes, we learn that \"there is nothing ne w under the sun.\" As I have explained before, the New World Order is really just an Old World Order that Satan has be en trying unsuccessfully to foist on mankind since the Tower of Babel and before. I'm sure he must be dancing with glee t o realize that it finally will come into existence in the nea r future; I'm equally sure that he is painfully aware that his ti me is short and this New World Order is the final stage of his death grip on this earth. When God's New World Order arrives, Jesus will be the King of kings and Lord of lords over th is earth and its inhabitants. Will the United Nations Become the New World Order Global Government? What about the United Nations? Is it going to evolv e into the infrastructure of the New World Order? Only God knows for sure, but based on over seven years of research into this matter, there is no doubt in my mind that it will. At present, it couldn't accomplish that feat because it is stil l a collection of independently sovereign nations; whereas the New World Order eventually will relegate independent nations to the status of \"world states\" or \"nation states,\" only o perating under the auspices of the head of world government (Anti- christ). But I believe that it is the forerunner th at is laying the groundwork for the New World Order. Identity Crisis or Identification Crisis?

Our elected official s are looking out for the Mew World Order and the UN, ins tead of us taxpayers who are paying both for their salaries and for all the ludicrous programs they are implementing to und ermine our freedoms. Yes, America is suffering an identity crisis! At the same time, America and Americans are sufferi ng an identification crisis, and it's going to get a w hole lot worse. We are being identified for everything; and now all those bar codes and magnetic stripes on all those plastic car ds we carry in our pockets are to be linked biometrically, that is, to our fingerprint, eyescan, thermal facial scan, DMA, etc . Then they want to take away all those pieces of plastic in ex change for only one piece. . .which, of course, could still be lost or stolen. Eureka!

It would allow for death-row inmates as organ donors, he says, since t he \"blade makes a clean cut and leaves vital organs in - tact...\" The guillotine, invented by the French Dr. Guilloti ne, was mainly used in the 18th and 19th century and ch ops off a person's head. It hasn't been used for decade s in any country in the world. The measure failed to pass the first time around, b ut I hear they may try it again. Of course, as we witnessed o n the Prime Time Live program in October, 1997, we always could set up an execution yard in the parking lot of the hospita l to be handy to harvest the spare parts, as they were doin g in China, where organs for transplants are sold for sizable a mounts. The only problem is that no one really knows if the se were criminals, or just dissenters. They were made to kn eel in the dirt, then soldiers shot them in the back of the he ad, execution style, so as not to damage any usable body parts. W here communism prevails, anything can happen. . .which i s why I am frantically warning everyone not to trust the communists. We should not be granting them \"most favored nation \" status in our trade agreements.

Thank God for the many organizations that seized the moment and bombarded the Russian people with evangelists carrying the messag e of the gospel—the good news, helping people with clothing and food, and Bibles in their own language, and trainin g nationals to be able to continue their worship and evangelism after Russia kicks out all the foreign groups. The way th e law reads is that only the Russian Orthodox Church will be re cognized. Any other church must get permission to exist throu gh them. It is believed that persecution will begin soon and drive the church underground. Pray for our persecuted brother s and sisters in Christ throughout the world. Possible Scenario to Usher in The New World Order Based on over seven years of research, having read over 300 books, mountains of periodicals and technical p roduct brochures, occultic newsletters, and various New Ag e and Masonic publications, I feel I have gained an incre dibly good understanding into the mindset of Satan's people wh o wish to bring about this New World Order. I will attempt to convey to you a possible scenario that could occur in the next few years to bring about world government under the Ant ichrist. I want to make it absolutely clear that I am not prophesying—I do not consider myself a prophet in t he biblical sense, however, the knowledge I have accru ed during these seven years gives considerable credibility to my conjectures concerning these events. The Luciferians, who desire a New World Order under the devil, often use a little-known Latin phrase that d escribes how they intend to bring it all about. That phrase is ordo ab chao. Ordo ab chao means \"order from chaos.\" In other words, they purposely plan to create more than enough chaos in the world to convince us that we need a New World Order to fi x it. The Book of Daniel says that the Antichrist first will come as a peacemaker, and \"by peace he shall destroy many.\" S o even though many wars and rumors of wars are occurring a round"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"THE BOTTOM LINE: THE SUPERCOMPUTER FROM HELL 417 the world presently, it's going to get worse, becau se the devil has to terrify the world into needing a worldwide p eacemaker to bring order out of chaos. As this book goes to p ress, we are hearing the sabers rattle in Korea, Bosnia, the middle east, and many other places. I believe that in the not-to o-distant future both Korea and the middle east will present the Anti- christ with the chaos he needs to pull this off. Th ese areas soon could explode into full-blown war—horrifying q uag- mires—that will call for a complete mobilization of US Armed Forces to help quell the planned disorder. . .under the com- mand of UN officers, of course! There even could be a limited nuclear strike, utilizing small atomic weapons. Suc h a nuclear conflagration—unheard of since World War II—would t errify the world into thinking that it was on the very pre cipice of Armageddon (even though actual Armageddon will be several years after the Antichrist comes to power). The wor ld, then, would need a world government under a charismatic, global leader (the Antichrist) to restore order and create peace from chaos. . .ordo ab chao. In addition to the war chaos scenario presented abo ve, Satan's people also could create an international f inancial disaster—an economic cataclysm the likes of which t he world never has seen—creating havoc around the globe that is unparalleled in history. Worldwide famine and uncon trolled contagious diseases are other forms of chaos. Other possibilities could be created as a result of an information \"mel tdown,\" created by terrorists, thieves, government agencies , or others. As Winn Schwartau suggested in Information Warfare, an informational \"Chernobyl\" is inevitable—it's just a matter of where and when. As a result, virtually everyone' s wealth will be wiped out over night—not difficult in a cas hless society! Banks will close and circumstances will be desperat e, even worse than the Great Depression of the 1930's throu gh which our parents lived. People will be reduced to povert y and will be dependent totally upon the government for subsis tance. Money, food, medical assistance, and other benefits will be used to make people gratefully submit to the govern ment's"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"418 BIG BROTHER NSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" plan to resolve this and other global crises. Dr. Henry Kissinger, a new world order \"lieutenant, \" was quoted several years ago as saying that what the wo rld really needed to make it realize that world government was necessary, was an outside threat of some kind. He postulated t hat a GFO alien invasion might be such a world-unifying threa t. (Again, I hear echoes from the Iron Mountain Report, as wel l as the NSA's facilities in Roswell, New Mexico, and Pine G ap, Aus- tralia.) He [Kissinger] further stated that when co nfronted by this threat, the people of the world gladly would r elinquish their national sovereignty and individual rights to receive protection from the UN-led world government against these \"invaders.\" So, based upon this insight from Mr. Ki ssinger, I surmise that in addition to war chaos, economic c ataclysm, and other disastrous events, such as famine and nat ural dis- asters, i.e. floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, volca nic eruptions, meteor bombardment, etc., we also may be confronted with a demonic manifestation in the form of a GFO invasi on. New Agers contend that the \"aliens\" are poised and read y to make intervention into the affairs of mankind at just th e right time to \"save us from ourselves.\" And they widely believ e that such events may occur near the year 2000. By this time, advanced technology probably will hav e moved us forward to the point that our smart cards already will have been replaced by a more positive, unalter able means of permanent identification (biochip implants). But until then, we are being pre-conditioned (desensitized) to acce pt such technology by means of routine use of biochip ident ification of animals, as well as an imminent national ID card —probably based on the current military MARC card, using the new LUCID 2000™ system for implementation. Eventually, as citizens of the world, as well as me mbers of nation-states, we will be required to accept a n ew system of international identification, the MARC/MARK of the New World Order, which likely will be the mark of the beast described previously.

Richards, CPP, titled \"ID Technology Faces the F uture,\" which appeared in the April, 1994, edition of Security Manage- ment magazine, discussing biometric identification metho ds, which states: Since users are likely to be clothed from head to t oe, the identification decision must be based on the hands or the head. . .[emphasis added]. The ramifications of accepting this mark, as I outl ined in detail earlier, result in the loss of your eternal soul and eternal torment in hell (Rev. 14:9-11). The price you will pay for not accepting the mark will be your head. . . literally ! Neither of those choices sounds very appealing to me. It pays to make your choice prior to this event, while there is sti ll time. . .even though it may be very short. Choosing the Right New World Order The drive toward a New World Order continues. Jesus predicted a time of terrible judgment, so bad that if God did not intervene, there would be no flesh left on the earth (Matt. 24:22). Someday Jesus will return, and when He does, He will establish His reign on the earth for a thousand yea rs (Rev. 20:6). This will be God's New World Order promised through- out the Bible. The time to choose which New World O rder is for you is now, before the time for choices is past. Satan's counterfeit is near at hand and, according to Joel 3:9-12, millions will perish during his cruel reign; howeve r, Jesus, the Savior, invites you to receive His grace and fo rgiveness instead, and rejoice in His New World Order forever . No man can serve two masters; that is a biblical ad monition, but you know it to be true from everyday experience . Two other scriptures warn us to \"choose you this day wh om you will serve\" and that \"today is the day of salvation .\" Those are easy to interpret. . .the choice is ours—don't wait until it is too late to make it; and today is the only da y we have"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"420 BIG BROTHER MSA & ITS \"LITTLE BROTHERS\" to accept the Lord's offer of salvation, since none of us have any guarantee of tomorrow. In spite of New Age propaganda to the contrary, the re are really only two choices: The Son of the one true Go d, The Lord Jesus Christ—or Satan, the fallen angel, the f ather of lies, the Antichrist, the false god, whose number ( according to scripture) is 666. For those who may believe tha t we don't have any choice in our destiny, 1 want you to consi der what God said in the Old Testament. First we are told in Joshua to \"choose you this day whom you will serve. As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.\" In another place God said: I set before you this day life and death—choose lif e! I also urge you to choose life! Mot only are the rewards \"out of this world,\" but you can escape God's judgment for rejec ting His Son. How Can I Make My Choice and Choose Life? The Bible promises that all who have received Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord will be saved from the com ing wrath of God on a Christ-rejecting, God-hating world. Yes , you, too, can escape the coming New World Order horror by mak ing Christ your Lord and Savior today. Don't procrastin ate, do it now. Worship is a choice. Choose to worship Jesu s Christ, not the Antichrist. All it takes on your part is a sincere invitation (it's usually called a prayer), then Jesus does the part He promised... He washes you clean by His shed blood, welcomes you into God's family, and becomes your Savior. Thi s is not religion, it's a relationship. Once you have established the relationship with Jesus by asking Him to become you r Savior (an immediate transaction), then proceed to make Hi m the Lord of your life. . . seek to pattern your life after H is example, described in the Bible, and seek His direction for your life. He has promised never to leave us nor forsake us. T hen tell someone about this new relationship. The Bible says that you must believe in your heart and confess with your mo uth— you can think of it as comfirming the transaction."},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"THE BOTTOM LINE: THE SUPERCOMPUTER FROM HELL 421 Personal Preparations Of course, being spiritually prepared is the most i mportant thing, but you might give consideration to preparin g in the natural, as well, i.e., store extra food, acquire s ome precious metals, etc. because some very precarious times lie ahead of us before the Lord returns for His church. Jesus said, \"Surely I come quickly.\" To which we re spond, \"Even so, come, Lord Jesus.\" May God bless you and keep you in the days ahead."}]
