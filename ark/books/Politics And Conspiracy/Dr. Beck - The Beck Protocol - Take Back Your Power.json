Since 1897, at least 20 patents have been filed related to electro- therapy devices.

Beck, D.Sc., USA - Revised August 2000 I Believe the amazing breakthrough you'll read about in the following pages is proving to be the most important medical discovery in decades - or perhaps ever. I Believe that anyone using this knowledge will be freed from sickness, infections, diseases and toxins, the third most common cause of all casualties in the US and the first cause of deaths in the third world. I Believe this tested and true information has the potential to release a person from dependency on doctors, pharmaceuticals, medicines, and hospitals. This technology also has the potential to release us from threat of incurable diseases and biological warfare agents. Even cancer disappears when interleuken and interferon are again produced by a restored immune system. Yet experience shows that 85% of the population will ignore, disbelieve, or vigorously resist these data: they're too simple, cheap, effective and revolutionary. This also requires assuming responsibility for your own health. You'll see why this dynamite truth must be suppressed to preserve multinational corporations. What is it? It's now scientifically established that mild, safe and simple electrification neutralizes bacteria, germs, viruses, parasites, pathogens, fungi and other foreign invaders in blood. Results are rapid, dirt cheap, comfortable and without side effects. Medical \"cures\" once strove to match expensive antibiotics to the few germs they killed before many diseases evolved as strain- resistant. Today's new paradigm is harmless, infallible, and hasn't encountered any resistant micro-organism. Unlike antibiotics and vaccines and their targets, you don't even care what anything is called medically. How? Average adults have eight pints of blood harboring trillions of hostile pathogens and viruses, plus their mutations—the progeny of thousands of invaders. Your blood normally circulates past a given point in under nine minutes. So when you attach electrodes directly outside arterial pulse points on one wrist, a gentle biphasic electric stimulus applied for a few hours introduces a comfortable 50 100uA (microamperes) into your flowing blood without puncturing skin. Techniques developed since 1991 (Beck) have enabled hundreds of previously sick and dying subjects to regain health and become symptom free. Previous sufferers from numerous other conditions are now well again. Many had undergone every medical treatment known with no cures. Electrification, rediscovered and reported many times over the years, has been mentioned briefly in journals since the 1800's then suppressed or disbelieved. Electrification's most recent rediscovery was in 1990 at Einstein College of Medicine by Kaali and variations re patented. (Example: US Patent #5,188,738 in 1993). My research shows everything necessary to take back your power and free anyone from slavery to disease. If you choose to build your own device for electrification, there's nothing else to buy besides a few electronic parts which should last indefinitely. After that the only cost is for replacement batteries. Excellent professional instruments are offered by several ethical manufacturers if you're in a hurry or can't build your own. An obvious problem is this could decimate hospital, pharmaceutical, doctor, and \"health care\" incomes. \"A patient cured is a customer lost.\" Also it could overload Social Security rolls with healthy citizens over 65. It restores health and \"well being ness\" to anyone who applies it correctly. Combined with Kilogauss magnetic pulsing of lymph and organs to induce back e.m.f. which scavenges latent and germinating pathogens, and silver colloids to control secondary and opportunistic infections, plus detoxification with ozonated drinking water, this is proving to be one of the best ways to stay healthy in the 21 St century. Full instructions and easy plans for building your own devices are available. Although not destined to be \"politically correct\" except in the underground, and generally doubted by skeptics who haven't tried it or are threatened, you can easily use this data to heal yourself and your friends. It may never be approved by the FDA. But hundreds of fully recovered patients who've used electrification are today's living proof that IT WORKS! I personally have nothing to gain from this.

Climaxing centuries of medical research, an \"accidental\" re-discovery at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1990 resulted in a reliable, positive, reproducible and recently patented (U.S. #5,188,738) protocol to help deal with diseases including AIDS, cancer, gulf war syndrome, biological warfare plagues plus emerging viruses. Essentially it consists of passing microcurrents (50-100 uA ) through flowing blood, which has the potential to eliminate infections and is proven to restore damaged i mmune systems. This appears to have been suppressed because electromedicine instead of pharmaceuticals drastically limits profits and re-empowers patients' sovereignty over all diseases. Strangely, it was never again mentioned except in Science News, March 30, 1991, pg. 207. The only cost to try this research is the cost of parts to build your own instruments or to purchase them from a reliable source. Hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children receiving state-of-the-art medical care die traumatically and financially stressed every year with \"incurable\" diseases. But this breakthrough consisting of mild electrification of blood while still in the body is proving for some to be reliable, simple, rapid, highly effective and inexpensive. It requires no medicines, pharmaceuticals, or outside intervention. It can be used privately and gives people back to themselves. It is vastly superior to antibiotics and other known treatments, since electrification when properly applied has no side effects. Lifestyle changes to improve health are, of course, important as well. Cancer treated by currently acceptable allopathic techniques (surgery, radiation and chemotherapy) costs an average of $375,000 but patients seldom survive five years. With self-administered electrification, typical costs are under two hundred dollars. An optimally functioning i mmune system has long been known to eliminate cancer, yet cancer is generally treated as a separate disease. Electrification in the laboratory is secretly proven to work with a variety of diseases and no \"antibiotic\" or \"charge- resistant\" strains of infectious invaders or side effects are yet known to exist. But you may never see electrification mentioned in a politically correct or establishment- serving media. Results would be too fast, cheap, revolutionary and user-attainable. The adaptation of this laboratory research for use by individuals is now yours to try. The author has spent several years researching all aspects of electrification and can suggest do-it-yourself apparatus and simple techniques which have the potential to safely eliminate pathogens, bacteria, virus, parasites, fungus, and germs which devastate health and are immune system destroyers. Many previously dying patients have come forward now completely well and symptom free. Anyone can do this for himself if his unconscious death-wish agendas or disbelief in new discoveries or blind faith in the medical establishment are overcome. If the user assembles his own system from scratch, everything should total about $50 minimum up to $450 maximum depending on which devices you make for this one-time investment. If working instruments are purchased from manufacturers, this cost could be more. Everyone using electrification should experience some health benefits immediately, even if not knowingly afflicted. All four synergistic and essential elements are fully described. They are: (1) Building or acquiring a functioning battery-powered blood electro-purifier that attaches externally to the Radial and Ulnar artery pulse points on one wrist. Suggested use is for a minimum of four to twelve weeks with daily electrification of two hours. (2) A very simple and inexpensive instrument for making any quantity of Ionic Silver Colloids for pennies ensuring help with the immune system. (3) A high—intensity magnetic pulser which destroys any residual germinating or incubating pathogens in lymph and other organs by inducing back e.m.f. in tissue consequently preventing self re-infection. (4) An ozone generator easily made with tropical fish store components to charge drinking water with 03. Ozone comfortably detoxifies by oxidation any wastes which the body must eliminate to regain health.

Beck, D.Sc. March, 1999 The complete process is described here in detail to allow anyone to successfully achieve recoveries and insure that the currently proven methods will never again be \"lost\" or suppressed. What You Do 1) Blood electrification for a minimum of 2 hours per day for a minimum of four to twelve weeks. Apply salt- water moistened electrodes over Ulnar and Radial , arteries on opposite insides of same wrist. A VelcroO and elastic strap holds electrodes in place. You must electrify blood for two hours every day for at least four to twelve weeks. This should not interfere with other activities. As your blood circulates normally, enough will be flowing along this path in the forearm until most blood in your body is eventually treated by the 50 to 100 microampere current flowing internally. About 3 to 5 milliampere is necessary at the skin to overcome resistive losses through tissue before current reaches blood. 2) Drink 3 to 5 ppm self—made Ionic Silver Colloid daily. Costing under 10 per gallon, colloids are shown to easily control opportunistic infections. This helps your i mmune system. 3) Apply your magnetic pulse generator for a minimum of 20 minutes daily by positioning and pulsing coil over lymph nodes and internal organs. Pulse each time it recharges at several second intervals. Pulses of high intensity time—varying magnetic flux generate a measurable back e.m.f. in adjacent tissue thus neutral- izing any residual germinating and incubating patho- gens. Without this step, sufferers have been known to sometimes re—infect themselves. Conventional perma- nent magnets cannot be substituted for this purpose. 4) Drink as much ozonated water as you can comfortably ingest daily. You must generate fresh ozone yourself each time and drink immediately since 0 3 has a half- life of only a few minutes. All known pathogens and cancers are anaerobic. 0 3 aids their elimination by oxidation and speeds your detoxification and recovery with no discomfort. Consuming 0 3 water flushes pathogens, wastes and toxins from your system. THESE FOUR STEPS WORK SYNERGISTICALLY AND SHOULD BE USED TOGETHER. A TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF EACH UNIT FOLLOWS: How to Do This and Why 1) The blood electrifier and ionic silver colloid maker are usually combined in one small plastic box typically 3 3 /4 X 21/4 X 1 inch (cigarette pack size) containing one outlet for wrist electrodes and a second for colloid making. A single 9V transistor radio battery drives a voltage tripler, and a single-IC-chip switches the 27- 33V from negative to positive 3.92 times each second. A biphasic square wave with sharp rise-time output is fed to a 3.5 mm jack connecting to two 3/32\" stainless steel or gold—plated electrodes 1\" long each covered with two layers of 100% cotton flannel saturated with diluted salt water. A potentiometer allows users to adjust output until comfortable. Red and green LED's show polarity reversal (essential for safe blood electri- fication) and overall system functioning. A grain-of- wheat lamp indicates current flow when making ionic colloid. Precise electrode locations are determined by carefully feeling arterial pulse points on opposite insides of same wrist and positioning saturated elec- trodes precisely along the paths where arteries come closest to surface. Locations are critical, since the objective is to supply maximal current into blood and not waste it in surrounding flesh. Typical impedance measured from electrode—to--electrode may be as low as 2000 W. Adjust output for strongest comfortable level. Schematics, parts lists and instructions for a three 9 V battery design are detailed in this paper. Anyone can build his own system; you need nothing except replacement batteries. However commercially available systems are inexpensive, reliable, and are useable immediately. 2) Ionic silver colloids of excellent quality and freshness are easily user—made as follows: Pure silver (.999) or better yet, .9999 (4 Nine) 14 gauge (0.064\" dia.) electrodes providing anode and cathode about 8\" long, are immersed in distilled water. Some prefer \"golden\" colloids, easily made by heating 2 cups of distilled water to the boil in a non—metal container.

The colloid will probably be clear but if run longer will turn a golden yellow. Stir every few minutes. Store silver ionic/colloidal silver in dark brown bottles. Keep out of light and do not refrigerate. [If using a manufactured unit with Constant Current, it is not necessary to heat the water for conductivity. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to make a high quality ionic/colloidal silver.] 3) Magnetic Pulser: This extremely useful tool neutral- izes active, hibernating or incubating pathogens being normally processed in lymph, spleen, liver, skin, kidney, stomach muscles and other tissue. It is easily made by purchasing or winding a –2.5 millihenry coil and driving it with a –35 to 70 Watt-Second (Joules) electronic flash or \"strobe\" (A Joule is 1/2 CV2 where C is in microFarads, mF or mfd., and V is in Volts.) A self-wound inductance of –130 T #14 or 16 AWG, plain enameled magnet wire works well. A 2.5 mH audio speaker cross–over coil is prettier. The coil is simply wired between one electrode of the strobe flash lamp and it's capacitor. The device, if self-made, costs approximately $100 and is vastly more powerful than $5000 to $7000 commercial devices of far less measurable power. The open coil kicks a steel washer several feet into the air when pulsed thus showing the invisible energy going into your body during use. A typical finished device tests 600 mfd. 330-350V, 36.75 W*S, 43,133 Gauss, 150 Amperes peak, 40,500 Ampere Turns pulse rise ti me –1.8 microseconds, pulse duration –2.5 millisec- onds, penetration –9\" in tissue. Along with it's ac power supply it fits in a box 3'/4 x 41/2 x 11 with an external applicator coil 2 3 /4\" dia. x 1 3/8\" thick on a 4' cord. 4) Ozonized Drinking Water: Before adding this final step to the \"magic four\", we had some very uncomfort- able people while they were detoxifying. By drinking ozone–charged water, some of the benefits of ozone use such as insufflation (0 3 enemas), autohemotheraphy, 0 3 injections and blood bubbling, Oxygen Bars and Hyperbaric Chambers are enjoyed and made simple and inexpensive. Tanks of \"medical oxygen\" (identical to welding oxygen) require medical prescriptions. Ozonized water is made from oxygen in ambient air and costs nothing. MAKING YOUR OWN: You can purchase ozone generators legally in tropical fish (aquarium) stores. Preferred is the 200 mg/hour stainless steel Sander (brand) ozonizer used with an aquarium aerator pump. (Avoid models using aluminum, metal or ceramic i.e. alumina ozone electrodes.) Air, pumped through a bubble-making \"stone,\" is passed through chilled water. Depending on the strength of the ozone maker you buy, water becomes \"saturated\" in a few minutes and must be drunk immediately. You can see an increase in % blood oxygen saturation which often reaches 100% within minutes. Be aware that ultra-violet although cheaper is not as effective as a good quality, cold–corona high voltage ozonizer. Construction and use is fully explained in this paper.

Many work far more effectively than expensive antibiotics and have no side effects and practically no costs. Since the Abraham Flexner propaganda funded by pharmaceutical company owner John D. Rockefeller in 1910 eliminated electromedicine from accredited medical universities, researchers have not pursued breakthrough discoveries. They are usually discredited.

But now a new electrical process for cleaning blood of viruses may solve the problem. At the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, Steven Kaali, M.D., has found that most of the AIDS viruses in a blood sample will lose their infectious capability after being zapped by a very low—level current. Repeated exposure appears to leave blood virtually free of HIV, as well as hepatitis—without harming blood cells. Kaali cautions that it will take years of testing before a virus—electrocuting device is ready for use. But, ultimately, he predicts, it could be used not just to purify blood, but to treat people with AIDS, by channeling their blood out of the body, exposing it to virus—killing current and then returning it. \"By lowering the viral count,\" he says, \"we may be able to lengthen and improve the quality of AIDS patients' lives.\" —Sharon McAuliffe MARCH 30, 1991 Page 207 Biomedicine Shocking Treatment proposed for AIDS Zapping the AIDS virus with low–voltage electric current can nearly eliminate its ability to infect human white blood cells cultured in the laboratory, reports a research team at the Albert–Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. William D. Lyman and his colleagues found that exposure to 50 to 100 microamperes of electricity— comparable to that produced by a cardiac pacemaker— reduced the infectivity of the AIDS virus (HIV) by 50 to 95 percent. Their experiments, described March 14 in Washington, D.C., at the First Inter–national Symposium on Combination Therapies, showed that the shocked viruses lost the ability to make an enzyme crucial to their reproduction, and could no longer cause the white cells to clump together—two key signs of virus infection. The finding could lead to tests of implantable electrical devices or dialysis–like blood treatments in HIV–infected patients, Lyman says. In addition, he suggests that blood banks might use electricity to zap HIV, and vaccine developers might use electrically incapacitated viruses as the basis for an AIDS vaccine. For scientists working to create contraceptive devices that repel sperm with electricity, the new study also hints at a lifesaving side effect: protection against HIV.

Researchers William Lyman and Steven Kaali of the Albert Einstein School of Medicine said Tuesday that initial laboratory tests have shown electrical current can weaken the virus believed to cause acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The two men said they plan to move to the next phase of the experiment in April using blood samples from people with AIDS. If their tests are successful, the researchers hope it could lead to a new way to treat AIDS patients, possibly involving a dialysis—type machine in which an AIDS patient's blood would be treated with electrical current outside the body. \"What we have done is expose the AIDS virus in laboratory circumstances to electrical current and then incubated the virus with white blood cells susceptible to the virus. We found that the virus became much more ineffective,\" Kaali, a specialist in the medical use of electrical current, said Lyman, an AIDS researcher and associate professor of pathology at Einstein, likened the new technique to chemotherapy. \"You are not going to get rid of the tumor, but you could get rid of enough of it to help the patient lead a normal life. This is not a cure but a new tool,\" Lyman said. He added that the use of electrical energy has no toxic side effect and that a similar technique has been used as a treatment for reducing herpes.

Revision March 1999. Copyright 1991/98 by Robert C. Beck, D.Sc. In a remarkable and startling discovery at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, NYC in 1990, it was shown that a minute current (50-100 microamperes) can alter outer protein layers of HIV virus in a petri dish so as to prevent its later attachment to receptor sites. (Science News. March 30, 1991 pg. 207.) It may also reverse Epstein—Barr (chronic fatigue syndrome), hepatitis, Lupus, cancer and many others. HIV—positive users of this enclosed information may expect a dramatic reduction of symptoms after about 45 days. This is reminiscent of a well proven cure for snakebite by application of electric current that instantly neutralizes the venom's toxicity. (Lancet, July 26, 1986 pg. 229.) And there may be several other diseases as yet undiscovered or untested viruses neutralizable with this discovery; perhaps more surprisingly, even the common cold. This very simple and valid blood clearing treatment proved of great promise as a positive method for immobilizing known strains of HIV still present and contaminating some European and US blood bank reserve supplies. It was further suggested that infected human HIV carriers could recover by removing their blood, treating it electrically and returning it by methods similar to dialysis or by surgically implanting electrode arrays with miniature batteries sewn inside blood vessels as described in US patent #5,188,738. Dr. S. Kaali, MD, projected that \"years of testing will be in order before such an in vitro (blood removed for treatment) device can be made ready for widespread use.\" (Longevity, Dec. 1992, page 12.) This paper reveals an alternate do- it—yourself approach for electrifying/purifying blood with no dialysis, implants, or medical intervention. In the writer's opinion both blood and lymph can be cleared in vivo (which means blood isn't removed or skin ever penetrated) simply, rapidly and inexpensively with similar but non—invasive do—it- yourself techniques described herein. All are fully disclosed in this paper. Also included are proven schematics, parts lists, electrode construction and complete instructions. Electronic and controlled electroporation approaches may easily make vaccines, antibiotics and pharmaceuticals obsolete. In a public lecture (Oct. 19, 1991) the writer proposed this theoretical do—it—yourself method for eliminating HIV, parasites, fungi, viral and pathogens in vivo. Subsequently, his original modalities and protocols have been refined, simplified and made universally affordable. These three simple treatments used in tandem are offered for research purposes to determine the extent to which they nullify known electro-sensitive pathogens residing in blood, lymph, and other body tissue and fluids. Following is a summary of several years of testing with this non—iatrogenic, do—it- yourself, simple and inexpensive experimental solution to the ever—escalating \"incurables\" dilemma. There are no known side effects since milliampere currents applied to skin are much lower than those in FDA approved TENS, CES and muscle stimulators which have been in safe daily use for many years. Battery replacement costs are about $10.00 per month per user or about 330 per day for a typical 30 day \"spontaneous remission.\" No pharmaceuticals, shots, or medications appear necessary. One compact battery—powered blood clearing instrument is basically a miniature relay driven by a ti mer chip set to —4 Hertz. Its 0 to 33V user adjustable biphasic output minimizes electrode site irritation. The described system delivers stimulation through normally circulating blood via electrodes placed at selected sites on wrist or arm. Optimum electrode positions are reliably located by feeling for strongest pulse (page 19.) Micro-current treatment is of such low amplitude that it creates no discomfort when used as directed and is demonstrated to have no harmful side effects on healthy blood cells or Revised November 2004 Page 15 of 86"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"tissue. A major obstacle to this simple, proven and obvious solution is disbelief. Treating approximately 120 minutes per day for four to twelve weeks should in the writer's opinion effectively neutralize well over 95% of HIV plus any other electro-sensitive viruses, parasites, bacteria, pathogens or fungi in blood. In heavy infections, shorter application times will prevent stressing patients with toxins. Simply treat for a greater number of days or also ingest ozonized water. In time, the restored immune system plus silver colloid may handle residual problems. In the special case of diabetically impaired circulation longer treatment times may be indicated. (See expanded instructions pages 22-23). Immobilized viruses may be expelled naturally through kidneys and liver. More rapid neutralization is possible but not recommended because of potential excessive toxin elimination (Herxheimer's syndrome.) T—cell counts usually drop initially because of lysing and scavenging by macrophages but should recover and increase after a few months. There is too much controversy around the PCR test and it has not been proven as a reliable measurement for HIV. Latent/germinating HIV reservoirs in body's lymph or other tissues and glands may theoretically be neutralized with a second and separate device by the strategy of generating a very high intensity (~20 kilogauss) short duration (-10 uS ) magnetic pulse of >~32 Joules by discharging a modified strobe light's capacitor through an applicator coil held against body locations over lymph nodes, thymus, kidneys, adenoids and other possible internal sites of latent infection (see page 43). By the physics of Eddy current/back e.m.f. \"transformer action\" (Lenz' law) the desired criteria of minimum current induced through infected tissue on the order of >100uA should be readily attained. Several pulses repeated at each site over several weeks may insure a reliable \"overkill\" for successful disease neutralization. A magnetic \"pulser\" is very simple to build. Full instructions are on page 41-42. Subjects must assume responsibility for their own health. In today's society, we are conditioned to look for answers only to a medical establishment. Unfortunately current medical practices have been unable to cure so many illnesses today. These \"theoretical solutions\" are being disclosed under constitutional freedom of speech guarantees. Data is offered only as theoretical and no medical claims are made or implied. \"See your health professional!\" Anyone at his discretion and assumed responsibility should be free to build, use (on himself) and network his \"research\" results. With this data, someone with a little knowledge of electronics should confidently be able to assemble both theoretical blood and tissue clearing modalities in about three hours. Components are widely available. After assembling, the only additional cost is for batteries. If electronically unskilled, \"busy\" or technically illiterate, call an \"Amateur Radio Supply\" store (yellow pages) or find a ham radio operator, hobbyist or TV repairman. After \"spontaneous remissions\" some users may wish to interest their doctors. But be advised that electronic cures may be vigorously suppressed or ignored because there is presently no credibility nor drug cartel profit in this inexpensive solution.

User tested for over two years, it is solid state (no relays), uses three (not seven) batteries, makes colloids, is much smaller, lighter, silent, with battery saving features. Copyright © 1996 Robert C Beck, D.Sc. The first section (U1B) of the LM358 dual op amp is a 50 volt peak to peak square wave oscillator. The second section (U1A) reverses polarity and provides ±27 Volts DC output of low impedance. This delivers a Bi-Phasic, sharp rise time output of Hz (not critical) for the biological cotton covered stainless steel electrodes saturated with salt water before applying. Sharp rise time is considered necessary to provide higher odd harmonics to the stimulus, although \"rounded\" waveforms will feel different. The third section is a current limited 27 Volts DC output from a separate RCA (or 2.5mm) jack for rapid generation of excellent colloidal silver in water. A three minute cycle in 8 Oz. of room temperature water makes a ppm concentration. Op amp section U1B's 4 Hz oscillator frequency is set by C1 (0.1 uF) and R1 (2.4 meg W). It is configured as a comparator with hysteresis determined by R2 (150 kW). Charging and discharging of C1 is done by the 180° out-of phase signal through Rl. R3 and R4 provide a set point 1/2 the V+ to the comparator. This insures a 50% duty cycle square wave with an amplitude of slightly less than the —27 Volt supply. U1A, the second comparator, is used to invert the output of oscillator U1B. A —50 Volt peak to peak signal will be generated between the op amps due to their outputs being 180° out-of phase. U1A's current is limited by potentiometer R5 (100 kW) and R7 (820 W) and is set to individual user's comfort. The power indicator circuit consists of a bicolor (red green) LED (CR1) and the series combination of two 18 Volt Zener diodes, D 1 & D2, with power limited by C2 (22 uF, 35 Volt). This section of the device is automatically disabled when the 3.5 mm plug is inserted into its jack. Therefore the LEDs flash only when batteries sum is over —21 Volts. If LEDs are dim or extinguished, replace with three fresh 9 Volt Alkaline batteries. C2 used as a limiter allows the LED to flicker on at 1/8 second intervals only as the square wave output reverses polarity. Users find this newer design highly satisfactory, trouble free and most efficient.

Copyright © 1991/1998 Robert C. Beck, D.Sc. PRECAUTIONS: Do NOT use wrist–to–wrist with subjects using cardiac pacemakers. Any electrical signals may interfere with \"demand\" type heart pacers and cause malfunction. Single wrist/forearm locations should be acceptable. Do NOT use on pregnant women, while driving or using hazardous machinery. Users MUST avoid ingesting anything containing potentially toxic medications, nicotine, alcohol, recreational drugs, laxatives, for several days before starting because blood electrification can cause electroporation which makes cell membranes pervious to small quantities of normally harmless chemicals in plasma. The effect is the same as overdosing. See Electroporation: a General Phenomenon for Manipulating Cells and Tissues J.C. Weaver, Journal of Cellular Biochemistry 51: 426-435 (1993.) The blood purifier can cause electroporation. Avoid ingesting alcohol 24 hours before using and keep in mind that high potency, synthetic vitamins as well as junk foods can be a problem when magnified. Do NOT place electrodes over skin lesions, abrasions, new scars, cuts, eruptions, or sunburn. Do NOT advance output amplitude to uncomfortable levels. All subjects will vary. Never put bare metal on skin. The magnetic pulser should be safe to use anywhere on body or head. Drink an 8 oz. glass of filtered or preferably ozonated water 15 minutes before and immediately following each session and drink at least four additional glasses daily for flushing during \"neutralization\" and for one week thereafter. This is imperative. Ignoring this can cause systemic damage from unflushed toxic wastes. When absolutely essential drugs must be ingested, do so a few minutes after electrification then wait 24 hours before next session. If subject feels sluggish, faint, dizzy, itchy, headachy, light-headed or giddy, nauseous, bloated or has flu–like symptoms or rashes after exposures, reduce pulsing per session and/or shorten applications of electrification. Drink more water—preferably ozonized—to speed waste oxidation and disposal. Use extreme caution when treating patients with impaired kidney or liver function. Start slowly at first, about 20 minutes per day to reduce detoxification problems. To avoid shock liability, use only batteries with blood cleaner. Do NOT use any line–connected power supply, etc. with blood electrification device. However a.c. supplies are OK with well–insulated magnetic pulse generators (strobe lights.) Health professionals: Tobacco, the most damaging (41/2 times more addictive than heroin) and deadly substance of abuse known, disrupts normal cardiovascular function. True vegetarian diets are missing several essential amino acids absolutely necessary for the successful rebuilding of AIDS–ravaged tissues. Secondary gains and hidden agendas (sympathy/martyrdom, work avoidance, free benefits, financial assistance, etc.) can play large roles with many seriously ill patients. SUPERIOR ELECTRODES: Excellent, convenient and vastly superior electrodes, reusable indefinitely, can be user- made by butt–soldering connecting wires to ends of 1-1/8\" long by 3/32\" dia. blanks cut from type 316 stainless steel rods available from welding supply stores (Cameron Welding Supply, 11061 Dale Ave., Stanton, CA 90680.) Use \"Stay Clean\" flux before soldering (zinc chloride/ hydrochloric acid.) Shrink–insulate TWO tight telescoping layers of 3/8\" long shrink tubing over soldered joints to prevent flexing/breaking and lead/copper ions from migrating. PREPARATION FOR USE: Wrap three or four turns of 100% cotton flannel around rods. Spiral–wrap with strong thread starting from wire side to end. Tightly pinch cloth over rod's end so as to leave no metal exposed by wrapping 6 or 7 turns of thread TIGHTLY just off end of rod, then spiral wrap back to start and tie with four knots then cut off excess cloth at end close to pinch-wraps. Treat end and knots with Fray Check® (fabric & sewing supply stores) to prevent raveling. Saturate before each use in a solution of sea salt (not table salt). Add a few drops of Colloidal Silver for disinfectant. Store for reuse. Tape soaking wet electrodes tightly over arterial pulse sites with paper masking, Transpore TM or Micropore® tape or make 1\" wide stretch elastic bands with tabs of Velcro® at ends to fasten. Electrodes should closely conform precisely along blood vessels, not skewing ever so slightly over to adjacent flesh. This insures better electrical conductivity paths to circulating blood and insures very low skin impedance. (-2000Q) Rinse and blot-dry electrodes and skin after each use. NEVER allow bare metal to touch skin as this will cause burns manifested as small red craters that heal slowly. The objective is to get maximum current into blood vessels, not leak it over to adjacent tissue. Therefore never use any electrode with cotton cover wider than about 1/8 inch. ELECTRODE PLACEMENTS: Locate blood vessel paths (NOT to be confused with acupuncture, Chapman or pressure points) on either wrist (Ulnar to Radial) or else kevised November 2002 Page 22 of 86"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"wrist to forearm by feeling for maximum pulses. Scrub skin over chosen sites with mild soap and water. Position each electrode lengthwise precisely along same branch of Radial artery. A 7\" long, 1\" wide elastic stretch–band with two l-'/4\" lengths of 3 /4\" wide Velcro® sewn to ends of opposite sides makes an excellent wrist band for holding electrode snugly in place. Place wet electrodes between ulnar and radial pulse points on opposite sides on inside of same wrist. Then with electrode cable unplugged, turn switch ON and advance amplitude control to maximum. On original blood electrifier design, push momentary SW 2 \"test\" switch and see that the red and green light emitting diodes flash alternately. This verifies that polarity is reversing –4 times per second (frequency in NOT critical) and that batteries are still good. When LED's don't light, replace all three 9V alkaline batteries. When the white incandescent bulb dims or appears yellowish, or relay isn't clicking, replace all four AA cells. Zener diodes will extinguish LED's when the three 9V battery's initial 27V drops below –20V after extended use. Never use any electrode larger than 1-1/8\" long by 1/8\" wide to avoid dissipating current through surrounding tissue. Confine exactly over blood vessels. Apply drops of salt water to each electrode's cotton cover as needed to keep cotton covers damp and insure optimum current flow. Later devices are solid-state, use only one battery and no relays, and are much smaller. Electrify blood 2 hours daily for 4 weeks or longer as indicated. (See diagram on page 19.) SETTING VOLTAGE: Now rotate amplitude control to minimum (counter-clockwise) and plug in electrode cable. Advance dial slowly until feeling a \"thumping\" and tingling. Turn as high as tolerable but don't advance amplitude to where it is uncomfortable. Adjust voltage periodically when acclimatizing to comfort level after several minutes. It is normal to feel different sensations with time. You may notice little or no sensation at full amplitude immediately, but feeling will begin building up to maximum after several minutes at which time amplitude can be decreased. Typical adapted electrode–to–electrode tissue impedance is on the order of 2000 Ohm. Typical comfortable input (to skin) is ~3mA, and maximum tolerable input (full amplitude) is ~7mA. However, this \"reserve\" margin although harmless is unnecessary and can be uncomfortable. Current flowing through blood is much lower than this external input because of series resistances through skin, tissue and blood vessel walls, but 50 to 100uA through blood is essential. FREQUENCY OF USE: Apply blood electrifier for about two hours daily for at least 1 to 3 months. Use judgment here. The limiting factor is detoxification. Carefully monitor subject's reactions (discomfort, catarrh, skin eruptions, weeping exudites, rashes, boils, carbuncles, coated tongue, etc.) With very heavy infections, go slower so as not to overload body's toxic disposal capability. Drinking ozone–bubbled water oxidizes wastes and speeds detoxification. With circulation–impaired diabetics, etc., you may wish to extend session times. Again, have subjects drink lots of water. Recent changes in theoretical protocol being currently tested suggest continuing the protocol for several weeks. One health practitioner with extensive use of both the blood electrification and magnetic pulsing devices reported to Sharing Health From the Heart Inc. to suggest prolonged use to ensure the stronger pathogens have been neutralized. He points out the danger of stopping too soon if only the weaker pathogens have been dealt with. He has suggested building up to using the blood electrification device for 6 days continuously to neutralize the longest-lived pathogens. Remember to remoisten electrodes regularly. If you absolutely must ingest prescription drugs, do so immediately after turning off instrument and allow 24 hours before next treatment to let chemical concentrations in blood plasma decay to lower levels. Remember, if subjects ever feel sleepy, sluggish, listless, nauseous, faint, bloated or headachy, or have flu-like reactions, they may be neglecting sufficient water intake for adequately flushing toxins. We interpret this as detoxification plus endorphin release due to electrification. Let them rest and stabilize for –45 minutes before driving if indicated. If this detoxing becomes oppressive, treat every second day. Treatments are shown to safely neutralize viruses, fungi, bacteria, parasites and microbes in blood. See US patents #5,188,738, 5,091,152, 5,139,684, 5,328,451, 3,753,886, 4,524,079, 4,665,898 and others as well as numerous valid medical studies which are presently little known or suppressed. SILVER COLLOID: Also, ingesting a few oz. of –5 parts per million silver colloid/silver ion solution daily can give subjects a \"second intact immune system\" and minimize or eliminate opportunistic infections during recovery phase. This miracle substance is pre-1938 technology, and unlike ozone is considered immune from FDA harassment. Silver colloid can easily be made at home electrolytically in minutes and in any desired quantities and parts per million strength for under 10 per gallon plus cost of water. It is ridiculous to purchase it for high prices. Unlike silver proteins, metallic colloid has no side effects. Silver colloids won't produce drug resistant strains as will all other known antibiotics. No reasonable amount can overdose or injure users either topically, by ingesting, or professional medical injection. Refer to page 31 for complete instructions on successfully making your own.

Step 2: Place the cotton sleeves over the electrodes. A dropper bottle is a handy way to wet the cotton and to keep the covers damp during use. Step 3: Place the covered electrodes directly over the two arteries on the wrist: the radial and ulner arteries. Step 4: Hold the electrodes in place with a wrist strap. This one is made of waterproof neoprene with velcro to hold it firm. Ensure the wrist strap does not get wet between the electrodes. If it does the current will travel between the two electrodes rather than through the skin to the arteries.

Beck, D.Sc. re Re-issued May, 1998 Opinions expressed in this article are based on the author's first hand experience and do not necessarily reflect those of this publication. [ Also published in Explore! Magazine] My archives contain a tantalizing report from several decades ago describing an authenticated record of an older man who was struck by lightning, survived, and subsequently grew a third set of teeth and a bushy head of youthful new dark hair. His grossly metastasized, inoperable cancers vanished. He threw away his glasses and cane, and appeared much younger and was totally healthy for the first ti me ever. This fascinated scientists and years later almost encouraged some highly illegal and bizarre human experiments in an abandoned aircraft hangar in Wendover, Utah where Tesla coil research with ball lightning was underway. The incident generated wide speculation, but few insights at the time. This mystery remained sleeping until 1990 when an astounding discovery was reported at Albert Einstein college of Medicine in NYC by Drs. Kaali and Lyman. Not surprisingly, the revolutionary data were apparently immediately suppressed (See Science News: Mar. 30, 1991 pg. 207; and Longevity: Dec. 1992 pg. 12.) As a totally unexpected and unpredictable outcome of the writer's self-funded research into \"blood electrification\" with micro currents for AIDS (currently showing excellent results), a growing number of users previously unknown to me began independently reporting \"spontaneous remissions\" of numerous other diseases including cancer. Most involved no doctors, medication, or time off. Recoveries occurred after subjects had self-administered an altered do-it-yourself blood treatment process first described in US Patent #5,188,738 issued to Dr. Steven Kaali in '93. We were puzzled to find explanations as to why this worked. This preliminary report offers a possible theory. Magnetic pulsing success with cancer were independently proven again in 1984 and described in US Patent #4,665,898 plus many other patents dating back to 1890! The Einstein disclosure describes removing blood from one arm, electrifying it, and returning it to the other arm in a process similar to dialysis. It also describes surgically i mplanted active electrode chambers containing miniature batteries sewn inside blood vessels. This author's preferred approach leaves all blood in the body, is totally non- invasive, costs practically nothing and is safely accomplished in about a month with –two hours per day exposures as one goes about his normal activities. It handles pathogens while blood flows normally through the –60cc volume of the electrified forearm's ulnar branch artery from wrist to elbow. Without medications, invasive techniques or doctors, most pathogens, viruses, microbes, parasites and fungi just tend to disappear. Progress can be readily observed in blood with dark-field and phase-contrast microscopy. The entire process and simple apparatus with parts list is fully described in my '91 paper reprinted in recent issues of Explore! (Vol.7 #1) and in this paper. Also simple instructions for self-made silver colloids of far better quality than you can usually buy are given in Vol. 7, #2 of Explore! also Explore More, Issue #15. Back issues: Box 11510, Prescott, AZ, 86303, 928-541-1920. You can turn any glass of tap water into a 3 ppm ionic electrolytic silver colloid in about two minutes anywhere with a shirt pocket instrument by simply running 27V (three 9V transistor radio batteries) between two short lengths of pure silver (never \"Sterling\") wires submerged in water. To date many \"spontaneous remissions\" of dozens of \"incurable\" illnesses including HIV have been reported by users and researchers of this \"blood purification\" when combined with ingestion of pennies-per-gallon instantly self-made ionic silver colloid plus magnetic pulsation and ozonized drinking water. Since none of dozens of friends using these apparent miracles has experienced infections, colds, flu, pneumonia, or lost a single day's productivity in over three years, evidence strongly suggests restored immune systems or dramatically improved blood functioning. It is also fascinating to note that several pet owners report their cats now refuse to drink water if silver colloid is not added. Trips to veterinarians with previously recurring infections were cut dramatically. It is as though the Creator had left a secret \"back door\" method for mankind to finally conquer the adversary - incurable diseases plaguing us since the beginning of time. To avoid legalities, these data are being offered under first amendment freedom of speech rights and should not be construed as medical advice. It has long been known that dissections of cadavers dying of natural causes reveal many have had cancer several times during their lifetime resulting in \"spontaneous remissions\" generally without their knowledge and without ever visiting a doctor. An optimally functioning immune system somehow automatically \"handles\" diseases of which the subject seldom becomes aware. Several promising broad- spectrum natural immunological agents like interferon and interleukin are produced by healthy immune systems but would cost thousands for patients with already overloaded or \"shut down\" defenses although many such neuropeptides could speed cures. Other respected researchers describe \"pleomorphic\" forms of cancer pathogens which evolve through several stages—even mycotoxin involvement—all of which surrender to blood electrification.

Most retail ready-to-use from $135 to $200. But this health breakthrough is politically incorrect and may never be FDA approved because of the millions of dollars and years needed to sort through an approval process and the billions invested in treatment facilities, pharmaceuticals, and in clinical, diagnostic equipment This discovery gi es power over diseases back to the individual. The onl dangers lie in too rapid detoxification avoidable by increa ing ozonized water intake for flushing and oxidizing wastes erxheimer's syndrome), plus avoiding potentially tox c substances during blood electrification because of v stly enhanced cell absorption due to electroporation. (See J.C . Weaver: Harvard-MIT in Journal of Cellular Biochemistry, 51:426- 435; 1993). All drugs, alcohol, tobacco, pharmaceuticals and coffee must therefore be discontinued for at least two days before starting and for the duration of blood electrification or magnetic pulsing. This minimizes substances in your blood plasma which may become toxic at –20X their normal levels. Electrification is now being successfully used underground around the world. One example—cervical cancer alone kills –1/3 of all victims in the third world, and has long been known to be caused by the papilloma virus. Electrification has the potential to eliminate these toxic \"fellow travelers' coexisting in our blood and may handle 'innumerable other diseases previously considered \"incurable.\" Ebola or other possibly genetically engineered biological warfare \"designer\" plagues may be unleashed someday per some theories of Gulf War Syndrome diseases which are currently i mmune to all other known countermeasures. Blood electrification, colloids and ozone may be effective against these viruses as well. Unfortunately in today's society, millions of dollars are needed to do the research for more people to be helped. The most reasonable theory of why electrification is so surprisingly effective for so many conditions lies in the now proven fact that when correctly applied directly into blood (not into other body tissue like palms of hands, soles of feet, or organs) the process neutralizes all microbes, pathogens, fungi, parasites, viruses, bacteria, mycotoxins and coexisting foreign life forms and alien invaders and their byproducts. In my opinion, this should never be confused with Royal Rife, Hulda Clark or others' modalities. Effective results are found to require a minimum of 27 Volts measurable under load with low impedance output which must deliver up to several milli-amperes measurable current into skin to produce the required 50 to 100 micro-amperes internally through blood after the inevitable series resistance losses through vessel walls plus several layers of tissue. Electrical currents in blood can be measured with an AC microvolt meter by IR drop using partially insulated hypodermic needles inserted –6 inches apart into the same artery. Clark's \"syncro-zap\" running at her standard 30 kHz (considered many octaves too high to be effective) actually measures only –2.6V peak to peak under load (~2000 ohms) at palms. The syncro-zapper's current is unmeasurable directly in bloodstream and physically cannot produce the essential 50 to 100 uA required internally. Using the syncro- zapper may only mask readouts of parasite presence radionically. Unfortunately the live bugs remain undisturbed and are still there and will still be observed in stool and microscopic blood diagnosis. To function at all, electrification requires cotton-covered salt water saturated stainless steel electrodes never over 3/32\" wide and 1\" long. Electrodes must be carefully positioned directly over and precisely in line with specific arterial pulse points. This maximizes current into blood by not diffusing it into surrounding tissue. Square or round TENS, EKG, EEG, EMG; etc. electrodes work only marginally and should never be substituted. Preferred instrument pulse-repetition rate is –3.9 Hz biphasic with steep rise time and 50% duty cycle. Rate is not critical although much higher frequencies and certainly higher harmonics of the essential square wave output are degrades by \"skin effect\" where currents travel around the outside of body instead of internally. This is demonstrated by lighting a bulb in one hand while touching a Tesla coil with the other and not getting shocked. Careful electrification causes no known harmful side effects to healthy cells or tissue. Blood electrified for 18-24 hours a day for three months were observed to live for well over a month when sealed under cover slips on microscope slides while the average life of \"normal\" drawn blood is under 4 days. This strongly suggests that even aging bodies may easily and rapidly be made impervious to many hostile, toxic, infectious, antibiotic-resistant and even yet undiscovered invaders. Like all revolutionary ideas, this incredible breakthrough barely survived initial ridicule and rejection because it is too startling, effective, inexpensive, simple and foolproof to be generally believable. Almost universally, people simply refuse to take responsibility for their own health. They think the \"Doctor\" should know what's \"best\" for them. So acceptance of blood electrification, through word of mouth, is just now emerging to enthusiastic acceptance from those who've actually experienced the results. Being profit- motivated, the establishment must resist anything like this. But we now have our \"hundredth monkey.\" Skeptics have only to use this technology to directly enjoy immensely better health. Take back your power! This works!

Copyright © 1997/99 Robert C. Beck Several years of experimentation and many reports of successes have resulted in simple, fast, proven ways to implement this most important step in self-healing. Electrify two hours daily for a minimum of four weeks. 1. Build or purchase a ready–to–use device, or put finishing touches on a nearly–completed kit. 2. Prepare and label a sea–salt–in–water solution for electrode wetting. Use 1/8 teaspoon of sea salt in a 2 ounce dropper bottle. Greater salt concentration can cause osmotic skin burns, irritation and rash. Add water and few drops of colloidal silver. Let salt dissolve. Filter through paper towel to clarify this storable conductive interface between cotton covered electrodes and skin. NEVER let bare metal electrode or any small area of metal touch skin directly, or it will burn. Use natural salt only, not table salt containing iodine for goiter and aluminum and silicates to insure easy pouring. 3. For best electrical conductance scrub skin at electrode locations with soap and water to eliminate skin oils, grime, dead skin cells, etc. Rinse and dry. With fingertip rub a drop of salt water into skin at each electrode site. 4. Referring to illustrations on page 19, carefully feel for pulses and trace a line about 1 inch long at each wrist site precisely on top and in line (parallel) with located blood paths. Pulses on Ulnar location opposite thumb are harder to feel. Never place electrodes over new lesions, cuts, abrasions, or sunburn. Muscle twitching in palm and fingers is normal and experienced occasionally. 5. Dip into bottle to saturate initially. Position wet electrodes not over –3/32\" wide 1-'/4\" long to wrist precisely over traced pulse paths. Slide each from forearm side underneath a snug 1\" wide stretch elastic band with Velcro® retaining overlapped ends. One electrode positions on radial (thumb) side, the second on other (ulnar) inside of same wrist. Current is confined to blood in lower forearm. Very little electrification is detectable elsewhere thus making it safer for heart-pacer users. The wrist electrode placements are more convenient and faster than any other positions. 6. Put larger units in pocket and run electrode cord down sleeve or strap the smaller electrifier—single battery units— with stretch–band to forearm. Plug in electrodes, turn on and advance slowly to comfortable level. I prefer the small, convenient, unobtrusive unit that uses one instead of the three 9V battery units. Neither interferes with normal activities. 7. Re-adjust power occasionally to maximum comfortable level. You can now even sleep with it on without fear. When the treatment (about two hours per session daily for a month or more but only after detoxifying) is done, turn it off and put it aside until tomorrow. When red and green LED's flash alternately with electrodes unplugged you know it's working properly. Blood cleansing can be speeded with heat. Example: wrapping forearm with electrodes in heating pad set to high. 8. Keep electrodes wet by re–moistening with drops of salt water occasionally using eye dropper. When finished, rinse wrists. Wash electrodes periodically with soap, water and soft toothbrush to eliminate skin oils and soil. Soaking overnight will dissolve caked salt. Discoloration at ends is normal. When frayed or worn, discard old covers and re-wrap stainless rods with 3 turns of 100% cotton flannel. Wrap tightly with a few turns of thread to end, spiral back to beginning and tie. Electrodes should last for months, but wire leads break and must be replaced eventually. [Editor's Note: If skin is particularly sensitive, try using conductive gel on the electrodes or reduce the amount of salt in the water to minimize skin irritation. Apply a healing salve after each session.] Revised November 2004 Page 27 of 86"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"What's inside the box? Preferred electrifiers must generate a 3.9 Hz (not critical) biphasic sharp-rise-time square wave, ± 27V peak adjustable output, 50% duty cycle, capable of delivering several milliamperes into a low resistance load at skin surface (—S 2000W impedance) which after losses in tissue resistance delivers the necessary 50 to 100 microamperes through flowing blood. Precautions: Badly debilitated patients such as full—blown AIDS victims should begin at less than 20 minutes every second day and flush by drinking lots of pure water, preferably ozonized because their systems will go into rapid detoxification causing physical problems called Herxheimer's syndrome. Users taking ANY medications should minimize such presence in blood for at least two days before starting and avoid irritants including coffee, tea, alcohol, tobacco, recreational drugs, etc., during the several weeks of recovery. \"Electroporation\" is shown to increase dosage levels up to 20X of anything drunk, shot, or ingested thus causing problems. This documented by J.C. Weaver, Harvard-MIT Jr. Cellular Biochemistry, 51: 426-435; 1993. Patients needing essential medications should take them immediately after turning off electrification and wait 24 hours before next blood cleansing. This lets their residues decay to minimum levels in plasma before re—electrifying. If detoxing becomes disturbing, proceed even more slowly. Symptoms may include fever, giddiness, dizziness, headaches, light—headed, vagueness, nausea, skin rashes, eruptions, itching, boils, coughing, kidney and liver discomfort, aches, general malaise, inflammations, frequent urination, and sluggishness. Use caution when detoxing patients with impaired liver or kidney function. But remember it's far better to force wastes out of your system than leaving them stored where they may have been hiding for years. Treat slowly if initial discomfort occurs. Electrification will profoundly affect your health and provoke your deepest mind—sets such as everyone's unconscious conflicting death wishes. This generally causes noticeable anxiety and depression.

Copyright ©1993/1998 Robert C. Beck, D.Sc. Revision 28 February 1997 To easily and rapidly make unlimited quantities of good quality silver colloid concentrate for –1 0 per gallon (plus water costs) you'll need three 9V type MN 1604 regular alkaline transistor radio batteries, three battery snap–on lead connectors, 2 insulated alligator clips, 1 \"grain–of–wheat\" 24 volt 40 mA sub miniature incandescent bulb, a foot of 3/32\" heat–shrink insulation tubing, 10\" pure silver wire, and a foot of 2–conductor stranded insulated wire for clip–leads. This should cost under $20 maximum for everything and take about 35 minutes to assemble from scratch. This design is idiot proof and simple to use. It makes an odorless, tasteless, colorless, fast and powerful antiseptic and one of the most remarkable healing agents known. Using a heat method, the entire colloid making process takes about fifteen minutes per 16 oz batch for –3-5 ppm laboratory tested concentration at room temperature when using the salt method. Use three snap–on connector clips for the batteries. Solder them in series (red to black) to provide 27 volts. Connect a 24V incandescent lamp in series with either (positive or negative) output lead. Solder a red insulated alligator clip to the positive (anode) and a black insulated clip to the negative (cathode) 2–conductor lead wires. Insulation is shrunk over soldered connections using a heat gun or match. Use ONLY pure silver (.999 fine) or better .9999 electrodes, #14 gauge (AWG) is the preferred size. Pure silver is sometimes available at electroplating supply companies, foundries, precious metals dealers, etc. Do NOT use Sterling silver (.9275 or other) since Sterling contains copper and nickel. Nickel can be toxic. WARNING! Sterling is sometimes passed off for electrodes with commercial colloid makers through ignorance or by entrepreneurs who are trying to cut corners and save money. Discard them as hazardous. Use only triple distilled or de–ionized water for injectable colloid. Single distilled water makes the best transparent ionic/colloids. Tap water is only suitable for external applications as it contains chlorine which produces some AgCI. This gives a milky appearance as will any salt (NaCI) which should be avoided. Bend top ends of silver electrode wires to clip over rim of plastic or glass container. Leave about 4 inches of bare electrodes submerged in the working solution (water.) Spacing between electrodes is not critical. There is no on–off switch, so process starts i mmediately when alligator clips are both attached to submerged wires, however most commercial colloid makers do have switches which must be on when using. Process stops when either or both clips are disconnected. Yield depends on water conductivity, surface area of electrodes, amount of current, and time. If bulb glows visibly, proceed and let current flow for about 10-15 minutes with heat method, then remove clips, stir, and you're done. If bulb doesn't light or you see only a faint reddish glow, proceed longer. Fifteen minutes activation of –16 oz of water brought to a boil, gives –3-5 ppm (parts per million) strength. Ionic/Colloidal silver should be clear. Pale yellow indicates a higher ppm. Any darker color should be discarded as too many impurities are present. The preferred method for making ionic/colloidal silver is to heat the water. Bring 2 cups of distilled water to the boil in a non–metal container. Cover the silver wires about 75% and let the unit run for 15 to 20 minutes to produce 3 to 5 ppm. Overdosing with any amount is considered unlikely for electrically produced ionic/colloidal silver, but silver PROTEINS can be harmful, toxic, and stain skin (Argyria). The 24V, 40 mA miniature bulb acts as an ideal ballast, current drain indicator, current limiter, and battery condition check for the apparatus. I found aircraft \"grain–of–wheat\" lamps (Precision Lamp, Inc. part #10238) in surplus for 500 each. You can momentarily short–circuit clip–leads together without harm; the bulb will simply light brightly. Also the visual brightness while operating gives an accurate indication of water conductivity.

Suggested adult dosage of ionic/ colloidal silver can be one to several oz. solution straight or added to 6 to 8 oz. of water taken not more than three times in 24 hours. Consult your health professional. An 8 ounce glass may be ingested directly with no harm or side effects according to some sources. Clean electrode wires after each use to remove dark oxide occurring on anode because the oxygen (produced electrolytically) oxidizes silver. Cut a small piece of 1/4\" thick nylon ScotchbrightTM kitchen scouring pad to polish the silver wires, then wipe with paper napkin to make silver ready for next use. A fresh set of 3 alkaline batteries will make hundreds of 8 oz. batches of three—minute silver colloid before battery replacement becomes necessary. Periodically check batteries by momentarily short—circuiting tips of alligator clips together to observe whiteness and intensity of light. When bulb appears significantly dimmer or looks yellowish after time, replace all three alkaline batteries. Pry snap connectors off, tape 3 new cells together, and replace snap—on clips. Be VERY careful not to crush or damage the fragile little in— series lamp. Store in a dark brown container. KEEP AWAY FROM LIGHT as even room light will degrade colloids rapidly by turning solution gray or black just as exposure to light darkens the silver in camera film. Light can also neutralize positive charges on silver ions that help keep particles in suspension. Keep colloids cool but do not refrigerate or let freeze. After evaluating many different instruments and methods, this paper describes what is easily the best performing, least expensive, simplest and most convenient method for producing good quality silver colloids presently disclosed. It has been fully tested and found to work much better than expensive, dangerous and complex devices. However it does not work with metals such as gold, which require much longer times. This stand alone appliance works all by itself, and never requires high voltage, ignition coils, transformers, underwater sparking, or \"plugging in.\" It goes in your pocket and will work anywhere. It is essential for sterilizing local drinking water when traveling. (See accompanying suggested uses.) You can make any desired concentration in parts per million by electrolyzing at higher temperatures. There is no heat or waste, and it cannot shock you. Filtering is generally unnecessary. Don't add preservatives, minerals, EDTA, proteins, gelatin, coloring (some makers add yellow dye to make it appear \"golden\" and even honey to slow precipitation), or any other substances. If purchased at market prices, commercial colloids could cost up to $60 for 8 oz. of generally vastly inferior products. Some available colloids on today's market when evaluated prove to be practically worthless. (At a recent health expo, in my opinion, out of eight brands tested only two were found to be adequate in quality, suspension and concentration. Many contained additives such as EDTA, coloring and gelatin for suspension.) This paper describes an easy way for anyone to make his own for only a small fraction of a penny. It seems ridiculous to buy it for high prices. You can now afford to use colloids universally, such as in laundry water for sterilization, as a disinfectant spray, rinse for fruit and vegetables, fungicide, bactericide, plant spray, pet health assurance, and hundreds of other applications. Side effects or overdosing are claimed unknown, and resistant strains of disease—causing pathogens never develop. Most users ingest lactobacillus acidophilus, bulgaricus, yogurt, etc. to replenish friendly intestinal flora.

A few are suggested here. You can use most purified water to make colloid for industrial and external uses but distilled or de- ionized water should be used for internal applications. Add to suspected drinking water when traveling or camping. Colloid sprayed burns heal rapidly without scarring. Safely sterilize anything from toothbrushes to surgical instruments. Use topically on cuts, wounds, abrasion, rashes, sunburn, razor nicks, bandages. Spray on garbage to prevent decay odors. Mist kitchen sponges, towels, cutting boards to eliminate E. Coli 0157:H7 and salmonella bacteria to prevent food poisoning, gastrointestinal inflammation, and genital tract infections. Add when canning, preserving, bottling. Use like peroxide on zits and acne. Add to juices. Milk will delay spoiling, fermenting, deteriorating, clabbering or curdling. Spray in shoes, between toes, between legs to stop most skin itch, athlete's foot, fungi, jock itch. Diminish dandruff, psoriasis, skin rashes, etc. Add to bath water, gargle, douches, colon irrigation, nasal spray and dental water-pic solutions. Cuts downtime dramatically with colds, flu, pneumonia, staph, strep, respiratory infections and rhino viruses. Skin itch, eye and ear infections, some moles and warts vanish when colloid is sprayed on body after bathing. Use with Q-tip on fingernail, toenail, and ear fungi. Neutralize tooth decay and bad breath. Colloid stops halitosis by eliminating bacteria deep in throat and on back of tongue. Unlike pharmaceutical antibiotics, silver colloid never permits strain-resistant pathogens to evolve. Put a few drops on Band-Aids and bandages to shorten healing times. Health professionals might consider IV and IM injections. Toothaches, mouth sores, bacterial irritations are diminished. Soak dentures. Spray refrigerator, freezer, and food storage bin interiors. Stop mildew and wood rot. Mix in postage stamp, envelope and tape moistening wells, paint and paste pots to prevent bacterial growth, odors, spoiling or souring. Add to water based paints, wallpaper paste, dishwater, cleaning and mopping solutions, etc. Spray pet bedding and let dry. Spray on top of contents of opened jam, jelly, and condiment containers and inside lids before replacing. Mix a little in pet water, birdbaths, cut flower vases. Always add to swamp cooler water. Spray air conditioner filters after cleaning. Swab air ducts and vents to prevent breeding sites for germs. Use routinely in laundry final rinse water and always before packing away seasonal clothes. Damp clothes or towels and washcloths will not sour or mildew. Eliminate unwanted microorganisms in planter soils and hydroponics systems. Spray plant foliage to stop fungi, molds, rot and most plant diseases. Treat pools, fountains, humidifiers, Jacuzzis, hot tubs, baths, dishwashers, recirculating cooling tower water, gymnasium foot dips, and bath and shower mats. Spray watch bands and gloves and under fingernails periodically. Treat shower stalls, tubs, fonts, animal watering troughs, shavers to avoid trading germs. Rinse fruit and vegetables before storing or using. Put in cooking water. Human and animal shampoos become disinfectants. Prevent carpets, drapes, wallpaper from mildewing. Wipe telephone mouthpieces, pipe stems, headphones, hearing aids, eyeglass frames, hairbrushes, combs, loofas. Excellent for diapers and diaper rash. Do toilet seats, bowls, tile floors, sinks, urinals, doorknobs. Kill persistent odors. Rinse invalid's pillowcases, sheets, towels and bedclothes. There are literally thousands of other essential uses for this ridiculously inexpensive, odorless, tasteless, colorless, totally benign and easily produced powerful non-toxic disinfectant and healing agent.

Now we know that unless there is an electrical charge there is no life. Life then, is electrical. And when electrical systems go, although the chemistry is still there, the life does not exist. Dr. Valerie Hunt, Prof Emeritus Dept of Physiological Sciences, UCLA In a past issue (Nov/Dec 1995] 1 wrote of a \"hospital\" that was safer than and in many ways superior to all others in its ability to promote wellness. This \"hospital\" was essentially cost free to operate and portable as a deck of cards. The hospital I wrote of was a colloidal silver generator. With it you can make virtually unlimited amounts of the highest quality colloidal silver for the price of water. Currently, we the people of the United States are spending $3,700 per person per year to treat our diseases—the highest amount in the world. Ironically, our health problems are getting worse. Absurd as it may seem, the third leading cause of disease and death in the United States is now infectious disease. These deaths are completely preventable. With the simple act of wiring together three 9 volt batteries, something very profound begins to happen: Ordinary people are able not only to heal themselves, but find themselves endowed with the power to heal others and to protect the health of entire communities. These everyday people find their new found power even encompasses the ability to heal animals, plants and trees. They're also able to grow more nutritious food and to store food for longer periods of time. The multi-billion dollar managed care of \"incurable diseases\" industry begins to crumble. The deadly, mutagenic vaccine industry begin to crumble. The cold and flu industry which buys all those primetime TV ads begins to crumble. Don't expect these industries to take their loss of power lying down. These cartels will do their best to frighten people away from making it themselves, sometimes buying off colloidal silver manufac-turers act as the cartel's agents. These cartels can also be expected to aggressively market their own substitute products, just as they did with antibiotics in the 1940's when colloidal silver was originally suppressed. One of the most effective flimflam ploys is to trot out an \"expert\" who confirms that the product he or she is selling is absolutely essential for your well being. This \"authority\" will go on to mention that in the course of their studies of competing products, they discovered that these competing products will very likely cause you harm. Actually, the expert is used as a shill to usurp your freedom of choice and dictate what you should regard as \"health\" and health-promoting practices. Similar ploys have been used by colloidal silver manufacturers which has resulted in confusion and fear among those most interested in using silver. We can best avoid manipulation by coming to a deeper understanding about different types of colloidal -silver, production methods, issues of safety and usefulness. First some basics. A colloid consists of minute particles that float within a liquid despite the pull of gravity. To stay in sus-pension for any length of time, these particles must be smaller than I micron (1/1000 of an inch). When fresh produce is processed through a juicer, a colloid results in the form of a glass of juice. Drinking fresh juices makes it possible to consume far more nutrients than by eating. Because juice is considered a predigested food, the body can process large amounts with minimal effort and correspondingly better health results. As a juice colloid sits, the larger particles begin to fall out of suspension and settle to the bottom of the container. To evenly redistribute the contents, it is common to shake up a bottle of juice before drinking. In the case of colloidal silver, silver particles are pulled off a pure silver electrode that is immersed in water by applying a low voltage electric current giving each particle an electric charge. This charge, though long lasting, is not permanent, and both daylight and time will cause a colloid to lose its charge. This loss is referred to as \"falling out\" or \"plating out\"' Note, while colloidal silver is light sensitive, it is not nearly so light sensitive as camera film. If taken to the beach under midday California summer sun, colloidal silver can be expected to oxidize in about 10 minutes. Indoors, under ambient and artificial light, this would take about three days. This only means that colloidal silver should be stored in tinted or opaque containers. Many colloidal silver manufacturers claim that if the silver particles are \"too large,\" the resulting brew will be injurious to the public health. The truth can be found in many science textbooks. When current is applied to silver in solution, metallic silver will always be the same size, 1.26 angstroms (0.0001 microns). 2 This particle is so small that the next stop on the road to smallness is the atom itself. Colloids are by nature the smallest particles matter can be divided into while still retaining individual characteristics. Reducing a piece of metallic silver into a cloud of microscopic particles greatly extends its total surface area, and its healing properties, while deepening penetration into the body. Revised November 2002 age 4 of 86"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Because the silver particles are charged, they strive to combine with other elements in the solution. Trace elements exist even in distilled water, and when the charged silver particles combine with a specific trace element, the solution will turn one of a number of colors, like gray, yellow, green or brown. Whatever element the silver chooses is largely irrelevant: Once in the body, the silver releases its bond in search of stronger attachments in an effort to stabilize its charge. Therefore, once the silver colloid has entered the body, the original silver particles measuring 1.26 angstroms (about the size of 15 atoms) quickly pass through the stomach lining and into the blood stream where they circulate for about a week before elimination. Yellow Colloidal Silver The real reason that yellow colloidal silver is favored by most manufacturers is not because it is more effective than other types, but because it has a longer shelf life before falling out of solution. This stability in solution doesn't automatically -translate into a smaller combined particle size between the silver ion and the trace element it has attached itself to. It may be simply that the trace element which the silver has combined with is more water soluble. In either case, it's a moot point. Simply put, the most effective colloidal silver is not a question of color, but of freshness and highest concentration density.' A disadvantage of the yellow colloidal silver is its bitter taste— unlike the silver colored colloid. Also, the yellow solution is more difficult to make. When using a 27 volt generator, it is helpful to reduce the water volume to mitigate the much longer activation ti me that the yellow solution requires. I couldn't find any medical evidence that the yellow colloid is more effective than a silver colored colloid. People can always create and compare the effects of the yellow and silver solutions for themselves. To make the yellow solution, use a tall, narrow glass with 6 to 8 ounces of distilled water. Use no saline solution. The water will not gain conductivity as it does when a saline solution is added, so the process will take about 45 minutes. It will produce a concentration of approximately 10 ppm. Keep an eye on the color of your solution, or it will eventually turn murky brown and then black. If this happens, just throw it out and start over. Making High Concentrations of Colloidal Silver Extending the process time to make higher concentrations of colloidal silver can be both inefficient and costly for replacing batteries. A smart chemist knows you should always heat the water first to create high concentrations. With this in mind, fifteen minutes of process time should be sufficient to create any desired potency. For every 10 degrees that the water is heated above room temperature (72 degrees), the ppm figure doubles: If 5 ppm resulted after seven minutes of activation with 16 ounces of water at 72 degrees, 82 degrees would yield 10 ppm, 92 degrees would deliver 20 ppm, etc. There is no need to boil the wateras there is ample leeway between 72 and 212 degrees (boiling). For heating purposes, do not use a teapot because of the pot's calcification. Use something cleaner, like a stainless steel cooking pot before pouring water into a glass. The body's ability to process the tiny atoms of colloidal silver makes silver build up in the body impossible. The Environmental Protection Agency's Poison Control Center reports a \"No Toxicity\" listing for colloidal silver. In fact, it appears that harmlessness is one of the attributes of the colloidal physiology, regardless of content. For example, when examining a bottle of colloidal minerals from a local health food store, I noticed arsenic, nickel and lead among the 65 trace minerals on the ingredients list: If the particles are small enough, you can even drink arsenic!4 Since the body has a vital need for silver—to maintain the i mmune system and to production of new, healthy cells, and due to the harmonious nature of colloids entering the body (our blood is also a colloid) it stands to reason that colloidal silver may well be the safest medicine on earth. Just to prove a point to myself, I made a 16 ounce solution of well over 250 ppm and drank it. I repeated this procedure four days in a row. I easily drank the equivalent of fifty 16 ounce glasses of a 5 ppm solution! I did not eat yogurt, acidophilus, or compensate for friendly bacteria loss in any way. The only side effect was that I seemed to feel better! This makes sense according to Capitol Drugs pharmacist, Ron Barnes, R.Ph.; \"Many strains of pathogenic microbes—viruses, fungi, bacter i a or any other single celled pathogen—resistant to other antibiotics are killed on contact by colloidal silver and are unable to mutate. However, it does not harm tissue cell enzymes or friendly bacteria.\" My next experiment was a little different. I cut two flowers in the back yard and left one on a shelf without water for 24 hours. When I picked it up the next day it was completely limp. I made a fresh cut at the bottom of the stem and placed it in a glass of high concentrate colloidal silver. Each day it got better. On the third day, the stem had become firm again, as if it had just been cut. Not a single petal was lost. The second flower that was cut had been placed immediately in ordinary water. Many of its petals had already fallen. Though the flower was in water from the start, it was already dying. It's as if there is something in silver that is tied to the very core of the life process itself. The noted bio-medical researcher from Syracuse University, and author of The Body Electric and Cross Currents, Dr. Robert 0. Becker, MD, agrees. Writing about his experience with older patients, Dr. Becker wrote, Silver did more than kill disease causing organisms. It promoted major growth of bone and accelerated the healing of injured tissues by over 50 percent. He also discovered that silver \"profoundly stimulates healing in skin and other soft tissues in a way unlike any known natural process... \" Dr. Becker discovered that the silver was promoting a new kind of cell growth which looks like the cells of children! \"These cells grew fast,\" he wrote \"producing a diverse and surprising assortment of primitive cell forms able to multiply at a great rate, then differentiate into the specific cells of an organ or tissue that had been injured, even in patients over 50 years old \"5 The healing properties of silver are so all-encompassing that we see researchers expressing amazement time and time again. Revised November 2004 Page 35 of 86"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Alfred Searle, founder of the pharmaceutical conglomerate, wrote in 1919 that \"applying colloidal silver to human subjects has been done in a large number of cases with astonishingly successful results. For internal administration, orally or hypodermically, it has the advantage of being rapidly fatal to parasites without toxic action on its host. It is quite stable. It protects rabbits from ten times the lethal dose of tetanus or diphtheria toxin. \"6 I received a call from a man with a Ph.D. in computer science who had read my original article, made some colloidal silver and applied it with a dropper to a chronic eye infection. He said the infection went away almost immediately. In the course of our conversation he mentioned in passing that colloidal silver also got rid of the plaque on his teeth. I had been wondering what happened to the plaque on my own teeth but had not put the two together. The power of silver still reigns over the world in many modern- day -applications: Physicians use silver compounds in 70 percent of all the burn centers in the United States. British Airlines, Swissair, Scandinavian Airlines, Lufthansa, Olympic, Air France, Canadian Pacific Airlines, Altalia, KLM, Japan Airlines and Pan Am all use silver water filters to curtail waterborne diseases. In fact, NASA uses a silver water purification system on the space shuttle as do the Soviets. Japanese firms even remove cyanide and nitric oxide from the air with silver. So, how do you frighten people away from the safest and most powerful medicine on earth? You tell them that the bogeyman will get them. If they're too sophisticated for that, tell them they will get a strange, archaic disease like argyria. Actually, there is no record of anyone ever contracting argyria from colloidal silver made by the electrolytic method.' (Argyria is a harmless and infrequent cosmetic condition in which some body parts take on a slight bluish cast due to the presence of chemical compounds of which silver is only a component. Argyria did not seem to bother the royal, \"blue blood\" families of Europe, who stayed healthy through the plagues of the Middle Ages by ingesting large amounts of silver.) Surviving With Colloidal Silver Were Ito end up in the midst of a calamity, I would need only water to have one of the most powerful medical resources in the world at my disposal. (Technically, colloidal silver can be made in a variety of common liquids, including beer and soup, but I'm not recommending anyone do this in the normal course of events.) In a remarkable clinical trial with 14 elderly patients, Dr. Robert O. Becker inserted a pair of silver electrode wires directly into each wound, using the body's own juices for the liquid solution and applying current from the external ends. (The voltage used for colloidal silver production is too low to cause sensation.) With this technique, Dr. Becker was able to heal infections inside broken bones—one of the worst kinds of infections to control— as well as heal actual bone fractures and breaks which had previously failed to heal.' In some cases he left the silver surgically implanted in the body. In others, he sewed the wound up around the protrud-ing electrode. Once the wound had healed, \"The implanted silver wire was easily withdrawn from the wound manually without the need for surgery or anesthesia.\" Regarding the ability of metallic silver to control infection, Dr. Becker said, \"All of the organisms that we tested were sensitive to the electrically generated silver ion, including some that were resistant to all known antibiotics.\" Concerning the safety of inserting it into the body, he added: \"In no case were any undesirable side effects of the silver treatment apparent.\" Under emergency conditions it would be good to remember that silver coins from 1964 or earlier contain 90 percent silver, nine percent copper and one percent zinc, all of which are known to have beneficial properties if used in a colloidal state. The coins would have to be scoured until they were clean and shiny before using. This is mentioned purely as an intellectual consideration and is not a recommendation that anyone undertake any such action under normal conditions. Silver electrode wire is much easier to use. What Doesn't Colloidal Silver Do? It doesn't interact with any other medications or upset the stomach, and, in fact, is a digestive aid. It does not sting in the eyes. Medical journal reports and documented studies spanning the past hundred years indicate no known side effects from oral or I.V. administration of colloidal silver in animal or human testing. Colloidal silver has been used with good results under the most demanding health care circumstances. 9 Without overstating the case, it may be time to recognize colloidal silver as not only the safest medicine on Earth, but also the most powerful! References: 1. \"Plating out\" is when the metallic particles of a colloid fall oul of suspension by either attaching themselves to the sides of the storage container or simply by settling to the bottom. This creates two problems: (1) When ingesting colloidal silver, less silver will enler the body because it's attached to the sides of the container. (2) Silver particles that enter the body without their electrical charge will have more difficulty in penetrating the stomach wall or in attaching themselves to the cells of the body. Plastic containers build up an eleclrical charge which can cause plating out, therefore, either non- reactive plastic containers, such as hydrogen peroxide bottles or tinled glass bottles, should be used for storage. 2.

The threat of another 'final solution' was, in fact, increasing every year. As American intelligence reports now confirm, the Soviet Union had taken the Nazi human experiments and developed new forms of toxic warfare. By the mid-1950's the Soviets had produced enough Nazi nerve gas to poison the population of the world several times over. Huge stockpiles of anthrax, plague, and 'designer bacteria' were in place in each Soviet city. In the event of war, barriers of poison ground would isolate Soviet cities from invaders. More frightening, the Soviets had developed new offensive systems of germ warfare for genocide. \"There is little defense against this kind of attack, and what few antidotes exist are withheld from the public as military secrets. One of the best examples of this is Movidyn, a substance that the Soviets discovered in their satellite state of Czechoslovakia way back in the 1950's. Movidyn is a form of colloidal silver, odorless, tasteless, and cheaper to produce than chlorine disinfectants. One part per billion of powdered Movidyn in water has a germicidal effect. In a study of infected wells, it completely destroyed typhus, malaria, cholera, and amoebic dysentery. Drinking containers washed in Movidyn retained their germ—fighting abilities for several weeks. \"Movidyn seems to be a cost—effective prophylactic for most of the water—born diseases that infect the Third World. To the astonishment of the Soviet military, Movidyn also disinfected every germ warfare bacteria in the Soviet arsenal, even their newest designer poisons. In other words, Movidyn was too good. The Czech factory was disassembled and carted back to the Soviet Union. To this day, the Movidyn formula seems to have been suppressed from the world, but then so have reports of germ warfare experiments that went wrong.

Consult with your licensed health practitioner. In keeping with do-it-yourself inexpensive hypothetical approaches to self-help, the simplest and most rapid means for obtaining a capacitor-discharge theoretical magnetic pulse lymph and tissue pathogen neutralizer would be to find and modify a used functioning portable battery and ac powered electronic flash (strobe light) for cameras. These are acquired at swap meets, yard sales, pawn shops, or in junk boxes at used camera stores. Or purchase a new Vivitar (brand) model 1900 ($22) carried at some professional camera stores. This compact, light weight, inexpensive, rapid recharging flash is only 17.5 Watt-seconds (Joules; calculated as 1/2 CV2 where C is in microFarads, mF or mfd., and V is in Volts) power but is readily available and easily modified. It works well enough for casual use but runs on batteries only so has greater operating expense than an AC/DC unit. California swap meet prices for used strobes range from $4.00 to about $18.00. One Sunday the writer found a dozen ac/dc strobes, all in good working condition. Carry four AA batteries with you so you can test flash units before purchasing. Almost any brand or model of comparable output power (17 to 35 watt-seconds) should work. Preferably select one with 115Vac as well as battery operating (dc) capability. First wind the applicator coil. Junk VHS videocassette reels are cheap, plentiful and adequate for this application. Remove 5 screws from shell, remove reels and discard shell. Be SURE alternative spools (if used) are non-conductive (plastic) or system will not work. Avoid shorter length VHS tape reels which may have center hubs larger than 1\" dia. and won't hold sufficient wire. Drill '/4\" holes through hub and through center of flange(s). Make two 4\" discs from 1 /4 \" thick plastic, metal, plywood or stiff fiberboard, drill '/4\" center holes and another 1/4\" hole off-center so coil's inside lead wire can be pulled through. These \"stiffeners\" must sandwich reel's flanges tightly so they won't warp or split as wire pressure builds up while winding progresses. A 2\" (or longer) 1/4-20 machine nut and bolt with washers through centers will clamp flange stiffeners and reel and also provide a shaft to hold in a variable speed drill motor or similar winding device if used. Remove bolt and stiffeners when finished. Specifications: Completely fill tape spool with #14 or 16 enameled copper magnet wire (130 to 160 turns) wound into the 1\" dia. hub and 3-'/2\" OD spool with a gap width for wire of 5/8\". Scrape enamel insulation 1 /2\" from ends and tin. Pull inside end of magnet wire through hub and stiffener and to outside. About 1- 1 /2\" should fill spool. Remove bolt, stiffeners, and finished coil. Now solder ends of 4 ft. of heavy two-wire extension cord to each side of coil. A #14 finished coil weighs -1 lb. 3 oz., has 0.935 millihenry inductance, 0.34W resistance, and takes -20 minutes to hand wind or -3 minutes with drill motor. An excellent alternative is an AMS brand air-core crossover inductor for home audio, MCM Electronics, Centerville, OH 45459, (800) 543-4330 catalog #50-940, 16 gauge, 0.58W, 2.5mH, 2-7/8\" dia. $10.65. Strobe modification consists simply of wiring the finished applicator coil with 4 ft. leads in series between either flash tube electrode. Be extremely cautious when working with case open because a strobe's capacitor can hold a residual high-voltage charge for a long time even when \"off.\" Before modifying and to avoid shock, short out the capacitor by placing clip leads directly across the flash tube. Remember to remove this shunt later. To install coil, unsolder wither wire from flash tube electrodes and connect one lead wire from coil to that side of tube. Connect the other lead from coil to the wire you just removed from tube. Insulate connections with tape. This places your coil in series with the flash tube and enables the lamp to act as an ionized gas relay or \"thyratron\" that dumps most of capacitor's stored energy through coil when fired. Lamp will still flash but less brightly. Cover flash window with black paper. Melt wire-slot with soldering iron. Replace case. You're done! Is it working properly? A good way to test strength of pulsed magnetic energy is to lay a thin steel washer (one strongly attracted to magnet) flat on top of coil, '/2\" off center. A 1\" dia. \"fender\" washer with 1/8\" center hole works well. Let the flash unit charge for about ten seconds or until the strobe's \"ready light\" comes on then Revised November 2004 Page 41 of 86"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"push flash button and see how the washer is \"kicked\" by Eddy current repulsion. A 35 watt–second strobe repels this washer over a foot vertically. Think of your pulsed coil as the \"primary\" of a transformer and anything conductive nearby (living tissue included) as the \"secondary\" in which current is induced when cut by coil's time–varying magnetic lines of flux. Your do–it- yourself magnetic pulse generator delivers a measurable output intensity several thousand times more powerful during each cycle than $7,000.00 German \"Magnetotrons0\", Elecsystem \"Biotrons0\", or Canada's \"Centurion0\" devices widely exhibited at holistic medical expos, none of which is nearly powerful enough for pathogen neutralization. Pulsers are also functionally similar to the \"Diapulse0\" miracle–working healing modality when coil is applied over liver and other organs. Regular permanent magnets no matter how powerful in Gauss absolutely will not work for this application regardless of claims since only a time varying field induces a significant current in tissue. Magnetic fields and therefore induced currents penetrate all body cells, bones and tissues in proximity to coil (effective approx. 8 inches deep) and can theoretically neutralize electro- sensitive pathogens and viruses such as herpes B, HIV, hepatitis, Epstein–Barr and possibly many others as yet undiscovered that hide within nerve sheaths and are therefore untouchable via immune system, white cells, or injectables. This may account for the impossibility of curing many known chronic infections via pharmaceuticals, antibiotics, or any presently known conventional treatments other than electrotherapy. Use pulser on body sites daily. This pulser is safe to use anywhere on the head and body except with cardiac pacemaker users. See page 43 for lymph locations. Zap sites at –10 second intervals for –20 minutes daily. To use press fully insulated coil flat against body over lymph glands and other selected locations such as shown on page 43. Let strobe build up to full charge (about 4 to 10 seconds between pulses) and flash while pressing coil over each selected site. Subjects will feel no physical sensations except for light \"thumps\" during this phase of electrification. Exposure levels are considered safe because intensity of this magnetic pulser is much lower than Magnetic Nuclear Resonance Imaging in routine use of tens of thousands of patients. But should subject feel \"headachy\", nauseous, sluggish, or display flu–like symptoms after exposures with either of these two devices, reduce number of pulses or duration of blood clearing process and drink ozonated water. If immune system is very badly damaged, you may need to repeat all routines after several months to insure neutralization. When using, keep coil several feet away from credit cards, watches, magnetic tape, computers, floppy disks, homeopathic remedies, etc., since its powerful magnetic field can de–gauss and erase magnetic data as well as subtle energy potenized medicines. As an unanticipated serendipity, pulsers are reported to erase deeply rooted lymph and tissue pathology and possibly even classical \"miasmas\" as well as many other microbes, fungi, bacteria, parasites and viruses. Flash should preferably be used with AC power to save battery costs since you'll only get about 40 full pulses per new set of alkaline batteries. For sanitary purposes, enclose coil in plastic zip–lock discardable sandwich bag. When treating numerous subjects if there's no AC adapter it is economical to utilize a small rechargeable lead–acid \"motorcycle\" battery. I recommend the manufacturer's pulser that is far superior to making one with a photo flash and it measures 600g, 330-350V; 36.75 Joules; 43,133 Gauss at 150 Amperes peak; 31,050 Ampere Turns; pulse rise time –1.8 microseconds; pulse duration –2.5 milliseconds; lifetime –250,000 cycles; and penetrates through tissue. How much should this cost? Used electronic strobes cost –$2.00 to –$18.00. Three 1 /2 lb. Spools of #14 magnet wire retail for #9.66 ea. You'll need –1- 1 /2 lb., 4- AA alkaline batteries, $2.89. A 12 ft. #14 X2–wire 15 amp. ac extension cord costs about $2.00 and makes 3 sets of leads, or use heavy-duty speaker wire. VHS spools –500. Wholesale wire from $2.50 to $4.35/lb. In 10 lb. Rolls at Pacific Wire & Cable, 1228 S. Village Way, Santa Ana, CA 92704, (714) 558-1864 –one week delivery. The total cost is around $100. Polarity: Either side of the coil—North or South Pole— will create the necessary microcurrents of electricity in tissue. For prolonged use, it is possible that it is better to use the North (–) or South–seeking side as this pole is known to have a balancing effect. The South Pole of a magnet is known to have a stimulating effect.

Measurements show dramatic increases in blood oxygen within minutes using meters like the Nellcor 7E NPB-40 \"Percent Oxygen Saturation meter.\"' Many different \"Ozonizers\" sold at health expos for prices up to $4,700 are large heavy suitcases, must plug into AC, and almost universally use inferior UltraEViolet systems and bottled oxygen instead of the preferred high-voltage cold corona utilizing air for ozone production. Described here is a superior design producing faster, more concentrated 0 3 than other available home units. It is a very portable three-way, stand-alone system. You can choose to utilize either internal battery power, or car lighter powered input. It can be put together by anyone for a fraction of the cost of top-of-the-line ozonizers. A second cheaper but slower do-it-yourself design using AC power only is also shown here. It uses inexpensive parts for the budget-minded but still works superbly. 0 3 unlike other forms of oxygen carries negative electrical charges that specifically counteract free radical damages, scavenge crosslinking and recharge depleted cells. Ionic silver colloids also greatly assist this \"rejuvenation\" process by restoring free electrons. 0 3 rapidly converts (oxidizes) all known toxins and wastes long present in your body cells to H20 and CO 2 which flush out easily and rapidly without utilizing colonies, lymph, spleen, liver, or kidney detoxing or any other treatments. Build a Compact, Line-Independent AC/DC Low Cost Powerful Ozone Generator Using Air Not Requiring Expensive Bottled Oxygen Note: Nitrogen by-products, oxides and acids produced with air and cold corona discharge have been tested and found negligible and harmless in ozonized drinking water. But hot arcing produces unwanted byproducts using air; pure oxygen does not. So to be safe, start with bottled oxygen and pure water only if making 03 intended for intermuscular injection, insufflation, direct blood infusions, or with heparin for auto-dialysis (bubbling blood in a vessel for reinjection or \"autohemotherapy\"). \"Medical\" and \"industrial\" (welding) oxygen are identical and come from the same tanks at suppliers who charge more by pretending that \"medical-grade\" oxygen is somehow \"different.\" Ambient air works well for drinkable 0 3 . The colder and purer your water and the deeper the container for greater pressure plus the smaller the volume of H 2 0 being bubbled, the most ozone dissolves faster and the longer it lasts. Ideal bubblers are —3\"dia.X 2-1/2 feet high. Teflon or Polypropylene tubes with airstone at very bottom. Tall, thin plastic bottles work almost as well but their greater content takes a little longer for saturation. Nonreactive Pyrex containers are better. How To Use Submerge airstone to bottom and \"bubble\" —10 ounce containers of 1/2 ice plus '/2 cold tap water in a large bottle for —2 to 5 minutes. Drink immediately since 0 3 without stabilizers even in ice water has a half-life of about twenty minutes so retains full potency for only a short ti me. Benefits start in minutes and are far superior to many other expensive products claimed to provide \"bound\" oxygen (chlorites; CIO 2 ) or proprietary \"Vitamin 0\" stabilized oxygen boosters. Ozone cannot be stored which is why everyone needs his own generator to make 0 3 immediately before using for the best possible results. Never directly breathe ozone or ozonized air as it damages (oxidizes) lung tissue even in small quantities. RESOURCES I. Nellcor Puritan Bennett, Inc., Pleasanton, CA 94599, 111 (800) LNELLCOR 2.

Not intended as medical advice. Revision July 6, 1997. Copyright © 1997/98 Robert C. Beck Disclosed here is a revolutionary do—it—yourself, safe, natural, inexpensive protocol based on blood electrification put forth to researchers as a possible solution to infectious diseases. It costs practically nothing. Anecdotal feedback confirms some researchers are having success in the war against AIDS, CANCER, HEPATITIS, LUPUS, EPSTEIN- BARR, GULF WAR SYNDROME, GIARDIA, and others including the common cold. It is offered to humanity as information only; empowerment for everyone who wishes to be healthy again. HOW? Four separate discoveries are combined in this new \"cocktail\" paradigm. If you do it yourself you have nothing to buy except parts and batteries. Most people have unconscious death—wishes manifested as disbelief aversion, resistance and \"defeat the unorthodox healer.\" But you must take back your power and assume responsibility for your own health. What are the four easy protocols? 1. Blood Electrification: In the laboratory, microcurrents are known to eliminate all viruses, parasites, fungi, bacteria and pathogens in blood. Disclosed by many revolutionary patents and research over past years, (back to 1897) these breakthroughs were lost or suppressed. The method was rediscovered by Einstein College of Medicine for AIDS in 1990, then silenced. Blood electrification takes 2 hours daily for a minimum of four to twelve weeks. 2. Pulsed Kilogauss Magnetic Fields: Externally applied magnetic resonance of lymph, spleen, kidney & liver helps neutralize germinating, latent and incubating alien invaders blocking re—infection. This quickens disease elimina- tion, restores the immune system and supports detoxification. Permanent magnets, no matter how strong, will not nor cannot scavenge pathogens with induced back—emf currents. You must have a sharp time—varying magnetic impulse. 3. Ionic/Colloidal Silver: Pennies—per—gallon self—made ionic colloids greatly assist in eliminating all known pathogens and guard against opportunistic infections. This \"second immune system\" is synergistic with steps 1, 2, and 4. 4. Drinking Ozonized Water: Provides rapid, safe, totally natural cell oxygenation without free radical damage. Universal detoxification by oxidation of wastes, dead and neutralized pathogens, (all anaerobic) reduces all to H20 + CO 2 . A low-cost, 0 3 generator is fully described. These four do-it-yourself tools are fully disclosed with detailed illustrated instructions for use. Utilized together and for two hours a day for at least four to twelve weeks, they eliminate all infectious and \"incurable\" diseases. Your only expense is then for replacement batteries. Some persons may need extra rest, liquids, trace minerals plus vitamins B and C during recovery. Have these four proven cures been known previously? Apparently, but not in combination. Related discoveries have been reported in medical journals and patents for over 100 years. Most were lost, ignored, disbelieved or suppressed by doctors and pharmaceutical cartels. US patents on related inventions establish public domain by prior state-of—the—art (many are pre 1982.) Such miracle \"cures\" have been independently rediscovered many times and proven effective. Now all four combined therapies are presented for researchers taking responsibility for their own health. Why hasn't research revealed this before now? When actualized, these data could interrupt HMO profits; disrupt medical—pharmaceuticals cartels, abort biological warfare plagues; eliminate most drugs; wipe out hospital and health care capital investments; minimize insurance machinations; dramatically abate sickness and suffering; plus imperil social security futures with bankruptcy. These are not politically correct. This technology might permit ethical health practitioners to keep their Hippocratic oaths by giving back the patient's sovereignty instead of serving the AMA, FDA, and drug cartels for profit.

He was a giant among men—for his intellect but more importantly for his generous heart. He developed what came to be known as The Beck Protocol and gave it to the world so those who were suffering would be able to find relief. After retiring from a career as a leading physicist, he spent his own money to make it known that microcurrents of electricity are a simple and inexpensive tool to help us restore health. Robert C. Beck, B.E., D.Sc. 1925 — 2002 Bob Beck was widely known for his instrumentation of altered states in brain research, his development of state—of—the—art medical electrostimulators, and his investigation of Tesla electromagnetics. He had been a consultant to Sandia Corporation, The USN Office of Surface Weaponry on the subject of E.L.F. detection, and was a Senior Staff Scientist at Eyring Research Institute. He was Acting Chief of Radiological Defense, OCD, in Los Angeles from 1958 through 1963. He designed and built extremely sensitive magnetometers for the Navy. He had also been a senior lecturer in the graduate school, University of Southern California. In 1969, Bob founded the Monitor Electronics Research Corporation and the Alpha—Metrics Company for the manufacturing of ethical EEG biofeedback instruments. As a university student, he designed and patented the low—voltage electronic flash (Strobelights, 1946). He owns several other patents involving electro—optical systems. Bob served on the Board of Directors of the U.S. Psychotronics Association for seven years and was their National President for three consecutive terms.

The Sharing Health From the Heart Team, www.sharinghealth.com Lesley's Story: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome In my late teens through mid twenties I had bulimia—an eating disorder. After conquering that, I was left with an addiction to sugar and chocolate. For 7 years I lived with the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. In a year I went from Vice- President for a garment firm, with an athletic body, to a couch potato. I left my job and put on 30 pounds. The smallest amount of stress would send me into confusion. When I look back now I realize that my experience was a training ground for realizing my dreams of sharing health with others. Experience is the best teacher!!! Have I reached my goal of abundant energy and great health? I'm sure getting there. Year after year of struggling with my illness I tried everything and spent oodles of $$$. Looking back (hindsight is such a gift) I realize that the following things that I did helped to prepare my body for the Beck protocol: 1) Colon, kidney and liver cleansing and rebuilding. 2) Removing the metals in my mouth and detoxifying my body. 3) Emotional issues. In the beginning I would not accept that I may have some emotional issues. However, as my illness progressed there were many things I would need to allow myself to feel and accept in order to heal. We all have fears, pain and anger that we need to accept, express and allow to heal. After doing all the above, I was introduced to Bob Beck's information regarding colloidal silver, blood electrification and lymph pulsing. I want to share with you my experience. My energy after the first three week program was amazing, I felt alive again. I lived with \"brain fog\" for at least 7 years and it is gone. Here's the result of live blood analysis done before and after electrification. Before: Lots of Free Radical Damage Few Red Blood Cells, most were abnormally shaped with little activity and a bit of sticking Hardly any white blood cells (immune system) Medium bacteria count. After: • No Free Radical Damage • Double number of red blood cells, more normal shape with lots of activity and very little sticking • Lots of white blood cells (immune system stimulated) • Medium bacteria count. I was so excited because the results confirmed how I felt. Free Radical damage was cleaned up meaning the aging process had been slowed. With more red blood cells I am able to absorb more oxygen and nutrients. The dramatic increase in white blood cells showed that my immune system had kicked in to do its job of cleaning up the viruses and other beasties in the blood. In Robert C. Beck's lectures, he says that the bacteria, viruses, etc. are rendered ineffective in the body so that the i mmune system is no longer overwhelmed. It can get to the task of cleaning up the blood. This is exactly what showed in my blood. Approximately three weeks after my session, fatigue and sugar cravings came back with a vengeance. I returned to pulsing and the fatigue and cravings went away. Shortly after stopping, the cravings came back. My conclusion? While zapping the bad guys are neutralized so the body can do its work to clean itself up. With candida especially, the body needs longer than three weeks. When stopping pulsing too soon, the critters start to regain their strength and demand food (sugar) so that they can grow. I will continue to use the blood electrification unit and magnetic pulse generator on an ongoing basis for optimum health. Over time, I expect to see all the \"bad guys\" eliminated from my system. All the above was without using the Colloidal Silver. My husband's live blood analysis showed a major bacteria problem. He took Colloidal Silver for two months. On the second testing his blood showed very little bacteria. Amazing results. I really recommend blood electrification and magnetic pulsing. I have found these two products to be very effective. ( We are all researchers of course.) Remember on this journey of health, to choose what you feel comfortable with. Educate yourself and then make an informed choice. If you do not feel comfortable with something, that is okay. The Beck protocol units are experimental devices. Personally, I was not concerned with that. I chose to try them. Bob Beck and his friends have been using these devices continuously for over seven years to make sure there are no side effects. Check out his booklet or lectures on tape or video before you make a decision. Your health is in your hands. We can learn from each other, but ultimately it is you who must decide.

While in the hospital for breast reduction surgery at the age of 44, I received a blood transfusion. Within hours I felt I was battling for my life. When I was finally diagnosed with HIV in early 1995, I was suffering from childhood diseases - chicken pox and mumps -herpes sores in my mouth, a peptic ulcer, aneurysm, numerous allergies, aches and pains, and I was always tired. My liver was so bad, the doctor thought I was an alcoholic. I was now taking a variety of prescription drugs ... swallowing 32 pills a day. In November 1996, I confided to my brother that I didn't think I would live through the Christmas season. He convinced me to fly across the country for a three-week visit as he felt he could help me. I said, \"What have I got to lose? If he wants to help I'll go.\" I didn't want to miss Christmas with my husband, two grandchildren and their parents but I went. Tracy put me on a careful diet – organic vegetables and fruit with lots of fresh carrot juice and I avoided dairy products, wheat and meat. I eat fish but no canned goods. Tracy started me on several therapies and I went off all prescribed medication. On December 12 th , I started blood electrifying and the magnetic pulsing. Within three weeks I felt great. I was walking miles a day. My mouth blisters (herpes) cleared up. When they return colloidal silver clears them quickly. What's my life like today? I'm living a full life but I'm living with the stigma of HIV. If people in my town knew I'd be ostracized. I'm sure there's a reason why this happened to me but I don't as yet know. I do a lot of yard work, I'm tanned, I look after my two young grandchildren, I cater to weddings ... and I look younger. My husband says I put three gardeners to shame! I continue to use the Beck units. I would greatly love to meet Bob Beck someday. N.M, Washington Editor's Note: Norene's brother says, \"I credit Bob Beck with her spontaneous remission and hope someday to see his picture on Time as Man of the Year and a Nobel Prize winner.\" Overcoming CFS and Fibromyalgia I bought the blood electrification unit—have used it every day now for about a month. This is the first time in 9 years I've felt great!! (Chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, hashimoto's, candida, etc.) I was using silver colloid (30 ppm) ... but the stuff I make (5 ppm) seems so much more effective— why is this?? My life is just starting over—thank you so much! C.W., California Overcoming Multiple Problems I am a 63 year old who in the spring of 1995 was diagnosed with high cholesterol, hypothyroidism and lymphocyctosis. I suffered from rashes, great depression, fatigue and headaches. A second opinion diagnosed me with C.L.L. [Chronic Lymphatic Leukemia] A third, a well-known Immunologist told me I had Sjogrens Syndrome. Note: 3 different diagnosis!! None of the three doctors offered any solution other than take thyroid pills and just go home and enjoy life. I was a basket case for a long while. Then I got angry and did some research on my own for a cure. (I have little faith in doctors anymore!) Eventually I came across Bob Beck's devices which I use daily and also make and take 4 oz. of colloidal silver (5 ppm) daily for 4 months now, plus about 8 large glasses of Reverse Osmosis water daily. These are the results to date: 1. My depression has vanished, my head is clear. 2. My fatigue has vanished, no more anxiety attacks. 3. My rashes are gone, my brittle fingernails are normalizing. 4. My rapid heart beat is a thing of the past, no infections. 5. My indigestion is gone, my appetite is too good now. 6. No more thyroid pills for months, don't need them. 7. No more headaches for 3 months. And, you may not want to print this, I deposited strange little \"chupa cabras\" through my kidneys and who knows what else in the bathroom. That went on for about 3 months also. I will go for another blood test next year sometime, out of curiosity, but I am in no hurry. Why go when feeling as good as I do. I can document these health problems of the past. For the rest of my life I will stay on colloidal silver, use Bob Beck's devices, eat a decent diet, exercise moderately and thank my Creator for guiding me in your direction. Take care of yourselves too. C.C., Alberta Cleansing I have used magnetic pulsing to relieve headaches – purely experimental – it abates them rather quickly. I don't have any obvious health problems but I've completed two months of the `cleansing' program: 208 hours so far. I had a few headaches and a few lethargic days early on but on the whole I've felt good. I feel the combination of Dr. Schulze's formulations, the blood electrification and the magnetic pulsing, drinking colloidal silver as well as drinking lots of water have enhanced my energy level. P.R., Minnesota Prostate Pain Clears I can't say enough about the unit. I have had prostate pain for about one year but after taking colloidal silver and doing the blood electrification, the pain was totally gone in about two weeks. C.S., Alberta Revised November 2002 age b2 6186"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Overcoming Chronic Fatigue Syndrome I' m writing this because I could not let my experience go silently by without heralding it to the world. So many times we, in our busy lives, simply accept the occasional miracles as they come our way with complacency—as if we are somehow deserving—not taking the time to thank or reflect or question. So here is the story of my miracle for which I am so very grateful. To cure a mysterious and stubborn virus that I contracted while living in the Caribbean, my U.S. doctor put me on strong antibiotics—permanently. (Gee, if you can't cure it just mask the symptoms.) Five years later looking like \"the night of the living dead,\" with my immune system completely destroyed, raging systemic candida, chronic liver and kidney infections, small intestine problems, and a general feeling of constant exhaustion, I felt desperate to find another way. Finally, I found a naturopath in Calgary who gradually began to unravel the damage done by conventional medicine and I did greatly improve over the next year. But the candida and bacteria were still out of control and nothing we tried seemed to give my immune system a fighting chance. Then the naturopath introduced me to the Beck blood electrfication device and silver colloidal. \"Oh bother, what kind of snake oil is this now?\" I thought. But I was willing to try anything, no matter how absurd, to get well. The first few days sent my body careening through terrible detox—like a horrible flu—but I stuck with it because, after all, anything this terrible was either going to kill me or cure me. On day four my husband said, \"Honey is there anything I can do—anything I can get you?\" \"Yes,\" I said, \"how about a loaded gun.\" Then on day five I woke up and felt suddenly better. On day six I felt better still and I have continued to feel increasingly better ever since. After two months the naturopath checked my blood work again and was astonished to find a whopping improvement— the candida and bacteria were reduced by 60%! Yahoo! I'm winning! I still use the blood electrifier religiously for 2-3 hours every day and drink between 2-3 cups of silver colloidal. I continue to improve. My eyes are clear, my hair is glossy, my skin is healthy and people who have not seen me for several months say, \"Hey you look great!\" I feel great! You helped me change hopeless to hopeful. Thanks for my miracle. Cellulitis Infection Let me explain how I acquired my cellulitis infection. The disease infected both lower legs, from my knees to the ankles. Occasionally, the elbow to the wrist begins to itch, just like poison oak. Last summer I purchased a pair of new, very stiff, leather boots. Whenever I wore them, my left boot rubbed on my ankle so much that the lymph would flow like blood. I didn't pay attention to it. The second or third day I placed a Band-Aid over the sore. Much too late. The dye from the threads in my socks had infected the lymph system. I didn't realize this until a month later when my legs turned beet red and swelled up. Any slight irritation to these areas, such as clothing rubbing on it, increases the swollen red areas. On occasion, I just plain lose control and scratch the itching areas, which makes it much worse. I tried many things such as, ozone, antibiotics, pitch (which provided the greatest relief from itching) and hydrogen peroxide. Nothing worked! But the magnetic pulsing tops all itching in the area where it's applied. The magnetic pulsing absolutely killed on contact the virus, bacteria, whatever. The relief is instant. The red itching areas just dried up and healed. My natural skin color came back within a short time. B.D., Oregon Pulsing & Colloidal Silver Clears Lungs & Sinuses Blood electrification has helped me immensely. I pulsed for 6 minutes 3 times at 20 minute intervals for 3 days and drank one-third cup of Colloidal Silver 3 times a day for 3 days before my body started cleaning out. I ran a temperature and my sinuses just poured. My lungs loosened a lot of stuff even though my left lung was plugged before I started. I was sick, just like having the flu, for about ten days coughing up tons of stuff out of my lungs. I even had to get my husband to pound my back in the mornings to loosen it up. My sinuses continued to run continuously. Meanwhile, I continued drinking colloidal silver. The colloidal silver I take every day keeps my Candida under control and I haven't had a cold or the flu since I started taking it. I wouldn't want to do without my Colloidal Silver and I think we need not be afraid of the super bugs as long as we have our Colloidal Silver makers.

It has been so exciting to find a product that works, and that does not have the adverse reactions we received when we used various drugs. My mother gave us a supply to try out, and I am running out, and am going to have to go back for more! I like the feeling of being clean too much. I notice a boost in energy and a positive cheerful mood change after taking as a drink. But the most remarkable change I have noticed is in using the undiluted, regular strength colloidal drops as an eye rinse twice daily. I use an eye dropper and put several drops in morning and evening. The first 2 days, my eyes stung slightly, and in the morning I woke up with a slight discharge in the corners of my eyes. After that my eyes, which were always blood-shot from years of adverse reactions from wearing contact lenses, with harsh chemicals, and having eye infections, which prescriptions didn't solve, suddenly were snowy white! I didn't think that a 46 year old lady could have snowy white eyes after the problems I had. They are like a healthy young child's! I decided to store my lenses in colloidal silver!! I use 1/2 of the soaking solution, and 1/2 distilled water. To that I add 3 drops of colloidal silver and SHAKE. To my amazement—the solution is so gentle—I have no sore eyes anymore! And one other added blessing. There was a pair of lenses that I could not wear. They had apparently become infected with bacteria. I was going to throw them out. After soaking in my special preparation, they are back to normal. I have saved a pair of lenses that were only 4 months old! Thanks to colloidal silver! One added addendum! My recessed gums are back to normal, since rinsing with colloidal silver! They are no longer red, but a paler healthy pink. I couldn't recognize them. I not only rinse, gargle, add drops with a dropper—but there is no more mouth wash for me! Yes, you guessed it. I use the colloidal silver. I am having so much fun, feeling so clean, and at a fraction of the cost!! G W, British Columbia Colloidal Silver Eases Foot Problem For about 15 years the space between my little toes would crack, bleed and would not heal. A few months ago I sprayed silver colloid on each little toe crack and zapped for about 1 hour a day for 5 days. Beginning immediately the terrible itching stopped and within a few days the open crack healed shut and my little toes were happy once again. As a precaution I spray between my toes every week or so and they are ever so much warmer and easier to walk on. A side benefit is my tootsies smell better than ever. L.T, Alberta Athletes Foot and Ear Infection Cleared With blood electrification I found instant relief from athletes foot. When it returned a month later colloidal silver cleared it up again almost as fast. A few weeks ago I came down with an inner ear infection...I did not want to go to the doctor for an antibiotic because it takes me literally a month to feel right again after using one. So I tried the colloidal silver. It seemed to be working at doses of 4 ounces every couple of hours. The pressure in my ears was noticeably better within 8 hours and the dizziness was gone in 24. But the low grade fever that comes with an inner ear infection wouldn't go away. Then an accident happened that I think was quite fortunate. I both forgot to add salt solution to the water for a fresh batch of silver, and the phone rang so I walked away with the generator turned on. About 30 minutes later I came back to find a batch of the golden style silver. I took 1 ounce dose of this every couple of hours for the rest of the day. Within 2 hours the fever was gone! By the time I'd taken 4 ounces there was NO PRESSURE AT ALL in my ears! With the colloidal silver I went from first symptom to total cure within 48 hours! Ask a doctor and you'll be told that if you really have an inner ear infection that you can expect 4 to 6 days to notice i mprovement on standard antibiotics. P.S. Recently my neighbor got desperate enough to try some on his ulcers. This guy used to carry the economy size Rolaids in his shirt pocket. He has been totally symptom free for nearly a month now. He only took a teaspoon per day for a week and then stopped to get that result. T.S. New York Skin Color Restored I want to share my silver colloid experiences: My yellowish tinge skin coloration I've had since 1975 disappeared—restoring my skin to a normal flesh tone. It happened after I drank a whole glass of silver colloid for a few consecutive days. S.C., Louisiana Flu and Athlete's Foot Clear While visiting Australia I started getting the tell tale tickle in the back of my throat. When I arrived back in the US, I had the full blown flu. Consistent coughing, sneezing, fever, watery eyes, you name it. And I just couldn't shake it. Tried doctors, my homemade cayenne pepper recipe, everything, and nothing worked. Then [my friend] Jon stepped in to the rescue. He told me about colloidal silver. He brought in about a half gallon [which I drank] every day for about a week and presto!! The flu disappeared along with a recurring case of athlete's foot that I have had for about 10 years. Another effect was that my mustache grew about a 1/4 of an inch OVERNIGHT!! Woke up the next morning and had to trim it before I could eat breakfast, it was the weirdest thing ... Needless to say I now have my own unit to make colloidal silver and have never felt better ... D.C., California Revised November 2002 Page 54 of 86"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Overcoming Lymes Disease One morning while doing sit ups, I felt pain on the back of my thigh. I pulled off a blood—gorged tic that had expanded about 10 times its original size. An excruciating painful bullseye developed after 4 days—the classic Lymes Disease initial symptom. I have detoxified and exercised for 20 years so I was confident my immune system would stop any invader. I began using natural antibiotics and anti- oxidants. The supplements did not stop the intensity of pain and growth of the bullseye. The library was the next stop. I learned that antibiotics can only stop the Spirochete Bacteria when it's in the blood stream. The bacteria, however, can return to the bloodstream, proliferate and the disease is back. Once in the tissue cells, antibiotics are ineffective. I knew it was too late for antibiotics at this point anyway. My energy was gone. That night I couldn't sit down because of the pain of the bullseye. It was 7\" in diameter. Fasting would surely stop the challenge I faced. Seven days of no solid food whatsoever and only green drinks. I tried food grade hydrogen peroxide baths. Three weeks after discovering the bite, my knees, hip and back had developed arthritis to the point where getting out of bed and dressed took 15 minutes. Everyday the bacteria was in different places: hands, shoulder blades, wrists and elbows, spine and ankles—they went everywhere. I'm 42 and was in good shape. My 90—year old friend walking with a cane was waiting for me to keep up with him. Every movement was painful. My hands and fingers could only move in segment motion. I ate only sprouted greens and sprouted grains—no fruit or carrots so as not to provide sugar to feed bacteria. I prayed God to take away all the good things I have and just give me back my health. Ozone is also known for stopping pathogens. I tried IV injections of ozone for one week. It didn't touch the symptoms. I thought I was a gonner. Finally I called the Hippocrates Institute in Florida. They faxed me back within two hours: \"Dear David, Be sure you will be healed as many others have with this information.\" Those were powerful words because they are world—renowned for helping those who are diagnosed as terminally ill. They advised me to get a device that makes silver. The day it came I began making my own Colloidal Silver. I started taking it that night—a tablespoon every 20 minutes holding it under the tongue for one minute. I went to sleep. When I woke up, I jumped out of bed and ran out the door shouting to the neighbors that I was healed. It was a dream. When I did wake up, I could hardly move and it took me five minutes to convince myself to go through the pain of sitting up. That dream was a vision of the future. One morning in January, I woke up and played out that dream in real life. It took three days for the silver to begin working. The fifth day I got 70% healing. When I got total mobility of my hips and spine, I knew the Lymes was biting the dust. Everyday there was less pain and more mobility. The last areas of pain were the hands and feet. It took about 11/2 to 2 months for total healing. Today is June 5, 1997. I have been Lymes free for 4 months now, no recurring symptoms. People that have it tell me you'll never get rid of it. I tell them about silver. D. T, New Jersey Eyes Clear with Colloidal Silver I am currently visiting my Granny. She has a colloidal silver machine. I have always had trouble with itchy red eyes that would swell periodically. The doctor would give me antibiotic drops for them which didn't seem to heal them much faster than if I'd just left them alone. When I first arrived at Granny's one week ago I woke up with infected, swollen eyes. The infection was so bad that it spread to the left side of my nose which was swollen and hurt to touch. When I looked in the mirror I was so horrified that I cried, which just worsened the condition. I looked hideous I was embarrassed. I felt depressed. It was my friend's birthday party in two days. I was desperate because I knew from past experience that it would take a week or two to heal! So I decided to try my Granny's colloidal silver. I sipped the liquid slowly. After drinking 8 ounces I got a warm, almost tingly feeling in my mouth, throat, and stomach. Immediately I got an energy lift and my mood changed for the better. I turned from depressed to hopeful. I then soaked a large cotton ball in it and taped it to the worst part of the infection the side of the nose and eye. I put 3 drops in each eye every 40 minutes and made sure the cotton ball stayed wet. After one hour I noticed my eyes were already less swollen. After two hours my eyes appeared normal which shocked me. I peeled the bandage back and to my surprise the swelling was gone. I looked normal. What only two hours before seemed like a disaster was now turned around thanks to colloidal silver. I went to the party with bells on! I've been drinking it every day now for 1 week and each time I drink it, it lifts my mood and gives me energy. I go from tired or even grumpy to energetic and pleasant! VW, British Columbia How to Make Larger Amounts of Colloidal Silver ... Used for Cats Too My Mom and I have a great way of making large quantities of colloidal silver without having to manually stir. We use magnetic stirrers and they work super for slowly stirring the mixture while the colloids are forming. We make large quantities because we use it in our animals' water. I have 28 cats, all strays, with varying health issues. The colloidal silver in their water everyday has made a huge difference in their health. ... Plus we use it ourselves so we make at least a gallon a week or more. D.G., California Revised November 2004 Page 55 of 86"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Helped Alleviate Chronic Fatigue Syndrome I began the Beck protocol seeking relief from chronic fatigue syndrome brought on by mercury and other metal poisoning and a lifetime of serious allergies. I took a series of chelation treatments to rid myself of the metal poisoning but two years later I still had a major problem with infections and a stubborn case of herpes zoster (shingles). After an initial 22 days using the blood electrifier and magnetic pulse generator, I felt better than I had in years. Two weeks later, however, my energy level took a dive. I had to take a break from treatments so that I could adjust the dosage of my allergy treatments in order to use both devices. That problem solved, I resumed use of the electrifier and magnetic pulse generator for another month but still had symptoms of the shingles I'd been carrying, I think, since my teens. Then I decided to use the blood electrifier for longer sessions — from 6 to 14 hours a day, five days a week. I continued this routine for about 3 months and noticed positive changes in my symptoms. I took a break again, but in four weeks I felt tired and symptoms worsened a bit. That was December, and I treated myself with both devices two or three days a week to keep my energy level up for the holidays. In January and February I resumed 5 day a week treatments and felt better than ever, but my immune system still wasn't ready to fly on its own. At that point, I tried a program known as Neuro Link 2000, an interesting mix of neurolinguistic programming and applied kinesiology. My allergies are now gone, my other symptoms are much improved and my energy level has stabilized. I am very grateful to Bob Beck for developing the blood electrifier and magnetic pulse generator because they helped me a great deal and I have recommended their use to others. B.A., California Hepatitis B Over the last 25 years I have fasted up to 15 days in a row, done numerous herbal cleansings, and ate vegetarian for awhile. I would get migraine headaches and then 15 years ago I caught Hepatitis B while traveling. My doctor said it was something I couldn't get rid of. I had to take drugs for migraines then cleanse to get rid of the drugs. I had to be careful because of my liver — it was a fine line between cleansing and poisoning. I went to a health practitioner who uses muscle testing to know what to take and how much to take. The blood electrification and the magnetic pulsing with colloidal silver and ozonized water are by far the best thing I have tried. I feel I'm rid of the Hepatitis B. Now if I feel a cold coming on I use the units and the symptoms stop within two days. If I get a headachy feeling, I use the magnetic pulse generator right away all over my head to clear the feeling. MM, California Bronchial Asthma I purchased the blood electrifier to help my bronchial asthmatic cough. It has helped to reduce my frequent and daily cough by approximately 25% as coughing spells are less frequent and shorter most of the times. The blood electrifier has done many things for my health including the following: reduces my sugar cravings; my skin heals faster and is no longer blotchy; my headaches are not as strong and heal faster than taking a Tylenol; my eyesight is better; and my bowel movements are easier and usually 2-3 times per day. I used the machine for 2-hours everyday for four months and drank 8 ozs. of colloidal silver. After four months I used the blood electrification four times a week, but continue to drink 8 ounces of colloidal silver on a daily basis. I have been using the blood electrification for six months, and I will continue to do so. I would recommend this device to anyone who wants to i mprove their health without a quick fix. IS., Alberta Bent Fingers & Magnetic Pulse Generator A surgeon advised me an operation is the only cure for Dupuytren's contracture — bending of the ring and little fingers that is considered hereditary in men. I've been using the magnetic pulse generator on my left hand and the surgeon now says I don't have to have surgery. I am very happy. This is a real sharing from the heart. MS., Saskatchewan Live—Blood Cell Analysis I'm 75 year old and I developed a heart condition about 4 years ago. I have a friend, a retired pharmacist, who does live blood cell analysis so for the past two years I have had my blood checked with a dark—field microscope. At first, my blood indicated a number of problems with parasites in advanced stages. I started using herbs, enzymes and other natural products and my blood showed I was making progress. I also took chelation treatments. I then started using the blood electrifier and also making colloidal silver. After one week, my blood plasma was completely clear, no signs of any parasites. I had more energy. Then I used the magnetic pulse generator to clear out various organs. In my opinion electrification is definitely the way to go. I'll see how long my blood stays clear to know when I need to use the units again. A.S., Florida Pain Relief I am having amazing success with my magnetic pulse generator in relieving pain in arthritic joints and herniated discs. Dr. IP, Ecuador Revised November 2002 age 56 of 86"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Back From the Dead Skin biopsies and blood tests from two separate labs confirmed I had cancer. On my arms and legs were skin cancer lesions. Through my veins flowed other malignant cells – less visible but more deadly. A researcher at the cancer clinic at UCLA told me flatly that without treatment I had six months to a year of wasting away before I died. His words fell like hammer blows. A younger researcher advised against the experimental chemotherapy describing the painful side effects. \"Your only hope is alternative therapy,\" he said. Cigarettes, liquor, cholesterol, a sedentary life – I had done everything wrong but drug abuse. Who could I blame? My first inclination was to give up as I knew nothing about `alternative therapies.' With the help of my friend, Peter, I waded through many 'sure–fire' cures and narrowed my choice to the research of Robert C. Beck, D.Sc. Beck's documentation was impressive and cited real medical references and patents as well as case histories. I had just read the media reports about a new electrical device that neutralizes snake venom and I like gadgets, so I decided on the Beck units. I followed the Beck protocol: drank freshly–made colloidal silver and used the blood electrifier and the magnetic pulse generator faithfully. The results were immediate. Diarrhea, sinusitis, bleeding, aching joints – fluids oozed from every orifice. All of which the Beck papers predicted – apparently due to the flushing of toxins. In my case from almost fifty years of hard living. After five days, the deep profound pain in my arms and legs just stopped. After living in pain for so many months, I was able to stop taking morphine. The skin lesions were drying up as well so I discontinued all medication except vitamin/ mineral supplements. On the tenth day I returned to my home in Mexico. My energy level had doubled and my appetite came back. It had been so long since I'd felt hunger that I mistook the feeling for stomach pains. I stopped losing weight. Once home I completed the recommended three weeks in August 1997. I have been symptom free since then and I'm gaining back my weight. To confirm the results, a blood test came back negative – no sign of cancer. So what really happened? I am still the skeptical scientist. I feel compelled to consider the other variables: Months before the treatment, I had begun simplifying my life. Instead of working 12 hour days I shut down my business. I moved from a confined apartment above my shop to a spacious, bright, airy place with a spectacular view. I now see clearly that stress and overwork alone can kill. Following the Beck protocol, I was spending time every day doing something to take care of myself. In addition to using the units, I was drinking lots of water, taking short walks and I cut down on the smoking and drinking. I became aware of how light, air and food affected me. Another important factor – friends. Love and support came in the form of chicken soup, picking things up for me, giving me rides, and encouragement. All of the above elements were important but I believe the combination therapy I used has definite therapeutic value. Since I completed the treatment, I have used the Beck units on three other people with different problems—skin cancer, Herpes simplex, Herpes Zoster, and a chronic urinary tract infection. All have had major improvements or complete remission. William Dowling, Mexico Genital Herpes Hello! I had Genital Herpes – please notice I use the word `had', as I am now symptom-free! I started on the Beck Protocol in January of 1997. For a three week period I used the blood electrifier behind my knees for 45-minutes a day; and I drank 2-cups of colloidal silver water daily. I also used the magnetic pulse generator every day for 15-minutes per day. I had one herpes outbreak during this time. Then I used the units again in July 1997. I went on them for the 21-Day Protocol for one hour per day, including the magnetic pulse generator, which I used on a swollen lymph node on the right side of my pelvis area. I 'zapped' it for 10-20 minutes a day with the magnetic pulse generator, plus 15-minutes all over the body. Since that time I have had NO SYMPTOMS. It took me two times on the 21-Day Beck Protocol for it to work, but it did! I have an active lifestyle and am athletic. I am 47-years old, but my girlfriend says I have the body of an 18- year old. Sometimes I overdo it. Stress or sunburn from my outdoor activity usually complicates my condition but I still haven't had a Herpes outbreak. I never feel the tingling in the lymph in the pelvis area anymore. Hard to believe I no longer have swollen lymph. I plan continuing a healthy lifestyle and remaining symptom-free! D.C., Washington Diabetes & Colloidal Silver Just a note to let you know the blood electrification has had a great beneficial influence on my wife's diabetes. I can't get her to pulse but she'll take the colloidal silver. She has been using the colloidal silver for a couple of years. Prior to its use she was in the hospital a number of times a year for infections in her feet. She lost her big toe in the process. Since using the colloidal silver she has not been in once for that problem. She did have a deep infection, which wouldn't heal prior to the colloidal silver. Once she started the silver water the nurse was amazed that it didn't get worse and at present it is almost completely healed. I also love the blood electrification and use it about twice a year. B.S., Florida Revised November 2004 Page 57 of 86"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Colds Cleared I have been using the blood electrifier for about 1 '/2 years. It has had the most positive effect on my health of any alternative therapy I have ever tried. In my early childhood double pneumonia and other childhood diseases put me in the hospital seven times by the time I was two years of age. I had constant colds, sore throats, chest ailments and allergies. This continued right up to my adult years. Since using the blood electrifier and taking silver water daily, I have been free of colds and associated respiratory complications for a year and a half. There have been occasions when I feel the early symptoms of something trying to develop but nothing does. I use the blood electrifier two hours daily for one month periods and then one month off. I take 1 ounce of silver water twice daily. I have recently purchased the magnetic pulse generator for deeper lymph cleaning. I had a blood analysis done about a year ago using the dark field microscopy method and it showed my blood to be quite clean and free from active virus and fungi. I attribute this to using the blood electrifier. I conclude that these theoretical health treatments for blood and lymph cleaning have been responsible for restoring my immune system so that it can properly function. A recent hair analysis showed that I was deficient in four minerals necessary for proper health and metabolic function. I will continue to take vitamin and mineral supplements. Thanks to the folks that make these units for their research and developments in new alternative health areas. NO., Saskatchewan Prostate Cancer I've had prostate cancer for 9-years. Gleason's strain of cancer is the 'bad' one. My doctor used to talk to me about how it will be before I die. Then I went on Robert Beck's total program for 2 weeks and discovered that the magnetic pulsing keeps my pain away. I went off pain medication. I'm seeing an Oncologist but am refusing treatment. I use the blood electrifier for 2 1/2 hours per day and the magnetic pulse Generator 15 minutes twice a day. I take no medication except herbs. I came off the hard medicine that would have killed me if I'd stayed on it. When I went for a PSA test (prostate cancer test marker) it went up 400 points, reading 1086 (4 is normal). My high PSA scares people to death. However, my cancer Doctor was pleased at how good I look. I believe I can keep myself going with what I'm doing. I use the magnetic pulse generator on the bad spots. I went easy on the blood electrifier for the first few weeks because I got nauseated from the other medicine. Now I'm working in my garden a little and I feel real good. I use a pendulum to check my body, if it will accept the electrical field, I take the herbs just before I go to sleep. I take herbs such as clover blossoms to get rid of toxins and oxygen (35 drops once a day). If I let up it gets back at me. I don't want chemotherapy but have had radiation and found that it can be worked out of your body. It shoots your white count in half. My count went wild after being on the units. But what's i mportant to me right know is that I feel better and can work in my garden. A.M,Utah Disappointing PCR Results It is with some regret and disappointment that I have to let you know after a two month intensive treatment towards HIV with the magnetic pulsing and blood electrification plus the use of colloidal silver (5 ppm and up) I have gained no benefits whatsoever. On the contrary, we've noticed a major drop in CD-4 cells (which was to be expected) but worst of all the viral load from 308,000 increased to over 380,000 with increased symptoms. Due to the nature of viruses and electromagnetic treatment I would expect this treatment to be either working for everyone or no one. I would appreciate an unbiased reply. Pete Hay Fever & Congestion I was doing remodeling work in an old motel in town. I felt my head getting stuffy — the start of a real bad sinus attack. I already drink 8 ounces of colloidal silver morning and night. A lot of other workers were getting sick. I think it was from the old structure but it could have been from a regular flu bug going around. I didn't get the flu but I did come down with nasal problems like Hay Fever. I decided to wire up my blood electrifier as it had been a couple of weeks since I used it. I drank five glasses of colloidal silver a day for three days and wore the electrifier for 4-hours per day for three days and the problem disappeared. I am back to normal! I still drink colloidal silver morning and night and have not been sick since I started a year ago. Thanks for the best all—round—unit in the world. J.J., Idaho Relief from Chronic Fatigue I have had chronic fatigue syndrome of a viral origin for 16 years. Last year I used Bob Beck's electronics diagram to build my own blood cleanser and I also built my own magnetic pulse (my background is electronics). I used them both for 2 months for a total of 90 hours on the blood cleanser. Even though it was somewhat difficult with all the cleansing reactions I'm glad I did it because now I feel like the virus has been completely eliminated because I don't have the ongoing flu-like symptoms anymore. I highly recommend the use of this product for any problem of viral and/or bacterial origin. ME, North Carolina Revised November 2002 Page 58 of 86"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Conquering Cancer Thirteen years ago I was diagnosed with breast cancer and I had a mastectomy on one breast. Eight months ago I knew the cancer was back. Tests confirmed I had 3 rd to 4 th stage cancer in my bones—skull, one hip, and several ribs. My leg was so bad I had to use a cane and couldn't walk without the aid of a cane. I refused chemotherapy and tamoxifin. Seven months ago, my doctor told me about blood electrification and magnetic lymph pulsing, so I ordered them. I started with only 5 minutes a day with both the blood electrification and magnetic pulsing. I gradually increased the ti me until I was able to use them to 2 hours a day. I use the magnetic pulse generator for 20 minutes a day. I drink one cup of colloidal silver daily, and 1/3 cup of ozonated water daily. After four weeks my sister invited me to go to a polka party with her. She insisted I enter a dance contest with her and we won first prize in the polka competition! I am 66 years old and today I often go for walks—up to 40 minutes—or I at least walk on my treadmill for 25 minutes. I am also taking vitamin and mineral supplements and flax oil daily. When the nurse at my doctor's office checked my blood using a darkfield microscope, she was so amazed at the improvement in my blood she interrupted the doctor while he was with another patient to tell him. A recent bone scan shows the cancer is still present. I'm optimistic as my doctor suggests the bones will be the last stage to clear. I'll keep in touch to let you know my progress. Ilinois A note from Jo's health coach, Sue As someone who has been coaching Jo since November of 1997, the first thing I noticed is that Jo has a fabulous attitude and definitely wants to live. Not only has Jo been using the Beck machines but also she was willing to give up her coffee, red meats and most of all her Polish pastries. Anyone who lives in Chicago with a bakery practically on every other corner, knows how hard it is to give up the sweet taste of Polish pastries. She now eats whole grain breads and homemade carrot breads with extra fiber. My doctor asked me to show Jo how to use the Beck units. He showed me her darkfield blood samples and also her bone scans. It didn't look like Jo had too much of a chance but I agreed to give it a try and work with her. When I first met her, Jo cried a lot. Now she's a regular comedian. I notice with Jo and others I work with that one of the first things that changes are their personalities. I guess when you feel that there is hope, you begin to find laughter in life again. Jo also has the support of her family, which makes a big difference in how a person is able to cope with cancer and whether or not they will survive. Jo also had a large ganglion on her left foot and started using the magnetic pulse generator on it. She no longer has it! Her blood sample under the darkfield microscope shows completely normal blood cells, a total turn-a-round from the first samples taken six months ago. Keeping a positive outlook about her future, learning to laugh again, and her willingness to change (exercise & diet) truly represents what my friend Jo is all about. Jo really works hard at getting better and she will be a survivor. Eczema Eliminated Many thanks to the blood electrifier and your friendly group. I am 55 years old and have had eczema as far back as I remember—even as a teenager. I have had a patch on my back the size of two Canadian `toonies'. [About 3\" in diameter] It would flare up, weep and grow as my belt rubbed against it. Over the years I have tried all sorts of ointments, herbs, salves, soaps, etc. Then I started on the blood electrifier. I started very gradually for one month. I also started taking a glass a day of silver colloid and I put some on the patch externally. I was shocked when my back no longer itched within one month! Mono Gone too It has been 10 months now and not even a trace can be found. I haven't been sick, nor have I had the flu or a cold. A friend's 9-year-old daughter was diagnosed with mononucleosis. I gave her a couple of quarts of colloidal silver and voila! No symptoms after three days of gargling and drinking the colloidal water. T.E., British Columbia Another Pulse Point Here is my suggestion for another pulse point. I can't find the ulnar artery so I use the pulse point on the back of my hand between the thumb and forefinger. I went to a practitioner for ozone infusion treatments to cure leg cramps. After several sessions plus vitamins, I said: \"We aren't getting anywhere so I propose we combine the ozone with blood electrification. My daily clean–outs shortly became quite explosive which indicates to me electrification was happening.\" N.B., United Kingdom ANIMALS HELPED TOO Horses Cleared of Fungus During the winter, my 5 horses all started losing patches of their hair. The vet diagnosed the problem as a fungus so I decided to try colloidal silver rather than medication. I mixed one cup of colloidal silver with their grain each day. In two weeks all the patches had cleared up and they're coats looked healthy again! L.E, British Columbia Revised November 2004 Page 59 of 86"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Symptoms of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome & Epstein Barr Disappearing Before I go into my testimonial, I just want to tell you that you are all really unusual people. It's unusual to find people that care about their product's performance, especially when it comes to a product that is health-related. I hope you all have the best of success and the best of health. The beginning of this past December I got sick and got progressively worse and worse, and only now almost at the end of May am I feeling better. My symptoms included constant low-grade fever, constant swollen glands in my neck, bronchial type cough, horrendous pounding headaches, virtual inability to sleep. I tried every remedy that was recommended to me and nothing worked. I had horrible nightmares, of which I had no history. The really strange thing is that sometimes I felt incredibly 'wired'. I had so much energy. But after December 1997, I literally could not move at times. Only with difficulty could I raise my arm parallel to the floor, over my head would have been impossible. I didn't have the strength to wash a single dish in the sink. I had irregular heart palpitations and anxiety attacks that would come at any time having nothing to do with stress. I had herpes cold sores on my lips. My whole body was incredibly weak and I could barely walk at times. I would get a pinched nerve feeling at the top of my thighs where they connect to my torso and pains on the bottoms of my feet so that I wasn't able to stand. I would get excruciating pains in my shoulder blades and lower back, arms and thighs. I got my period every 3 weeks. I could barely remember anything—everything was a blur. I had rashes. My tongue had a heavy white film over it. At times it was impossible to eat. I was extremely sensitive to noise to the point where it hurt my ears to listen to the radio or talk on the phone. I had a constant, disgusting feeling all the time that is difficult to explain. It felt like I was covered from head to toe with ants that were crawling all over me and eating away at my body. Now that I know these symptoms relate to Chronic Fatigue and Epstein Barr, I know that I've had this for much longer than half a year. As I said, I already had sleeping problems. Other various symptoms were constantly coming and going for over 2 years. I just never had them all at the same time. When I started using the Bob Beck Protocol—a minimum 4 weeks on the blood electrifier (approx. 2-hours per day) & colloidal silver water (approx. 4 oz. per day), the magnetic pulse generator (approx. 30-minutes per day), and ozonated water (approx. 8 oz.)—I had immediate improvement for about 3 weeks, then I went backwards, meaning that my symptoms had lessened and then came back much stronger. It would be bad for about 2 weeks, and then there was improvement again. This has been my pattern of healing. I'm feeling much more energetic. I haven't missed one day since I started using the protocol. At times when I was really sick I drank up to 4 cups of colloidal silver (CS) a day. Now I drink between 1 and 2. Whatever my body was telling me I needed, that was how I gauged how much CS-water to drink. So I'd say that the protocol has been the best medicine I've ever taken. I'm still using it, and plan to continue using it until I'm 100% better. I have also completely changed my diet. I eat no sugar, no white flour, no white rice, no tap water, and no dairy products. I do eat ONLY organic vegetables, fruits, and grains. I juice a lot, mainly carrot juice, orange juice, grape juice and papaya juice. In the carrot juice I usually include either beets or celery. I take 5 super blue green algae tablets a day. I just started with Pycnogenol. I grow and drink my own wheat grass juice, I drink it about 4 or 5 days a week. I drink the acidophilus from it. I sprout wheat along with other beans. I eat a lot of salmon. I've started walking at least 20 minutes a day. I feel really good afterwards. I pray to God a lot. I try to be thankful for the small things in life and accept this as something that I have to go through while doing everything that I can to overcome it. I' m really grateful that I'm lucky enough to have found something that has really helped me heal. A.S., Israel Progress Notes from Jean Colloidal Silver: The black fungus that grew on the rock wall by the bathtub just disappeared after being sprayed with silver colloid. We bathe and wash dishes from water in our cistern—haven't yet figured out how to reduce the bacteria and what not—so skin problems were a part of life. Now we spray ourselves with colloidal silver. Skin problems have disappeared and our athlete's foot and dandruff cleared up too. Blood Electrifier and Magnetic Pulse Generator: Today, after only 21/2 days of being back on these units I'm already getting back on my feet. Truly amazing. Both units also make my eyes and mind clear. I love this. The magnetic pulse generator stops stomach trouble dead! My sinuses and sore throat cleared like a miracle! If this is psychosomatic—I don't care! My fingers and hands have been numb and asleep since 1983—not so after electrification! Yee ha! I may get normal yet! J.F. Arizona Sharing Health From the Heart Inc. www.sharinghealth.com Revised November 2002 Page 60 of 86"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Cleansing with Ozonated Water First, a note about using a water ozonator. I am a retired electrical engineer, age 67, with good health. Three years ago I moved from Ontario to a remote rural Manitoba area where the air and water are clean and unpolluted. I built a solar passive heated home set into the hillside. I use wood in an old fashion kitchen wood stove as backup heat. My goal is to be reasonably independent of energy, heat, water, food and health systems. I make 10 oz. of ozonated water using distilled water that I drink each day, usually about 11 am. The first seven days I found I made three trips to the bathroom for a bowel movement compared to the usual one trip. My urine was also darker color and a strong odor such as would happen if I ate a lot of candy or sweets. On the eighth day my bones ached and I felt feverish as though I was getting the flu. I took 1/2 teaspoon of colloidal silver six times a day and slept sound all night. On the ninth day my bladder was sore as though I had a bladder infection. I continued on the colloidal silver six times per day and also drank two liters of pure homemade cranberry juice. On the tenth day, the bladder pain was gone but my lower intestine area was sore. At no time did I experience diarrhea or vomiting. I decided to stop the test for two weeks as I was having company. I will restart the experiment tomorrow. Shingles & Bone Healing In January of 1997, my 97—year old mother contacted shingles (Herpes Zoster). The shingles went to the left side of her face and into her blind left eye. It was painful and caused her much stress. The medical doctor told us there was no cure for shingles and he could only prescribe a powerful narcotic painkiller. The doctor said my mother 'might' get over it in two months or it may take two years. So I contacted a friend in Ontario who was working with herbs and alternative healing methods. She had helped a friend who had shingles by using colloidal silver and Reflexology and in seven days the shingles were cleared up and have not returned. The second incident also involved my elderly mother who tripped and fell in the night last February and broke her hip. She was taken to the local hospital by ambulance and after x— rays the doctor was preparing to ship her to Winnipeg for a pin—in—the—hip operation. Winnipeg is a four-hour ambulance trip. When I got to the hospital I cancelled the trip and the operation as I believed she would NOT have survived an operation of this magnitude. I was advised that she would have to be flat on her back in bed for at least a year! Then the bone would heal enough to get up and put pressure on it. My research had shown that colloidal silver was used to speed up the healing of broken bones. I went to the hospital every day and discreetly gave her CS twice per day. In 12 weeks she was able to walk alone with the aid of her walker (which she used before the accident). She continues to take colloidal silver every day and is in very good health and does not get colds or the flu as do other residents in the nursing home where she lives.A second case of shingles that was healed with the use of colloidal silver involved a friend of a friend in Ontario who had suffered for 2 months with shingles. I sent 8 ounces of colloidal silver and in short order the herpes virus was out of commission and my friend advises that his friend is extremely happy and feels she has a new lease on life. I have recently sent 8 oz. of colloidal silver to Ottawa to the sister of a good friend who has just recently contacted shingles while in the hospital. In conjunction with Noni Juice and colloidal silver the shingles have cleared up. K.D., Manitoba infection—free ... still and my dog is too! Here is a follow-up from my last testimonial over one year ago. I am now 63 years old, going strong and thanking the Lord every sunrise I am allowed to see. Ever since using the Blood electrification, mainly for making colloidal silver now, I have not been ill with any kind of infection. It's so incredible as I always used to get colds and the flu. I take 3-ounces of colloidal silver daily. My spirit and energy levels are high. My dog had some intestinal problems so I gave him some colloidal silver. He's now as frisky as ever. My dog doesn't know what a placebo effect is either! C. C., Alberta Planter Warts Cleared I showed 4 large, fast-growing planter's warts, which freezing from the doctor didn't kill, to members of my squash club, my friends and family to prove the before and after results. I didn't follow the suggested procedure of 2 hours a day for one month but I got amazing results anyway. I used the blood electrifier daily for from 1 1/2 to 4 hours for 4 days. Then I took a break for one week. I used it in a casual manner for about one month until one night before I went to bed I picked at the warts and piece by piece, without any pain, they fell out. I am a believer. ... (I did not use colloidal silver.) N.H., Alberta Warts Gone Plus ... After using the blood electrifier and drinking colloidal silver for one month, I've noticed the following: 1) Reduction in old skin scars. 2) Resolution of warts on the surface first with building of good tissue beneath. 3) Healing of athlete's foot virtually overnite. 4) Very decreased recovery time after heavy weight lifting. 5) Decreased sugar craving with need for less food in general.

I have been using the magnetic pulse generator for about one year and I found it to relieve pain everywhere. I had the lung surgery and radiation and so far so good. All my friends I met at the clinic have died. Its 21/2 years for me. Between prayers and my machines and all the water I drink I truly believe it is why I am still alive. There is a lot of things I cannot do but I can still watch TV, eat, do the laundry, cook and do dishes, change the cat's box, and shop; play pinochle or board games and even baby sit. I love life and nothing is better! I owe a lot to these machines. If its all in my mind I hope this is as crazy as I get. Ilinois Fibromyalgia & Asthma I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia about 2 years ago. Even though it seems some doctors deny the existence of it, I certainly had something wrong. I was in pain most of the time. I couldn't sleep I was extremely tired. I wasn't getting much relief from traditional doctors who told me I needed to learn pain management instead of using painkillers. I also tried alternative medicine. I found little help and was resolved to having this the rest of my life. A friend gave me Robert Beck's video. Beck talked about colloidal silver, blood electrification, and magnetic lymph pulsing. After a week on the blood electrifier, I started feeling better. I stopped taking medication to help me sleep and I was pain free. After a week I started experiencing some pain and symptoms again. After 3 weeks I felt great! I decided to try using the blood electrification for an eight-hour period. That was a year ago, I have had no symptoms of that type since. I have asthma and allergy problems that are ongoing. The magnetic pulse generator helps with that also. When my air passages are inflamed and constricted I use it to get relief. I just place it on my chest and in about ten minutes I feel better. S. Y, Arizona Traveling With a Silver Maker Treated an earache by spraying colloidal silver (CS)in my ear and under my tongue. Burned my hand while boiling eggs—blisters and pain disappeared with CS. CS relieved itchy eyes and more blisters. Sprayed CS on friend Emma's eczema and foot blisters. She was so impressed she sprayed it on her boyfriend's infected belly button ring. Friend Sandy's infected earring cleared with CS. Friend Tracey cleared dry patches on her face with ... that's right, CS! Ran out of bottled water, so purified tap water with CS. If you ask me, colloidal silver is a true everything tonic and one thing you don't want to leave home without! T. Y., N.ew Jersey Candida in Check In 1977, I was diagnosed with an overactive thyroid. With radioactive iodine, I had persistent nausea and hair loss. I was sick year round. I developed severe allergic reactions to almost all fragrances—even vapors from cough drops and candies! These fumes triggered choking, headaches and tingling pain in my nervous system. It was hard to breathe anywhere! Specialists shrugged: \"Multiple chemical sensitivity is psychosomatic.\" After another year of suffering, an acupuncturist took my pulse and looked at my eyes: \"You have candida!\" \"Candida albicans develops roots which penetrate the intestinal walls,\" I read in a medical text, \"allowing toxins to flow freely into the bloodstream. Candida impairs brain function.\" That was it! After taking a few caprylic acid pills, a 'brain fog' which I was unaware of, disappeared. Sight and sounds suddenly became more vivid. I purchased a magnetic pulse generator and pulsed the whole intestinal area. There was a warm sensation across my belly. Within a few hours, I felt even better than before. Next I pulsed my lungs. Later that night, I could breathe better. The tension in my respiratory system was gone! Since candida can travel through the bloodstream to infect other parts of the body, I started blood pulsing a few weeks later. Twenty minutes for three days and slowly building up to 2 hour sessions. I experienced an even greater sense of well-being and energy. People I saw daily said I looked more alert. However, a month later, I was surprised to find the candida slowly growing back. I now alternate with 3 weeks of pulsing to keep the candida in check and 3 weeks taking vitamin and nutritional supplements. So, with a heavy burden of parasites lifted, I now have my energy and health restored after a 20 year nightmare! R.L., British Columbia Child's Fever The silver generator has saved me enough in doctors' visits and antibiotics to pay for it many times over. My 11- year-old daughter is prone to earaches and sore throats. I was called to pick her up at school as she had a temperature of 100° with a sore throat. The nurse said there was a lot of strep throat going around. When I picked her up at 10:30 a.m. she looked pale. While in the car, I had her gargle and swallow freshly made colloidal silver four times as I had an errand to run on the way home. When we arrived home about noon, her temperature was down to 98.6° and her throat was only scratchy. We continued to give her colloidal silver three times a day for the next five days. She has had no recurrence of the symptoms. I've used colloidal silver for a lot of stuff and it works! I don't need National Health Care; I need knowledge. Thank you for helping us to care for our families and ourselves.

She said, \"Well I cannot talk to anyone, I have a contractual arrangement with the NET.\" (Neuro Electric Therapy Group) At that time they were near the John Wayne Airport. \"But under the circumstances we can call a meeting.\" Well this was, perhaps, one of the most remarkable meetings I have ever attended in my entire life. At one end of the table was the principle investor who at this time had raised about 3 1 /2 million dollars to develop the \"Black Box Brain Tuner\" ... the neural electrotherapy device. There were three of the staff scientists and the president of the financial company called TLC. A very bad analogy, the middle word was leverage, I think it was Turner Leverage Corporation, it had nothing to do with tender loving care. Meg had been brought to this company in August of 1981 to develop the device, which had been built for her by Shackman Instruments in England. The history of this is that Meg Patterson, while working as an abdominal surgeon at the Tung Wa Hospital in Hong Kong, had come across Dr. Wen and his use of electro-acupuncture for anesthesia. Dr. Wen had discovered, quite accidentally, that many of his patients were on heroin. At this time 1970-1972, a $500 a day habit in the United States would cost less than a pack of cigarettes in Hong Kong. And about 20% of the gross population that would go through the Tung Wa Hospital in Hong Kong were heroin addicts. So doing hundreds of surgeries a month, a certain percentage of these people who were heroin addicts began to report, \"I'm not feeling any discomfort. I don't have withdrawal pains. I seem to have an altered state.\" They would go back on the street after surgery, get a fix from their usual 'mother' and find that the fix had not given them the same effect. There were a number of fights because they thought their heroin was being cut, etc., but it was a very interesting political situation. The Addiction Withdrawal Process So, Dr. Wen did what any cool scientist would do, he began doing rat studies. Mega rats. I'll digress for a moment here and say that heroin or opiates as a class—opium, morphine, heroin and the number of the synthetics that are manufactured in the ethical pharmaceutical houses—simply overload the body's production of normal endorphins. Betaendorphins was discovered around 1975 as a painkiller that the body manufactures. It is about 100 times as effective as morphine as a painkiller. When you don't have it you get the aches and pains, the withdrawal, the stomach cramps, the nausea, the insomnia, all of these horrible things that attend withdrawal. When you give your body massive doses, or even small doses in the beginning, of any of the opiates the part of the brain that says, 'build neural transmitters,' simply says, 'shut down we have too much.' So, when you get off of the substance, when you try to kick it cold turkey, the body is in agony because those little factories in the brain simply don't produce the endorphins. The word endorphin comes from en: endogenous and orphin: after morphine. It simply means endogenous or built-in Revised November 2004 Page 67 6186"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"morphine. About five or six years ago there were some 40 known neuro-transmitters, seratonin being one of the most famous. At this time there are over 2,000 that have been identified and they're still counting. So, the brain is an exceedingly complex little factory. Remember the days in school when they said, \"Well you're worth about five dollars, you've got two pounds of salt, some potassium, some carbon, some hydrogen.\" Try to buy a gram of interferon for under 8 to 10,000 dollars. The body is far more complex than this set of chemicals that we held so dear in grade school. What Dr. Wen did was to hook the rats on heroin, have two groups: one control and one active. He would cut off the heads of the rats and run chromatography (electrophoresis chromatography) to find out what some of these trace proteins were in the control and the sample. The control group, the rats that had been hooked on heroin and suddenly cut off were pretty miserable rats. They showed that it took maybe a week to three weeks before the neuro-transmitters would again reappear—the exact range of time that the withdrawal symptoms occupy somebody coming off the narcotic. The rats taken off heroin cold turkey and then with two little clips ... were given electro-stimulation around 111 hertz ... showed that within 40 minutes of the time that the voltage was applied, the brain's ability to produce it's own neuro-transmitters had been rehabilitated and that within three to five days it had reached normal. [Editor's note: we do not believe animal testing is necessary. We do not support animal testing.] The Politics of Health and Addictive Substances Now the implications of this were rather stunning. How many people do we have in this country who are on valium—uppers, downers, legal narcotics that are highly addictive. You probably remember that during the American Civil War, when morphine was invented to replace some of the other opiates, they said, \"Oh, here we have a pain killer that is totally non-addictive.\" They've said this about almost every other drug that has seen the light of day. In fact, boys and girls, if it isn't addictive they don't want to sell it. Did you realize that there is a 13.6 billion dollar legal pharmaceutical trade in mood-altering drugs such as valium? And that there is about a 20 billion dollar market from the same drug manufacturers in the United States that exported to Mexico where they do not have these pharmaceutical controls—prescriptions—which comes back onto the streets of the United States? That is close to 36 billion dollars a year at the retail level. Now nobody wants to interrupt this trade. Tobacco is 4 1 /2 times more addictive than heroin. This study was done here at the Veterans Administration Hospital, Sepulvida, by Dr. Krober in 1974. It had been found that GI's coming back from Vietnam who had several habits—tobacco, heroin, others, could be gotten off heroin within 72 hours to a week. But it was almost impossible to get them off of tobacco. So a study was done which established that the withdrawal time on tobacco could run up to two years. That it was 4 1 /2 times more physically addictive than heroin—this is hard core scientific data. Would you like to see the American tobacco companies stop paying taxes? Their net is around 27 billion dollars a year. These are big dollars. People ask why these devices are not exactly legal in the United States. Well, getting back to the story, we came to this conference table hoping to exchange some information. I passed along to Meg and the rest of the people (who must remain nameless, but this is thoroughly documented) the fact that Paul Tyler was willing to assist this group in getting this device going. Now, since she had been in this country, they had raised 3 1 /2 million dollars to build a prototype. At the time that I met with these people in February of 1983, not one device had been built. Meg had been in California since August of 1981. Revised November 2002 Page 68 of 86"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"So I asked them, \"How's your patent status?\" They replied, \"Well, we realized that once we patent it we've given the secret away, so we plan on using the strategy of continuance in part.\" If you know what this means—in other words they would continue to modify the patent as long as possible with continuation amendments so as not to get a patent. That meant that they had no patent. \"Well what is the status of your prototype?\" Again they responded, \"Well...we're, yada, yada, yada...\" I then asked, \"Well are you going to sell these devices?\" Response, \"Uh, we don't know, we think we're going to lease them.\" Next question, \"Well how much?\" Response, \"Well we'll put a price tag of about $50,000 on each box and the doctor will be on the franchise agreement. They required to charge the person $8,000 if he has no insurance for 10 days use of the box. $10,000 if he has insurance coverage. I have the letter here that went to the franchisees. And yet they had no boxes. A number of people had bought territory for this including William Parker of the Parker Holistic Health Center and a number of other people that by this time I had met. They had been promised delivery of the Brain Tuners by December of 1981 and here we are into 1983 and not one box had been delivered. Some strange things were happening here. And after listening to this for about an hour, I was prepared, I had armed a briefcase. I had devices which I had acquired, had smuggled into the United States from the USSR, from Finland, from Germany, from England. I still have some of these. We have the original devices that have been used by Dr. Wen in Hong Kong. In other words the grandfather of the Shackman Instrument device that Meg had used at the Pharmacon clinics in England. So, it turned out that the investors who are at this table were not even aware that this technology was over a hundred years old ... had been used in the Soviet Union for over 20 years ... and had been used on the continent for 15 years ... and in Great Britain for 10 years. They thought that they had an original idea, which might have been patentable. These devices could absolutely rock the boat of the pharmaceutical drug industry, the liquor industry, the tobacco industry, the doctors who make a great deal of money. When you want the prescription refilled, usually you have to pay the doctor a fee. It's just a mess. Why are these not being used, for example, in alcoholic rehabilitation centers? In 1969 some friends of mine, new friends-I didn't meet these people until I started researching this area—had heard about the generic term \"electro-sleep\" that was being used in the Soviet Union for addiction and alcohol control. The government gave these people a little money, sent them to the Soviet Union, and they came back with one of the original devices that were used for \"electro-sleep.\" It seemed that the Soviets had trouble with Generals who drank too much vodka. And at this hospital in Washington, which is a household word, they were treating American Generals who had the habit of too much scotch, bourbon or gin. They brought the device back to the United States in late 1969 or early 1970 and began using it in the hospital with addicts. It's one of the most fascinating psycho-political stories that emerged during the five months that I was actually researching this data. The CIA came around and said, \"What are you doing?\" My friends said, \"Well, we have this electronic device which apparently is restoring short-term memory loss.\" The CIA said, \"You can't do that.\" The people who were working on the project were dispersed. They took the device to Garland, Texas to the Vero Instrument Company. Now Vero builds the high-technology equipment. Vero builds skunk-work devices like starlight scopes, infrared viewers, high technology microcomputers. They're one of the highest tech, government secret-agency suppliers in the world. The vice president of this company split off and founded a corporation called Neurosystems Incorporated. And brought out a beautiful little device, which until recently was the Cadillac of the entire field, about the size of a pack of cigarettes that absolutely cured addictions. They thought, \"Wow we're going to have markets for this.\" They never got FDA approval. It's Revised November 2004 age 9 of 86"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"been 14 years. FDA grandfathered them under section 510K of the 1976 Congressional Act. They still said, \"Hey if we take this around to dry farms, namely alcoholic rehabilitation centers, there should be a tremendous need for these.\" Now in California alone there are about two dozen—it's a big industry. He knocked on doors and there was very little acceptance. Finally, a fellow who had worked for one of these dry farms told him the secret. He said, \"You know if somebody comes in here who has good insurance, we can run up about a $9,000 bill on laboratory tests alone ... pathology, kidney test, blood test, you name it. He has to be in here for at least a week and a half to 14 days before we break even on our television-advertising budget alone. The person gets glossed up ... the family's happy ... he goes back to work. 75% of them will backslide within six months. You come in here with a device that will totally restore them in five days? Why, we are a franchise, we are here to make money for our stockholders, get out of here you bum.\" Research on Addictions and the Brain Tuner Technology Now fortunately they had spent a great deal of money in absolutely and totally documenting the effects of this little device. They found that it reversed Korscoff psychosis in three to five days with chronic alcoholics. This work was done at the University of Wisconsin Medical School, at the Louisiana Medical College and at the University of Texas. Now any of you who've dealt with alcoholism know that it normally takes eight years for the short-term memory to be restored—eight years of total abstinence. The short-term memory profile of an alcoholic absolutely pinpoints the amount of degeneration. One of the tests is the maze test, where you have to go through a maze without lifting the pencil from the paper. The other is the beta section of the test where you have to look at words on one page, then the page is taken away and you have to remember it on subsequent pages. An alcoholic will usually show a profile of almost total inability to pass these two facets. In all of their subjects, I don't like to say all, it's rather spooky, 99% of them—they were able ... where they had a baseline of tests ... for example, where the person had been to college, had taken this same or a similar test and had become an alcoholic for 15 years ... where they had access to the original records, the short-term memory was totally restored in five days of using this little box 40 minutes a day. Now this is wild and wonderful. All of this emerged during some of the research. I spent quite a bit of time in the bio-med library of UCLA, some time at the Marris library, USC County. Some of the papers, particularly the work done in the Soviet Union and in the Orient, were only available at the national medical archives at Bethesda, Maryland. But, I have compiled a bibliography—it isn't in the final form—and any of you who are health professionals can get a copy of it. I'm still trying to get it on the word-processor and there's an explosion of information in electro-medicine lately, as anyone knows, and I try to update it. So, every week my friends send me at least another dozen references on this particular topic. [See page 21 for the bibliography.] Now it became apparent after spending a great deal of time with Meg that nothing was going to happen in this particular sector. She had her engineers come down to her little house on Fernleaf and I spent many an afternoon with them explaining what I had found independently—explaining the difference between constant current and constant voltage, etc. The only device Meg had brought to this country was the Pharmacon, which we were able to thoroughly instrument, analyze and document. About the size of the original Sony Walkman tape recorder. This is the device that was used on Peter Townsend when he was flown in on a hospital bed type airplane to the John Wayne Airport. He had taken a massive dose of heroin before he left London, enough to get him to the States. He was absolutely green and yellow when they took him off the plane ... when Meg put this device on his head ... and within about 40 minutes, of course all of you have read this story—it's been reprinted in Penthouse, it's been reprinted in Omni magazine, he was rehabilitated—after he'd spent a fortune in various clinics around the world. Peter Townsend finally got off, Revised November 2002 Page 70 of 86"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"kicked the habit and is now happy, healthy, clean, producing again and all of this is history. At any rate, they were getting results with the device as primitive as it was and it began to appear that the neuro-electric therapy group, the magnet group were not going to produce anything. They were either unable or unwilling to do it. Now this could lead to a great deal of speculation as to who got to whom, whether the Mafia was involved or some of the pharmaceutical houses or what have you. By the way, Meg's reason for not accepting the government's offer was that she wanted an entirely new category. Paul had conveyed to her that \"If you will come in under the grandfather clause, it will get you approval by the FDA, which will permit animal and human experimentation.\" Meg absolutely and totally refused to do this. She wanted a new category for neuro-electric therapy, not realizing that this category had been preempted by CES, which is Cranial Electro Stimulation and a long list of generic terms. We tried to explain to Meg that since Reagan there are only under 300 investigators still working for the Food and Drug Administration and this is an accurate figure. There are over 80,000 devices awaiting their investigation and approval. If you have another 5 to 6 million dollars and ten years to wait—even if we get you at the front of the list —it's not going to fly. But she absolutely insisted that she would not come in under the grandfather clause for a TENS unit. Although these devices do a great deal more than any TENS unit, they cannot make claims for what they actually do because this would put them in a new category. And this means human and animal tests, certification, all of the research that goes on and on and on and takes a tremendous amount of money. BOB BECK'S DECISION TO DESIGN A BRAIN TUNER Research with Frequencies So, I decided, \"Well let's research this thing a little bit further and bring out a box that will do some good.\" Which I did. I gave away a number of these to friends and used them as guinea pigs. It worked, and we feel it is vastly superior to the $50,000 Pharmacon device. ... doctors have used the unit. The history of this is that some doctor will buy one unit and pass it around and then the next order will be for 3 or 4, the next will be for 10, the next one will be for a couple of dozen. So, it's a thoroughly tested, viable approach. There's no placebo, witchcraft, or 'maybe' in it. The animal studies have proven that. It works. But now, another very interesting thing happened. There had been an ongoing debate between Robert 0. Becker who was Chief of Orthopedic Surgery at the Syracuse VA Hospital, and a student of his Dr. Andy Bassett, Columbia University, as to which frequencies would rehabilitate, rejuvenate and grow li mbs back on amputated animals. Okay, Becker was using actually attached electrodes and putting current directly into the system. Now he and I have shared several conferences in Canada over the years. He's a brilliant man—he's rather bitter. At one time he had been nominated for a Nobel Prize for his work, but because he was a little outspoken, like some of the rest of our family, he got to enjoy a rather early retirement. He was also speaking out on the fact that the power lines were causing undue clusters of illness here in the eastern United States. But, he had a student named Andy Bassett who has made ... a device, which has been accepted by the orthopedic mainstream ethical physicians. A little magnetic paddle, which is put near the non-union fracture which, induces a current into that area by induction. Now here we have two separate approaches. We have a little ongoing discussion like Dr. Salk and Dr. Sabin. You can't get around either one of them without having them absolutely assassinate the other one. ... This discussion [Becker vs Bassett research] became so heated that some funds were laundered and sent to Great Britain to find out just what was really going on. The results of this were reported for the first Revised November 2004 Page 71 of 86"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"time publicly at a conference in Quebec last year by the principle investigator from Cambridge. A person of female persuasion by the way, who finally located the secret frequency that was causing the tissue to rejuvenate. In the case of a rat they would amputate an extremity and put on the electrode. The blood seepage would indifferentiate, go to the area and start growing the tissue which had been there originally, as though there had been some type of architectural pattern that had restored the memory of the RNA, DNA close to the site to reproduce the proper tissue. It didn't turn into kidney tissue or brain tissue or testicles, it turned into whatever happened to have been there before the amputation. In human beings, young children, they have grown fingers back. If you follow this—it is an extremely delicate subject because they're not supposed to be doing this with human subjects. But when they get off the conference, they will talk to you about what has actually been going on with this. Now, they ran many, many, many animal studies. They held a frequency constant and varied the waveform, they held a voltage constant and varied the frequency, and they held the voltage and frequency constant and varied the pulse repetition rate. One of the three magic numbers was publicly disclosed at this conference a year ago last August in Canada. It was very much unsuspected. It was over 2 kilohertz. I can't, well, I can give it to this group-2.72 kilohertz. When that particular frequency was in the shotgun effect of the device, the limb re-grew. When it was filtered out or when the slope of the curve was altered so that that frequency was not predominant, it didn't grow. Now there are three other magic numbers, which caused the rejuvenation, the healing, rapid re-stimulation of the neuro-transmitters. These were developed on another government grant program and I am not at liberty to tell you what they are. Beck's Brain Tuner Frequencies But, they are in the little box that we built. We did very elaborate spectrum analysis work on all of the units that we could beg, borrow or steal. These are computer printouts, spectrum analysis sheets, of over two dozen brain tuners ... We found the majority of these devices were hit or miss—they didn't have the magic numbers but they had enough fairly rough harmonics. You know, it's so ridiculous for the people selling these devices to claim certain frequency effects. How many engineers do we have here? Well, you've played around with radio ... uh, frequency is a useful term only if you're dealing with coherent waveforms such as a sine wave. If you have a square wave, by definition a square wave has an infinite number of odd harmonics, right? That's what a square wave is. So that means if you put a 10 Hz (hertz) square wave into somebody, you have every other odd harmonic of that from DC to light if it passes the system. Is that correct? So here are people putting out square wave boxes that they say will tune from X number of hertz to X number of hertz and they're looking at the pulse repetition rates and confusing them with the frequencies. Now these are things we find absolutely abhorrent, ... Well, we hope that in these years where more and more people are talking about electronic medicine—which has to be the medicine of the future—that some of these basic misconceptions will be clarified. So we began experimenting in earnest. Thank God I had access to an IQS Model 401 Spectrum Analyzer which is probably the most advanced thing that I could get my hands on for under $50,000 at Hewlett Packard. And then we began looking at these frequencies in earnest. We eliminated the need for ever tuning the device. How many of you are familiar with the AccuScope? I'm going to use this as an example. Terry Fisher, like the rest of us, realized that perhaps the most innocent people with whom you can deal are medical doctors. And here are these two dials that have various frequency settings, and the doctors Revised November 2002 Page 72 of 86"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"very seldom read instructions. So Jerry came up with a marvelous idea. He got some different colored scotch stick-on masking tape and cut little dots that are red and orange and green and yellow and paste these dots on the dial. Now we can tell the doctor match up the yellow dot with the yellow dot. This made it almost idiot proof and so there was no need to talk of specific frequencies ... which is ridiculous when you're dealing with anything other than sine waves, anyway. You match the dots. He would come back months later and find that the device was still set on the same dots as when he walked out of the office and it was working fine. So everybody was happy. All of this apocrypha is now being replaced by hard science in these conferences. I've attended a number of them. They say electricity is the thing which makes you better, etc., etc. At any rate this was the political state of affairs in 1983 when a lot of people who did not know the difference between frequency and pulse repetition rate and had never heard of heterodynes and harmonics, were looking for the Holy Grail. The way they normally did this, they put the box on the dope addict and they would just juggle a dial and say, \"How does this feel, how does this feel, how does this feel?\" It was a fairly empirical process. How many of you read the Omni article in January 1983? You notice there that the main secret of making the person better was to twiddle the knob because at that time they did not know what the frequencies were. It has been fairly well established that the beta-endorphins are stimulated with a pulse repetition rate of between 90 and 111 hertz., The catecholamines at around 4 hertz, the enkephalins at another number, etc., etc. This work has been very well documented and very well replicated by a number of scientific laboratories. So what we decided to do in, our box, was to put all of these frequencies simultaneously. Now some people said, \"Well, shouldn't you do one and then another and then another.\" And it's turned out not to be this way at all. If you have a Hi Q circuit you can put white noise into it and ring the filters, right? And the brain is an exceedingly Hi Q circuit. It appears to have a Q in certain of the neuronal constructs of around 3,000. Which is amazingly high. What is Q? Q is the figure of merit. Q means the band pass versus the energy required. A crystal set will get all the radio stations in the area at once. A super heterodyne or TRF will get narrower and narrower bandwidth. If you have a triple or double conversion super heterodyne, you can separate two stations that are within a kilohertz of each other. The difference between those is the Q of the circuit, which is tuning to the signal. The higher the Q the lower the band pass, the less the interference. We have all of the frequencies simultaneously. This generates a sine wave of ten hertz at milli-volts and it requires about 25 volts minimum threshold to stimulate them. We use all 200 frequencies. Would you like to see the spectrum analysis of this? We put them in bundles. We think that some physiology ... for example an old person and a young person might have slightly different frequencies. So when we are hitting the beta-endorphins we center it. For example if this is the target frequency, we put out enough on each side of it in these three magic ranges: encephalon, catecholamines and beta-endorphins. These seem to be the most active known neuro-transmitters. We've used a bit of a shotgun approach instead of a rifle. When we work the lower frequencies for the catecholamines, each one of these clusters show the simultaneous frequency spectrum by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) each millisecond. In each one thousandth of a second, this bundle of energy is supplied to the points. Now it was rather difficult to do that because we had to buy reverse Fourier transform, find out what fundamentals would recombine and heterodyne to give us exactly the spectrum that we want. If you hold a prism to the light and you have white light, you can separate that into red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo violet. You can recombine those with three basic colors to get white, but you have gaps in it. If you look at that with a spectroscope, if you look at a fluorescent lamp, you'll find it's not a continuous spectrum.

We broke the price barrier, most of the units on the market, sold for $5,000 up. This Brain Tuner has everything that was necessary for the brain to rehabilitate it's own production of neuro-transmitters. In the meantime we had found about 200 pounds of literature—at least I have that many boxes full of Xerox material that friends had sent me—literally cardboard cartons full. My filing system is abysmal. I'm very creative—I just pile it in boxes and hope I can find it later. Of the work that had been done absolutely establishing that any stress-related syndrome—and this is why the psychologists hate this device. The stress-related symptoms that are recognized are: insomnia, addiction, anxiety and depression. That about 95% of the people who use these devices for a period of less than a month, find complete reversal of these symptoms. And here the psychologists that have been talking to them for years at $50 to $75 an hour. The pharmacologists have been giving them mood-elevating, depressing and altering drugs since the good old days of Milltown and into the more elaborate pharmacology. ... So naturally there was a great deal of resistance to this type of technology. So right now there's this political hassle happening over the fact that even the Carnegie Report, the study back at the turn of the century, tried to damn all of the electronic medicine that had been proven back in the 1890's to be highly effective. And you know who funded those studies. It's very much like the American Tobacco industry saying that the link between lung cancer and smoking? There isn't any. So we could go on and on about this. Basically that's what the device is. That's how I started to do it. I hated to see people being charged $1,000 a day and the thing just grew and grew and grew and grew.

But they are basically being used to relieve pain. TENS units have been around for about 100 years. When Norm Shealey saw the little device from the barber shop that had an induction coil and a flashlight battery and a handle that you roll up and down your back, he had thought this was a good idea and brought out one of the first transistorized TENS units. By the way, there's an interesting story. The Stemtech Company was purchased by Johnson & Johnson, I'm sure you're aware of the litigation that came down. And a few years ago, the president of Stemtech, took Johnson & Johnson, which is one of the largest pill manufacturers in the United States, they make Tylenol, Super Tylenol and what have you—hundreds of other products. They took them to court saying, \"you've suppressed this technology.\" Revised November 2004 Page 75 of 86"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"They won. The judge said, \"In 30 years on the bench, I have never seen a more flagrant violation of trust\" (this was reported in a number of magazine articles.) Johnson & Johnson appealed the 130 million dollar judgement against Johnson & Johnson and lost the appeal. The inventors of the Stemtech which is only one of maybe 20 or 30 TENS units, then got back in motion. The judge pointed out that it wasn't to the advantage of Johnson & Johnson to have anything to relieve pain if they were in the business of selling Tylenol. So that's a matter of public record that the drug companies try to suppress this type of technology. That was a pretty big lawsuit—it made a lot of headlines. That's typical ... you see we're not dealing with a scientific problem with this type of instrumentation, we're dealing with a socio-political-economic problem. The government on one hand subsidizes the tobacco growers and on the other hand says you have to put a warning on the packages. But the tobacco growers generate so much tax revenue that they're in this double bind. This thing is a political problem not a scientific one. The same thing is happening with the new emerging electronic medical devices. Germany has some of the most amazing things, the Mora Unit— you're familiar with that ... the Dermatron. These things do almost psychic diagnostic work. And yet they're totally outlawed in this country. Andreas has to smuggle these things in—call them agricultural testing devices. Should we charge more money? We've had one complaint from a number of professional users. They say \"For God's sake, take that thing and put it in a great, big box, put a lot of dials and bells and whistles and light-emitting diodes and switches on it, all of which would be dummy incidentally, and charge five or six thousand dollars for it. Then people will have faith in it.\" And I say \"Well that's criminal.\" But anyway that's my philosophy. Early Research Studies Okay, the results of this on drug addicts were generated in the US several years before Meg learned about the device in Hong Kong. And the vast literature on this was funded by the Neuro Systems Group in Garland Texas. How many of you have heard of the Executive Monkey study. This work was funded by the people who brought this box out originally in 1970. This is before Dr. Wen had his serendipity, his accidental discovery, with the heroin addicts in Hong Kong. I didn't realize you could give monkeys ulcers. But what they had done was to aggravate them enough to where they had ulcers and put the device on their acupuncture points. They found that within about three days they had reversed the pH, the acidity, and the monkeys got better—the control group. All of this work had been thoroughly done long before this current era of re-stimulation of interest. The rat studies had been done both in San Francisco and in Hong Kong. The chromatography had been done here in the United States, so it was well controlled. Like electronic medicine, when we were looking at patents, we found a patent in 1893 showing a fellow with electrodes behind his ears. Okay, 1893, before the Harrison Act, some 20 some years before the Harrison Act you could go into any drugstore and buy morphine sulfate. Mothers whose babies cried could buy simple soothing syrup, which was sugar and morphine. She'd give a teaspoon to the baby and the baby wouldn't cry anymore. There were quite a few addicts. The stuff was legal, there was no control. I mean marijuana was legal. After the Act, a number of people who were trying to get off this had forgotten that around 1890 we had a hell of a lot more addicts in this country. The women who were religious were sipping tonic which was about 200 proof alcohol for their health, taking bitters and what-have-you. In other words, we had about the same addiction level. And this work had been explored about 84 to 85 years ago and then again suppressed by what we feel is the ruling class of the doctors, the pharmacies and the people who want Revised November 2002 age 6 of 86"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"to take your money for making you better. ... Fisher, no relation to Jerry, had done this work in 1932 and 1935 and had a number of patents. Remember the Fisher Instrument Company that was making electrical stimulating devices back 40 years or so. Okay, this has been in the literature, they had explored in great depth the wave forms, the frequencies, the application modes and what-have-you. Bob Beck's Early Research There's a replica of the work I did in 1973. In 1969 I began building ethical biofeedback equipment—EEG Brainwave Amplifiers. I had one foot on each banana peel, I had been a scientist and I am now a kook, so we sort of straddle this chasm. So I have taught biofeedback classes at UCLA, USC, Vilanova University of Hawaii, SMU. And when I was doing this for health professionals, I also had access to the psychic underground. In Hawaii I was able to make brainwave recordings of one of the three living bloodline Polynesian Kahunas. I was able to make brainwave EEG recordings of hexinmeisters like John Ott in Lancaster County—no relation to the fellow who did the work on light and colour. I have worked with American Indian medicine men. I've worked with Kathryn Coleman before she died. And she let me run a little telemetry test when she was knocking them down at the Shrine Auditorium. We found almost invariably that when they were in their working state—which was only a few seconds—you're here you get the information you come back, you can talk about it for hours. It's a flash, in the twinkling of an eye. They were showing about a 7.83 hertz, almost pure coherent maybe 20 microvolt signal frontal to occipital midline. That's between Fl and F2 in the standard nomenclature system to halfway between 01 and 02 if you're an encephalographer. In other words the third eye ... which shows whole brain alpha. Over and over again we found these frequencies in people with remarkable talents—healers, radionics operators, dousers, shamans, witch doctors, mystics, golden don, priests and priestesses—if they were authentic. One of our early cases was, well I'd better not mention the person's name, and it's a world famous name. But at any rate I was intrigued enough to want to discover the common denominator ... yet none of t hese ad died for your would sins speak and that's the 's the others. only Kathryn way to go Coleman . . . and some thought of it the was American the blood d of the medicine lamb ne that men Christ had thought it was in the sacred cornmeal, the gourds and the feathers. Marnis and Leona had certain stones that were the dwelling place of the ancestral spirits. Well, Kathryn would think that was heathen and Marnis would absolutely laugh at a fellow in a barn in Lancaster County wearing a black hat between midnight and dawn drawing these hexan signals to bless the barns. So after we'd seen it enough times, I developed very sensitive magnetometers, which I sell to the government for anti-submarine warfare, that would detect this earth ionosphere cavity resonance. And in a few cases—not enough to make a solid scientific case, but enough to be extremely interesting anecdotally—we found that there was phase-lock ... frequency, amplitude, etc. between that person's EEG signature and the earth's brainwave itself. Now this was heresy, when I reported on it in 1973 and then did a more formal paper in 1977. We'd rather you learn to enter altered states through EEG biofeedback instead of having it done to you. I teach classes back east occasionally, where they have a number of people who get into this state very rapidly. Revised November 2004 Page 77 of 86"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The Mind as a Hologram What does this mean? It means that some people with remarkable talents, maybe one in one thousand, are sensitive enough to tune to this cosmic clock. When they synchronize their brainwave with this signal, they can access information in the hologram, which is normally not accessible except in an altered state of consciousness. If we take a hologram with helium-neon laser light which happens to be 632.8 nano-meters and try to play that hologram back with a carbon dioxide laser or anything else, we've got garbage. That hologram, at least in the old fashioned system not the dichromates, must be played back at that specific wavelength of light. If it doesn't you garble the image. The holographic mind, which was very hot several years ago as a topic of conversation ... David Balm, of course this is his theory, and Carl Prebrum thought it was a good idea and got on board. It is now fairly certain that the mind is a hologram, it acts holographically. If you cut a picture in half and throw half of it away, you've lost half the data. But if you cut half of your brain out, like we had a number of hydroencephalites that had a brain about the size of a grape and we had veterans coming back from Korea, Vietnam, World War 1 and 2, that had 90% of their brain missing. They hadn't forgotten 90% of their family—they had remembered every single person. It wasn't as though you had thrown half of the information away. So, that suggested that the brain was processing information like a hologram. If you break that hologram into smaller and smaller pieces, you still have the whole picture but in less detail. But you can't see that picture unless you have that specific excitation frequency of, in the case of helium, neon, which is the most common, replays that information. So as a metaphor only, if the person has by dent of meditation, religious practice, taking sacred mushrooms or whatever, the person does manage to hit that frequency in his brainwave pattern, it seems to make him more amenable to all of this information. Now this is interesting because if our brain, our mind, is a hologram and if you and you and you are existing here right now, you're a part of it. Which means that if you can access what is in your mind, quantum physics says there's no reason why you can't access the whole thing. Thou art that. You are in the universe, the universe is in you. You are God. Whatever information is out there you have just a little bitty slice of it, it isn't as sharp, it isn't as high resolution as if you were everybody at the same time but you can do it. Any shaman or person who's undergone any kind of mystical discipline ... can demonstrate this. ... So what that means to us is that maybe that magic number 7.83 hertz is the place on the alpha-theta border. Alpha is from 8 to about, they used to say 14, we now say 12 1 ,4 because there's a kappa in the gap. Theta is usually considered to be 4 to 7. So 8 or 7.83 is right there on the bi-phasic border between the alpha-theta. We've known for years that theta might be the area where we access creativity. You recall that Thomas Edison, Bernard Berude, many people, would take a little catnap when they were dealing with a particular knotty problem. They would say, \"I will have the answer when I wake up\" and usually they would. The reason for that didn't emerge until many, many years after the death of these people who had been using this technique. A number of us use this technique today. It was demonstrated that when you go to sleep, the hypnogogic state going from waking to sleeping, the hypnopompic coming up from sleep to normal consciousness ... you pass through that alpha-theta border and that might be the place where you access the information external to your own nervous system. Now, you can get an argument on this, but great ideas down through history from the invention of calculus to inventions of many other things have appeared simultaneously at places all over the planet. So that means that maybe Rupert Sheldrake is right—that there is a morphogenetic field and that maybe this is the best way to access this. Revised November 2002 Page 78 of 86"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Now getting back to, \"What does this mean?\" This state can be stimulated with small magnetic oscillators. I brought this one that was brought in from Germany. This is the Vittaset unit that many of the i mportant people in Germany have to wear because it re-synchronizes the left and right hemisphere firing ... with this little magnetic pace setter ... when they're feeling particularly distressed because they're closer to the Eastern Iron Curtain transmitters than we are. This work has also been done by Delgado who had to leave the University of New Mexico and go to Spain because his work was so controversial. It's been done by Ross Adee at his VA hospital out here in Loma Linda. It has been replicated by any number of people both in the open literature and in the intelligence community as a fact. Your brain can be stimulated to go into these particular states ... So, instead of it being witchcraft, this is emerging as the medicine, the consciousness, of the future. Instead of dropping acid to alter consciousness, there are far more benign ways. Well, I would say that science and religion are on a collision course if they haven't collided a long time ago. I would say that we now have scientific proof that man, as a bio-cosmic resonator is tremendously sensitive to these very small stimuli. There are three to five hundred papers on this topic in the hard-core scientific literature. Now if you choose to challenge me on that figure I will take you 10 to 1 in a bet. It's an explosion of information! Years ago we were a piece of meat. Today, we are a finely-tuned instrument that can access information exterior to ourselves and do something with it—bring it back. I'm told about a time when Bob Monroe gave a demonstration for the CIA and he was challenged to leave his body. This happened in Maryland if I got the story straight from the naval office of surface weaponry that sponsored it. That's the skunk works back there in White Oaks, Maryland. Bob actually went to the distant site, got into the safe, read the data and came back. It was later verified on a double blind test. Half the people in that room got up and said, \"Gee that's interesting. I wonder how he did it. It has to be some kind of a trick.\" And then went unconscious about it later. Their reality structure could not admit that, damn it, the Soviets have been doing this for a long time and there are some people over here that are on top of it. It's the challenge to your belief structure that stops ... well we could on forever. One of the implications of this is that we have new technology for enhancing consciousness rapidly, safely, right now, with no side effects—that works for at least 30% of the population. The brain tuners work for about 95%, the magnetic stimulation for only about one third. So that is by no means perfected. But at any rate this has been researched for about 20 years and it works. Revised November 2004 Page 79 of 86"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"USE OF THE BRAIN TUNER Placement of the Electrodes The electrodes go behind the ears. You might want to know how this happened. Traditionally the point for stimulation for electro-acupuncture for certain types of surgery is .86, which is in the ear, the area that's called the heart lung point in classical acupuncture. Dr. Wen was inserting number 30 needles, I think it was 3 tenths of a millimeter beneath the surface of the skin at a 30 degree angle. And he was putting—this is all in the open literature—alligator clips to these needles. Meg Patterson found a spot on the mastoid process right up here at the top of the ear, using external electrodes, not penetrating the skin, no blood and guts, that was just as effective. The neuro-systems people, in doing a study, found that by far the most effective spot is this little hollow behind the TMG, the temporal mendibular joint. This accesses various acupuncture points on what's called the triple warmer. How accurately does it need to be placed? With electro-acupuncture, anywhere between a half and three quarters of an inch will still hit it because the current is diffused. The electrons being of light charge will disperse through the body, so anywhere near that is effective. How it Should Feel Well, you may notice a sting if you don't clean. There's the oil, I took a bath before I came here but I feel a little oil on my skin. It's a matter of contact and if you clean that area with a little swab of alcohol and get good contact, there is no sting. It's a very pleasant sort of buzzing stimulation. You may feel more on one side than the other. Most people will feel a difference in stimulus on one side or the other and to prove that it's you and not the instrument, simply turn your head all the way one way and all the way the other and you'll find that the locus will shift. What you're getting there is the difference of the bio-electric muscle tension—plus or minus the AC coming in on the electrodes. What amplitude is necessary? You turn it up to the point where it's basically uncomfortable, then turn it down to where it's comfortable. In about 10 minutes you'll find that you'll acclimate and you'll have to turn it higher and higher. Your body builds up a tolerance to it. Length of a Session Is there any threshold on having your neuro-transmitters stimulated? The dosage ... all of the plateaus have been noticed by most of the workers at between 20 and 30 minutes. 40 minutes is red line. If you go 45 minutes, they begin coming down the other side of the slope. It won't do any damage, but you will undo the benefits. So, we recommend that the device be used for only about 20 to 30 minutes a day. Too much medicine is worse than not enough. So, in the case of an alcoholic that's into DT's, bed-ridden, throwing up, you know really in bad shape—we say two sessions, 40 minutes in the morning and 40 minutes at night, a day. When the person is more or less back together we say then cut that back down to 40 minutes once a day. That seems to be enough. Revised November 2002 Page 80 of 86"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Side-Effects What about side effects? The most troublesome side effect that has been noted almost universally is that it stimulates lucid dreaming. Some people who have been shut off from their dreams are a little alarmed, at first. Is it possible to replace an addiction with an addiction to the Brain Tuner? No. We've had a problem with a few alcoholics who we've gotten off say a fifth of scotch a day. And they feel so great they panicked. When they went back, drinking only two fifths they got the same effect that they would on one. We believe that this is the death wish and since God gave those people free will and they've chosen to anesthetize themselves, that's their choice. But if they want to kick whatever it is, it works. It only works about 45% effectively with tobacco. With Dr. Elizabeth Long's work with heroin, morphine, it's been about 95%. With Valium and Librium about 95%. The only thing that we can't kick almost instantly is tobacco. That's the most addictive substance known to man. Other Benefits—Memory, Depression, Anxiety, Insomnia What are the benefits if you don't have an addiction? This is another one of the startling side-effects. My own lady had had a spinal block when her daughter who is 25 years old was born. Since that time she could not remember telephone numbers or addresses very well. She found after she'd been on it one day that she was recalling telephone numbers, did not need the telephone book, ... and numbers that she had known 20 years earlier when she worked in aerospace, were coming back. You'll find that you can recall faces and places that you thought you had lost, they're just there. It does amazing things to the memory. It is as specific for stress reduction. If you have any type of anxiety, depression, insomnia. If it's chronic it takes about 3 weeks. This is a universal constant that has been replicated in any number of studies. If it's acute it takes about a week. Does it improve intelligence? What they found in a student study at the University of Louisiana, again this is accessible in the literature, they were working on students who had anxiety about final exams— and I know I've been there, years ago fortunately. And after they had removed the anxiety, the freezing, their IQ's went up. So the story was spread around for a while that these things improved intelligence. But it turned out that that isn't what was happening. What had happened is that they had restored these person's memory. Apparently they were then able to access the information in a shorter period of time and since IQ tests are graded against a clock, they were getting higher scores. So it wasn't intelligence, it was simply memory that had been rehabilitated. And this was controversial from about 1972 to 74. There were all these arguments in the literature about why was this person performing better and the final solution was simply that the memory had been restored. In other words apparently when the brain is tuned, the neuro-transmitters are in balance. With regards to depression, lithium carbonate requires blood assays, the dosage is fairly critical. In most of the studies, again double blind, a most amazing thing happened in some of these studies. The doctors, who had done them, and I have one or two of these from the University of Wisconsin, said that we hope our colleagues check our results. We can't imagine anything being this effective and yet we've gone over our studies repeatedly. To have a responsible scientist put that in his report as sort of a disclaimer, I found rather titillating. And yes, it does specifically address stress-related symptoms and at the top of that list are anxiety and depression. And we don't know of anyone who doesn't have a taste of these no matter how well balanced, how well adjusted, how high on pot, or low on Valium, Librium or what have you that they get to be. 4 Revised November 2004 Page 81 of 86"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"When the Brain Tuner is used, does that place someone in a beta state or alpha state or something like that? Not necessarily. It simply addresses the stress-related symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia or addiction, hypertension, you name it. You see 80% of the hospital beds in this country, maybe 100, are occupied with people who have psychosomatic ailments and most of these are now traceable to stress. When you relieve the stress, you're going to reverse that condition. There was a time when they thought that maybe there was one or two diseases that had no stress related syndromes, like cancer. Now, of course, it's been shown that there are vast psychosomatic factors in even that. So the point is you can hardly name any existing condition that is not stress-related. The body has a marvelous ability to heal itself if it has the proper things to work with. And if you relink that body with some of it's normalized neuro-transmitters, they apparently work faster than anything else to normalize the body. Learning Disorders Dr. Hunt has been working with people with dyslexia and she finds that she can resynchronize their left and right hemisphere. This is measured with photo-stimulus. If you flash a strobe light at the closed eyes of a child with dyslexia and measure the evoked potential, the photo-stimulus, that's taken off of the occipital, you'll find that the signal will arrive from one eye at a different time than it will the other. You can see this on an oscilloscope. Which means that the optic nerve is not processing that data coherently. After the Brain Tuner is used, the firing of the neurons are reset, so that they're all marching to the sound of the same drummer—the person can read for a while after that exposure without palming, without going through the usual strategies of a person who is unsynchronized. So, you can call it a brain wave synchronizer, you can call it a gobbledy gook. If it's working don't fix it. Pain Relief The Brain Tuner can be used for pain relief. It's a superb TENS or Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulator. I was going to lunch with Paul at the Ambassador a couple of weeks ago and I tripped over (it was very embarrassing) one of these tire puncturing things and having had about 10 years of judo, I slapped as I was going on to the cement. And I broke, I don't know whether I broke the bone—but this was extremely painful. I couldn't even move it. And I thought \"Holy cow what's the matter with me?\" So I got the Brain Tuner, put it on the area and the next day I had full mobility and no pain. I held the electrodes on my hand for about 10 minutes. So, it's a superb TENS unit. But we don't sell it for that purpose. Meg Patterson, when I first met her, was wearing her brain tuner, the Pharmacon unit in her belt with the electrodes taped on her back. She had low back pain. But you cannot use a TENS unit for a Brain Tuner because there's a DC offset. Any DC above the neck causes small synoptic polarization. Like electrolysis. Do not use a TENS unit as a Brain Tuner but you can use a Brain Tuner as a TENS unit. All hens are chickens, not all chickens are hens. Why Bob Beck did not have his Brain Tuner FDA Approved If this device is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, it will have to have a little label on it that says it is illegal to use, transport, sell, etc., this device without a medical prescription. It will have to go up in price ... the public won't be able to access it, they will have to go to a medical doctor and get a prescription for it. TENS units that cost $5 to build, sell for about $500 to $600. But the doctors say that unless it costs about $500 it isn't medicine. It will be another rip off. If it is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, it will not be accessible by the people who want it—except at a very high price.

MAGAZINE EXCERPT Spectrum The Wholistic News Magazine, January/February 1995 SHOCKING TREATMENT FOR TROUBLED MINDS Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation (CES) has been proved to be an effective, non pharmacological, non toxic therapy for anxiety, depression and insomnia. It works by delivering a soothing, low voltage electrical stimulation to the brain 45 minutes a day via a Sony Walkman type headset resting on both ears. Patients can use CES at home while engaging in other activities, except, of course, for driving or other possibly dangerous activities. Side effects are negligible—users might experience an occasional transitory feeling of light headedness or a mild headache if the unit is turned up too high. Several scientific studies support the effectiveness and safety of CES. In six separate placebo controlled studies of anxiety, 220 hospitalized psychiatric inpatients receiving the treatment for at least 30 minutes per day for three weeks showed a significant lessening of anxiety; compared to controls. Similar studies with depressed patients revealed an average reduction in depression scores of 50%. CES is thought to act by correcting neurotransmitter i mbalances. Scientists discovered that severely depressed patients receiving CES had increased serotonin and norepinephrine blood levels, and normalized serotonin/ betaendorphin and norepinephrine/cholinesterase ratios. Because CES duplicates the biochemical changes of drugs like antidepressants, it usually takes one to four weeks for the therapeutic effect to take hold. Potential applications for CES treatment include addictions, phobias, panic disorder, attention deficit disorder, and cognitive dysfunction. It has also been found quite effective for tension headaches. ( Based on facts presented in: Bridges ISSSEEM Newsmagazine, Winter 1993) Revised November 2002 Page 86 of 86"}]
