He also taught at Princeton and at Harvard. His 1300 page book \"Tragedy and Hope\" is unique among other history books in its exposure of the role of International Banking cabal behind-the-scenes in world affairs. He does not spend a lot of time explaining what he calls \"unorthodox\" financial methods as opposed to \"orthodox\" financial methods which can be be distinguished by the fact that \"orthodox\" finance has governments allowing banks to create the money and then borrowing that money from them at interest to create massive growth of public debt whereas \"unorthodox\" finance has government Treasuries create the money and borrowing that money from the Treasury without interest to create a stable debt where all payments go against the principal. The recurrent theme of these historical texts is the oppression of the poor by the International bankers. When I speak of Rothschild and Rockefeller (R&R), I am treating them as the epitome of the parasitic usurer families for according to the golden rule, those who have the gold makes the rules and throughout most of recent history, the Rothschild and Rockefeller families have been the most prominent owners of the gold. Blame for all the genocides and most murders of recent history can be laid at their feet though it is a responsibility shared by their banker cronies the world over. I know that if Christ came back and had a whip in hand, it's these moneylenders he's go after, once again. Over and over, Quigley details governments acting for the benefits of the owners of money to the detriment of the poor to the point where the poor strike or riot rather than face starvation quietly. Quigley, on a regular basis, mentions orthodox versus unorthodox financial methods without ever detailing the unorthodox methods responsible for the happiness of the citizens though he goes into great depth about the orthodox financial methods which result in such oppressive misery.

THE BUFFER FRINGE Back cover TRAGEDY AND HOPE is a lively, informed and always readable view of our not quite One World of today, seen in historical perspective. Quigley has already shown his command of the kind of historical perspective seen in the a world like that of Toynbee and Spengler; but unlike them he does not so much concern himself with projections from a distant past to a distant future as he does with what must interest us all much more closely - our own future and that of our immediate descendants. He uses the insights, but in full awareness of the limitations of our modern social sciences, and especially those of economics, sociology, and psychology. Not all readers will agree with what he sees ahead of us in the near future, nor with what he thinks we should do about it. But all will find this provocative and sometimes provoking book a stimulus to profitable reflection. David Brinton Inside cover TRAGEDY AND HOPE shows the years 1895-1950 as a period of transition from the world dominated by Europe in the nineteenth century to the world of three blocs in the twentieth century. With clarity, perspective and cumulative impact, Professor Quigley examines the nature of that transition through two world wars and a worldwide economic depression. As an interpretative historian, he tries to show each event in the full complexity of its historical context. The result is a unique work, notable in several ways. It gives a picture of the world in terms of the influence of different cultures and outlooks upon each other; it shows, more completely than in any similar work, the influence of science and technology on human life; and it explains, with unprecedented clarity, how the intricate financial and commercial patterns of the West prior to 1914 influenced the development of today's world. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01.htm (1 of 28)22.5.2005 19:16:40"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Carroll Quigley, professor of history at the Foreign Service School of Georgetown University, formerly taught at Princeton and at Harvard.

CHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION: WESTERN CIVILIZATION IN ITS WORLD SETTING Page 3 Each civilization is born in some inexplicable fashion and, after a slow start, enters a period of vigorous expansion, increasing its size and power, both internally and at the expense of its neighbors, until gradually a crisis of organization appears... It becomes stabilized and eventually stagnant. After a Golden Age of peace and prosperity, internal crises again arise. At this point, there appears for the first time, a moral and physical weakness. Page 5 The passage from the Age of Expansion to the Age of Conflict is the most complex, most interesting and most critical of all periods of the life cycle of a civilization. It is marked by four chief characteristics: it is a period: a) of declining rate of expansion; b) of growing tensions and class conflicts; c) of increasingly frequent and violent imperialist wars; d) of growing irrationality.

This shift from an Age of Conflict to an Age of Expansion is marked by a resumption of the investment of capital and the accumulation of capital on a large scale. In the new Western civilization, a small number of men, equipped and trained to fight, received dues and services from the overwhelming majority of men who were expected to till the soil. From this inequitable but effective defensive system emerged an inequitable distribution of political power and, in turn, an inequitable distribution of the social economic income. This, in time, resulted in an accumulation of capital, which, by giving rise to demand for luxury goods of remote origin, began to shift the whole economic emphasis of the society from its earlier organization in self-sufficient agrarian units to commercial interchange, economic specialization, and, a bourgeois class. Page 9 At the end of the first period of expansion of Western Civilization covering the years 970-1270, the organization of society was becoming a petrified collection of vested interests and entered the Age of Conflict from 1270-1420. In the new Age of Expansion, frequently called the period of commercial capitalism from 1440 to 1680, the real impetus to economic expansion came from efforts to obtain profits by the interchange of goods, especially semi-luxury or luxury goods, over long distances. In time, profits were sought by imposing restrictions on the production or interchange of goods rather than by encouraging these activities. Page 10 The social organization of this third Age of Expansion from 1770- 1929 following upon the second Age of Conflict of 1690-1815 might be called \"industrial capitalism.\" In the last of the nineteenth century, it began to become a structure of vested interests to which we might give the name \"monopoly capitalism.\" We shall undoubtedly get a Universal Empire in which the United States will rule most of the Western Civilization. This will be followed, as in other civilizations, by a period of decay and ultimately, as the civilizations grows weaker, by invasions and the total destruction of Western culture.

As Rousseau said, \"Man is born free yet everywhere he is in chains.\" Obviously, if man is is innately good and needs but to be freed from social restrictions, he is capable of tremendous achievements in this world of time, and does not need to postpone his hopes of personal salvation into eternity. Page 25 To the nineteenth century mind, evil, or sin, was a negative conception. It merely indicated a lack or, at most, a distortion of good. Any idea of sin or evil as a malignant force opposed to good, and capable of existing by its own nature, was completely lacking in the typical nineteenth century mind. The only evil was frustration and the only sin, repression. Just as the negative idea of the nature of evil flowed from the belief that human nature was good, so the idea of liberalism flowed from the belief that society was bad. For, if society was bad,the state,which was the organized coercive power of society, was doubly bad, and if man was good, he should be freed, above all, from the coercive power of the state. \"No government in business\" was commonly called \"laissez faire\" and would have left society with little power beyond that required to prevent the strong from physically oppressing the weak. This strange, and unexamined, belief held that there really existed, in the long run, a \"community of interests\" between the members of a society. It maintained that, in the long run, what was good for one was bad for all. It believed that there did exist a possible social pattern in which each member would be secure, free and prosperous. Page 26 Capitalism was an economic system in which the motivating force was the desire for private profit as determined in a price system with the seeking of aggrandization of profits for each individual. Nationalism served to bind persons of the same nationality together into a tight, emotionally satisfying, unit. On the other side, it served to divide persons of different nationalities into antagonistic groups, often to the injury of their real mutual political, economic or cultural advantages. The event which destroyed the pretty dream world of 1919-1929 were the stock market crash, the world depression, the world financial crisis. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01.htm (4 of 28)22.5.2005 19:16:40"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 28 The twentieth century came to believe that human nature is, if not innately bad, at least capable of being very evil. Left to himself, man falls very easily to the level of the jungle or even lower and this result can be prevent only by the coercive power of society. Along with this change from good men and bad society to bad men and good society has appeared a reaction from optimism to pessimism. The horrors of Hitler's concentration camps and Stalin's slave-labor units are chiefly responsible for this change. CHAPTER II: WESTERN CIVILIZATION TO 1914 WESTERN CIVILIZATION TO 1914 Page 39 The financial capitalist sought profits from the manipulation of claims on money; and the monopoly capitalist sought profits from manipulation of the market to make the market price and the amount sold such that his profits would be maximized. Page 41 Karl Marx,about 1850, formed his ideas of an inevitable class struggle in which the groups of owners would become fewer and fewer and richer and richer while the mass of workers became poorer and poorer but more and more numerous. Mass production required less labor. But mass production required mass consumption. EUROPEAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Page 42 Investments in railroads, steel mills and so on could not be financed from the profits and private fortunes of individual proprietors. New instruments for financing industry came into existence in the form of limited-liability corporations and investment banks. These were soon in a position to control the chief parts of the industrial system since they provided the capital to it. This gave rise to financial capitalism. Page 43 Great industrial units, working together either directly or through cartels and trade associations, were in a position to exploit the majority of the people. The result was a great economic crisis which soon developed into a struggle for control of the state - the minority hoping to use the state to defend their privileged position, the majority hoping to use the state to curtail the power and privileges of the minority. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01.htm (5 of 28)22.5.2005 19:16:40"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Capitalism, because it seems profits as its primary goal, is never primarily seeking to achieve prosperity, high production, high consumption, political power, patriotic improvement, or moral uplift. Page 44 Goods moved from low-price areas to high-price areas and money moved from high-price areas to low-price areas because goods were more valuable where prices were high and money was more valuable where prices were low. Thus, clearly, money and goods are not the same thing but are, on the contrary, exactly opposite things. Most confusion in economic thinking arises from failure to recognize this fact. Goods are wealth which you have, while money is a claim on wealth which you do not have. Thus goods are an asset; money is a debt. If goods are wealth; money is non-wealth, or negative wealth, or even anti-wealth. Page 45 In time, some merchants turned their attention from exchange of goods to the monetary side of the exchange. They became concerned with the lending of money to merchants to finance their ships and their activities, advancing money for both, at high interest rates, secured by claims on ships or goods as collateral for repayment and made it possible for people to concentrate on one portion of the process and, by maximizing that portion, to jeopardize the rest. Page 46 Three parts of the system, production, transfer, and consumption of goods were concrete and clearly visible so that almost anyone could grasp them simply examining them while the operations of banking and finance were concealed, scattered, and abstract so that they appeared to many to be difficult. To add to this, bankers themselves did everything they could to make their activities more secret and more esoteric. Their activities were reflected in mysterious marks in ledgers which were never opened to the curious outsider. Changes of prices, whether inflationary or deflationary, have been major forces in history for the last six centuries at least. Page 47 Hundreds of years ago, bankers began to specialize, with richer and more influential ones associated increasingly with foreign trade and foreign-exchange transactions. Since these were richer and more cosmopolitan and increasingly concerned with questions of political significance, such as stability and debasement of currencies, war and peace, dynastic marriages, and worldwide trading monopolies, they became financiers and financial advisers of governments. Moreover, they were always obsessed with the stability of monetary exchanges and http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01.htm (6 of 28)22.5.2005 19:16:40"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"g$biloxi used their power and influence to do two things: 1) to get all money and debts expressed in terms of strictly limited commodity - ultimately gold; and 2) to get all monetary matters out of the control of governments and political authority, on the ground that they would be handled better by private banking interests in terms of such a stable value of gold. INDUSTRIAL CAPITALISM, 1770-1850 Page 48 Britain's victories had many causes such as its ability to control the sea and its ability to present itself to the world as the defender of the freedoms and rights of small nations and of diverse social and religious groups. Also, financially, England had discovered the secret of credit and economically, it had embarked on the Industrial Revolution. Credit had been known to the Italians and Netherlanders long before it became one of the instruments of English world supremacy. Nevertheless, the founding of the Bank of England by William Paterson and his friends in 1694 is one of the great dates in world history. For generations, men had sought to avoid the one drawback of gold, its heaviness, by using pieces of paper to represent specific pieces of gold. Today, we call such pieces of paper gold certificates which entitles its bearer to exchange it for its piece ofgold on demand, but in view of the convenience of paper, only a small fraction of certificate holders ever did make such demands. It early became clear that gold need be held on hand only to the amount needed to cover the fraction of certificates likely to be presented for payment; accordingly, the rest of the gold could be used for business purposes, or, what amounts to the same thing, a volume of certificates could be issued greater than the volume of gold reserved for payment of demands against them. such an excess volume of paper claims against reserves we now call bank notes. In effect, this creation of paper claims greater than the reserves available means that bankers were creating money out of nothing. The same thing could be done in another way, not by note- issuing banks but by deposit banks. Deposit bankers discovered that orders and checks drawn against deposits by depositors and given to third persons were often not cashed by the latter but were deposited to their own accounts. Thus there were no actual movements of funds, and payments were made simply by bookkeeping transactions on the accounts. Accordingly, it was necessary for the banker to keep on hand in actual money (gold, certificates and notes) no more than the fraction of deposits likely to be drawn upon and cashed; the rest could be used for loans and if these loans were made by creating a deposit for the borrower, who in turn would draw checks upon it rather than withdraw it in money, such \"created deposits\" or loans could also http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01.htm (7 of 28)22.5.2005 19:16:40"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"g$biloxi be covered adequately by retaining reserves to only a fraction of their value. Such created deposits also were a creation of money out of nothing, although bankers usually refused to express their actions, either note issuing or deposit lending, in these terms. William Paterson, on obtaining the charter of the Bank of England, said \"the Bank hath benefit of interest on all moneys it creates out of nothing.\" This is generally admitted today. This organizational structure for creating means of payment out of nothing, which we call credit, was not invented by England but was developed by her to become one of her chief weapons in the victory over Napoleon in 1815. The emperor, could not see money in any but concrete terms, and was convinced that his efforts to fight wars on the basis of \"sound money\" by avoiding the creation of credit, would ultimately win him a victory by bankrupting England. He was wrong although the lesson has had to be relearned by modern financiers in the twentieth century. FINANCIAL CAPITALISM 1850-1931 Page 50 The third stage of capitalism is of such overwhelming significance in the history of the twentieth century, and its ramifications and influences have been so subterranean and even occult, that we may be excused if we devote considerate attention to this organization and methods. Essentially, what it did was to take the old disorganized and localized methods of handling money and credit and organize them into an integrated system, on an international basis, which worked with incredible and well-oiled facility for many decades. The center of that system was in London, with major offshoots in New York and Paris and it has left, as its greatest achievement, an integrated banking system and a heavily capitalized - if now largely obsolescent - framework of heavy industry, reflected in railroads, steel mills, coal mines and electrical utilities. This system had its center in London for four chief reasons. First was the great volume of savings in England. Second was England's oligarchic social structure which provided a very inequitable distribution of incomes with large surpluses coming to the control of a small, energetic upper class. Third was that this upper class was aristocratic but not noble, quite willing to recruit both money and ability from lower levels and even from outside the country, welcoming American heiresses and central-European Jews to its ranks almost as willingly as it welcomed monied, able and conformist recruits from the lower classes of Englishmen. Fourth (and by no means last) in significance was the skill in financial manipulation, especially on the international scene, which the small group of merchant bankers of http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01.htm (8 of 28)22.5.2005 19:16:40"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"g$biloxi London had acquired. In time, they brought into their financial network the provincial banking centers as well as insurance companies to form all of these into a single financial system on an international scale which manipulated the quantity and flow of money so that they were able to influence, if not control, governments on one side and industries on the other. The men who did this, looking backward toward the period of dynastic monarchy in which they had their own roots, aspired to establish dynasties of international bankers and were at least as successful at this as were many of the dynastic political rulers. The greatest of these dynasties, of course, were the descendants of Meyer Amschel Rothschild (1743-1812) whose male descendants for at least two generations, generally married first cousins or even nieces. Rothschild's five sons, established at branches in Vienna, London, Naples and Paris as well as Frankfort, cooperated together in ways which other international banking dynasties copied but rarely excelled. In concentrating, as we must, on the financial or economic activities of international bankers, we must not totally ignore their other attributes. They were cosmopolitan rather than nationalistic; they were a constant, if weakening, influence for peace, a pattern established in 1830 and 1840 when the Rothschilds threw their whole tremendous influence successfully against European wars. They were usually highly civilized, cultured gentlemen, patrons of education and of the arts, so that today, colleges, professorships, opera companies, symphonies, libraries, and museum collections still reflect their munificence. For these purposes they set a pattern of endowed foundations which still surround us today. The names of some of these banking families are familiar to all of us and should be more so. They include Baring, Lazard, Erlanger, Warburg, Schroder, Seligman, Speyers, Mirabaud, Mallet, Fould and above all Rothschild and Morgan. Even after these banking families became fully involved in domestic industry by the emergence of financial capitalism, they remained different from ordinary bankers in distinctive ways: 1) they were cosmopolitan and international; 2) they were close to governments and were particularly concerned with questions of government debts, including foreign government debts, even in areas which seemed, at first glance, poor risks, like Egypt, Persia, Ottoman Turkey, Imperial China and Latin America; 3) their interests were almost exclusively in bonds and very rarely in goods since they admired \"liquidity\"; 4) they were fanatical devotees of deflation (which they called \"sound\" money from its close association with high interest rates and a high value of money) and of the gold standard; http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01.htm (9 of 28)22.5.2005 19:16:40"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"g$biloxi 5) they were almost equally devoted to secrecy and the secret use of financial influence in political life. These bankers came to be called \"international bankers\" and were known as \"merchant bankers\" in England, \"private bankers\" in France and \"investment bankers\" in the United States. Everywhere, they were sharply distinguishable from other, more obvious, kinds of banks, such as savings banks or commercial banks. One of their less obvious characteristics was that they remained as private unincorporated firms offering no shares, no reports, and usually no advertising to the public until modern inheritance taxes made it essential to surround such family wealth with the immortality of corporate status for tax-avoidance purposes. This persistence as private firms continued because it ensured the maximum of anonymity and secrecy to persons of tremendous public power who dreaded public knowledge of their activities as an evil almost as great as inflation. Page 53 Firms like Morgan, like others of the international banking fraternity, constantly operated through corporations and governments, yet remained itself an obscure private partnership. The influence of financial capitalism and the international bankers who created it was exercised both on business and on governments, but could have neither if it had not been able to persuade both these to accept two \"axioms\" of its own ideology. Both of these were based on the assumption that politicians were too weak and too subject to temporary public pressures to be trusted with control of the money system; accordingly, the soundness of money must be protected in two ways: by basing the value of money on gold and by allowing bankers to control the money supply. To do this it was necessary to conceal, even mislead, both governments and people about the nature of money and its methods of operation. Page 54 Since it is quite impossible to understand the history of the twentieth century without some understanding of the role played by money in domestic affairs and in foreign affairs, as well as the role played by bankers in economic life and in political life, we must take a least a glance at each of these four subjects: DOMESTIC FINANCIAL PRACTICES In each country, the supply of money took the form of an inverted pyramid or cone balanced on its point. In the point was the supply of gold and its equivalent certificates; on the intermediate levels was a much larger supply of notes; and at the top, with an open and expandable upper surface, was an even greater supply of deposits. Each level used the levels below it as its reserves and these lower levels http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01.htm (10 of 28)22.5.2005 19:16:40"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"g$biloxi had smaller quantities of money, they were \"sounder.\" Notes were issued by \"banks of emission\" or \"banks of issue\" and were secured by reserves of gold or certificates held in some central reserve. The fraction held in reserve depended upon banking regulations or statute law. Such banks, even central banks, were private institutions, owned by shareholders who profited by their operations. Deposits on the upper level of the pyramid were called by this name, with typical bankers' ambiguity, in spite of the fact that they consisted of two utterly different kinds of relationships: 1) \"lodged deposits\" which were real claims left by a depositor in a bank on which a depositor might receive interest; and 2) \"created deposits\" which were claims created by the bank out of nothing as loans from the bank to \"depositors\" who had to pay interest on them. Both form part of the money supply. Lodged deposits as a form of savings are deflationary while created deposits, being an addition to the money supply, are inflationary. Page 55 The volume of deposits banks can create, like the amount of notes they can issue, depends upon the volume of reserves available to pay whatever fraction of checks are cashed rather than deposited. In the United States, deposits were traditionally limited to ten times reserves notes and gold. In Britain it was usually nearer twenty times such reserves. In most countries, the central bank was surrounded closely by the almost invisible private investment banking firms. These, like the planet Mercury, could hardly be seen in the dazzle emitted by the central bank, which they, in fact, often dominated. Yet a lost observer could hardly fail to notice the close private associations between these private, international bankers and the central bank itself. In France, in 1936, the Board of the Bank of France was still dominated by the names of the families who had originally set it up in 1800. In England, a somewhat similar situation existed. In a secondary ring are the \"joint stock banks.\" Outside this secondary ring are the savings banks, insurance firms, and trust companies. In France and England the private bankers exercised their powers through the central bank and had much more influence on the government and foreign policy and less on industry. In the United States, much industry was financed by investment bankers directly and the power of these both on industry and government was very great. Page 57 The various parts of the pyramid of money were but loosely related to each other. Much of this looseness arose from the fact that http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01.htm (11 of 28)22.5.2005 19:16:40"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"g$biloxi the controls were compulsive in a deflationary direction and were only permissive in an inflationary direction. This last point can be seen in the fact that the supply of gold could be decreased but could hardly be increased. If an ounce of gold was added to the point of the pyramid, it could permit an increase in deposits equivalent to $2067 on the uppermost level. If such an ounce of gold were withdrawn from a fully expanded pyramid of money, this would compel a reduction of deposits by at least this amount, probably by a refusal to renew loans. Throughout modern history, the influence of the gold standard has been deflationary, because the natural output of gold each year, except in extraordinary times, has not kept pace with the increase in the output of goods. Only new supplies of gold or the development of new kinds of money have saved our civilization over the last couple of centuries. The three great periods of war ended with an extreme deflationary crisis (1819, 1873, 1921) as the influential Money Power persuaded governments to re-establish a deflationary monetary unit with a high gold content. The obsession of the Money Power with deflation was partly a result of their concern with money rather than with goods but was also founded on other factors, one of which was paradoxical. The paradox arose from the fact that the basic economic conditions of the nineteenth century were deflationary, with a monetary system based on gold and an industrial system pouring out increasing supplies of goods but in spite of falling prices, the interest rate tended to fall rather than rise. Moreover, merchant banking continued to emphasize bonds rather than equity securities (stocks), to favor government issues rather than private offerings. Another paradox of banking practice arose from the fact that bankers, who loved deflation, often acted in an inflationary fashion from their eagerness to lend money at interest. Since they make money out of loans, they are eager to increase the amounts of bank credit on loan. But this is inflationary. The conflict between the deflationary ideas and inflationary practices of bankers had profound repercussions on business. The bankers made loans to business so that the volume of money increased faster than the increase of goods. The result was inflation. When this became clearly noticeable, the bankers would flee to notes or specie by curtailing credit and raising discount rates. This was beneficial to the bankers in the short run (since it allowed them to foreclose on collateral for loans) but it could be disastrous to them in the long run (by forcing the value of the collateral below the amount of the loans it secured). But such bankers' deflation was destructive to business and industry in the short run as well as the long run.

Central banks can usually vary the amount of money in circulation by \"open market operations\" or by influencing the discount rates of lesser banks. In open market operations, a central bank buys or sells government bonds in the open market. If it buys, it releases money into the economic system; it if sells it reduces the amount of money in the community. If the Federal Reserve Bank buys, it pays for these by checks which are soon deposited in a bank. It thus increases this bank's reserves with the Federal Reserve Bank. Since banks are permitted to issue loans for several times the value of their reserves with the FED, such a transaction permits them to issue loans for a much larger sum. Central banks can also change the quantity of money by raising the discount rate which forces the lesser banks to raise their discount rates; such a raise in interest rates tends to reduce the demand for credit and thus the amount of deposits (money). Lowering the discount rate permits an opposite result. It is noted that the control of the central bank over the credit policies of local banks are permissive in one direction and compulsive in the other. They can compel these local banks to curtail credit and can only permit them to increase credit. This means that they have control powers against inflation and not deflation - a reflection of the old banking idea that inflation was bad and deflation was good. Page 60 The powers of governments over the quantity of money are: a) control over a central bank; b) control over public taxation; c) control over public spending; Since most central banks have been (technically) private institutions, this control is frequently based on custom rather than on law. Taxation tends to reduce the amount of money in a community and is usually a deflationary force. Government spending is usually an inflationary force. On the whole, in the period up to 1931, bankers, especially the Money Power controlled by the international investment bankers, were able to dominate both business and government. They could dominate business because investment bankers had the ability to supply or refuse to supply such capital. Thus Rothschild interests came to dominate many of the railroads of Europe, while Morgan dominated at least 26,000 miles of American railroads. Such bankers took seats on the boards of directors of industrial firms, as they had already done http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01.htm (13 of 28)22.5.2005 19:16:40"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"g$biloxi on commercial banks, savings banks, insurance firms, and finance companies. From these lesser institutions, they funneled capital to enterprises which yielded control and away from those who resisted. These firms were controlled through interlocking directorships, holding companies, and lesser banks. Page 61 As early as 1909,Walter Rathenau said, \"Three hundred men, all of whom know one another, direct the economic destiny of Europe and choose their successors from among themselves.\" The power of investment bankers over governments rests on the need of governments to issue short-term treasury bills as well as long-term government bonds. Just as businessmen go to commercial banks for current capital advances, so a government has to go to merchant bankers to tide over the shallow places caused by irregular tax receipts. As experts in government bonds, the international bankers provided advice to government officials and, on many occasions, placed their own members in official posts. This was so widely accepted even today, that in 1961 a Republican investment banker became Secretary of the Treasury in a Democratic administration in Washington without significant comment from any direction. Naturally, the influence of bankers over governments during the age of financial capitalism (roughly 1850-1931) was not something about which anyone talked about freely, but it has been admitted freely enough by those on the inside, especially in England. In 1842, Gladstone, chancellor of the Exchequer, declared \"The hinge of the whole situation was this: the government itself was not to be the substantive power in matters of Finance, but was to leave the Money Power supreme and unquestioned.\" On Sept. 26, 1921, the Financial Times wrote, \"Half a dozen men at the top of the Big Five Banks could upset the whole fabric of government finance by refraining from renewing Treasury Bills.\" In 1924, Sir Drummond Fraser, vice-president of the Institute of Bankers, stated, \"The Governor of the Bank of England must be the autocrat who dictates the terms upon which alone the Government can obtain borrowed money.\" Page 62 In addition to their power over government based on government financing and personal influence, bankers could steer governments in ways they wished them to go by other pressures. Since most government officials felt ignorant of finance, they sought advice from bankers whom they considered experts in the field. The history of the last century shows that the advice given to governments by bankers, like the advice they gave to industrialists, was consistently good for bankers but was often disastrous for governments, businessmen and the people generally. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01.htm (14 of 28)22.5.2005 19:16:40"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Such advice could be enforced if necessary by manipulation of exchanges, gold flows, discount rates, and even levels of business activity. Thus Morgan dominated Cleveland's second administration by gold withdrawals, and in 1936-13 French foreign exchange manipulators paralyzed the Popular Front governments. The powers of these international bankers reached their peak in 1919-1931 when Montagu Norman and J.P. Morgan dominated not only the financial world but international relations and other matters as well. On Nov. 11, 1927, the Wall Street Journal called Mr. Norman \"the currency dictator of Europe.\" This was admitted by Mr. Norman who said, \"I hold the hegemony of the world.\" The conflict of interests between bankers and industrialists has resulted in the subordination of the bankers (after 1931) to the latter by the adoption of \"unorthodox financial policies\" - that is, financial policies not in accordance with the short-run interests of the bankers. THE UNITED STATES TO 1917 Page 71 The civil service reform began in the federal government with the Pendleton Bill of 1883. As a result, the government was controlled with varying degrees of completeness by the forces of investment banking and heavy industry from 1884 to 1933. Popularly known as \"Society,\" or the \"400,\" they lived a life of dazzling splendor. Page 72 The structure of financial control created by the tycoons of \"Big Banking\" and \"Big Business\" in the period 1880-1933 was of extraordinary complexity, one business fief being built upon another, both being allied with semi-independent associates, the whole rearing upward into two pinnacles of economic and financial power, of which one, centered in New York, was headed by J.P. Morgan and Company, and the other, in Ohio, was headed by the Rockefeller family. When these two cooperated, as they generally did, they could influence the economic life of the country to a large degree and could almost control its political life, at least on the federal level. The influence of these business leaders was so great that the Morgan and Rockefeller groups acting together, or even Morgan acting alone, could have wrecked the economic system of the country merely by throwing securities on the stock market for sale, and having precipitated a stock market panic, could then have bought back the securities they had sold but at a lower price. Naturally, they were not so foolish as to do this, although Morgan came very close to it in precipitating the \"panic of 1907,\" but they did not hesitate to wreck individual corporations, at the expense of holders of common stock, by driving them to bankruptcy. In this way, Morgan wrecked the New York, http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01.htm (15 of 28)22.5.2005 19:16:40"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"g$biloxi New Haven and Hartford railroad before 1914 and William Rockefeller wrecked the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad before 1925. Page 73 The discovery by financial capitalists that they made money out of issuing and selling securities rather than out of production, distribution and consumption of goods accordingly led them to the point where they discovered that the exploiting of an operating company by excessive issuance of securities or the issuance of bonds rather than equity securities not only was profitable to them but made it possible for them to increase their profits by bankruptcy of the firm, providing fees and commission of reorganization as well as the opportunity to issue new securities. When the business interests pushed through the first installment of the civil service reform in 1881, they expected to control both political parties equally. Some intended to contribute to both and to allow an alternation of the two parties in public office in order to conceal their own influence, inhibit any exhibition of independence by politicians, and allow the electorate to believe that they were exercising their own free choice. The inability of the investment bankers to control the Democratic Party Convention of 1896 was a result of the agrarian discontent of the period 1868-1896. This discontent was based very largely on the monetary tactics of the banking oligarchy. The bankers were wedded to the gold standard and at the end of the Civil War, persuaded the Grant administration to curb the postwar inflation and go back on the gold standard (crash of 1873 and resumption of specie payment in 1875). Page 74 This gave the bankers a control of the supply of money which they did not hesitate to use for their own purposes. The bankers' affection for low prices was not shared by farmers, since each time prices of farm products went down, the burden of farmers' debts became greater. As farmers could not reduce their costs or modify their production plans, the result was a systematic exploitation of the agrarian sectors of the community by the financial and industrial sectors. This exploitation took the form of high industrial prices and discriminatory railroad rates, high interest charges, low farm prices and very low level of farm services. Unable to resist by economic weapons, the farmers turned to political relief. They tried to work on the state political level through local legislation (so-called Granger Laws) and set up third- party movements (like the Greenback Party of 1878 or the Populist Party in 1892). By 1896, the capture of the Democratic Party by the forces of discontent under William Jennings Bryant who was determined http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01.htm (16 of 28)22.5.2005 19:16:40"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"g$biloxi to obtain higher prices by increasing the supply of money on a bimetallic rather than a gold basis, presented the electorate with an election on a social and economic issue for the first time in a generation. Though the forces of high finance were in a state of near panic, by a mighty effort involving very large-scale spending they were successful in electing McKinley. Though the plutocracy were unable to control the Democratic Party as they controlled the Republican Party, they did not cease their efforts to control both and in 1904 and 1924, Morgan was able to sit back with a feeling of satisfaction to watch presidential elections in which the candidates of both parties were in his sphere of influence. Page 75 The agrarian discontent, the growth of monopolies, the oppression of labor, and the excesses of Wall Street financiers made the country very restless between 1890-1900. All this could have been alleviated merely by increasing the supply of money sufficiently to raise prices somewhat, but the financiers were determined to defend the gold standard no matter what happened. In looking for some issue to distract public discontent from domestic issues, what better solution than a crisis in foreign affairs? Cleveland had stumbled upon this alternative in 1895 when he stirred up controversy with England over Venezuela. The great opportunity came with the Cuban revolt against Spain in 1895. While the \"yellow press\" roused public opinion, Henry Cabot Lodge and Theodore Roosevelt plotted how they could best get the United States into the fracas. They got the excuse they needed when the American battleship Maine was sunk by a mysterious explosion in Havana Harbor in 1898. In two months, the United States declared war on Spain to fight for Cuban independence. The resulting victory revealed the United States as a world naval power, established it as an imperialist power with possession of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. America's entrance upon the stage as a world power continued with the annexation of Hawaii in 1898, the intervention in the Boxer uprising in 1900, the seizure of the Panama canal in 1903, the diplomatic intervention in the Russo-Japanese war in 1905, the military occupation of Nicaragua in 1912, the military intervention in Mexico in 1916. Page 76 As an example of the more idealistic impulse we might mention the creation of various Carnegie foundations to work for universal peace. As an example of the more practical point of view, we might mention the founding of \"The New Republic,\" a liberal weekly paper, by an agent of Morgan financed with Whitney money (1914).

Wilson roused a good deal of popular enthusiasm with his talk of \"New Freedom\" and the rights of the underdog, but his program amounted to little more than an amateur attempt to establish on a federal basis those reforms which agrarian and labor discontent had been seeking on a state basis for many years. Wilson was by no means a radical and there was a good deal of unconscious hypocrisy in many of his resounding public speeches. His political and administrative reforms were a good deal more effective than his economic or social reforms. The establishment of an income tax and the Federal Reserve System justified the support which Progressives had given to Wilson. Wilson did much to extend equality of opportunity to wider groups of American people. CHAPTER III: THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE TO 1917 Page 88 The abolition of serfdom made it necessary for the landed nobility to cease to regard the peasants as private property. Peter the Great (1689-1725) and Catherine the Great (1762-1796) were supporters of westernization and reform. Paul I (1796-1801) was reactionary. Alexander I (1801-1825) and Alexander II (1855-1881) were reformers while Nicholas I (1825-1855) and Nicholas II (1855-1881) were reactionaries. By 1864, serfdom had been abolished, and a fairly modern system of law, of justice, and of education had been established; local government had been somewhat modernized; a fairly good financial and fiscal system had been established; and an army based on universal military service (but lacking in equipment) had been created. On the other hand, the autocracy continued in the hands of weak men and the freed serfs had no adequate lands. Page 93 The first Russian railroad opened in 1838 but growth was slow until 1857. At that time, there were only 663 miles of railroads, but this figure went up over tenfold by 1871, doubled again by 1881 with 14,000 miles, reached 37,000 by 1901 and 46,000 by 1915. Page 94 In 1900, Russia had 48% of the total world production of petroleum products. The State Bank was made a bank of issue in 1897 and was required by law to redeem its notes in gold, thus placing Russia on the international gold standard.

He was assassinated in the presence of the Tsar in 1911. The fourth duma (1912-1916) was elected by universal suffrage. CHAPTER IV: THE BUFFER FRINGE THE NEAR EAST TO 1914 Page 111 The Ottoman Empire was divided into 21 governments and subdivided into seventy vilayets, each under a pasha. The supreme ruler in Constantinople was not only sultan (head of the empire) but was also caliph (defender of the Muslim creed). Page 121 The Great Powers showed mild approval of the Baghdad Railway until about 1900. Then, for more than ten years, Russia, Britain and France showed violent disapproval and did all they could the obstruct the project. They described the Baghdad Railway as the emerging wedge of German imperialist aggression seeking to weaken and destroy the Ottoman Empire and the stakes of the other powers in the area. Page 122 The Germans were not only favorably inclined toward Turkey; their conduct seems to have been completely fair in regard the administration of the railway itself. At a time when the American and other railways were practicing wholesale discrimination between customers, the Germans had the same rates and same treatment for all, including Germans and non-Germans. They worked to make the railroad efficient and profitable although their income from it was guaranteed by the Turkish government. In consequence, the Turkish payments to the railroad steadily declined, and the government was able to share in its profits to the extent of almost three million francs in 1914. Moreover, the Germans did not seek to monopolize control of the railroad, offering to share equally with France and England and http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01.htm (19 of 28)22.5.2005 19:16:40"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"g$biloxi eventually with the other Powers. France accepted this offer in 1899, but Britain continued to refuse and placed every obstacle in the path of the project. When the Ottoman government sought to raise their customs duties from 11% to 14% in order to continue construction, Britain prevented this. In order to carry on the project, the Germans sold their railroad interests in the Balkans and gave the Ottoman building subsidy of $275,000 a kilometer. In striking contrast, the Russians demanded arrears of 57 million francs under the Treaty of 1878. The French, in spite of investments in Turkey, refused to allow Baghdad Railway securities to be handled on the Paris Stock Exchange. Page 123 In 1903, Britain made an agreement for a joint German, French, and British control of the railroad. Within three weeks this agreement was repudiated because of newspaper protests against it. When the Turkish government tried to borrow, it was summarily rebuffed in Paris and London, but obtained the sum unhesitatingly in Berlin. The growth of German prestige and the decline in favor of the Western Powers at the sultan's court is not surprising and goes far to explain the Turkish intervention on the side of the Central powers in the war of 1914-1919. Britain withdrew her opposition to the Baghdad Railway in return for promises that: 1) it would not be extended to the Persian Gulf; 2) British capitalists would be given a monopoly on the navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers and exclusive control over their irrigation projects; 3) 2 British subjects would be given seats on the Board of directors; 4) Britain would have exclusive control over commercial activities in Kuwait, the only good port on the upper Persian Gulf; 5) a monopoly over the oil resources given to a new corporation: Royal Dutch Shell Company in which British held half interest, the Germans and French a quarter interest each; THE BRITISH IMPERIAL CRISIS TO 1926 Page 127 In England, the landed class obtained control of the bar and the bench and were, thus, in a position to judge all disputes about real property in their favor. Control of the courts and of the Parliament made it possible for this ruling group to override the rights of peasants in land, to eject them from the land, to enclose the open fields of the medieval system, to deprive the cultivators of their manorial rights and thus reduce them to the condition of landless rural laborers or tenants. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01.htm (20 of 28)22.5.2005 19:16:40"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 130 Until 1870, there was no professorships of Fine Arts at Oxford, but in that year, thanks to a bequest,John Ruskin was named to such a chair. He hit Oxford like an earthquake, not so much because he talked about fine arts but because he talked about the empire and England's downtrodden masses as moral issues. Until the end of the nineteenth century, the poverty-stricken masses in the cities lived in want, ignorance and crime much like described by Charles Dickens. Ruskin spoke to the Oxford undergraduates as members of the privileged ruling class. He told them that they were the possessors of a magnificent tradition of education, beauty, rule of law, freedom, decency, and self-discipline but that this tradition could not be saved and did not deserve to be saved, unless it could be extended to the lower classes and to the non-English masses throughout the world. If not extended to these classes, the minority upper-class would be submerged and the tradition lost. Ruskin's message had a sensational impact. His inaugural lecture was copied out in longhand by one undergraduate, Cecil Rhodes. Rhodes feverishly exploited the diamond and gold fields of South Africa, rose to be prime minister of Cape Colony, contributed money to political parties, controlled parliamentary seats both in England and South Africa. With financial support from Lord Rothschild, he was able to monopolize the diamond mines as De Beers Mines and Gold Fields. In the mid 1890s, Rhodes had a personal income of a least a million pounds (then five million dollars) a year which was spent so freely for his mysterious purposes that he was usually overdrawn on his account. These purposes centered on his desire to federate the English-speaking peoples and to bring all the habitable portions of the world under their control. Page 131 Among Ruskin's most devoted disciples at Oxford were a group of intimate friends who devoted the rest of their lives to carrying out his ideas. They were remarkably successful in these aims. In 1891, Rhodes organized a secret society with members in a \"Circle of Initiates\" and an outer circle known as the \"Association of Helpers\" later organized as the Round Table organization. Page 132 In 1909-1913, they organized semi-secret groups know as Round Table Groups in the chief British dependencies and the United States. In 1919, they founded the Royal Institute of International Affairs. Similar Institutes of International Affairs were established in the chief British dominions and the United States where it is known as the Council on Foreign Relations.

Page 137 By 1895, the Transvaal Republic presented an acute problem. All political control was in the hands of a rural, backward, Bible- reading, racist minority of Boers while all economic wealth was in the hands of a violent, aggressive majority of foreigners, (Utlanders) most of whom lived in Johannesburg. The Utlanders, who were twice as numerous and owned two thirds of the land and nine-tenths of the wealth of the country, were prevented from participating in political life or from becoming citizens (except after 14 years residence) and were irritated by President Paul Kruger's intriguing to obtain some kind of German intervention and protection. At this point, Rhodes made his plans to overthrow Kruger's government by an uprising in Johannesburg, financed by himself and led by his brother Frank, followed by an invasion led by Frank Jameson from Rhodesia. Flora Shaw used The Times to prepare public opinion in England while others negotiated for the official support necessary. When the revolt fizzled, Jameson raided anyway and was easily captured by the Boers. The public officials involved denounced the plot, loudly proclaimed their surprise at the event, and were able to whitewash most of the participants in the subsequent parliamentary inquiry. A telegram from the German Kaiser to Kruger congratulating him on his success \"in preserving the independence of his country,\" was built up by The Times into an example of brazen German interference in British affairs, and almost eclipsed Jameson's http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01.htm (22 of 28)22.5.2005 19:16:40"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"g$biloxi aggression.

Propaganda, most of it true about the plight of the Utlanders flooded England from Flora Shaw. Milner was made British High Commissioner to South Africa; his friend Brett worked his way into the confidence of the monarchy to become its chief political advisor. Milner made provocative British troop movements on the Boer frontiers in spite of the vigorous protests of his commanding general in South Africa, who had to be removed; and finally, war was precipitated when Smuts drew up an ultimatum insisting that the British troop movements cease and when this was rejected by Milner. Page 138 The Boer War (1899-1902) was one of the most important events in British imperial history. The ability of 40,000 Boer farmers to hold off ten times as many British for three years, inflicting a series of defeats on them over that period, destroyed faith in British power. Although the Boer republics were defeated and annexed in 1902, Britain's confidence was so shaken that it made a treaty with Japan providing that if either became engaged in war with two enemies in the Far East, the other would come to the rescue. This treaty allowed Japan to attack Russia in 1904. Page 138 Milner's group, known as \"Milner's Kindergarten\" reorganized the government. By 1914, the Smuts government passed a law excluding natives from most semi-skilled or skilled work or any high-paying positions. Page 139 By the Land Act of 1913, 7% was reserved for purchases by natives and the other 93% by whites. The wages of natives were about one tenth of those of whites. Page 141 These natives lived on inadequate and eroded reserves or in horrible urban slums and were drastically restricted in movements, residence, or economic opportunities and had almost no political or even civil rights. By 1950 in Johannesburg, 90,000 Africans were crowded into 600 acres of shacks with no sanitation with almost no running water and denied all opportunity except for animal survival and reproduction.

Although this project has not been achieved, it provides the key to Britain's native policies from 1917 onward.

This was blocked by the Kindergarten because they considered reconciliation with the Boers to be more urgent. In South Africa, the three native protectorates of Swaziland, Bechuanaland, and Basutoland were retained by the imperial authorities as areas where native rights were paramount and where tribal forms of living could be maintained at least partially.

Forty years later, it had about 4 million blacks and only 30,000 whites. The healthful highlands were reserved for white ownership as early as 1908. The native reserves had five times as much land although they had 150 times as many people. The whites tried to increase the pressure on natives to work on white farms rather than to seek to make a living on their own lands within the reserves, by forcing them to pay taxes in cash, by curtailing the size or quality of the reserves, by restricting improvements in native agricultural techniques and by personal and political pressure and compulsion. The real crux of the controversy before the Mau Mau uprising of 1948-1955 was the problem of self-government; Pointing to South Africa, the settlers in Kenya demanded self-rule which would allow them to enforce restrictions on non-whites. Page 151 From this controversy came a compromise which gave Kenya a Legislative Council containing representatives of the imperial government, the white settlers, the Indians, the Arabs, and a white missionary to represent the blacks. Most were nominated rather than elected but by 1949, only the official and Negro members were nominated.

Although slavery was abolished in 1843, many of the poor were reduced to peonage by contracting debts at unfair terms and binding themselves and their heirs to work for their creditors until the debt was paid. Such a debt could never be paid, in many cases, because the rate at which it was reduced was left to the creditor and could rarely be questioned by the illiterate debtor.

THE FAR EAST TO WORLD WAR I THE COLLAPSE OF CINA TO 1920 Page 176 The destruction of traditional Chinese culture under the impact of Western Civilization was considerably later than the similar destruction of Indian culture by Europeans The upper-most group derived its income as tribute and taxes from its possession of military and political power the middle group derived its incomes from sources such as interest on loans, rents from lands and the profits from commercial enterprises. Although the peasants were clearly an exploited group, this exploitation was impersonal and traditional and thus more easily borne. Page 179 Only in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century did peasants in China come to regard their positions as so hopeless that violence became preferable to diligence or conformity. This change arose from the fact that the impact of Western culture on China did, in fact, make a peasant's position economically hopeless. Page 180 Chinese society was too weak to defend itself against the West. When it tried to do so, as in the Opium Wars of 1840-1861 or in the Boxer uprising of 1900, such Chinese resistance to European penetration was crushed by armaments of the Western Powers and all kinds of concessions to these Powers were imposed on China. Until 1841, Canton was the only port allowed for foreign imports and opium was illegal. As a consequence of Chinese destruction of illegal Indian opium and the commercial exactions of Cantonese authorities, Britain imposed on China the treaties of Nanking (1842) and of Tientsin (1858). These forced China to cede Hong Kong to Britain and to open sixteen ports to foreign trade, to impose a uniform import tariff of no more than 5%, to pay an indemnity of about $100 million, to permit foreign legations in Peking, to allow a British official to act as head of the Chinese customs service, and to legalize the import of opium.

It becomes stabilized and eventually stagnant. After a Golden Age of peace and prosperity, internal crises again arise. At this point, there appears for the first time, a moral and physical weakness. JCT: I think it is interesting that Quigley has civilizations arising \"in some inexplicable fashion\" whereas Astle suggests they arise when a money system develops to allow the allocation of saved surpluses among citizens. I have to agree that civilization cannot arise without such a monetary mechanism though societies which barter their surpluses may also be called civilizations though not what I'd call an advanced civilization. So I accept Astle's suggestion that a money system for allocation of surpluses is a necessary mechanism for any advanced civilization to arise. I find Quigley's assumption interesting that a crisis of organization must inevitably appear. It is true that according to David Astle, there have been many stabilized civilizations which were unstabilized once usury and moneylending were introduced. Since most of unrecorded history comprises those stables societies and since most of recorded history comprises those unstable societies, it's understandable that Quigley's studies of recorded history would think these unstable effects are inevitable by-products of civilization. I suggest that they are inevitable by-products of usury which creates a death-gamble mortgage between its citizens and out of the death by poverty of its citizens comes the inevitable crises. I also accept that all civilizations which arise on all planets in the universe will inevitably develop money systems and inevitably be infected with usury which arises logically out of periods of scarcity. Page 5 The passage from the Age of Expansion to the Age of Conflict is the most complex, most interesting and most critical of all periods of the life cycle of a civilization.

JCT: See, class conflicts only arise when there exists the usury function to separate citizens into the two classes, those who have abundance and get even more and those who have no abundance and have it taken away. That such a system is irrational is a given though its irrationality is unseen by the great majority of its victims. One need only study my Essence of Money debates with Professor Flaherty at my web site to see how supposedly intelligent people can be reduced to blathering contradicters who don't even realize they are contradicting themselves. I don't think there's an easier proof of this growing irrationality than to have people who don't realize, according to Orwell's doublethink, can believe to contradictory points of view at the same time. I honestly do believe that the brain has to be damaged in order that two contradictory points of view can both be held as true and those debates show quite clearly that the study of Economics does indeed damage their brains of their students. It's not for nothing Christ said that when it comes to usury, \"they will forever be hearing without hearing and seeing without seeing or understanding,\" while Mohammed said that those who devour usury are as as stands one whom the Evil One by his touch hath driven to madness.\" One might think that Christ and Mohammed were using hyperbole when saying that money-lovers have been driven to madness but I have no doubt that historians will use Professor Flaherty's contradictions to demonstrate the madness incurred from studying Economics and learning to love money. Page 8 When we consider the untold numbers of other societies, simpler than civilizations, which Western Civilization has destroyed or is now destroying, the full frightening power of Western Civilization becomes obvious. JCT: But note that Western Civilization usually destroyed these other civilizations in the quest for gold after being tricked into usurious debt by the Rothschilds and Rockefellers of their day. I don't think destroying neighbor civilizations is an inevitable function of humanity though it is an inevitable function of a humanity which must always expand to pay its expanding debt. This shift from an Age of Conflict to an Age of Expansion is marked by a resumption of the investment of capital and the accumulation of capital on a large scale. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01a.htm (2 of 30)22.5.2005 19:17:01"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"g$biloxi JCT: So all it takes is for the money-lenders to loosen the purse strings and resume investment to permit an Age of expansion. If the world-owners choose not to resume investment, the nations of the world remain in a condition of conflict in the death-gamble fight to survive bank foreclosure. In the new Western civilization, a small number of men, equipped and trained to fight, received dues and services from the overwhelming majority of men who were expected to till the soil. From this inequitable but effective defensive system emerged an inequitable distribution of political power and, in turn, an inequitable distribution of the social economic income. This, in time, resulted in an accumulation of capital, which, by giving rise to demand for luxury goods of remote origin, began to shift the whole economic emphasis of the society from its earlier organization in self-sufficient agrarian units to commercial interchange, economic specialization, and, a bourgeois class. JCT: Notice that a \"defensive system\" was necessary for this need for an professional army to arise. It's fair to assume that usury was well installed to necessitate such defences from their neighbors. Page 9 At the end of the first period of expansion of Western Civilization covering the years 970-1270, the organization of society was becoming a petrified collection of vested interests and entered the Age of Conflict from 1270-1420. In the new Age of Expansion, frequently called the period of commercial capitalism from 1440 to 1680, the real impetus to economic expansion came from efforts to obtain profits by the interchange of goods, especially semi-luxury or luxury goods, over long distances. In time, profits were sought by imposing restrictions on the production or interchange of goods rather than by encouraging these activities. JCT: So the real push in the new Age of Expansion came from the growth of middlemen profits who sought not to increase production but to decrease it while they sought a monopoly. Page 10 The social organization of this third Age of Expansion from 1770-1929 following upon the second Age of Conflict of 1690-1815 might be called \"industrial capitalism.\" In the last of the nineteenth century, it began to become a structure of vested interests to which we might give the name \"monopoly capitalism.\" We shall undoubtedly get a Universal Empire in which the United States will rule most of the Western Civilization. This will be followed, as in other civilizations, by a period of decay and ultimately, as the civilizations grows weaker, by invasions and the total destruction of http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01a.htm (3 of 30)22.5.2005 19:17:01"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Western culture. JCT: Too bad he doesn't say where this decay arises. He simply asks to assume such decay as a given. EUROPE'S SHIFT TO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY Page 24 The belief in the innate goodness of man had its roots in the eighteenth century when it appeared to many that man was born good and free but was everywhere distorted, corrupted, and enslaved by bad institutions and conventions. As Rousseau said, \"Man is born free yet everywhere he is in chains.\" Obviously, if man is is innately good and needs but to be freed from social restrictions, he is capable of tremendous achievements in this world of time, and does not need to postpone his hopes of personal salvation into eternity. JCT: I think this philosophy makes the most sense. I think the wish for power of one's fellow man is purely a function of insecurity. Page 25 To the nineteenth century mind, evil, or sin, was a negative conception. It merely indicated a lack or, at most, a distortion of good. Any idea of sin or evil as a malignant force opposed to good, and capable of existing by its own nature, was completely lacking in the typical nineteenth century mind. The only evil was frustration and the only sin, repression. Just as the negative idea of the nature of evil flowed from the belief that human nature was good, so the idea of liberalism flowed from the belief that society was bad. For, if society was bad,the state, which was the organized coercive power of society, was doubly bad, and if man was good, he should be freed, above all, from the coercive power of the state. JCT: Of course, this is only when the state is front man for loansharks' oppression. When the state was not in thrall to loansharks and did not have to oppress its citizens with oppressive taxes to service debt, there would be no reason for citizens to feel this way nor would there be any reason for the state not to pass laws in favor of the good life of its citizens. \"No government in business\" was commonly called \"laissez faire\" and would have left society with little power beyond that required to prevent the strong from physically oppressing the weak. This strange, and unexamined, belief held that there really existed, in the long run, a \"community of interests\" between the members of a society. It maintained that, in the long run, what was good for one was bad for all. It believed that there did exist a possible social pattern in which each member would be secure, free and prosperous. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01a.htm (4 of 30)22.5.2005 19:17:01"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"g$biloxi JCT: Capitalistic laissez-faire would actually work for the benefit of all if it weren't for some enjoying loanshark privileges. How anyone could call capitalism where everyone has to pay a vicious rake-off for the use of the currency \"laissez-faire\" or \"free trade\" is quite a joke. True laissez-faire or true free trade can only be so when the usurious shackles are abolished. Page 26 Capitalism was an economic system in which the motivating force was the desire for private profit as determined in a price system with the seeking of aggrandization of profits for each individual. JCT: I see nothing wrong with this in a \"free market\" which an interest-based system is not. Nationalism served to bind persons of the same nationality together into a tight, emotionally satisfying, unit. On the other side, it served to divide persons of different nationalities into antagonistic groups, often to the injury of their real mutual political, economic or cultural advantages. JCT: Having a tight satisfying unit does not necessarily injure your neighbors. This only occurs when people's are engaged in death- gambles. The event which destroyed the pretty dream world of 1919-1929 were the stock market crash, the world depression, the world financial crisis. JCT: The stock market crash, the depression and the world financial crisis are not causes which destroyed the pretty \"real\" world of Roaring Twenties. Why he'd call their real potential \"dream\" escapes me though he confusing the symptoms with the cause could explain it. It was a reduction in currency which brought stagnation to a formerly vibrant world economy. The International Bankers had but to reduce the amount of money in circulation to watch mankind sit down in front of their trees with their hammers and chainsaws not unable to house themselves. Let us remember that during the Great Depression, the number of plants, the number of machines, the number of skilled workers did not disappear, only the number of dollars disappeared. Page 28 The twentieth century came to believe that human nature is, if not innately bad, at least capable of being very evil. Left to himself, man falls very easily to the level of the jungle or even lower and this result can be prevent only by the coercive power of society. JCT: When man is forced to play financial death-gamble where the losers are left with insufficient life-support tickets to survive, is there any wonder that once the bankers have insisted on a \"kill or be http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01a.htm (5 of 30)22.5.2005 19:17:01"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"g$biloxi killed\" system that man falls to the level of the law of the jungle? Along with this change from good men and bad society to bad men and good society has appeared a reaction from optimism to pessimism. The horrors of Hitler's concentration camps and Stalin's slave-labor units are chiefly responsible for this change. JCT: This is silly. None of these things would have happened had all nations not been faced with impossible debts. Just because the bankers have organized a deathgamble for mankind to play is no reason to label the depths man has fallen to as a naturally occurring trait. Yet, we do see that even good men go bad in a bad society. And when it comes to mass murder, Hitler and Stalin's numbers pale beside the hundreds of millions murdered by poverty that the Rothschilds and Rockefellers can be held accountable for. And let us never forget that Hitler and Stalin were financed by corporations controlled by R&R and could never have been elevated to power without their support. I think Anthony Sutton's books \"Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler,\" and \"Wall Street and the Rise of Bolshevism\" (I'm not sure of the second title) explain pretty clearly how Wall Street financiers were the main supporters of both Hitler and Stalin. So we can lay their victims at the feet of the International bankers too. I guess by now, you must realize my abhorrence of these parasitic families who can be likened to those who would take food from starving children which they have done by the millions. Can anyone think of anyone more odious than someone who would take the life-support tickets away from a starving child. The Rothschilds and Rockefellers have and even though many will want to have them punished after the upcoming LETS financial revolution, my policy is to forgive and forget because if the Lord can say that when the wicked cease their evil ways, all their sins will be forgotten, who are we to do differently. So though it's true that the thought of the Rothschilds and Rockefellers make me want to puke, I'm prepared to leave them be as we enter a millennium of peace and prosperity. And remember that in my advocacy of \"Amnesty, Anonymity, Security,\" or \"Forgive, Forget, Have some interest-free LETS credit,\" you'll notice the anonymity section which will permit the Rothschilds and Rockefellers and other usurer families to change their names so no one even knows that they were related to the monsters who enslaved and murdered so many with their exponential debt. If anyone thinks this is hyperbole, just remember that the the first word in the name of their business, \"mort-gage,\" translates into \"death.\" And can there be any other reason that the usurers are the only ones who were physically attacked by Christ in the temple?

CHAPTER II: WESTERN CIVILIZATION TO 1914 WESTERN CIVILIZATION TO 1914 Page 39 The financial capitalist sought profits from the manipulation of claims on money; and the monopoly capitalist sought profits from manipulation of the market to make the market price and the amount sold such that his profits would be maximized. JCT: To the detriment of consumers since manipulating the value of money and manipulating the market price does not aim at maximizing production. Page 41 Karl Marx,about 1850, formed his ideas of an inevitable class struggle in which the groups of owners would become fewer and fewer and richer and richer while the mass of workers became poorer and poorer but more and more numerous. JCT: Score a point for Marx in his analysis of the capitalist malaise. As capitalist countries play \"mortgage,\" it is inevitable that more and more people are thrust into foreclosure and less and less survive to be richer and richer owners. Mass production required less labor. But mass production required mass consumption. JCT: And as long as robot paychecks go to only a few people and not to the majority, especially of people who were replaced by those robots, this dislocation will persist. Think of it as everyone owning a robot slave to do one's work. No one would complain about losing their job once their robot started doing it as long as they got their usual paycheck. EUROPEAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Page 42 Investments in railroads, steel mills and so on could not be financed from the profits and private fortunes of individual proprietors. New instruments for financing industry came into existence in the form of limited-liability corporations and investment banks. These were soon in a position to control the chief parts of the industrial system since they provided the capital to it. This gave rise to financial capitalism. JCT: Of course, King Henry's tally system of issuing currency for http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01a.htm (7 of 30)22.5.2005 19:17:01"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"g$biloxi large projects from the national treasury had been forgotten and corporations and investment banks were the only way that it could still be done while guaranteeing a large profit to the nation's rich. Page 43 Great industrial units, working together either directly or through cartels and trade associations, were in a position to exploit the majority of the people. The result was a great economic crisis which soon developed into a struggle for control of the state - the minority hoping to use the state to defend their privileged position, the majority hoping to use the state to curtail the power and privileges of the minority. JCT: So what's new? In every nation on Earth today, the minority use the state to defend their privileged positions while the majority have no luck at all in curtailing their power and privileges. Capitalism, because it seems profits as its primary goal, is never primarily seeking to achieve prosperity, high production, high consumption, political power, patriotic improvement, or moral uplift. JCT: And since that's what R&R want, it's want R&R get. Large profits for the banking elite with little prosperity, never full production unless in time of war, never high consumption and certainly no moral uplift. I think Christ described a world ruled by Rothschild and Rockefeller moneylenders as \"like heaven but an alley where men weep and gnash their teeth.\" Heck of a tribute to their control, isn't it. What could have been a heaven for mankind in Eden has been turned into a cesspool of misery by these banking families. Page 44 Goods moved from low-price areas to high-price areas and money moved from high-price areas to low-price areas because goods were more valuable where prices were high and money was more valuable where prices were low. Thus, clearly, money and goods are not the same thing but are, on the contrary, exactly opposite things. Most confusion in economic thinking arises from failure to recognize this fact. Goods are wealth which you have, while money is a claim on wealth which you do not have. Thus goods are an asset; money is a debt. If goods are wealth; money is non-wealth, or negative wealth, or even anti-wealth. JCT: I've never heard it described like this anywhere in Economics or Accounting. As long as the cashier's cage is holding the requisite amount of collateral for every token issued, there's nothing wrong with treating the claim on wealth as wealth though once economists have divorced money from collateral, problems do arise.

They became concerned with the lending of money to merchants to finance their ships and their activities, advancing money for both, at high interest rates, secured by claims on ships or goods as collateral for repayment and made it possible for people to concentrate on one portion of the process and, by maximizing that portion, to jeopardize the rest. JCT: And jeopardize the rest they have. This should be R&R's epitaph: they concentrated on the process while jeopardizing the rest. Page 46 Three parts of the system, production, transfer, and consumption of goods were concrete and clearly visible so that almost anyone could grasp them simply examining them while the operations of banking and finance were concealed, scattered, and abstract so that they appeared to many to be difficult. To add to this, bankers themselves did everything they could to make their activities more secret and more esoteric. Their activities were reflected in mysterious marks in ledgers which were never opened to the curious outsider. JCT: David Astle repeatedly makes the same point. There's something about bankers' operations that necessitate people not finding out how it works. Still, given how the process has been confused in the study of banking by economists, one has to wonder what there was to hide. With professional economists leading the confusion, today's world is in no better shape that societies in antiquity. Still, the main goal was to hide the fact that people were in fact borrowing new credit money and not someone else's savings. Though you might accept paying interest for the use of someone's deferred savings, it's hard to rationalize paying interest for no one's deferred savings. This is the reason Economics spends so much time instilling the infamous doublethink that loans are depositors' funds while admitting that new money is also created. So the mystery is over. Bankers do not lend out their depositors' funds, no one is deferring their current consumption and no one needs be rewarded with interest for that deferred consumption. Bankers lend out new funds and scam the borrowers into paying interest on the false belief that they're getting it from depositors who are deferring consumption. Changes of prices, whether inflationary or deflationary, have been major forces in history for the last six centuries at least. JCT: Probably for the last six millennia if we can believe Astle's research. Still it's nice to have a major historian admit that the financial manipulations of international bankers have been the major forces of history. We'll see how over and over. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01a.htm (9 of 30)22.5.2005 19:17:01"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 47 Hundreds of years ago, bankers began to specialize, with richer and more influential ones associated increasingly with foreign trade and foreign-exchange transactions. Since these were richer and more cosmopolitan and increasingly concerned with questions of political significance, such as stability and debasement of currencies, war and peace, dynastic marriages, and worldwide trading monopolies, they became financiers and financial advisers of governments. Moreover, they were always obsessed with the stability of monetary exchanges and used their power and influence to do two things: 1) to get all money and debts expressed in terms of strictly limited commodity - ultimately gold; and JCT: And we'll read over and over how their concern over the buying power of their gold superseded the well-being of the peoples every time. The standard argument is that money given a high value by scarcity was good for the people since their money bought them more. The fact that this was great for those who had most of the money seems to have dwarfed the realization that this was not great for the majority who had little money. 2) to get all monetary matters out of the control of governments and political authority, on the ground that they would be handled better by private banking interests in terms of such a stable value of gold. JCT: You'll hear this argument ad nauseam, that governments are too irresponsible to be left in charge of the money system which should be left to experts like bankers and economists. Given their track records, I doubt this was such a great idea and I can't imagine how any government could have caused as much calamity as these private bankers have done with their control of the money. And if you're going to genocide millions of people by poverty, shouldn't it at least be a government doing the genocide rather than a few private families? The problem is that governments usually get blamed for the genocide of the poor by withdrawal of life-support tickets even though they are not even in control; though they should be. INDUSTRIAL CAPITALISM, 1770-1850 Page 48 Britain's victories had many causes such as its ability to control the sea and its ability to present itself to the world as the defender of the freedoms and rights of small nations and of diverse social and religious groups. Also, financially, England had discovered the secret of credit and economically, it had embarked on the Industrial Revolution. JCT: England had discovered the secret of credit?

Nevertheless, the founding of the Bank of England by William Paterson and his friends in 1694 is one of the great dates in world history. For generations, men had sought to avoid the one drawback of gold, its heaviness, by using pieces of paper to represent specific pieces of gold. Today, we call such pieces of paper gold certificates which entitles its bearer to exchange it for its piece of gold on demand, but in view of the convenience of paper, only a small fraction of certificate holders ever did make such demands. It early became clear that gold need be held on hand only to the amount needed to cover the fraction of certificates likely to be presented for payment; accordingly, the rest of the gold could be used for business purposes, or, what amounts to the same thing, a volume of certificates could be issued greater than the volume of gold reserved for payment of demands against them. such an excess volume of paper claims against reserves we now call bank notes. JCT: Once again we run into an explanation of the goldsmith scam to explain how credit is just as valid a currency as actual commodity tokens are. In effect, this creation of paper claims greater than the reserves available means that bankers were creating money out of nothing. JCT: Of course, Economics professors Flaherty and Simms are still teaching their students that bankers lend out their depositors' funds. I'm sure most other Economics professors are teaching this false belief too. Of course, that they were creating credit out of thin air was one of the things bankers worked to hard at keeping secret and it seems is still quite unknown to the majority of Economics teachers. The same thing could be done in another way, not by note-issuing banks but by deposit banks. Deposit bankers discovered that orders and checks drawn against deposits by depositors and given to third persons were often not cashed by the latter but were deposited to their own accounts. Thus there were no actual movements of funds, and payments were made simply by bookkeeping transactions on the accounts. Accordingly, it was necessary for the banker to keep on hand in actual money (gold, certificates and notes) no more than the fraction of deposits likely to be drawn upon and cashed; the rest could be used for loans and if these loans were made by creating a deposit for the borrower, who in turn would draw checks upon it rather than withdraw it in money, such \"created deposits\" or loans could also be covered adequately by retaining reserves to only a fraction of their value. Such created deposits also were a creation of money out of nothing, although bankers usually refused to express their actions, either note http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01a.htm (11 of 30)22.5.2005 19:17:01"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"g$biloxi issuing or deposit lending, in these terms. William Paterson, on obtaining the charter of the Bank of England, said \"the Bank hath benefit of interest on all moneys it creates out of nothing.\" This is generally admitted today. JCT: Again, such \"created deposits\" or \"loans\" were the creation of money out of nothing even though Flaherty and Simms violently disagree. They still think that piggy banks create money though I've challenged them to explain where the piggy bank got the new money and they've never been able to answer. This organizational structure for creating means of payment out of nothing, which we call credit, was not invented by England but was developed by her to become one of her chief weapons in the victory over Napoleon in 1815. The emperor, could not see money in any but concrete terms, and was convinced that his efforts to fight wars on the basis of \"sound money\" by avoiding the creation of credit, would ultimately win him a victory by bankrupting England. He was wrong although the lesson has had to be relearned by modern financiers in the twentieth century. JCT: Boy, did he ever blow it. Of course, LETS shows that pure credit works as currency just fine and if Napeleon restricted his money to metal base, then he was under the control of the bullion brokers as every king of antiquity mentioned by Astle. FINANCIAL CAPITALISM 1850-1931 Page 50 The third stage of capitalism is of such overwhelming significance in the history of the twentieth century, and its ramifications and influences have been so subterranean and even occult, that we may be excused if we devote considerate attention to this organization and methods. JCT: Banking as subterranean and even occult? Why not? Given the International bankers were planning the murder by war and famines of millions, could be anything but subterranean and occult. I've always said that such people would have to have an almost \"alien\" mentality in order to calmly inflict poverty and starvation on millions of people without any qualms. When I watch the X-Files' suggestions of alien conspiracies, I'd have no problem believing that if aliens were here and controlling the planet, they would inevitably be international bankers in order to control human activity and given their obvious lack of care for the well-being of the humanoid population, I would have no trouble at all with the hypothesis that the Rockefellers and Rothschilds are alien life forms.

The center of that system was in London, with major offshoots in New York and Paris and it has left, as its greatest achievement, an integrated banking system and a heavily capitalized - if now largely obsolescent - framework of heavy industry, reflected in railroads, steel mills, coal mines and electrical utilities. JCT: And of course, those who believe in the accidental theory of history pooh-pooh the thought that these men would use their organized integrated system for their own benefit to the murderous detriment of the rest of humanity. Fortunately, the facts show that such an accidental view of history is quite silly and leaves us with the only conclusion that they in fact did use their control of the world's money to manipulate the world's peoples into war after war and depression after depression. This system had its center in London for four chief reasons. First was the great volume of savings in England. Second was England's oligarchic social structure which provided a very inequitable distribution of incomes with large surpluses coming to the control of a small, energetic upper class. Third was that this upper class was aristocratic but not noble, quite willing to recruit both money and ability from lower levels and even from outside the country, welcoming American heiresses and central-European Jews to its ranks almost as willingly as it welcomed monied, able and conformist recruits from the lower classes of Englishmen. Fourth (and by no means last) in significance was the skill in financial manipulation, especially on the international scene, which the small group of merchant bankers of London had acquired. JCT: So the knowledge of credit creation was still a secret but these men knew about it, and how to use it to their advantage. In time, they brought into their financial network the provincial banking centers as well as insurance companies to form all of these into a single financial system on an international scale which manipulated the quantity and flow of money so that they were able to influence, if not control, governments on one side and industries on the other. JCT: So the Rothschilds and Rockefellers controlled both governments and industries. It does explain why so many policies which starved so many people paid off so handsomely for them.

And of course, had they chosen to finance food production instead of war production, there would have been no wars possible. Certainly not the large, well- financed productions they did organize for humankind. The men who did this, looking backward toward the period of dynastic monarchy in which they had their own roots, aspired to establish dynasties of international bankers and were at least as successful at this as were many of the dynastic political rulers. The greatest of these dynasties, of course, were the descendants of Meyer Amschel Rothschild (1743-1812) whose male descendants for at least two generations, generally married first cousins or even nieces. Rothschilds five sons, established at branches in Vienna, London, Naples and Paris as well as Frankfort, cooperated together in ways which other international banking dynasties copied but rarely excelled. JCT: And even though his five sons were lauded for their support of each countries war efforts, the point is that they financed all sides of those wars and without their support for all sides of those wars, there wouldn't have been any wars. I find it funny how Quigley will later say that they were forces for peace but we do find that he often lauds these men who would steal food tickets from starving children. In concentrating, as we must, on the financial or economic activities of international bankers, we must not totally ignore their other attributes. They were cosmopolitan rather than nationalistic; they were a constant, if weakening, influence for peace, a pattern established in 1830 and 1840 when the Rothschilds threw their whole tremendous influence successfully against European wars. JCT: This is the joke about them being forces for peace I was referring to. The guys who financed all the wars and without whose financing there could have been no wars, are forces for peace. How amusing. They were usually highly civilized, cultured gentlemen, patrons of education and of the arts, so that today, colleges, professorships, opera companies, symphonies, libraries, and museum collections still reflect their munificence. For these purposes they set a pattern of endowed foundations which still surround us today. JCT: Being patrons of the arts and giving gave back a bit of what they'd stolen from the starving children doesn't make them saints in my books. The fact is that they did not earn their ill-gotten gain and the fact they gave some back doesn't change my impression of them in the least. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01a.htm (14 of 30)22.5.2005 19:17:01"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"g$biloxi The names of some of these banking families are familiar to all of us and should be more so. They include Baring, Lazard, Erlanger, Warburg, Schroder, Seligman, Speyers, Mirabaud, Mallet, Fould and above all Rothschild and Morgan. JCT: Names that will live in infamy. But once we've installed our Global LETS, their descendants will all be allowed to change their names though the history books will certainly treat the names of these monsters accordingly. Even after these banking families became fully involved in domestic industry by the emergence of financial capitalism, they remained different from ordinary bankers in distinctive ways: 1) they were cosmopolitan and international; JCT: Which accounts for their great power and the inability of any national governments to control them. Rather control worked the other way around. 2) they were close to governments and were particularly concerned with questions of government debts, including foreign government debts, even in areas which seemed, at first glance, poor risks, like Egypt, Persia, Ottoman Turkey, Imperial China and Latin America; JCT: Nothing better than having a government license your creation of money and then getting in line so you can loanshark it to them. In this way, governments are responsible for the tax collections to pay the loansharks which certainly beats them having to do their collections themselves. 3) their interests were almost exclusively in bonds and very rarely in goods since they admired \"liquidity\"; JCT: So their major interests did absolutely no good for the people who were more interested in goods than bonds. 4) they were fanatical devotees of deflation (which they called \"sound\" money from its close association with high interest rates and a high value of money) and of the gold standard; JCT: And the fact that millions of people who had no money suffered so the owners of the bulk of the money could benefit by such deflationary policies was of no concern to them. We'll read over and over about how these deflationary policies cause misery and death among the poor but continue to be pursued relentlessly by these non- human monsters. 5) they were almost equally devoted to secrecy and the secret use of financial influence in political life.

JCT: I wouldn't want the general population to be aware of the misery I'd caused them either and I can understand why they'd want their activities to be couched in secrecy. Everywhere, they were sharply distinguishable from other, more obvious, kinds of banks, such as savings banks or commercial banks. One of their less obvious characteristics was that they remained as private unincorporated firms offering no shares, no reports, and usually no advertising to the public until modern inheritance taxes made it essential to surround such family wealth with the immortality of corporate status for tax-avoidance purposes. This persistence as private firms continued because it ensured the maximum of anonymity and secrecy to persons of tremendous public power who dreaded public knowledge of their activities as an evil almost as great as inflation. JCT: And if people realised what phenomenal profits they made from the sufferings of the general population, they might rise up against the bankers rather than their front governments for a change. Notice that Christ's only incident of physical violence was not against the Roman or Jewish government but against the money-lenders who probably controlled the government as they do today. He wasn't fooled into blaming the government when he knew that the ones responsible for his generation's debt enslavement were the financiers just as they are today. Page 53 Firms like Morgan, like others of the international banking fraternity, constantly operated through corporations and governments, yet remained itself an obscure private partnership. JCT: That way, the sheeple would blame the government for their misfortunes rather than the moneylenders who actually were responsible for their misery. The influence of financial capitalism and the international bankers who created it was exercised both on business and on governments, but could have neither if it had not been able to persuade both these to accept two \"axioms\" of its own ideology. Both of these were based on the assumption that politicians were too weak and too subject to temporary public pressures to be trusted with control of the money system; accordingly, the soundness of money must be protected in two ways: by basing the value of money on gold and by allowing bankers to control the money supply. To do this it was necessary to conceal, even mislead, both governments and people about the nature of money and its methods of operation. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01a.htm (16 of 30)22.5.2005 19:17:01"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"g$biloxi JCT: How well put. And we hear the same rationale today. Yet, considering their track record, I'd have rather had government control it. Especially considering the track records of government which actually did control their money, examples of which I have already detailed. Roman copper money, English tallies, Lincoln Greenbacks were all Treasury currencies which benefited their citizens. Unfortunately, these have been erased from economic histories being taught in every Economics faculty in the world. Please do not think that these omissions are accidental. It's just part of the secrecy they need to keep the people ignorant of how money works. Of course, with professional economists leading the confusion, it actually is a feat of intellectual prowess to defeat the brainwashing and find out about and understand how these interest-free models did work. Page 54 Since it is quite impossible to understand the history of the twentieth century without some understanding of the role played by money in domestic affairs and in foreign affairs, as well as the role played by bankers in economic life and in political life, we must take a least a glance at each of these four subjects: JCT: And yet, Quigley's is the only orthodox history I've ever read which makes any mention at all of the effects of money in manipulating human affairs. DOMESTIC FINANCIAL PRACTICES In each country, the supply of money took the form of an inverted pyramid or cone balanced on its point. In the point was the supply of gold and its equivalent certificates; on the intermediate levels was a much larger supply of notes; and at the top, with an open and expandable upper surface, was an even greater supply of deposits. Each level used the levels below it as its reserves and these lower levels had smaller quantities of money, they were \"sounder.\" Notes were issued by \"banks of emission\" or \"banks of issue\" and were secured by reserves of gold or certificates held in some central reserve. The fraction held in reserve depended upon banking regulations or statute law. Such banks, even central banks, were private institutions, owned by shareholders who profited by their operations. Deposits on the upper level of the pyramid were called by this name, with typical bankers' ambiguity, in spite of the fact that they consisted of two utterly different kinds of relationships: 1) \"lodged deposits\" which were real claims left by a depositor in a bank on which a depositor might receive interest; and 2) \"created deposits\" which were claims created by the bank out of nothing as loans from the bank to \"depositors\" who had to pay interest on them. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01a.htm (17 of 30)22.5.2005 19:17:01"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Both form part of the money supply. Lodged deposits as a form of savings are deflationary while created deposits, being an addition to the money supply, are inflationary. JCT: Pretty good explanation of how the world's money system works though, like every economist, the idea of linking the issuance of new chips to an increase in pledge collateral cannot be grasped. If deposits are created at the pledging of new collateral, then it is not inflationary. Every good casino cashier understands the link between the increase in money matching the increase in collateral though very few economists can understand this link. Page 55 The volume of deposits banks can create, like the amount of notes they can issue, depends upon the volume of reserves available to pay whatever fraction of checks are cashed rather than deposited. In the United States, deposits were traditionally limited to ten times reserves notes and gold. In Britain it was usually nearer twenty times such reserves. In most countries, the central bank was surrounded closely by the almost invisible private investment banking firms. These, like the planet Mercury, could hardly be seen in the dazzle emitted by the central bank, which they, in fact, often dominated. Yet a lost observer could hardly fail to notice the close private associations between these private, international bankers and the central bank itself. In France, in 1936, the Board of the Bank of France was still dominated by the names of the families who had originally set it up in 1800. JCT: So even though most people think that the Bank of Canada, the Bank of France, the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve are controlled by government for the good of the people, they are actually all controlled by the private bankers for the good of the private bankers and the detriment of the people in general. In England, a somewhat similar situation existed. In a secondary ring are the \"joint stock banks.\" Outside this secondary ring are the savings banks, insurance firms, and trust companies. In France and England the private bankers exercised their powers through the central bank and had much more influence on the government and foreign policy and less on industry. In the United States, much industry was financed by investment bankers directly and the power of these both on industry and government was very great. JCT: The point is that government had no control over financial policies which hurt so many people and helped so few bankers. Page 57 The various parts of the pyramid of money were but loosely related to each other. Much of this looseness arose from the fact that the http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01a.htm (18 of 30)22.5.2005 19:17:01"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"g$biloxi controls were compulsive in a deflationary direction and were only permissive in an inflationary direction. This last point can be seen in the fact that the supply of gold could be decreased but could hardly be increased. If an ounce of gold was added to the point of the pyramid, it could permit an increase in deposits equivalent to $2067 on the uppermost level. If such an ounce of gold were withdrawn from a fully expanded pyramid of money, this would compel a reduction of deposits by at least this amount, probably by a refusal to renew loans. JCT: So the guys who owned the gold could force the banks to call in their loans and precipitate credit crunches just by moving gold around. David Astle keeps pointing out how currencies based on gold or silver are subject to this same control. Throughout modern history, the influence of the gold standard has been deflationary, because the natural output of gold each year, except in extraordinary times, has not kept pace with the increase in the output of goods. Only new supplies of gold or the development of new kinds of money have saved our civilization over the last couple of centuries. The three great periods of war ended with an extreme deflationary crisis (1819, 1873, 1921) as the influential Money Power persuaded governments to re-establish a deflationary monetary unit with a high gold content. JCT: Money Power persuaded governments to get back on gold which subjected the people to poverty and death while profiting the bankers to high interest rates. The usual bankers' prescription for financial ills. The obsession of the Money Power with deflation was partly a result of their concern with money rather than with goods but was also founded on other factors, one of which was paradoxical. The paradox arose from the fact that the basic economic conditions of the nineteenth century were deflationary, with a monetary system based on gold and an industrial system pouring out increasing supplies of goods but in spite of falling prices, the interest rate tended to fall rather than rise. Moreover, merchant banking continued to emphasize bonds rather than equity securities (stocks), to favor government issues rather than private offerings. JCT: Is it any wonder that the guys who own all the money and control the creation of new money would want their money to buy them more and more even though those who have no money end up with less and less? Another paradox of banking practice arose from the fact that bankers, who loved deflation, often acted in an inflationary fashion from their eagerness to lend money at interest. Since they make money out of http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01a.htm (19 of 30)22.5.2005 19:17:01"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"g$biloxi loans, they are eager to increase the amounts of bank credit on loan. But this is inflationary. JCT: It's only inflationary when they don't demand collateral for the loan. And how many bankers don't demand collateral? So usually, the creation of new money is not inflationary though a large injection of new money, such as a gold strike, would certainly be inflationary. The conflict between the deflationary ideas and inflationary practices of bankers had profound repercussions on business. The bankers made loans to business so that the volume of money increased faster than the increase of goods. The result was inflation. When this became clearly noticeable, the bankers would flee to notes or specie by curtailing credit and raising discount rates. This was beneficial to the bankers in the short run (since it allowed them to foreclose on collateral for loans) but it could be disastrous to them in the long run (by forcing the value of the collateral below the amount of the loans it secured). But such bankers' deflation was destructive to business and industry in the short run as well as the long run. JCT: It was never disastrous to the bankers at all. When times were good, they got large interest and large fees and when times were bad, they got the foreclosed collateral for a song, even if its value was less than the original value of the loan. Page 59 The resulting fluctuation in the supply of money, chiefly deposits, was a prominent aspect of the \"business cycle.\" The quantity of money could be changed by changing reserve requirements or discount (interest) rates. Central banks can usually vary the amount of money in circulation by \"open market operations\" or by influencing the discount rates of lesser banks. In open market operations, a central bank buys or sells government bonds in the open market. If it buys, it releases money into the economic system; it if sells it reduces the amount of money in the community. If the Federal Reserve Bank buys, it pays for these by checks which are soon deposited in a bank. It thus increases this bank's reserves with the Federal Reserve Bank. Since banks are permitted to issue loans for several times the value of their reserves with the FED, such a transaction permits them to issue loans for a much larger sum. JCT: Actually, here he repeats the same old Socred canard that the banks can issue more in loans than their reserves. If they can issue only 90% of the deposits, it is never possible to issue more than the reserves. I explained this just recently. The loan must be deposited before a new loan can be issued to cause another deposit to permit a new loan to cause another deposit, etc. See my http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/bankmath.htm for a fuller treatment. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01a.htm (20 of 30)22.5.2005 19:17:01"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Central banks can also change the quantity of money by raising the discount rate which forces the lesser banks to raise their discount rates; such a raise in interest rates tends to reduce the demand for credit and thus the amount of deposits (money). Lowering the discount rate permits an opposite result. JCT: If one believes that inflation is an increase in the money supply, then restricting the growth in the money by raising interest rates is the solution Shift A inflation. If one believes today's inflation is a decrease in the goods supply being purchased by the money created, then reducing the unpurchasable portion by lowering interest rates is the solution to Shift B inflation. The fact that a large injection of new local bond currency issued by Argentina provinces in the mid 1980s lowered inflation is persuasive proof that we are suffering inflation due to failure caused by interest rate rather than inflation due to too much money. It is noted that the control of the central bank over the credit policies of local banks are permissive in one direction and compulsive in the other. They can compel these local banks to curtail credit and can only permit them to increase credit. This means that they have control powers against inflation and not deflation - a reflection of the old banking idea that inflation was bad and deflation was good. JCT: Yes, this is a very interesting point. They can always compel a depression while they can only permit a boom. Page 60 The powers of governments over the quantity of money are: a) control over a central bank; JCT: What a joke. No government in the world controls its central bank. The private banks do. b) control over public taxation; c) control over public spending; JCT: Neither of these who controls the money supply, they only shuffle money from our accounts to the governments or vice versa. What governments really need to do is go the Third Way which is not even mentioned here: Cut debt service. Since most central banks have been (technically) private institutions, this control is frequently based on custom rather than on law. JCT: Very few people know this and very few economists accept it. For instance, though it's not of major importance, the Federal Reserve of the United States, though its directors are appointed by the President, is not a government body but a purely private one. It has never been audited by the government and it is not even listed with http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01a.htm (21 of 30)22.5.2005 19:17:01"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"g$biloxi the other government agencies in the telephone book. It is listed with all other private corporations in the white pages. This is not a major point given that the Bank of Canada is a government agency which also acts independently of government. So even when part of the government, they are left independent to further the aims of the private bankers in their orbit. Taxation tends to reduce the amount of money in a community and is usually a deflationary force. Government spending is usually an inflationary force. JCT: As if the government takes money out of circulation via taxes and doesn't spend it back. Considering that most governments operate on deficits, this implies that every dollar taken in in taxes is spent so there is no deflationary effect. On the whole, in the period up to 1931, bankers, especially the Money Power controlled by the international investment bankers, were able to dominate both business and government. They could dominate business because investment bankers had the ability to supply or refuse to supply such capital. Thus Rothschild interests came to dominate many of the railroads of Europe, while Morgan dominated at least 26,000 miles of American railroads. Such bankers took seats on the boards of directors of industrial firms, as they had already done on commercial banks, savings banks, insurance firms, and finance companies. From these lesser institutions, they funneled capital to enterprises which yielded control and away from those who resisted. These firms were controlled through interlocking directorships, holding companies, and lesser banks. JCT: People tend to undervalue this power to deny loans of new money to their enemies while authorizing loans to their friends so they can buy the less-favored enterprises at auction after foreclosure. As Astle points out, such power is too great for private individuals and should be restricted to the rulers who, hopefully, will be issuing such loans for the benefit of their citizens. Page 61 As early as 1909, Walter Rathenau said, \"Three hundred men, all of whom know one another, direct the economic destiny of Europe and choose their successors from among themselves.\" JCT: These are the men responsible for the millions of deaths by poverty and war in those times. The power of investment bankers over governments rests on the need of governments to issue short-term treasury bills as well as long-term government bonds. Just as businessmen go to commercial banks for current capital advances, so a government has to go to merchant http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01a.htm (22 of 30)22.5.2005 19:17:01"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"g$biloxi bankers to tide over the shallow places caused by irregular tax receipts. JCT: Of course, such power is only over governments stupid enough to have taken the power to create money from their own Treasuries and given it to private banks. Only the idiot government are in such a ridiculous position. Unfortunately, this comprises all the governments of today's world except for the Island of Guernsey and perhaps some of the Argentinian provinces. Otherwise, all governments have given the power to create money to private bankers and are in line with all their citizens trying to borrow that money. As experts in government bonds, the international bankers provided advice to government officials and, on many occasions, placed their own members in official posts. This was so widely accepted even today, that in 1961 a Republican investment banker became Secretary of the Treasury in a Democratic administration in Washington without significant comment from any direction. JCT: So the bankers have advised the governments to give them the power to create the money and advised them to get into debt to them and advised them to tax everyone to pay them interest. Naturally, the influence of bankers over governments during the age of financial capitalism (roughly 1850-1931) was not something about which anyone talked about freely, but it has been admitted freely enough by those on the inside, especially in England. In 1842, Gladstone, chancellor of the Exchequer, declared \"The hinge of the whole situation was this: the government itself was not to be the substantive power in matters of Finance, but was to leave the Money Power supreme and unquestioned.\" On Sept. 26, 1921, the Financial Times wrote, \"Half a dozen men at the top of the Big Five Banks could upset the whole fabric of government finance by refraining from renewing Treasury Bills.\" In 1924, Sir Drummond Fraser, vice-president of the Institute of Bankers, stated, \"The Governor of the Bank of England must be the autocrat who dictates the terms upon which alone the Government can obtain borrowed money.\" JCT: So these few men can be held responsible for the state of the world in those years. He leaves no doubt that the international bankers were in control just as Astle leaves no doubt that they were in control in antiquity. Page 62 In addition to their power over government based on government financing and personal influence, bankers could steer governments in ways they wished them to go by other pressures. Since most government officials felt ignorant of finance, they sought advice from bankers whom they considered experts in the field.

JCT: Actually, genocidal for the people generally. The results of their actions qualify these bankers as monsters in anyone's book. Such advice could be enforced if necessary by manipulation of exchanges, gold flows, discount rates, and even levels of business activity. Thus Morgan dominated Cleveland's second administration by gold withdrawals, and in 1936-13 French foreign exchange manipulators paralyzed the Popular Front governments. The powers of these international bankers reached their peak in 1919-1931 when Montagu Norman and J.P. Morgan dominated not only the financial world but international relations and other matters as well. On Nov. 11, 1927, the Wall Street Journal called Mr. Norman \"the currency dictator of Europe.\" This was admitted by Mr. Norman who said, \"I hold the hegemony of the world.\" JCT: International bankers admitted they ruled the world. The conflict of interests between bankers and industrialists has resulted in the subordination of the bankers (after 1931) to the latter by the adoption of \"unorthodox financial policies\" - that is, financial policies not in accordance with the short-run interests of the bankers. JCT: Interesting that \"unorthodox financial policies\" which were in the interest of the people and not in the interests of the bankers are not explained, only mentioned. As I've pointed out, these unorthodox financial practices were the policies of the Roman Empire with their Treasury's copper money, King Henry I with his Treasury's wooden \"tally money\" and Abe Lincoln with his paper \"Treasury notes\" which have disappeared down the economics history memory holes. THE UNITED STATES TO 1917 Page 71 The civil service reform began in the federal government with the Pendleton Bill of 1883. As a result, the government was controlled with varying degrees of completeness by the forces of investment banking and heavy industry from 1884 to 1933. Popularly known as \"Society,\" or the \"400,\" they lived a life of dazzling splendor. JCT: The bankers lived on their ill-gotten unearned interest income while the rest of the population suffered in poverty. I wonder what kind of Hell God has in store for them?

Morgan and Company, and the other, in Ohio, was headed by the Rockefeller family. When these two cooperated, as they generally did, they could influence the economic life of the country to a large degree and could almost control its political life, at least on the federal level. The influence of these business leaders was so great that the Morgan and Rockefeller groups acting together, or even Morgan acting alone, could have wrecked the economic system of the country merely by throwing securities on the stock market for sale, and having precipitated a stock market panic, could then have bought back the securities they had sold but at a lower price. Naturally, they were not so foolish as to do this, although Morgan came very close to it in precipitating the \"panic of 1907,\" but they did not hesitate to wreck individual corporations, at the expense of holders of common stock, by driving them to bankruptcy. In this way, Morgan wrecked the New York, New Haven and Hartford railroad before 1914 and William Rockefeller wrecked the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad before 1925. JCT: Seems pretty clear that the bankers controlled the US in these years as they still do today. Of course, accidentalists will argue that these pillars of power were never used and if used, their genocidal results were accidental given their benign intentions. After all, didn't these men donate some of the money to set up libraries? Page 73 The discovery by financial capitalists that they made money out of issuing and selling securities rather than out of production, distribution and consumption of goods accordingly led them to the point where they discovered that the exploiting of an operating company by excessive issuance of securities or the issuance of bonds rather than equity securities not only was profitable to them but made it possible for them to increase their profits by bankruptcy of the firm, providing fees and commission of reorganization as well as the opportunity to issue new securities. When the business interests pushed through the first installment of the civil service reform in 1881, they expected to control both political parties equally. Some intended to contribute to both and to allow an alternation of the two parties in public office in order to conceal their own influence, inhibit any exhibition of independence by politicians, and allow the electorate to believe that they were exercising their own free choice. JCT: Such control continues today.

The inability of the investment bankers to control the Democratic Party Convention of 1896 was a result of the agrarian discontent of the period 1868-1896. This discontent was based very largely on the monetary tactics of the banking oligarchy. The bankers were wedded to the gold standard and at the end of the Civil War, persuaded the Grant administration to curb the postwar inflation and go back on the gold standard (crash of 1873 and resumption of specie payment in 1875). JCT: So, going back on the gold standard to please the owners of gold caused the crash of 1873 to the detriment of the majority of Americans. We'll see this theme over and over in our studies. Page 74 This gave the bankers a control of the supply of money which they did not hesitate to use for their own purposes. JCT: No kidding. Still, how will the accidentalists account for all these benefits to their purposes? The bankers' affection for low prices was not shared by farmers, since each time prices of farm products went down, the burden of farmers' debts became greater. As farmers could not reduce their costs or modify their production plans, the result was a systematic exploitation of the agrarian sectors of the community by the financial and industrial sectors. This exploitation took the form of high industrial prices and discriminatory railroad rates, high interest charges, low farm prices and very low level of farm services. JCT: Every time we hear of deflationary policies, we're talking about higher interest rates for the owners of money, more foreclosure for their debtors, and misery for the population in general. I've had much experience helping people who were losing their homes fight their foreclosures and there's nothing as heart-breaking to behold. Having fought dozens of foreclosures, I feel eminently qualified to call the men responsible for these policies in olden times or today as monsters whose souls I hope will burn in Hell. Unable to resist by economic weapons, the farmers turned to political relief. They tried to work on the state political level through local legislation (so-called Granger Laws) and set up third-party movements (like the Greenback Party of 1878 or the Populist Party in 1892). JCT: In the early 1980s, I contemplated calling my party a Greenback party and they have a rousing history of political revolt against their oppressors though they had no chance against Big Money who could influence the majority of the booboisie. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01a.htm (26 of 30)22.5.2005 19:17:01"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"g$biloxi By 1896, the capture of the Democratic Party by the forces of discontent under William Jennings Bryant who was determined to obtain higher prices by increasing the supply of money on a bimetallic rather than a gold basis, presented the electorate with an election on a social and economic issue for the first time in a generation. Though the forces of high finance were in a state of near panic, by a mighty effort involving very large-scale spending they were successful in electing McKinley. JCT: And things went on as usual though I'm not sure Astle would agree that adding silver as a secondary base for the creation of new money would be much of an improvement. Of course, any new source of money with which to sell their products and pay their debts would have been a help. Though the plutocracy were unable to control the Democratic Party as they controlled the Republican Party, they did not cease their efforts to control both and in 1904 and 1924, Morgan was able to sit back with a feeling of satisfaction to watch presidential elections in which the candidates of both parties were in his sphere of influence. JCT: Just as Rockefeller has controlled both parties for the last 50 years through his Council on Foreign Relations. Page 75 The agrarian discontent, the growth of monopolies, the oppression of labor, and the excesses of Wall Street financiers made the country very restless between 1890-1900. All this could have been alleviated merely by increasing the supply of money sufficiently to raise prices somewhat, but the financiers were determined to defend the gold standard no matter what happened. JCT: What happened was wave after wave of foreclosures, suicides, hunger and misery, all the things that bankers thrive upon. In looking for some issue to distract public discontent from domestic issues, what better solution than a crisis in foreign affairs? Cleveland had stumbled upon this alternative in 1895 when he stirred up controversy with England over Venezuela. The great opportunity came with the Cuban revolt against Spain in 1895. While the \"yellow press\" roused public opinion, Henry Cabot Lodge and Theodore Roosevelt plotted how they could best get the United States into the fracas. They got the excuse they needed when the American battleship Maine was sunk by a mysterious explosion in Havana Harbor in 1898. In two months, the United States declared war on Spain to fight for Cuban independence. The resulting victory revealed the United States as a world naval power, established it as an imperialist power with possession of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01a.htm (27 of 30)22.5.2005 19:17:01"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"g$biloxi America's entrance upon the stage as a world power continued with the annexation of Hawaii in 1898, the intervention in the Boxer uprising in 1900, the seizure of the Panama canal in 1903, the diplomatic intervention in the Russo-Japanese war in 1905, the military occupation of Nicaragua in 1912, the military intervention in Mexico in 1916. JCT: It still works today too. It seems nothing gets a population to rally around the leader better than killing a few foreigners. I think Bill Clinton's use of Iraqi bombing at a propitious moment during his problems certainly gained him a great measure of approval. Though people love seeing their smart V2 bombs taking out targets on TV, I think they would be well served to also see some television coverage of the funerals that resulted. Page 76 As an example of the more idealistic impulse we might mention the creation of various Carnegie foundations to work for universal peace. JCT: Again, I can't help snickering when I think of monsters with the blood of millions of innocent debtors on their hands \"working for universal peace.\" I can believe that the only peace they really are working for is the peace provided when they've achieved universal bondage by debts. As an example of the more practical point of view, we might mention the founding of \"The New Republic,\" a liberal weekly paper, by an agent of Morgan financed with Whitney money (1914). The combined forces of the liberal East and the agrarian West were able to capture the Presidency under Woodrow Wilson in 1912. JCT: The Agrarian West didn't capture the presidency under Wilson. Wilson was a banker's all the way who will be most remembering for his campaign pledge not to send their sons to any foreign wars while he was planning to send their sons to foreign wars. Wilson roused a good deal of popular enthusiasm with his talk of \"New Freedom\" and the rights of the underdog, but his program amounted to little more than an amateur attempt to establish on a federal basis those reforms which agrarian and labor discontent had been seeking on a state basis for many years. JCT: As are most bankers agents, he was all talk and no action. It might be called an amateurish attempt if it were an honest attempt but considering it was probably not an honest attempt, I think it would be better to have called his attempt to help the poor \"fraudulent.\" Wilson was by no means a radical and there was a good deal of http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig01a.htm (28 of 30)22.5.2005 19:17:01"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"g$biloxi unconscious hypocrisy in many of his resounding public speeches. JCT: The most successful politicians are always the most hypocritical liars. He was a great one leading voters to believe he had their interests at heart while having Wall Street's interest truly at heart. His political and administrative reforms were a good deal more effective than his economic or social reforms. JCT: That's because political and administrative reforms don't really help the debt slaves very much. That they have better ways of being organized doesn't reduce their slavery as economic reforms would. Bankers will always allow their paid mouthpieces to orate useless reforms while the substantive never see the light of day. The establishment of an income tax and the Federal Reserve System justified the support which Progressives had given to Wilson. JCT: And I'm sure that American are still cheering with Quigley the establishment of the Federal Reserve System to promote interest debt service on the government's debt and the establishment of an Income tax to collect the interest payable on that national debt. Not. Wilson did much to extend equality of opportunity to wider groups of American people. JCT: After enslaving them with government debt and a new tax system to collect the debt service, he extended equality of opportunity to pay it wider groups of American people. Considering Quigley can laud monster usurers because they build a few libraries with some of their unearned income, is it any wonder he'd laud the guy who gave us the Fed and Income Taxes? Again, I must point out that when I talk of bankes committing genocide by poverty, it is not hyperbole. I have pushed 6 different genocide charges against bankers right to the Supreme Court of Canada and have initiated dozens, perhaps hundreds more appearances on the same charges at various court levels.

Peter the Great (1689-1725) and Catherine the Great (1762-1796) were supporters of westernization and reform. Paul I (1796-1801) was reactionary. Alexander I (1801-1825) and Alexander II (1855-1881) were reformers while Nicholas I (1825-1855) and Nicholas II (1855-1881) were reactionaries. By 1864, serfdom had been abolished, and a fairly modern system of law, of justice, and of education had been established; local government had been somewhat modernized; a fairly good financial and fiscal system had been established; and an army based on universal military service (but lacking in equipment) had been created. On the other hand, the autocracy continued in the hands of weak men and the freed serfs had no adequate lands. JCT: The fact that Russia was this advanced is just not something that I was ever aware of. We've always been given the impression that Russia was some backward country full of serfs and a dictatorial tsar. Page 93 The first Russian railroad opened in 1838 but growth was slow until 1857. At that time, there were only 663 miles of railroads, but this figure went up over tenfold by 1871, doubled again by 1881 with 14,000 miles, reached 37,000 by 1901 and 46,000 by 1915. JCT: Again, sounds very advanced considering what I had always been led to believe. Yet, I was raised during the Cold War and it's not that amazing that they never told us much of the truth. Page 94 In 1900, Russia had 48% of the total world production of petroleum products. The State Bank was made a bank of issue in 1897 and was required by law to redeem its notes in gold, thus placing Russia on the international gold standard. JCT: And as we know from Astle's Babylonian Woe, that put them under the control of the gold bullion brokers as had been most rulers throughout most of history.

It was controlled by four foreign banking groups. JCT: Makes sense that the International bankers would end up owning everything once we realize that Russia was hooked to their gold bullion money system. Page 100 Until 1910, Stolypin continued his efforts to combine oppression with reform, especially agrarian reform. Rural credit banks were established; various measures were taken to place larger amounts of land in the hands of the peasants; restrictions of immigration of peasants, especially to Siberia, were removed; participation in local government was opened to lower social classes previously excluded; education, especially technical education, was made more accessible; and certain provisions for social insurance were enacted into law. He was assassinated in the presence of the Tsar in 1911. The fourth duma (1912-1916) was elected by universal suffrage. Š JCT: As we read on, assassination and coups seem to be the fate of any politicians who dare enact land reform and Russia seems to be no exception. CHAPTER IV: THE BUFFER FRINGE THE NEAR EAST TO 1914 Page 111 The Ottoman Empire was divided into 21 governments and subdivided into seventy vilayets, each under a pasha. The supreme ruler in Constantinople was not only sultan (head of the empire) but was also caliph (defender of the Muslim creed). Page 121 The Great Powers showed mild approval of the Baghdad Railway until about 1900. Then, for more than ten years, Russia, Britain and France showed violent disapproval and did all they could the obstruct the project. They described the Baghdad Railway as the emerging wedge of German imperialist aggression seeking to weaken and destroy the Ottoman Empire and the stakes of the other powers in the area. Page 122 The Germans were not only favorably inclined toward Turkey; their conduct seems to have been completely fair in regard the administration of the railway itself. At a time when the American and other railways were practicing wholesale discrimination between customers, the Germans had the same rates and same treatment for all, http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig03a.htm (2 of 14)22.5.2005 19:17:19"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"g$biloxi including Germans and non-Germans. They worked to make the railroad efficient and profitable although their income from it was guaranteed by the Turkish government. In consequence, the Turkish payments to the railroad steadily declined, and the government was able to share in its profits to the extent of almost three million francs in 1914. Moreover, the Germans did not seek to monopolize control of the railroad, offering to share equally with France and England and eventually with the other Powers. France accepted this offer in 1899, but Britain continued to refuse and placed every obstacle in the path of the project. JCT: Of course, at the time, Britain was the seat of the moneylenders and we'll soon see that just like here, their vassal, the English government, obstructed almost everything everywhere. Quite a sad performance. When the Ottoman government sought to raise their customs duties from 11% to 14% in order to continue construction, Britain prevented this. In order to carry on the project, the Germans sold their railroad interests in the Balkans and gave the Ottoman building subsidy of $275,000 a kilometer. In striking contrast, the Russians demanded arrears of 57 million francs under the Treaty of 1878. The French, in spite of investments in Turkey, refused to allow Baghdad Railway securities to be handled on the Paris Stock Exchange. JCT: I can understand why Quigley's book never made it to the bestseller list when he describes the Germans as honest and honorable. That's not the impression of the murderous Hun we've always been left with to explain why we got involved in the war to end all wars. Page 123 In 1903, Britain made an agreement for a joint German, French, and British control of the railroad. Within three weeks this agreement was repudiated because of newspaper protests against it. JCT: And who owned the newspapers of the day? The Rothschilds, Rockefellers, and their moneylending ilk were able to scuttle Šinternational agreements which I'm sure eventually led to the Great War they were so eager to finance. When the Turkish government tried to borrow, it was summarily rebuffed in Paris and London, but obtained the sum unhesitatingly in Berlin. The growth of German prestige and the decline in favor of the Western Powers at the sultan's court is not surprising and goes far to explain the Turkish intervention on the side of the Central powers in the war of 1914-1919. Britain withdrew her opposition to the Baghdad Railway in return for promises that: http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig03a.htm (3 of 14)22.5.2005 19:17:19"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"g$biloxi 1) it would not be extended to the Persian Gulf; 2) British capitalists would be given a monopoly on the navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers and exclusive control over their irrigation projects; 3) 2 British subjects would be given seats on the Board of directors; 4) Britain would have exclusive control over commercial activities in Kuwait, the only good port on the upper Persian Gulf; 5) a monopoly over the oil resources given to a new corporation: Royal Dutch Shell Company in which British held half interest, the Germans and French a quarter interest each; JCT: Now let's take a look at these conditions again insisted upon by the British government not to obstruct someone else's railroad. 2) British businessmen were to be made rich with a monopoly; 4) British businessmen were to be made rich with control over commercial activity in Kuwait, the richest part of Iraq. 5) British businessmen were to be made rich with an oil monopoly for their company. Isn't it interesting that making some of their British businessmen rich seemed to be of such great interest to the British government. And everyone else from Turks to Germans were to lose on the deal until these privileged British were given all these concessions. Over and over, we'll see governments interceding on behalf of a few rich businessmen to the detriment of everyone else. This doesn't prove any conspiracy controlling the political apparatus of those nations but sure gives us a good hint. THE BRITISH IMPERIAL CRISIS TO 1926 Page 127 In England, the landed class obtained control of the bar and the bench and were, thus, in a position to judge all disputes about real property in their favor. Control of the courts and of the Parliament made it possible for this ruling group to override the rights of peasants in land, to eject them from the land, to enclose the open fields of the medieval system, to deprive the cultivators of their manorial rights and thus reduce them to the condition of landless rural laborers or tenants. JCT: Sounds like much of the Third World governments today, doesn't it? Small ruling groups controlling legislatures and judiciaries to the detriment of everyone but themselves. Page 130 Until 1870, there was no professorships of Fine Arts at Oxford, but in that year, thanks to a bequest,John Ruskin was named to such a chair. He hit Oxford like an earthquake, not so much because he talked about http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig03a.htm (4 of 14)22.5.2005 19:17:19"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"g$biloxi fine arts but because he talked about the empire and England's downtrodden masses as moral issues. Until the end of the nineteenth century, the poverty-stricken masses in the cities lived in want, ignorance and crime much like described by Charles Dickens. Ruskin spoke to the Oxford undergraduates as members of the privileged ruling Šclass. He told them that they were the possessors of a magnificent tradition of education, beauty, rule of law, freedom, decency, and self-discipline but that this tradition could not be saved and did not deserve to be saved, unless it could be extended to the lower classes and to the non-English masses throughout the world. If not extended to these classes, the minority upper-class would be submerged and the tradition lost. JCT: 120 years later, we can safely say that despite the big talk, there was little action in their quest to spread good times to the poor of the world. If there was ever any intention of doing more than flapping their gums for posterity. Ruskin's message had a sensational impact. His inaugural lecture was copied out in longhand by one undergraduate, Cecil Rhodes. Rhodes feverishly exploited the diamond and gold fields of South Africa, rose to be prime minister of Cape Colony, contributed money to political parties, controlled parliamentary seats both in England and South Africa. With financial support from Lord Rothschild, he was able to monopolize the diamond mines as De Beers Mines and Gold Fields. In the mid 1890s, Rhodes had a personal income of a least a million pounds (then five million dollars) a year which was spent so freely for his mysterious purposes that he was usually overdrawn on his account. These purposes centered on his desire to federate the English-speaking peoples and to bring all the habitable portions of the world under their control. JCT: This all sounds very contradictory. Cecil Rhodes writing down Ruskin's great idea to help the poor as he later helped the Rothschilds oppress the whole world with usurious debt. Unless it was written down to later provide a good laugh. Page 131 Among Ruskin's most devoted disciples at Oxford were a group of intimate friends who devoted the rest of their lives to carrying out his ideas. They were remarkably successful in these aims. JCT: Though they may have been remarkably successful in talking about these aims, they were quite remarkably unsuccessful in carrying any of them out. In 1891, Rhodes organized a secret society with members in a \"Circle of Initiates\" and an outer circle known as the \"Association of Helpers\" later organized as the Round Table organization. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig03a.htm (5 of 14)22.5.2005 19:17:19"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"g$biloxi JCT: These are the behind-the-scenes groups who have conspired to keep the poor shackled to their debts and we'll hear much more about Round Table Groups and their nefarious doings.

In 1919, they founded the Royal Institute of International Affairs. Similar Institutes of International Affairs were established in the chief British dominions and the United States where it is known as the Council on Foreign Relations. After 1925, the Institute of Pacific Relations was set up in twelve Pacific area countries. JCT: And even though the Council on Foreign Relations has been for proving ground of American rulers, whose members usually comprised of both candidates for president as well as the bulk of their administrations, it remained relatively unknown by the general population as it was never written about by the major newspapers whose publishers more often than not belonged to this secretive group. The lid of secrecy on this organization of influential rich people over so many decades seems to be more than accidental.

JCT: This is one the greatest stories about the Rothschild family where even the Rothschild of the day mentioned how silly it was for a whole nation to be coming to get credit from a private individual. Page 135 As a result of complex and secret negotiations in which Lord Rosebery was the chief figure, Britain kept Uganda, Rhodes was made a privy councilor, Rosebery replaced his father-in-law, Lord Rothschild, in Rhodes secret group and was made a trustee under Rhodes' next and last will. JCT: Cute, making it sound like Rothschild was just another member of the group when in reality, he was probably the leader of the gang.

All political control was in the hands of a rural, backward, Bible- reading, racist minority of Boers while all economic wealth was in the hands of a violent, aggressive majority of foreigners, (Utlanders) most of whom lived in Johannesburg. JCT: Boers had all the political control, aliens had all the money, and the natives had nothing. Sounds like most of the Third World today. The Utlanders, who were twice as numerous and owned two thirds of the land and nine-tenths of the wealth of the country, were prevented from participating in political life or from becoming citizens (except after 14 years residence) and were irritated by President Paul Kruger's intriguing to obtain some kind of German intervention and protection. At this point, Rhodes made his plans to overthrow Kruger's government by an uprising in Johannesburg, financed by himself and led by his brother Frank, followed by an invasion led by Frank Jameson from Rhodesia. Flora Shaw used The Times to prepare public opinion in England while others negotiated for the official support necessary. When the revolt fizzled, Jameson raided anyway and was easily captured by the Boers. The public officials involved denounced the plot, loudly proclaimed their surprise at the event, and were able to whitewash most of the participants in the subsequent parliamentary inquiry. A telegram from the German Kaiser to Kruger congratulating him on his success \"in preserving the independence of his country,\" was built up by The Times into an example of brazen German interference in British affairs, and almost eclipsed Jameson's aggression. JCT: Of course, let's give credit to the Times for having fomented what later became a war costing thousands of British lives, sort of a rehearsal for the cheerleading for the upcoming Great War where they'd lose millions of British lives. Rhodes was stopped only temporarily. For almost two years, he and his friends stayed quiet waiting for the storm to blow over. Then they Šbegan to act again. Propaganda, most of it true about the plight of the Utlanders flooded England from Flora Shaw. Milner was made British High Commissioner to South Africa; his friend Brett worked his way into the confidence of the monarchy to become its chief political advisor. Milner made provocative British troop movements on the Boer frontiers in spite of the vigorous protests of his commanding general in South Africa, who had to be removed; and finally, war was precipitated when Smuts drew up an ultimatum insisting that the British troop movements cease and when this was rejected by Milner. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig03a.htm (7 of 14)22.5.2005 19:17:19"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"g$biloxi JCT: I find these behind the scenes activities by small groups of men which push nations to war most interesting.

Page 138 The Boer War (1899-1902) was one of the most important events in British imperial history. The ability of 40,000 Boer farmers to hold off ten times as many British for three years, inflicting a series of defeats on them over that period, destroyed faith in British power. Although the Boer republics were defeated and annexed in 1902, Britain's confidence was so shaken that it made a treaty with Japan providing that if either became engaged in war with two enemies in the Far East, the other would come to the rescue. This treaty allowed Japan to attack Russia in 1904. Page 138 Milner's group, known as \"Milner's Kindergarten\" reorganized the government. By 1914, the Smuts government passed a law excluding natives from most semi-skilled or skilled work or any high-paying positions. Page 139 By the Land Act of 1913, 7% was reserved for purchases by natives and the other 93% by whites. The wages of natives were about one tenth of those of whites. JCT: Just Milner's way of extending the great British tradition to the poor people of the world. Page 141 These natives lived on inadequate and eroded reserves or in horrible urban slums and were drastically restricted in movements, residence, or economic opportunities and had almost no political or even civil rights. By 1950 in Johannesburg, 90,000 Africans were crowded into 600 acres of shacks with no sanitation with almost no running water and denied all opportunity except for animal survival and reproduction.

Page 142 In 1908, the Milner Round Table group worked a scheme to reserve the Štropical portions of Africa north of the Zambezi river for natives under such attractive conditions that the blacks south of that river would be enticed to migrate northward. Its policy would be to found a Negro dominion in which Blacks could own land, enter professions, and stand on a footing of equality with Whites. Although this project has not been achieved, it provides the key to Britain's native policies from 1917 onward. Page 143 In 1903, when Milner took over the Boer states, he tried to follow the policy that native could vote. This was blocked by the Kindergarten because they considered reconciliation with the Boers to be more urgent. In South Africa, the three native protectorates of Swaziland, Bechuanaland, and Basutoland were retained by the imperial authorities as areas where native rights were paramount and where tribal forms of living could be maintained at least partially.

I'd bet that not many people realized that these back-room boys controlled their front-room politicians that the ordinary people usually got to vote for. Still, their policies always betrayed whose interests they were really protecting.

Page 152 As a result of the 1923 continued encroachment of white settlers on native preserves, the 1930 Native Land Trust Ordinance guaranteed native reserves but these reserves remained inadequate. Page 153 Efforts to extend the use of native courts, councils and to train natives for an administrative service were met with growing suspicion based on the conviction that the whites were hypocrites who taught a religion that they did not obey, were traitors to Christ's teachings, and were using these to control the natives and to betray their interests under cover of religious ideas which the whites themselves did not observe in practice. INDIA TO 1926 Although the East India Company was a commercial firm, it had to intervene again and again to restore order, replacing one nominal ruler by another and even taking over the government of those areas where it was more immediately concerned and to divert to their own pockets some of the fabulous wealth they saw flowing by. Areas under rule expanded steadily until by 1858 they covered three-fifths of the country. JCT: Once again, we have the situation of a private company pocketing all of the fabulous wealth while leaving the local population to starve. Always backed by the British government, these companies benefited while the mass of the English people or the oppressed natives did not.

Such a debt could never be paid, in many cases, because the rate at which it was reduced was left to the creditor and could rarely be questioned by the illiterate debtor.

Here is this sentient being who replied to her \"Savings? Savings? Lady, I don't even have any clothes.\" Just another indictment of Rothschild World waiting for them on the other side.

Played down was the old and basic Hindu idea of Karma where each would reappeared again and again in a different physical form and in a different social status, each difference being a reward or punishment for the soul's conduct in at it's previous appearance. There was no real hope of escape from this cycle, except by a gradual improvement through a long series of successive appearances to the ultimate goal of complete obliteration of personality (Nirvana) by ultimate mergence in the soul of the universe (Brahma). This release (moksha) from the endless cycle of existence could be achieved only by the suppression of all desire, of all individuality and of all will to live. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig03a.htm (12 of 14)22.5.2005 19:17:19"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"g$biloxi IRELAND TO 1939 Page 173 The Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in the seventeenth century had transferred much Irish land, as plunder of war, to absentee English landlords.

This change arose from the fact that the impact of Western culture on China did, in fact, make a peasant's position economically hopeless. JCT: In the case of oppression by American corporations and moneylenders, whenever the peasants found their lot so hopeless that violence became preferable to starvation, the American administration simply labeled them communists and sent in the Marines to the approval of the sheeple at home who believed it all.

Until 1841, Canton was the only port allowed for foreign imports and opium was illegal. As a consequence of Chinese destruction of illegal Indian opium and the commercial exactions of Cantonese authorities, Britain imposed on China the treaties of Nanking (1842) and of Tientsin (1858). These forced China to cede Hong Kong to Britain and to open sixteen ports to foreign trade, to impose a uniform import tariff of no more than 5%, to pay an indemnity of about $100 million, to permit foreign legations in Peking, to allow a British official to act as head of the Chinese customs service, and to legalize the import of opium. China lost Burma to Britain, Indochina to France. Also Formosa and the Pescadores to Japan, Macao to Portugal, Kiaochow to Germany, Liaotung (including Port Arthur) to Russia, France took Kwangchowan and Britain took Kowloon and Weihaiwei. Various Powers imposed on China a system of extraterritorial courts under which foreigners in judicial cases could not be tried in Chinese courts or under Chinese law.

INTERNATIONAL SOCIALISM AND THE SOVIET CHALLENGE CHAPTER V: THE FIRST WORLD WAR THE GROWTH OF INTERNATIONAL TENSIONS 1871-1914 Page 249 Four chief reasons have been given for the intervention of the United States in World War I. 1) to secure \"freedom of the seas\" from German submarine attacks; 2)British propaganda; 3) a conspiracy by international bankers and munitions manufacturers either to protect their loans to the Entente Powers or their wartime profits from sales to these Powers; 4) Balance of Power principles to prevent Great Britain from being defeated by Germany Page 250 The fact that German submarines were acting in retaliation for the illegal British blockades of the continent of Europe and British violations of international law and neutral rights on the high seas. Britain was close to defeat in April 1917 and on that basis the United States entered the war. The unconscious assumption by American leaders that an Entente victory was inevitable was at the bottom of their failure to enforce the same rules of neutrality and international law against Britain as against Germany. They constantly assumed that British violations of these rules could be compensated with monetary damages while German violations of these rules must be resisted by force if necessary. Since they could not admit this unconscious assumption or publicly defend the legitimate basis of international power politics on which it rested, they finally went to war on an excuse which was legally weak, \"the assertion of a right to protect belligerent ships on which Americans saw fit to travel and the treatment of armed belligerent merchantmen as peaceful vessels.

This proved so dangerous because the British instructions to merchant ships to attack submarines. American protests reached a peak when the Lusitania was sunk in 1915. The Lusitania was a British merchant vessel constructed as an auxiliary cruiser carrying a cargo of 2,400 cases of rifle cartridges and 1250 cases of shrapnel with orders to attack German submarines whenever possible. The incompetence of the acting captain contributed to the heavy loss of life as did also a mysterious second explosion after the German torpedo struck. The captain was on course he had orders to avoid; he was running at reduced speed, he had an inexperienced crew; the portholes had been left open; the lifeboats had not been swung out; and no lifeboat drills had been held. Page 251 The propaganda agencies of the Entente Powers made full use of the occasion. The Times of London announced that 80% were citizens of the US (actually 15.6%); the British manufactured and distributed a medal which they pretended had been awarded to the submarine crew by the German government; a French paper published a picture of the crowds in Berlin at the outbreak of war in 1914 as a picture of Germans \"rejoicing\" at the news of the sinking of the Lusitania. The US protested violently against the submarine warfare while brushing aside German arguments based on the British blockade. It was so irreconcilable in these protests that Germany sent Wilson a note which promised that \"in the future merchant vessels within and without the war zone shall not be sunk without warning and without safeguarding human lives unless these ships try to escape or offer resistance. In return, the German government hoped that the US would put pressure on Britain to follow the established rules of international law in regard to blockade and freedom of the sea. Wilson refused to do so. It became clear to the Germans that they would be starved into defeat unless they could defeat Britain first by unrestricted submarine warfare. Since they were aware this would probably bring the US into the war against them, they made another effort to negotiate peace before resorting to it. It was rejected by the Entente Powers on Dec. 27 and unrestricted submarine attacks were resumed. Wilson broke off diplomatic relations and the Congress declared war on April 3, 1917. Page 252 Britain was unwilling to accept any peace which would leave Germany supreme on the continent or in a position to resume the commercial, naval, and colonial rivalry which had existed before 1914. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05.htm (2 of 27)22.5.2005 19:17:43"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 253 The Vatican, working through Cardinal Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII) sought a negotiated peace. On Oct 5, a German note to Wilson asked for an armistice based on the basis of the Fourteen Points which promised the end of secret diplomacy, freedom of the seas; freedom of commerce; disarmament; a fair settlement of colonial claims, with the interests of the native peoples receiving equal weight with the titles of the Imperialist Powers; the evacuation of Russia, the evacuation and restoration of Belgium, the evacuation of France and the restoration of her Alsace-Lorraine as in 1870. Page 254 The Entente Supreme War Council refused to accept the Fourteen Points as the basis for peace until Colonel House threatened that the US would make a separate peace with Germany. Page 255 Wilson had clearly promised that the peace treaty would be negotiated and based on the Fourteen Points but the Treaty of Versailles was imposed without negotiation and the Fourteen Points fared very poorly in its provisions. The subsequent claim of the German militarists that the German Army was never defeated but was \"stabbed in the back\" by the home front through a combination of international Catholics, international Jews, and international Socialists have no merit whatever. On all fronts, almost 13 million men in the various armed forces died and the war destroyed over $400 billion in property at a time when the value of every object in France and Belgium was not worth over $75 billion. Page 256 In July 1914, the military men were confident that a decision would be reached in six months. This belief was supported by the financial experts who, while greatly underestimating the cost of fighting, were confident financial resources would be exhausted in six months. By financial resources, they meant \"gold reserves.\" These were clearly limited; all the Great Powers were on the gold standard. However each country suspended the gold standard at the outbreak of war. This removed the automatic limitation on the supply of paper money. The each country proceeded to pay for the war by borrowing from the banks. The banks created the money which they lent my merely giving the government a deposit of any size against which the government could draw checks. The banks were no longer limited in the amount of credit they could create because they no longer had to pay http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05.htm (3 of 27)22.5.2005 19:17:43"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"g$biloxi out gold for checks on demand. This the creation of money in the form of credit by the banks was limited only by the demands of its borrowers. Naturally, as governments borrowed to pay for their needs, private businesses borrowed to be able to fill the government's orders. The percentage of outstanding bank notes covered by gold reserves steadily fell and the percentage of bank credit covered by either gold or bank notes fell even further. Naturally, when the supply of money was increased in this fashion faster than the supply of goods, prices rose because a larger supply of money was competing for a smaller supply of goods. People received money for making capital goods, consumer goods and munitions but they could spend their money only to buy consumer goods. The problem of public debt became steadily worse because governments were financing such a large part of their activities by bank credit. Public debts rose by 1000 percent. Page 259 Governments began to regulate imports and exports to ensure that necessary materials stayed in the country and did not go to enemy states. This led to the British blockade of Europe. Page 251 The results of the blockade were devastating. Continued for nine months after the armistice, it caused the deaths of 800,000 persons, reparations took 108,000 horses, 205,000 cattle, 426,000 sheep and 240,000 fowl. Page 262 Countries engaged in a variety of activities designed to regulate the flow of information which involved censorship, propaganda and curtailment of civil liberties. Page 263 The War Propaganda Bureau was able to control almost all information going to the American press. The Censorship and Propaganda bureaus worked together. The former concealed all stories of Entente violations of the laws of war or of the rules of humanity while the Propaganda Bureau widely publicized the violations and crudities of the Central Powers. The German violation of Belgian neutrality was constantly bewailed,while nothing was said of the Entente violation of Greek neutrality. A great deal was made of the Austrian ultimatum to Serbia while the Russian mobilization which had precipitated the war was hardly mentioned. In the Central Powers a great deal was made of the Entente encirclement while nothing was said of the Kaiser's demands for \"a place in the sun\" of the High Command's refusal to renounce annexation of any part http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05.htm (4 of 27)22.5.2005 19:17:43"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"g$biloxi of Belgium. Manufacture of outright lies by propaganda agencies was infrequent and the desired picture of the enemy was built up by a process of selection and distortion of evidence until, by 1918,many in the West regarded the Germans as bloodthirsty and sadistic militarists while the Germans regarded the Russians as \"subhuman monsters.\" A great deal was made, especially by the British, of \"atrocity\" propaganda; stories of German mutilation of bodies, violation of women, cutting off a children's hands, desecration of churches, and crucifixions of Belgians were widely believed in the West by 1916. In 1917, Henry Carter is created a story that the Germans were cooking human bodies to extract glycerine and produced pictures to prove it. Again, photographs of mutilated bodies in a Russian anti-Semitic outrage in 1905 were circulated as pictures of Belgians in 1915. There were several reasons for the use of such atrocity stories: a) to build up the fighting spirit of the mass army; b) to stiffen civilian morale; c) to encourage enlistments; d) to increase subscriptions for war bonds; e) to justify one's own breaches of international law; f) to destroy the chances of negotiating peace or to justify a severe final peace; g) to win the support of the neutrals. The relative innocence and credulity of the average person who was not yet immunized to propaganda assaults through mediums of mass communication in 1914 made the use of such stories relatively effective. But the discovery in the period after 1919 that they had been hoaxed gave rise to a skepticism toward all government communications which was especially noticeable in the Second World War. CHAPTER VI: THE VERSAILLES SYSTEM AND THE RETURN TO NORMALCY 1919- 1929 THE PEACE SETTLEMENTS 1919-1923 Page 267 The criticisms of the peace settlements was as ardent from the victors as from the vanquished aimed at the terms which were neither unfair nor ruthless. The causes of the discontent rested on the procedures which were used rather than the terms themselves. Above all, there was discontent at the contrast between the procedures which were used and the procedures which pretended to be used, as well as between the high-minded principles which were supposed to be applied and those which really were applied. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05.htm (5 of 27)22.5.2005 19:17:44"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 268 When it became clear that they were to be imposed rather than negotiated, that the Fourteen Points had been lost in the confusion, that the terms had been reached by a process of secret negotiations from which the smaller nations had been excluded, there was a revulsion against the treaties. By 1929, most of the Western World had feelings of guilt and shame whenever they thought of the Versailles Treaty. In England, the same groups, often the same people, who had made the wartime propaganda and the peace settlements were loudest in their complaint that the latter had fallen far below the ideals of the former while all the while their real aims were to use power politics to the benefit of Britain. The peace settlements were made by an organization which was chaotic and by a procedure which was fraudulent. None of this was deliberate. It arose rather from weakness and ignorance, from a failure to decide on what principles it would be based. Page 269 Since the Germans had been promised the right to negotiate, it became clear that the terms could not first be made the subject of public compromise. Unfortunately, by the time the victorious Great Powers realized all this and decided to make the terms by secret negotiations among themselves, invitations had already been sent to all the victorious powers to come to the conference. As a solution to this embarrassing situation, the peace treaty was made on two levels. On one level, in the full glare of publicity, the Inter-Allied Conference became the Plenary Peace Conference and with the considerable fanfare, did nothing. ON the other level, the Great Powers worked out their peace terms in secret and when they were ready, imposed them simultaneously on the conference and on the Germans. This had not been intended. It was not clear to anyone just what was being done. Page 271 At all these meetings, as at the Peace Conference itself, the political leaders were assisted by groups of experts and interested persons. Many of the experts were members associates of the international banking fraternity. In every case but one, where a committee of experts submitted a unanimous report, the Supreme Council accepted its recommendation. The one case where a report was not accepted was concerned with the Polish corridor, the same issue which led to the Second World War where the experts were much harsher on Germany than the final decision of the politicians.

The Germans voted to sign if the articles on war guilt and war criminals could be struck from the treaty.. When the Allies refused these concessions, the Catholic Center Party voted 64-14 not to sign. The High Command of the German army ordered the Cabinet to sign. The Treaty of Versailles was signed by all the delegations except the Chinese in protest against the disposition of the prewar German concessions in Shantung. Page 274 No progress was possible in Hungary without some solution of the agrarian question and the peasant discontent arising from monopolization of the land. The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs (acting on behalf of France's greatest industrialist, Eugene Schneider) made a deal with the Hungarians that if they would sign the Treaty of Trianon and give Schneider control of the Hungarian state railways, the port of Budapest and the Hungarian General Credit Bank, France would eventually make Hungary one of the mainstays of its anti-German bloc in Eastern Europe and, at the proper time, obtain a drastic revision of the Treaty of Trianon. Paleologue received his reward from Schneider. He was made director of Schneider's personal holding company. The Treaty of Sevres with Turkey was never signed because of the scandal caused by the Bolsheviki publication of the secret treaties regarding the Ottoman Empire, since these treaties contrasted so sharply with the expressed war aims of the Allies. The British felt that richer prospects were to be obtained from the Turkish sultan. In particular, the French were prepared to support the claims of Standard Oil to such concessions while the British were prepared to support Royal Dutch Shell. Page 277 The chief territorial disputes arose over the Polish corridor. France's Foch wanted to give all of East Prussia to Poland. Instead, the experts gave Poland access to the sea by severing East Prussia from the rest of Germany by creating a Polish corridor in the valley of the Vistula. However, the city of Danzig was clearly a German city and Lloyd George refused to give it to POland. Instead, it was a made a free city under the protection of the League of Nations. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05.htm (7 of 27)22.5.2005 19:17:44"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 279 The most violent controversies arose in regard to the boundaries of Poland. Of these, only that with Germany was set by the Treaty of Versailles. The Poles refused to accept their other frontiers and by 1920 were at war with Lithuania over Vilna, with Russia over the eastern border, with the Ukrainians over Galaicia, and with Czechoslovakia over Teschen. Page 280 These territorial disputes are of importance because they continued to lacerate relationships between neighboring states until well into the period of World War II. There were 1,000,000 Germans living in Poland, 550,000 in Hungary, 3,100,000 in Czechoslovakia, about 700,000 in Romania, 500,000 in Yugoslavia and 250,000 in Italy. To protect these minorities, the Allied Powers forced the new states to sign treaties grating a certain minimum political rights guaranteed by the League of Nations with no power to enforce observation of them. Page 282 The French were torn between a desire to obtain as large a fraction as possible of Germany's payments and a desire to pile on Germany such a crushing burden of indebtedness that Germany would be ruined beyond the point where it could threaten French security again. A compromise originally suggested by John Foster Dulles was adopted by which Germany was forced to admit an unlimited, theoretical obligation to pay but was actually bound to pay for only a limited list of ten categories of obligations with pensions being larger than the preceding nine categories together. All reparations were wiped out in the financial debacle of 1931-1932. Page 283 Britain had obtained all her chief ambitions. The German navy was at the bottom of Scapa Flow scuttled by the the Germans themselves; the German merchant fleet was scattered, captured, destroyed; the German colonial rivalry was ended and its areas occupied; the German commercial rivalry was crippled by the loss of its patents and industrial techniques, the destruction of all its commercial outlets and banking connections throughout the world, and the loss of its rapidly growing prewar markets. France on the other hand, had not obtained the one thing it wanted: security.

Thus the stated policy was based on support of the League of Nations and of disarmament yet the real policy was quite different. While openly supporting Naval disarmament, Britain signed a secret agreement with France which blocked disarmament and signed an agreement with Germany which released her from her naval disarmament in 1935. After 1935, the contrast between the public and secret policy became so sharp that Lord Halifax called it \"dyarchy.\" Page 289 The British Right forced France to give away every advantage which it held over Germany. Germany was allowed to rearm in 1935, allowed to remilitarize the Rhineland in 1936. Finally, when all had been lost, public opinion forced the British government to abandon the Right's policy of appeasement and adopt the old French policy of resistance made on a poor issue (Poland 1939) In France, as in Britain, there appeared a double policy. While France continued to talk of collective security, this was largely for public consumption for in fact she had no policy independent of Britain's policy of appeasement. Page 290 War was not outlawed but merely subjected to certain procedural delays in making it, nor were peaceful procedures for settling international disputes made compulsory. The Covenant had been worded by a skillful British lawyer, Civil Hurst, who filled it with loopholes cleverly concealed under a mass of impressive verbiage so that no state's freedom of action was vitally restricted. Page 293 The Locarno Pacts, which were presented at the time throughout the English-speaking world as a sensational contribution to the peace and stability of Europe, really formed the background for the events of 1938 when Czechoslovakia was destroyed at Munich. When the guarantee of Locarno became due in 1936, Britain dishonored its agreement, the Rhine was remilitarized and the way was open for Germany to move eastward. Poland protested violently at the refusal to guarantee her frontiers.

The British government reserved certain areas, notably the Middle East, where it wished to be able to wage wars which could not be termed self-defence in a strict sense. The US also made reservation preserving its right to make war under the Monroe doctrine. The net result was that only aggressive war was to be renounced. The Kellogg-Briand Pact took one of the first steps toward destroying the legal distinction between war and peace, since the Powers, having renounced the use of war, began towage wars without declaring them as was done by Japan in China in 1937, by Italy in Spain in 1936 and by everyone in Korea in 1950. Page 296 The outlawry of war was relatively meaningless without some sanctions that could compel the use of peaceful methods. Efforts in this direction were nullified by Britain. DISARMAMENT 1919-1935 Page 303 Disarmament suggestions of the Soviet representative, Litvinoff, providing for immediate and complete disarmament of every country, was denounced by all. A substitute draft provided that the most heavily armed states would disarm by 50%, the less heavily-armed by 31% and the lightly armed by 25%, and the disarmed by 0%. That all tanks, planes, gas and heavy artillery be completely prohibited was also rejected without discussion and Litvinoff was beseeched to show a more \"constructive spirit.\" Page 305 Once it was recognized that security was in acute danger, financial considerations were ruthlessly subordinated to rearmament giving rise to an economic boom which showed clearly what might have been achieved earlier if financial consideration had been subordinated to the world's economic and social needs earlier; such action would have provided prosperity and rising standards of living which might have made rearming unnecessary. JCT: How true. REPARATIONS 1919-1932 Page 305 The preliminary payments were supposed to amount to a total of 20 billion marks by May 1921.

Under pressure, Germany accepted this bill and gave the victors bonds of indebtedness. Of these, 82 billion were set aside and forgotten. Germany was to pay the other 50 billion at 2.5 billion a year in interest and .5 billion a year to reduce the total debt. JCT: It would only take 200 years to pay off a total of 500 billion in interest and 50 billion in principal. Page 306 Germany could only pay if two conditions prevailed: a) if it had a budgetary surplus and b) if it sold abroad more than it bought abroad. Since neither of these conditions generally existed in the period 1921-1931, Germany could not, in fact, pay reparations. The failure to obtain a budgetary surplus was solely the responsibility of the government which refused to reduce its own expenditures or the standards of living off its own people or to tax them sufficiently heavily. The failure to obtain a favorable balance of trade because foreign creditors refused to allow a free flow of German goods into their own countries. Thus creditors were unwilling to accept payment in the only way in which payments could honestly be made, that is, by accepting German goods and services. JCT: Notice they wanted money and not the goods they could buy with it. Germany could have paid in real goods and services if the creditors had been willing to accept such goods and services. The government made up the deficits by borrowing from the Reichsbank. The result was an acute inflation which was not injurious to the influential groups though it was generally ruinous to the middle classes and thus encouraged extremist elements. Page 307 On Jan 9,1923, the Reparations Committee voted 3 to 1 (Britain opposing France, Belgium and Italy) that Germany was in default. Armed forces of the three nations began to occupy the Ruhr two days later. Germany declared a general strike in the area, ceased all reparation payments, and adopted a program of passive resistance, the government supporting the strikers by printing more paper money. The area occupied was no more than 60 miles long by 30 miles wide but contained 10% of Germany's population and produced 80% of Germany's coal, iron and steel and 70% of her freight traffic. Almost 150,000 Germans were deported.

The Dawes Plan was largely a J.P. Morgan production drawn up by an international committee of financial experts presided over by American banker Charles Dawes. Germany paid reparations for five years (1924-1929) and owed more at the end than it had owed at the beginning. It is worthy of note that this system was set up by the international bankers and that the subsequent lending of other people's money to Germany was very profitable to these bankers. Using these American loans, Germany's industry was largely rebuilt to make it the second best in the world and to pay reparations. Page 309 By these loans Germany's creditors were able to pay their war debts to England without sending goods or services. Foreign exchange went to Germany as loans, back to Italy, Belgium, France and Britain as reparations and finally back to the US as payments on war debts. In that period, Germany paid 10.5 billion marks in reparations but borrowed 18.6 billion abroad. Nothing was settled by all this but the international bankers sat in heaven under a rain of fees and commissions. Page 310 The Dawes Plan was replaced by the Young Plan, named after the American Owen Young (a Morgan agent). A new private bank called the Bank for International Settlements was established in Switzerland. Owned by the chief central banks of the world and holding accounts for each of them, \"a Central Bankers' Bank,\" it allowed payments to be made by merely shifting credits from one country's account to another on the books of the bank. The Young Plan lasted for less than 18 months. The crash of the New York stock market in 1929 marked the end of the decade of reconstruction and ended the American loans to Germany. Germans and others had begun a \"flight from the mark\" which created a great drain on the German gold reserve. As it dwindled, the volume of money and credit erected on that reserve had to be reduced by raising the interest rate. Prices fell because of the reduced money supply so that it became almost impossible for the banks to sell collateral to obtain funds to meet the growing demand for money.

To meet this run,the Austrian banks called in all the funds they had in German banks. The German banks began to collapse. These latter began to call in all their funds in London. The London banks began to fall and gold flowed outward. On Sept.21, England was forced off the gold standard. The Reichsbank lost 200 million marks of its gold reserve in the first week of June and a billion in the second. The discount rate was raised step by step to 15% without stopping the loss of reserves but destroying the activities of the German industrial system almost completely. Germany begged for relief on her reparations payments but her creditors were reluctant unless they obtained similar relief on the war-debt payments to the US. The President suggested a moratorium for one year if its debtors would extend the same privilege to their debtors. Page 312 At the June 1932 Lausanne Conference, German reparations were cut to a total of only 3 billion marks but the agreement was never ratified because of the refusal of the US Congress to cut war debts equally drastically. In 1933, Hitler repudiated all reparations. CHAPTER VII: FINANCE, COMMERCIAL POLICY, AND BUSINESS POLICY 1897-1947 REFLATION AND INFLATION 1897-1925 page 315 A real understanding of the economic history of twentieth century Europe is imperative to any understanding of the events of the period. Such an understanding will require a study of the history of finance. Page 316 The outbreak of war in 1914 showed these financial capitalists in their worst, narrow in outlook, ignorant and selfish, while proclaiming, as usual, their total devotion to the social good. They generally agreed that war could not go on for more than six to ten months because of the \"limited financial resources\" of the belligerents (by which they meant gold reserves).This idea reveals the fundamental misunderstanding of the nature and of money on the part of the very persons who were reputed to be experts on the subject. Wars are not fought with gold or even with money but by proper organization of real resources. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05.htm (13 of 27)22.5.2005 19:17:44"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"g$biloxi The attitudes of bakers were revealed most clearly in England, where every move was dictated by efforts to protect their own position and to profit from it rather than by considerations of economic mobilization for war or the welfare of the British people. War found the British banking system insolvent in the sense that its funds, created by the banking system for profit and rented out to the economic system to permit it to operate, could not be covered by the existing volume of gold reserves or collateral which could be liquidated rapidly. Accordingly,the bankers secretly devised a scheme by which their obligations could be met by fiat money (so-called Treasury Notes), but as soon as the crisis was over, they ten insisted that the government must pay for the war without recourse to fiat money (which was always damned by the bankers as immoral) but by taxation and by borrowing at high interest rates from the bankers. The decision to use Treasury Notes to fulfill the bankers' liabilities was made on July 25, 1915 by Sir John Bradbury. the first Treasury Notes were run off the presses at Waterloo and Sons on July 28th. It was announced that the Treasury Notes, instead of gold, would be used for bank payments. The discount rate was raised at the Bank of England from 3% to 10% to prevent inflation, a figure taken merely because the traditional rule of the bank stated that a 10% bank rate would draw gold out of the ground itself. Page 317 At the outbreak of war, most of the belligerent countries suspended gold payments and accepted their bankers' advice that the proper way to pay for the war was by a combination of bank loans and taxation of consumption. The governments paid for the war by taxation, by fiat money, by borrowing from banks (which created credit for the purpose) and by borrowing from the people by selling them war bonds. Each of these methods had a different effect upon the two consequences of the war: inflation and public debt. a) Taxation gives no inflation and no debt. b) Fiat money gives inflation and no debt. c) Bank credit gives inflation and debt. d) Sales of bonds give no inflation but give debt. It would appear from this table that the best way to pay for the war would be by taxation and the worst way would be by bank credit. Probably the best way to finance war is a combination of the four methods. Page 318 In the period 1914-1918, the various belligerents used a mixture of these four methods but it was a mixture dictated by expediency and false theories so that at the end of the war all countries found http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05.htm (14 of 27)22.5.2005 19:17:44"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"g$biloxi themselves with both public debts and inflation. While the prices in most countries rose 200 to 300 percent and public debts rose 1000%, the financial leaders tried to keep up the pretense that the money was as valuable as it had ever been. For this reason, they did not openly abandon the gold standard. Instead, they suspended certain attributes of the gold standard. In most countries, payments in gold and export of gold were suspended but every effort was made to keep gold reserves up to a respectable percentage of notes. These attributes were achieved in some cases by deceptive methods. In Britain, the gold reserves against notes fell from 52% to 18% in the month of July 1914; then the situation was concealed, partly by moving assets of local banks into the Bank of England and using them as reserves for both, partly by issuing a new kind of notes (Currency Notes) which had no real reserve and little gold backing. Page 320 As soon as the war was over, governments began to turn their attention to restoring the prewar financial system. Since the essential element was believed to be the gold standard, this movement was called \"stabilization.\" Productive capacity in both agriculture and industry had been increased by the artificial demand of the war period to a degree far beyond the ability of normal domestic demand to buy the products. JCT: But not to eat them. The backwards areas had increased their outputs of raw materials and food so greatly that the total could hardly have been sold. JCT: But no eaten. The result was as situation where all countries were eager to sell and reluctant to buy. The only sensible solution to this problem of excessive productive capacity would have been a substantial rise in domestic standards of living but this would have required a fundamental reapportionment of the national income so that claims to this product of the excess capacity would go to those masses eager to consume, rather than continue to go to the minority desiring to save. Such reform was rejected by the ruling groups in both \"advanced\" and \"backwards\" countries so that this solution was reached only to a small degree in a relatively few countries (chiefly US and Germany in 1925-1929). Page 324 The powers of financial capitalism had another far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05.htm (15 of 27)22.5.2005 19:17:44"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"g$biloxi acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences. The apex of the system was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basle, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the world's central banks which were themselves private corporations. Each central bank sought to dominate its government by its ability to control Treasury loans, to manipulate foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the country, and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world. In each country, the power of the central bank rested largely on its control of credit and money supply. In the world as a whole the power of the central bankers rested very largely on their control of loans and the gold flows. They made agreements on all the major financial problems of the world, as well as on many of the economic and political problems, especially in reference to loans, payments, and the economic future of the chief areas of the globe. The Bank of International Settlements, B.I.S. is generally regarded as the apex of the structure of financial capitalism whose remote origins go back to the creation of the Bank of England in 1694. Page 325 It was set up to be the world cartel of every-growing national financial powers by assembling the nominal heads of these national financial centers. The commander in Chief of the world system of banking control was Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, who was built up by the private bankers to a position where he was regarded as an oracle in all matters of government and business. In government, the power of the Bank of England was a considerable restriction on political action as early as 1819 but an effort to break this power by a modification of the bank's charter in1844 failed. In 1852, Gladstone, then chancellor of the Exchequer and later Prime Minister, declared, \"The hinge of the whole situation was this: the government itself was not to be a substantive power in matters of Finance, but was to leave the Money Power supreme and unquestioned.\" This power of the Bank of England was admitted in 1924 by Reginald McKenna, who had been Chancellor of the Exchequer, when he, as Chairman, told the stockholders of the Midland bank, \"I am afraid the ordinary citizen will not like to be told that the banks can, and do, create money. And they who control the credit of a nation direct the policy if Governments and hold in the hollow of their hands the destiny of the people.\" In that same year, Sir Drummond Fraser, vice- president of the Institute of Bankers stated, \"The Governor must be the autocrat who dictates the terms upon which alone the Government can obtain borrowed money.\" On Sep. 26, 1921, Vincent Vickers, director of the bank, the Financial Times wrote, http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05.htm (16 of 27)22.5.2005 19:17:44"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"g$biloxi \"Half a dozen meant the top of the Big Five Banks could upset the whole fabric of government by refraining from renewing Treasury Bills.\" Page 326 Norman had no use for governments and feared democracy. Both of these seemed to him to be threats to private banking and thus to all that was proper and precious to human life. He viewed his life as a kind of cloak-and-dagger struggle with the forces of unsound money which were in league with anarchy and Communism. When he rebuilt the Bank of England,he constructed it as a fortress prepared to defend itself against any popular revolt. For much of his life, he rushed about the world under the assumed name of \"Professor Skinner.\" Norman had a devoted colleague in Benjamin Strong, the first governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Strong owed his career to the favor of the Morgan bank. In the 1920s, they were determined to use the financial power of Britain and the US to force all the major countries of the world to go on the gold standard and to operate it through central banks free from all political control, with all questions of international finance to be settled by agreements by such central banks without interference from governments. Page 327 It must not be felt that these heads of the world's chief central banks were themselves substantive powers in world finance. They were not. Rather, they were the technicians and agents of the dominant investment bankers of their own countries, who had raised them up and were perfectly capable of throwing them down. The substantive financial powers of the world were in the hands of investment bankers (also called \"international\" or \"merchant\" bankers) who remained largely behind the scenes in their own unincorporated private banks. These formed system of international cooperation and national dominance which was more private,more powerful, and more secret tan that of their agents in the central banks. This dominance of investment bankers was based on their control over the flows of credit and investment funds in their own countries and throughout the world. They could dominate the financial and industrial systems of their own countries by their influence over the flow of current funds through bank loans,the discount rate,the rediscounting of commercial debts; they could dominate governments by their control over current government loans and the play of the international exchanges. Almost all of this power was exercised by the personal influence and prestige men who had demonstrated their ability in the past to bring off successful financial coups, to keep their word, to remain http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05.htm (17 of 27)22.5.2005 19:17:44"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"g$biloxi cool in a crisis, and to share their winning opportunities with their associates. In this system, the Rothschilds had been preeminent during much of the nineteenth century, but, at the end of that century, they were being replaced by J.P. Morgan in New York. At the present stage, we must follow the efforts of the central bankers to compel the world to return to the gold standard of 1914. Page 328 The problem of public debts arose from the fact that as money (credit) was created, it was usually made in such a way that it was not in the control of the state but was in the control of private financial institutions which demanded real wealth at some future date for the creation of claims on wealth in the present. The problem of public debt could have been met in one or more of several fashions: a) by increasing the amount of real wealth... b) by devaluation... c) by repudiation... d) by taxation... e) by the issuance of fiat money and the payment of the debt by such money. Page 329 Efforts to pay the public debt by fiat money would have made the inflation problem worse. Orthodox theory rejected fiat money as solutions to the problem. Page 332 In Britain, the currency notes which had been used to supplement bank notes were retired and credit was curtailed by raising the discount rate to panic level. The results were horrible. Business activity fell drastically and unemployment rose to well over a million and a half. The outcome was a great wave of strikes and industrial unrest. Page 333 To maintain the gold reserve at all, it was necessary to keep the discount rate at a level so high (4.5% or more) that business activity was discouraged. As a result of this financial policy, Britain found herself faced with deflation and depression for the whole period of 1920-1923. The number of unemployed averaged about 1.75 millions for each of the thirteen years of 1921-1932 and reached 3 million in 1931. Belgium, France and Italy, accepted orthodox financial ideas and tried to deflate in 1920-1921 but after the depression which resulted, they gave up the task. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05.htm (18 of 27)22.5.2005 19:17:44"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 334 The Dawes Plan provided the gold reserves which served to protect Germany from the accepted principles of orthodox finance. Page 336 Financial capitalism had little interest in goods at all, but was concerned entirely with claims on wealth - stocks, bonds, mortgages, insurance, proxies, interest rates, and such. It built railroads in order to sell securities, not to transport goods. Corporations were built upon corporations in the form of holding companies so that securities were issued in huge quantities bringing profitable fees and commissions to financial capitalists without any increase in economic production whatever. Indeed, these financial capitalists discovered that they could not only make killings out of the issuing of such securities,they could also make killings out of the bankruptcy of such corporations through the fees and commissions of reorganization. A very pleasant cycle of flotation, bankruptcy, flotation, bankruptcy began to be practiced by these financial capitalists. The more excessive the flotation, the greater the profits and the more imminent the bankruptcy. The more frequent the bankruptcy, the greater the profits of reorganization and the sooner the opportunity of another excessive flotation. Page 337 The growth of financial capitalism made possible a centralization of world economic control and a use of this power for the direct benefit of financiers and the indirect injury of all other economic groups. Financial control could be exercised only imperfectly through credit control and interlocking directorates. Page 338 The real key rested on the control of money flows which were held by investment bankers in 1900. THE PERIOD OF DEFLATION, 1927-1936 Page 339 After 1929, deflation reached a degree which could be called acute. In the first part of this period (1921-1925), the dangerous economic implications of deflation were concealed by a structure of self-deception which pretended that a great period of economic progress would be inaugurated as soon as the task of stabilization had been accomplished. This psychological optimism was completely unwarranted by the economic facts. After 1925, when deflation became http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05.htm (19 of 27)22.5.2005 19:17:44"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"g$biloxi more deep-rooted and economic conditions worsened, the danger from these conditions was concealed by a continuation of unwarranted optimism. THE CRASH OF 1929 Page 342 When France stabilized the franc at a level at which it was devalued, the Bank of France sold francs in return for foreign exchange. The francs were created as credit in France thus giving an inflationary effect. Page 343 The financial results of the stock market book in the U S was credit diverted from production to speculation and increasing amounts of funds being drained from the economic system into the stock market where they circulated around and around, building up prices of securities. Page 344 Early in 1929, the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System became alarmed at the stock market speculations draining credit from industrial production. To curtail this, they called upon member banks to reduce their loans on stock collateral to reduce the amount of credit available for speculation. Instead, the available credit went more and more to speculation and decreasingly to productive business. Call money rates in New York which had reached 7% at the end of 1928 were at 13% by June 1929. Page 346 To restore confidence among the wealthy (who were causing the panic) an effort was made to balance the budget by cutting public expenditures drastically. This, by reducing purchasing power, had injurious effects on business activity and increased unrest among the masses of the people. Page 350 Washington left gold in 1933 voluntarily in order to follow an unorthodox financial program of inflation. Page 351 The Thomas Amendment to the Agricultural Adjustment Act (1933) gave the president the power to devaluate the dollar up to 50%, to issue up to $3 billion fiat money,and to engage on an extensive program of public spending. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05.htm (20 of 27)22.5.2005 19:17:44"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 352 The economies of the different countries were so intertwined with one another that any policy of self-interest on the part of one would be sure to injure others in the short run and the country in the long run. The international and domestic economic systems had developed to the point where the customary methods of thought and procedure in regard to them were obsolete. page 353 As a result of the crisis, regardless of the nature of its primary impact, all countries began to pursue policies of economic nationalism. This spread rapidly as a result of imitation and retaliation. Page 355 The Bank of France raised its discount rate from 2.5% to 6% in 1935 with depressing economic results. In this way, the strain on gold was relieved at the cost of increased depression. The Right discovered that it could veto any actions of the Left government merely by exporting capital from France. Page 356 The franc passed through a series of depreciations and partial devaluations which benefited no one except the speculators and left France torn for years by industrial unrest and class struggles. The government was subjected to systematic blackmail by the well-to-do of the country because of the ability of these persons to prevent social reform, public spending, arming, or any policy of decision by selling francs. Page 357 The historical importance of the banker-engendered deflationary crisis of 1927-1940 can hardly be overestimated. It gave a blow to democracy and to the parliamentary system and thus became a chief cause of World War II. It so hampered the Powers which remained democratic by its orthodox economic theories that these were unable to rearm for defence. It gave rise to a conflict between the theorists of orthodox and unorthodox financial methods. The bankers' formula for treating a depression was by clinging to the gold standard, by raising interest rates and seeking deflation, and by insisting on a reduction in public spending, a fiscal surplus or at least a balanced budget. These ideas were rejected totally, on a point by point basis, by the unorthodox economists, (somewhat mistakenly called Keynesian). The bankers' formula sought to encourage economic recovery by \"restoring http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05.htm (21 of 27)22.5.2005 19:17:44"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"g$biloxi confidence in the value of money,\" that is, their own confidence in what was the primary concern of bankers. The unorthodox theorists sought to restore purchasing power by increasing, instead of reducing, the money supply and by placing it in the hands of potential consumers rather than in the banks or in the hands of investors. page 358 The whole relationship of money and resources remained a puzzle to many and was still a subject of debate in the 1950s but at least a great victory had been won by man in his control of his own destiny when the myths of orthodox financial theory were finally challenged in the 1930s. REFLATION AND INFLATION 1933-1947 Page 360 Except for Germany and Russia, most countries in the latter half of 1937 experienced sharp recession. Page 361 As a result of the failure of most countries (excepting Germany and Russia) to achieve full utilization of resources, it was possible to devote increasing percentages of resources to armaments without suffering any decline in the standards of living. Page 366 It was discovered by Germany in 1932, by Italy in 1934, by Japan in 1936 and by the United States in 1938 that deflation could be prevented by rearming. Page 368 Britain made barter agreements with various countries, including one direct swap of rubber for wheat with the US. Page 369 The period of reflation after 1933 was caused by increases in public spending on armaments. In most countries,the transition from reflation to inflation did not occur until after they had entered the war. Germany was the chief exception and possibly also Italy and Russia, since all of these were making fairly full utilization of their resources. In France and the other countries overrun by Germany, such full mobilization of resources was not achieved before they were defeated. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05.htm (22 of 27)22.5.2005 19:17:44"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 370 The use of orthodox financing in the First World War had left a terrible burden of intergovernmental debts and ill-feeling...

This was most notable in the absence of a post-war depression which was widely expected but which did not arrive because there was no effort to stabilize on a gold standard. The major difference was the eclipse of the bankers who have been largely reduced in status from the masters to the servants of the economic system. This has been brought about by the new concern with real economic factors instead of with financial counters, as previously. As part of this program, there has been a great reduction in the economic role of gold. CHAPTER VIII: INTERNATIONAL SOCIALISM AND THE SOVIET CHALLENGE Page 375 Industrialism, especially in its early years, brought with it social and economic conditions which were admittedly horrible. Human beings were brought together around factories to form great new cities which were sordid and unsanitary. In many cases, these persons were reduced to conditions of animality, which shock the imagination. Crowded together in want and disease, with no leisure and no security, completely dependent on weekly wage which was less than a pittance, they worked twelve to fifteen hours a day for six days in the week among dusty and dangerous machines with no protection against inevitable accidents, disease, or old age, and returned at night to crowded rooms without adequate food and lacking light, fresh air, heat, pure water, or sanitation. These conditions have been described for us in the writings of novelists such as Dickens in England, Hugo or Zola in France. Page 376 The Socialist movement was a reaction against these deplorable conditions to the working masses. It has been customary to divide this movement into two parts at the year 1848, the publication of the Communist Manifesto of Karl Marx. This work began with the ominous sentence, \"A specter is haunting Europe - the specter of Communism,\" and ended with the trumpet blast \"Workers of the world, unite.\" In general, the former division believed that man was innately good and that all coercive power was bad, with public authority the worst form of such coercive power. All the world's evils, according to the anarchists, arose because man's innate goodness was corrupted and distorted by coercive power. The remedy, they felt, was to destroy the http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05.htm (23 of 27)22.5.2005 19:17:44"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"g$biloxi state. The simplest way to destroy the state would be to assassinate the chief of the state to ignite a wholesale uprising of oppressed humanity. Page 377 Syndicalism was a somewhat more realistic and later version of anarchism. It was equally determined to abolish all public authority. The state would be destroyed by a general strike and replaced by a flexible federation of free associations of workers. The second group of radical social theorists wished to widen the power and scope of governments by giving them a dominant role in economic life. The group divided into0 two chief schools: The Socialists and the Communists. Page 378 From Ricardo, Marx derived the theory that the value of economic goods was based on the amount of labor put into them. Page 379 Marx built up a complicated theory which believed that all history is the history of class struggles. The money which the bourgeoisie took from the proletariat in the economic system made it possible for them to dominate the political system, including the police and the army. From such exploitation, the bourgeoisie would become richer and richer and fewer and fewer in numbers and acquire ownership of all property in the society while the proletariat would become poorer and poorer and more and more numerous and be driven closer and closer to desperation. Eventually, the latter would rise up and take over. Page 381 In fact, what occurred was could be pictured as cooperative effort by unionized workers and monopolized industry to exploit unorganized consumers by raising prices higher and higher, quite contrary to the expectations of Marx. Where he had expected impoverishment of the masses and concentration of ownership with gradual elimination of the middle classes, there occurred instead rising standards of living, dispersal of ownership , a relative decrease in the numbers of laborers, and a great increase in the middle classes. Due to income and inheritance taxes, the rich became poorer and poorer, relatively speaking.

The Bolshevik group seized the centers of government in St. Petersburg and within 24 hours, issued a series of decrees which abolished the Provisional government, ordered the end of the war with Germany and the distribution of large land holdings to the peasants. Page 387 By 1920 industrial production in general was about 13% of the 1913 figure. At the same time, paper money was printed so freely to pay for the costs of war, civil war, and the operation of the government that prices rose rapidly and the ruble became almost worthless. The secret police (Cheka) systematically murdered all real or potential opponents. Page 388 Various outsider Powers also intervened in the Russian chaos. An allied expeditionary force invaded northern Russia from Murmansk and Archangel, while a force of Japanese and another of Americans landed at Vladivostok and pushed westward for hundreds of miles. The British seized the oil fields of the Caspian region (late 1918) while the French occupied parts of the Ukraine about Odessa (March 1919). By 1920, Russia was in complete confusion. Poland invaded Russia occupying much of the Ukraine. Page 389 As part of this system, not only were all agricultural crops considered to be government property but all private trade and commerce were also forbidden; the banks were nationalized while all industrial plants of over five workers and all craft enterprises of over ten workers were nationalized. This culminated in peasant uprisings and urban riots. Within a week, peasant requisitioning was abandoned in favor of a \"New Economic Policy\" of free commercial activity in agriculture and other commodities, with the re-establishment of the profit motive and of private ownership in small industries and in small landholding. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05.htm (25 of 27)22.5.2005 19:17:44"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 395 The Bolsheviks insisted that the distribution of income in a capitalistic society would become so inequitable that the masses of the people would not obtain sufficient income to buy the goods being produced by the industrial plants. As such unsold goods accumulated with decreasing profits and deepening depression, there would be a shift toward the production of armaments to provide profits and produce goods which could be sold and there would be an increasingly aggressive foreign policy in order to obtain markets for unsold goods in backward and undeveloped countries. Such aggressive imperialism would inevitably make Russia a target of aggression in order to prevent a successful Communist system there from becoming an attractive model for the discontented proletariat in capitalistic countries. Page 396 Communism in Russia alone required that the country must be industrialized with breakneck speed and must emphasize heavy industry and armaments rather than rising standards of living. This meant that goods produced by the peasants must be taken from them by political duress, without any economic return, and that the ultimate in authoritarian terror must be used to prevent the peasants from reducing their level of production. It was necessary to crush all kinds of foreign espionage, resistance to the Bolshevik state, independent thought, or public discontent. Page 397 Stalin forced the peasants off their land. In the space of six weeks, (Feb-Mar 1930) collective farms increased from 59,400 with 4.4 million families to 110,200 farms with 14.3 million families. All peasants who resisted were treated with violence; their property was confiscated, they were beaten or sent into exile in remote areas; many were killed. This process, known as \"the liquidation of the kulaks\" affected five million kulak families. Rather than give up their animals, many peasants killed them. The number of cattle was reduced from 30.7 million in 1928 to 19.6 million in 1933. The planting season of 1930 was entirely disrupted. Three million peasants starved in 1931-1933. Stalin told Churchill that 12 million died in this reorganization of agriculture.

All restrictions on maximum salaries were removed. Special stores were established where the privileged could obtain scarce goods at low prices; restaurants with different menus were set up in industrial plants for different levels of employees; housing discrimination became steadily wider. Page 402 As public discontent and social tensions grew, the use of spying, purges, torture and murder increased out of all proportion. Every wave of discontent resulted in new waves of police activity. Hundreds of thousands were killed while millions were arrested and exiled to Siberia or put into huge slave-labor camps. Estimates vary from two million as high as twenty million. Page 403 For every leader who was publicly eliminated, thousands were eliminated in secret. By 1939, all the leaders of Bolshivism had been driven from public life and most had died violent deaths. There were two networks of secret-police spies, unknown to each other, one serving the special department of the factory while the other reported to a high level of the secret police outside. Page 404 Whenever the secret police needed more money it could sweep large numbers of persons, without trial or notice, into its wage deduction system or into its labor camps to be hired out. It would seem that the secret police were the real rulers of Russia. This was true except at the very top where Stalin could always liquidate the head by having him arrested by his second in command in return for Stalin's promise to promote the arrester to the top position. In this way, the chiefs of the secret police were successively eliminated.

Name me one other historian who has had the nerve to cite the conspiracy by international bankers and munitions manufacturers to protect their loans and sales to the Entente Powers. Surely given this reason jives with the reasons for most of the other wars in our history must imply that fulfilling the wishes of the moneylenders to profit from the carnage is far more important than the other three possible reasons given. As we'll soon see, reason #1 was a red herring since the British were as much of a threat to the freedom of the seas as the Germans were. Reason #2 is certainly valid though I'd call it more a tactic than a cause. The bankers and munitions makers in a hurry to get their nations into the bloodletting controlled the British propaganda that was used to enflame British and American sheeple to clamor for war. If ever you delve deeper into the service records of the sons of bankers, you'll notice that they invariably serve as majors and colonels in military inteligence. The back-room bankers always seem to serve in back-room activity. So it's no wonder that the press owned by the bankers who wanted the war created the public opinion wanting war. And let's never forget that the media do not poll the public opinion, they create it. I think Chomsky's \"Manufacturing Consent\" is one of the best books available on how the elite control the media in favor of the war-making proclivities. Unfortunately, the guys who promote all these wars and their children never seem to be in the front lines. Oh if only those who lobby for war could be put in the http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05a.htm (1 of 22)22.5.2005 19:17:51"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"g$biloxi front lines, there would be far fewer wars. Page 250 The fact that German submarines were acting in retaliation for the illegal British blockades of the continent of Europe and British violations of international law and neutral rights on the high seas. JCT: Aha, so the \"protection of the seas\" was a red herring since there would have been no such need for protection had the British not been involved in an illegal blockade. Of course, the Versailles Treaty forced the Germans to accept all the blame for the war but this certainly does imply that the illegal British blockade had some effect in forcing the Germans to retaliate. Britain was close to defeat in April 1917 and on that basis the United States entered the war. The unconscious assumption by American leaders that an Entente victory was inevitable was at the bottom of their failure to enforce the same rules of neutrality and international law against Britain as against Germany. They constantly assumed that British violations of these rules could be compensated with monetary damages while German violations of these rules must be resisted by force if necessary. JCT: Let us not forget that President Wilson was always in favor of getting American boys involved in the foreign war as he campaigned for the presidency on his campaign promise \"not to send your boys to any foreign wars.\" I'm always amazed when these kinds of Big Lies get forgotten by historians and that's the reason I have to mention them. When world leaders like Wilson state bald-faced lies, there must be a very interesting underlying reason. Since they could not admit this unconscious assumption or publicly defend the legitimate basis of international power politics on which it rested, they finally went to war on an excuse which was legally weak, \"the assertion of a right to protect belligerent ships on which Americans saw fit to travel and the treatment of armed belligerent merchantmen as peaceful vessels. Both assumptions were contrary to reason and to settled law and no other professed neutral advanced them.\" JCT: So Quigley does point out that the reason given for the American intervention in the first world war was a false pretext. What's interesting is that so many great American wars were based on false pretexts: 1) Spain was falsely blamed for the sinking of the Maine in Havana Harbor as pretext for the Spanish American war; 2) The sinking of the munitions ship Lusitania and these other reasons as pretext for the First World war as well as false allegations of the Germans bayonetting babies; http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05a.htm (2 of 22)22.5.2005 19:17:51"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"g$biloxi 3) Ignoring code-breakers who informed Roosevelt of the Japanese approaching Pearl Harbor for the Second World War; 4) False PT boat attacks on destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin as pretext for the Vietnam war; 5) False allegations that Khadafi disco bombing of US servicemen as pretext to bomb Khadafi's daughter; I don't believe US allegations about the Lockerbie bombing either as recent stories indicate they don't have much of a case other than having convinced the UN to apply sanctions. 6) False allegations of Iraqis killing the incubator babies in Kuwait made by a Kuwaiti princess disguised as a nurse by a public relations firm for the Iraqi war. 7) Bombing the Sudan factory on the false allegation that it was making chemical weapons, recently disproved, though no apology for those killed. It's sad to say that you can't believe anything the American administration ever says about someone they have labelled an enemy. They seem to make great use of the \"killing babies\" allegations and the American public seems to swallow it every time. The Germans at first tried to use the established rules of international law regarding destruction of merchant vessels. This proved so dangerous because the British instructions to merchant ships to attack submarines. American protests reached a peak when the Lusitania was sunk in 1915. The Lusitania was a British merchant vessel constructed as an auxiliary cruiser carrying a cargo of 2,400 cases of rifle cartridges and 1250 cases of shrapnel with orders to attack German submarines whenever possible. The incompetence of the acting captain contributed to the heavy loss of life as did also a mysterious second explosion after the German torpedo struck. The captain was on course he had orders to avoid; he was running at reduced speed, he had an inexperienced crew; the portholes had been left open; the lifeboats had not been swung out; and no lifeboat drills had been held. JCT: Just like the Maine, they had a mysterious explosion and everything seems to indicate that the Lusitania was sent into dangerous waters in the hopes of being torpedoed with no concern for the loss of life. After all, if Roosevelt didn't kind having a couple of thousand American boys killed at Pearl Harbor to get them into the war after promising like Wilson not to send them to war, why wouldn't we believe that Wilson didn't mind having a thousand American tourists killed on the Lusitania to get the US into the war after promising not to send their boys to war. Page 251 The propaganda agencies of the Entente Powers made full use of the http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05a.htm (3 of 22)22.5.2005 19:17:51"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"g$biloxi occasion. The Times of London announced that 80% were citizens of the US (actually 15.6%); the British manufactured and distributed a medal which they pretended had been awarded to the submarine crew by the German government; a French paper published a picture of the crowds in Berlin at the outbreak of war in 1914 as a picture of Germans \"rejoicing\" at the news of the sinking of the Lusitania. JCT: And of course, I must remind you that the propaganda agencies were owned and operated by the bankers and munitions makers who wanted their neighbors kids to join in the slaughter that would prove to profitable to them. With Rothschild media on one side of the Atlantic and Rockefeller media on the other side both clamoring for war and publishing false pretexts for it, is it any wonder that the American people went from a majority not wanting to get involved to a majority wanting to get involved virtually overnight. Who can blame them when they assume that their media have checked the facts they are not in a position to check themselves and when they can't believe that some men would want to foment wars purely from a business profit point of view. The US protested violently against the submarine warfare while brushing aside German arguments based on the British blockade. It was so irreconcilable in these protests that Germany sent Wilson a note which promised that \"in the future merchant vessels within and without the war zone shall not be sunk without warning and without safeguarding human lives unless these ships try to escape or offer resistance. In return, the German government hoped that the US would put pressure on Britain to follow the established rules of international law in regard to blockade and freedom of the sea. Wilson refused to do so. It became clear to the Germans that they would be starved into defeat unless they could defeat Britain first by unrestricted submarine warfare. Since they were aware this would probably bring the US into the war against them, they made another effort to negotiate peace before resorting to it. It was rejected by the Entente Powers on Dec. 27 and unrestricted submarine attacks were resumed. Wilson broke off diplomatic relations and the Congress declared war on April 3, 1917. JCT: So the British were breaking the rules of war and when the Germans fought back in the only way they could, it was blown up in the media to be a cause of involvement. This ignoring the violations of one side while being critical of the other side is not a new tactic. We'll see it being employed over and over in upcoming wars. I myself therefore would assign blame on the illegal British blockade as the true cause of the U-boat attacks, something that most people aren't even aware of since most history books don't mention it. In every historical piece on the first world war, Quigley's books is http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05a.htm (4 of 22)22.5.2005 19:17:51"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"g$biloxi the first time that I have ever heard that the Germans U-boat attacks were in retaliation for being starved by an illegal British blockade. All historical accounts simply lay the blame on German bloodthirsiness. Also, the fact that the German Government took out ads in New York papers warning people that the Lusitania was carrying munitions and might be attacked for that reason never seem to make the news. The point is that the back-room boys wanted an incident for war and the best kinds of incidents needed dead people. And in all the cases listed above, they got the dead people just as planned. Page 252 Britain was unwilling to accept any peace which would leave Germany supreme on the continent or in a position to resume the commercial, naval, and colonial rivalry which had existed before 1914. JCT: So Britain insisted on sending millions of its boys to their deaths even though most Britons didn't benefit by their intransigence, only the bankers who financed and profited by the butchery. Page 253 The Vatican, working through Cardinal Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII) sought a negotiated peace. On Oct 5, a German note to Wilson asked for an armistice based on the basis of the Fourteen Points which promised the end of secret diplomacy, freedom of the seas; freedom of commerce; disarmament; a fair settlement of colonial claims, with the interests of the native peoples receiving equal weight with the titles of the Imperialist Powers; the evacuation of Russia, the evacuation and restoration of Belgium, the evacuation of France and the restoration of her Alsace-Lorraine as in 1870. JCT: Again, no one benefitted by the refusal to make an early peace except Rothschild and Rockefeller banking and munitions enterprises. Page 254 The Entente Supreme War Council refused to accept the Fourteen Points as the basis for peace until Colonel House threatened that the US would make a separate peace with Germany. Page 255 Wilson had clearly promised that the peace treaty would be negotiated and based on the Fourteen Points but the Treaty of Versailles was imposed without negotiation and the Fourteen Points fared very poorly in its provisions. The subsequent claim of the German militarists that the German Army was never defeated but was \"stabbed in the back\" by the home front through a combination of international Catholics, http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05a.htm (5 of 22)22.5.2005 19:17:51"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"g$biloxi international Jews, and international Socialists have no merit whatever. JCT: Considering that the Germans surrendered upon the promise of the Fourteen points, the fact that the Fourteen Points fared very poorly is certainly a good reason for German militarists to have felt that they were sold out by their representatives at Versailles. On all fronts, almost 13 million men in the various armed forces died and the war destroyed over $400 billion in property at a time when the value of every object in France and Belgium was not worth over $75 billion. JCT: One relevant fact was not mentioned, how much money Rothschild and Rockefeller made before, during and after all the devastation, Page 256 In July 1914, the military men were confident that a decision would be reached in six months. This belief was supported by the financial experts who, while greatly underestimating the cost of fighting, were confident financial resources would be exhausted in six months. By financial resources, they meant \"gold reserves.\" These were clearly limited; all the Great Powers were on the gold standard. However each country suspended the gold standard at the outbreak of war. This removed the automatic limitation on the supply of paper money. The each country proceeded to pay for the war by borrowing from the banks. The banks created the money which they lent my merely giving the government a deposit of any size against which the government could draw checks. The banks were no longer limited in the amount of credit they could create because they no longer had to pay out gold for checks on demand. This the creation of money in the form of credit by the banks was limited only by the demands of its borrowers. Naturally, as governments borrowed to pay for their needs, private businesses borrowed to be able to fill the government's orders. The percentage of outstanding bank notes covered by gold reserves steadily fell and the percentage of bank credit covered by either gold or bank notes fell even further. Naturally, when the supply of money was increased in this fashion faster than the supply of goods, prices rose because a larger supply of money was competing for a smaller supply of goods. People received money for making capital goods, consumer goods and munitions but they could spend their money only to buy consumer goods. The problem of public debt became steadily worse because governments were financing such a large part of their activities by bank credit. Public debts rose by 1000 percent. JCT: Notice that getting off the gold standard and using paper money worked just fine in financing the war. Now some will point out http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05a.htm (6 of 22)22.5.2005 19:17:51"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"g$biloxi that this caused some inflation, and I won't disagree given that some much of the production backing up that new issue of money ended up being blown up. But had paper money been issued in exchange for useful production during the Depression rather than war production, it wouldn't have been blown up and no such inflation would occur. This issuing paper money in exchange for new non-blastable collateral, much like a casino cashier issues new chips in exchange for pledged collateral, does not cause inflation no matter the knee- jerk reaction of all economists to the issuance of any new money by unorthodox methods. Only as long as banks create the money and governments borrow it from banks do economists find the creation of money okay but moment government Treasuries do it and cut out banker middlemen, they they invariably scream inflation. Anyway, we have here a good indication that unorthodox financial methods of creating and issuing money would work fine as long as production backing up the new money isn't slated to be exploded or destroyed. And note that the government public debts to Rothschild and Rockefeller grew by 1000%. Not a bad profit for them with only the slaughter of their neighbors kids as the cost. You can bet none of their kids were on the front lines though I sure wish they had been. Page 259 Governments began to regulate imports and exports to ensure that necessary materials stayed in the country and did not go to enemy states. This led to the British blockade of Europe. Page 251 The results of the blockade were devastating. Continued for nine months after the armistice, it caused the deaths of 800,000 persons, reparations took 108,000 horses, 205,000 cattle, 426,000 sheep and 240,000 fowl. JCT: So they kept on killing Germans for many months after the war. That's another fact I'd never heard about before reading Quigley. Had anyone else heard that the continued blockade killed almost a million more people after the war? Page 262 Countries engaged in a variety of activities designed to regulate the flow of information which involved censorship, propaganda and curtailment of civil liberties. Page 263 The War Propaganda Bureau was able to control almost all information going to the American press. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05a.htm (7 of 22)22.5.2005 19:17:51"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"g$biloxi The Censorship and Propaganda bureaus worked together. The former concealed all stories of Entente violations of the laws of war or of the rules of humanity while the Propaganda Bureau widely publicized the violations and crudities of the Central Powers. The German violation of Belgian neutrality was constantly bewailed, while nothing was said of the Entente violation of Greek neutrality. A great deal was made of the Austrian ultimatum to Serbia while the Russian mobilization which had precipitated the war was hardly mentioned. In the Central Powers a great deal was made of the Entente encirclement while nothing was said of the Kaiser's demands for \"a place in the sun\" of the High Command's refusal to renounce annexation of any part of Belgium. JCT: And why would the media have slanted the news this way? It would have been pretty tough to get the children of the sheeple to march off to the drums of war if the truth had been told. Manufacture of outright lies by propaganda agencies was infrequent and the desired picture of the enemy was built up by a process of selection and distortion of evidence until, by 1918, many in the West regarded the Germans as bloodthirsty and sadistic militarists while the Germans regarded the Russians as \"subhuman monsters.\" A great deal was made, especially by the British, of \"atrocity\" propaganda; stories of German mutilation of bodies, violation of women, cutting off a children's hands, desecration of churches, and crucifixions of Belgians were widely believed in the West by 1916. In 1917, Henry Carter is created a story that the Germans were cooking human bodies to extract glycerine and produced pictures to prove it. Again, photographs of mutilated bodies in a Russian anti-Semitic outrage in 1905 were circulated as pictures of Belgians in 1915. There were several reasons for the use of such atrocity stories: a) to build up the fighting spirit of the mass army; b) to stiffen civilian morale; c) to encourage enlistments; d) to increase subscriptions for war bonds; e) to justify one's own breaches of international law; f) to destroy the chances of negotiating peace or to justify a severe final peace; g) to win the support of the neutrals. JCT: I think the most important reason was f) because a negotiated peace would have ended the Rothschilds and Rockefellers' profits from munitions manufacturer. The others were certainly necessary but making sure there was no peace had to be number one and it sure worked. The Rothschilds and Rockefellers revelled in gore galore. The relative innocence and credulity of the average person who http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05a.htm (8 of 22)22.5.2005 19:17:51"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"g$biloxi was not yet immunized to propaganda assaults through mediums of mass communication in 1914 made the use of such stories relatively effective. But the discovery in the period after 1919 that they had been hoaxed gave rise to a skepticism toward all government communications which was especially noticeable in the Second World War. JCT: What a joke. They were skeptical until the next set of hoax pretexts and then joined the parades marching off to the next war as eagerly as they always had. We just have look at recent false pretexts to appreciate just how effective R&R's media control is at getting the booboisie to cheer the next and then the next bloodlettings. CHAPTER VI: THE VERSAILLES SYSTEM AND THE RETURN TO NORMALCY 1919- 1929 THE PEACE SETTLEMENTS 1919-1923 Page 267 The criticisms of the peace settlements was as ardent from the victors as from the vanquished aimed at the terms which were neither unfair nor ruthless. The causes of the discontent rested on the procedures which were used rather than the terms themselves. Above all, there was discontent at the contrast between the procedures which were used and the procedures which pretended to be used, as well as between the high-minded principles which were supposed to be applied and those which really were applied. JCT: So the Germans really got screwed. Page 268 When it became clear that they were to be imposed rather than negotiated, that the Fourteen Points had been lost in the confusion, that the terms had been reached by a process of secret negotiations from which the smaller nations had been excluded, there was a revulsion against the treaties. By 1929, most of the Western World had feelings of guilt and shame whenever they thought of the Versailles Treaty. In England, the same groups, often the same people, who had made the wartime propaganda and the peace settlements were loudest in their complaint that the latter had fallen far below the ideals of the former while all the while their real aims were to use power politics to the benefit of Britain. JCT: So the Germans really got screwed.. The peace settlements were made by an organization which was chaotic and by a procedure which was fraudulent. None of this was deliberate. It arose rather from weakness and ignorance, from a failure to decide on what principles it would be based. JCT: Quigley must think we're pretty gullible if he thinks we're http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05a.htm (9 of 22)22.5.2005 19:17:51"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"g$biloxi going to believe that none of it was deliberate. You just have to look at how once again Rothschild and Rockefeller interests reaped a fortune from the Versailles reparations to realize how non-accidental it really was. They profited because they knew exactly what they were doing. Page 269 Since the Germans had been promised the right to negotiate, it became clear that the terms could not first be made the subject of public compromise. Unfortunately, by the time the victorious Great Powers realized all this and decided to make the terms by secret negotiations among themselves, invitations had already been sent to all the victorious powers to come to the conference. As a solution to this embarrassing situation, the peace treaty was made on two levels. On one level, in the full glare of publicity, the Inter-Allied Conference became the Plenary Peace Conference and with the considerable fanfare, did nothing. On the other level, the Great Powers worked out their peace terms in secret and when they were ready, imposed them simultaneously on the conference and on the Germans. This had not been intended. It was not clear to anyone just what was being done. JCT: I'm sure that it was pretty clear to the bankers agents in charge of most of the negotiations and seems pretty clear that it had been intended that it would not be clear just what was being done. Page 271 At all these meetings, as at the Peace Conference itself, the political leaders were assisted by groups of experts and interested persons. Many of the experts were members associates of the international banking fraternity. JCT: Are these the members of the international banking fraternity that it wasn't clear to? Are these the guys who didn't intend the results that occured? Was the fact the bankers made a financial killing all accidental? It's funny how Quigley can report this kind of information then conclude they accidentally made themselves rich with processes no one understood. In every case but one, where a committee of experts submitted a unanimous report, the Supreme Council accepted its recommendation. The one case where a report was not accepted was concerned with the Polish corridor, the same issue which led to the Second World War where the experts were much harsher on Germany than the final decision of the politicians. JCT: So in all cases, the shameful Versailles Treaty were the product of the word of the international banking experts and the one case where they weren't listened to, they wanted to screw the Germans even more so that there would be even greater grievances to lead to http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05a.htm (10 of 22)22.5.2005 19:17:51"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"g$biloxi the Second World War where they also who made a killing. Page 272 The German delegation offered to accept the disarmament sections and reparations if the Allies would withdraw any statement that Germany had, alone, caused the war and would re-admit Germany to the world's markets. JCT: Considering how many times the Germans had tried to make peace while the British would not and how it was an illegal British blockade which led to the unrestricted submarine warfare, I can understand why many Germans would resent having the sole blame for the war placed on them. I myself would place the millions of dead at the feet of the bankers controlling the politicians in London who made sure there was no peace, not at the feet of the Germans who it seems did try. Page 273 The Allies answer accused the Germans of sole guilt in causing the war and of inhuman practices during it. The Germans voted to sign if the articles on war guilt and war criminals could be struck from the treaty. When the Allies refused these concessions, the Catholic Center Party voted 64-14 not to sign. The High Command of the German army ordered the Cabinet to sign. The Treaty of Versailles was signed by all the delegations except the Chinese in protest against the disposition of the prewar German concessions in Shantung. JCT: So we can understand how Hitler could have made good use of the resentment felt by most Germans at the politicians who accepted the sole blame for the war. This resentment can be said to be one of the main reasons Hitler found much of his support. Also, being forced to make reparations payments for the war for another 70 years was another good reason that they preferred to fight a second war rather than pay through the nose until 1990. Page 274 No progress was possible in Hungary without some solution of the agrarian question and the peasant discontent arising from monopolization of the land. The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs (acting on behalf of France's greatest industrialist, Eugene Schneider) made a deal with the Hungarians that if they would sign the Treaty of Trianon and give Schneider control of the Hungarian state railways, the port of Budapest and the Hungarian General Credit Bank, France would eventually make Hungary one of the mainstays of its anti-German bloc in Eastern Europe and, at the proper time, obtain a drastic revision of the Treaty of Trianon. Paleologue received his reward from Schneider.

JCT: This may seem that it was only one preson in the French government pursuing policies to the benefit of one rich man but you can bet others in the government were in on the deal. Remember how Britain obstructed the Turkish railway until rich British businessmen were granted concessions? This is just more of the same, governments pursuing policies to the benefit of the Rothschild and their agents. The Treaty of Sevres with Turkey was never signed because of the scandal caused by the Bolsheviki publication of the secret treaties regarding the Ottoman Empire, since these treaties contrasted so sharply with the expressed war aims of the Allies. The British felt that richer prospects were to be obtained from the Turkish sultan. In particular, the French were prepared to support the claims of Standard Oil to such concessions while the British were prepared to support Royal Dutch Shell. JCT: The French were supporting claims to Rockefeller's Standard Oil concessions and the British were supporting claims to Rothschild's Shell Oil concessions. What else is new? Page 277 The chief territorial disputes arose over the Polish corridor. France's Foch wanted to give all of East Prussia to Poland. Instead, the experts gave Poland access to the sea by severing East Prussia from the rest of Germany by creating a Polish corridor in the valley of the Vistula. However, the city of Danzig was clearly a German city and Lloyd George refused to give it to Poland. Instead, it was a made a free city under the protection of the League of Nations. JCT: Notice that even though Danzig was a German city, it was this issue which was at the root of the dispute between Germany and Poland upon which the British and France went to war with Germany in 1939. Had they not severed East Prussia from Germany in this way, there would have been no World War Two. Interestingly, had they not severed Kuwait from Iraq to give it to a few rich families so they could loot the oil reserves with the Oil companies, there would have been no 1991 Desert Storm war. It's interesting to note now many of the partitions of land later resulted in wars, almost as if the bankers at Versailles were planning new profitable war ventures years in advance. Page 279 The most violent controversies arose in regard to the boundaries of Poland. Of these, only that with Germany was set by the Treaty of Versailles. The Poles refused to accept their other frontiers and by 1920 were at war with Lithuania over Vilna, with Russia over the eastern border, with the Ukrainians over Galaicia, and with http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05a.htm (12 of 22)22.5.2005 19:17:51"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Czechoslovakia over Teschen. Page 280 These territorial disputes are of importance because they continued to lacerate relationships between neighboring states until well into the period of World War II. There were 1,000,000 Germans living in Poland, 550,000 in Hungary, 3,100,000 in Czechoslovakia, about 700,000 in Romania, 500,000 in Yugoslavia and 250,000 in Italy. To protect these minorities, the Allied Powers forced the new states to sign treaties grating a certain minimum political rights guaranteed by the League of Nations with no power to enforce observation of them. JCT: So decisions made by the bankers at Versailles continued to lacerate relationships between neighboring states right into the Second World War. We might have thought that these territorial partitions were accidental if the bankers weren't still making so much money out of those later wars. Page 282 The French were torn between a desire to obtain as large a fraction as possible of Germany's payments and a desire to pile on Germany such a crushing burden of indebtedness that Germany would be ruined beyond the point where it could threaten French security again. A compromise originally suggested by John Foster Dulles was adopted by which Germany was forced to admit an unlimited, theoretical obligation to pay but was actually bound to pay for only a limited list of ten categories of obligations with pensions being larger than the preceding nine categories together. All reparations were wiped out in the financial debacle of 1931-1932. JCT: One interesting fact that I ran into that Quigley never mentioned was the so-called French \"carbide ring,\" the trial of a group of French industrialists who continued to do business with Germany during the war whose sales supported the Germans to such an extent that the carbide ring were charged with providing the means by which Germans could kill French soldiers. Of course, the trial was fixed and they beat the charge and even though the French branch of the Rothschild family weren't charged, they probably should have been. Even the judge decried the prosecution's inept handling of the case and maybe the fact that they were acquitted is the reason Quigley didn't mention their profits from the deaths of the own countrymen. Of course, the German branch of the Rothschild family probably sold the war material necessary for the British and French to kill Germans in the same way. Remember that they are hailed as patriotic by the prospective nations for their financial support of their individual war efforts without the realization that it still boils down to their making money no matter who wins. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05a.htm (13 of 22)22.5.2005 19:17:51"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 283 Britain had obtained all her chief ambitions. The German navy was at the bottom of Scapa Flow scuttled by the the Germans themselves; the German merchant fleet was scattered, captured, destroyed; the German colonial rivalry was ended and its areas occupied; the German commercial rivalry was crippled by the loss of its patents and industrial techniques, the destruction of all its commercial outlets and banking connections throughout the world, and the loss of its rapidly growing prewar markets. France on the other hand, had not obtained the one thing it wanted: security. JCT: So while many British and French families were attending funerals for their sons and daughters, some British businessmen were attending celebrations of the destruction of their German competition. SECURITY 1919-1935 Page 287 The British governments of the Right began to follow a double policy: a public policy in which they spoke loudly in support of the foreign policy of the Left; and a secret policy in which they supported the foreign policy of the Right. JCT: I love noting instances where governments say one thing while doing the other. Of course, the biggest lies are the ones that lead to the deaths of millions such as Wilson and Roosevelt intending to send American kids to war while promising not to. These kinds of lesser government lies may not result in the deaths of many of their nation's children but they always result in more money for the bankers. Thus the stated policy was based on support of the League of Nations and of disarmament yet the real policy was quite different. While openly supporting Naval disarmament, Britain signed a secret agreement with France which blocked disarmament and signed an agreement with Germany which released her from her naval disarmament in 1935. After 1935, the contrast between the public and secret policy became so sharp that Lord Halifax called it \"dyarchy.\" JCT: Okay, so these decision did facilitate German rearmament making the Second World War easier to start after giving the Germans good reason to resent war guilt and 70 years of reparations payments. Page 289 The British Right forced France to give away every advantage which it held over Germany. Germany was allowed to rearm in 1935, allowed to remilitarize the Rhineland in 1936. Finally, when all had been lost, public opinion forced the British government to abandon the Right's policy of appeasement and adopt the old French policy of resistance made on a poor issue (Poland 1939) http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05a.htm (14 of 22)22.5.2005 19:17:51"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"g$biloxi In France, as in Britain, there appeared a double policy. While France continued to talk of collective security, this was largely for public consumption for in fact she had no policy independent of Britain's policy of appeasement. JCT: What they call appeasement was really the bankers providing the opportunity to rearm after having provided the reason for great resentment. Some say that the bankers didn't really want to make all those war profits during the Second World War and their efforts to enable Germany to rearm so they could fight the oppressive conditions of the Versailles Treaty was just accidental doings of their banking agents at the Conference. I see a darker side of it all and conclude that they screwed the Germans so royally intending them to finally fight back. Page 290 War was not outlawed but merely subjected to certain procedural delays in making it, nor were peaceful procedures for settling international disputes made compulsory. The Covenant had been worded by a skillful British lawyer, Civil Hurst, who filled it with loopholes cleverly concealed under a mass of impressive verbiage so that no state's freedom of action was vitally restricted. JCT: In other words, though many nations of the world wanted tight conditions on warmaking and war declaring, Civil Hurst, probably another banker's agent, provided the loopholes that permitted the freedom of action to make war. It's not too often that we can pin the blame for the deaths of millions so clearly on one person but I think Mr. Hurst's soul deserves to burn in Hell even if he was doing nothing more than following Rothschild orders. Page 293 The Locarno Pacts, which were presented at the time throughout the English-speaking world as a sensational contribution to the peace and stability of Europe, really formed the background for the events of 1938 when Czechoslovakia was destroyed at Munich. When the guarantee of Locarno became due in 1936, Britain dishonored its agreement, the Rhine was remilitarized and the way was open for Germany to move eastward. Poland protested violently at the refusal to guarantee her frontiers. JCT: Now you can bet that it wasn't the mothers of the first war's dead soldiers who were promoting the German rearmament. About the only British I can imagine saw any profit in such rearmament were the usual bankers betting on another profitable war.

The British government reserved certain areas, notably the Middle East, where it wished to be able to wage wars which could not be termed self-defence in a strict sense. The US also made reservation preserving its right to make war under the Monroe doctrine. The net result was that only aggressive war was to be renounced. The Kellogg-Briand Pact took one of the first steps toward destroying the legal distinction between war and peace, since the Powers, having renounced the use of war, began towage wars without declaring them as was done by Japan in China in 1937, by Italy in Spain in 1936 and by everyone in Korea in 1950. JCT: So every attempt to deter war-making is defeated by the British and American governments. Again, they are not acting in the interests of the mothers and orphans of the recently slain but again they were acting in the interests of bankers who profit from these orphan-making activities. Page 296 The outlawry of war was relatively meaningless without some sanctions that could compel the use of peaceful methods. Efforts in this direction were nullified by Britain. JCT: Not to blame British politicians in particular but let us not forget that the the real big money bankers did reside in London and New York at the time so it makes sense that they would be the most pliable bankers' agents. So let's be precise and say that peacemaking efforts were scuttled more by politicians under banker control rather than politicians who loved attending funerals though their policies certainly did help the business of morticians. Somehow I'd have to bet that Rothschilds and Rockefellers would have cornered the market on morticians considering they profit by all other areas of the bloodletting. DISARMAMENT 1919-1935 Page 303 Disarmament suggestions of the Soviet representative, Litvinoff, providing for immediate and complete disarmament of every country, was denounced by all. A substitute draft provided that the most heavily armed states would disarm by 50%, the less heavily-armed by 31% and the lightly armed by 25%, and the disarmed by 0%. That all tanks, planes, gas and heavy artillery be completely prohibited was also rejected without discussion and Litvinoff was beseeched to show a more \"constructive spirit.\" JCT: Once again, efforts to curtail war-making potential are scuttled by the back-room forces who consider such actions as \"non- constructive.\" The only people who can say that ending war-making capacity is not constructive must be those who profit by such http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05a.htm (16 of 22)22.5.2005 19:17:51"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"g$biloxi destruction and the only people who regularly profit from war are the bankers.

JCT: This is a major point. If financial considerations were subordinated to productive enterprise, it would give rise to an economic boom in favor of wealth production. The fact that financial considerations interfere with productive enterprise is the tragedy of the past several millenia. It is crucial to appreciate what Quigley is saying here. He's saying that the men who control the financial system permitted an economic boom once mankind was involved in destroying itself but would not permit such a boom when mankind wanted to make productive wealth. I consider the greatest crime of the Rothschild and Rockefellers. We could have been in an era of abundance but they diverted it to an era of destruction. Quite an indictment they'll have to face when they get to the other side. REPARATIONS 1919-1932 Page 305 The preliminary payments were supposed to amount to a total of 20 billion marks by May 1921. Although the Entente Powers contended that only 8 billion had been paid, the whole matter was dropped when the Germans were presented with a total reparations bill of 132 billion marks. Under pressure, Germany accepted this bill and gave the victors bonds of indebtedness. Of these, 82 billion were set aside and forgotten. Germany was to pay the other 50 billion at 2.5 billion a year in interest and .5 billion a year to reduce the total debt. JCT: It would only take 100 years to pay off a total of 250 billion in interest and 50 billion in principal. Page 306 Germany could only pay if two conditions prevailed: a) if it had a budgetary surplus and b) if it sold abroad more than it bought abroad. Since neither of these conditions generally existed in the period 1921-1931, Germany could not, in fact, pay reparations. The failure to obtain a budgetary surplus was solely the responsibility of the government which refused to reduce its own http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05a.htm (17 of 22)22.5.2005 19:17:51"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"g$biloxi expenditures or the standards of living off its own people or to tax them sufficiently heavily.

Thus creditors were unwilling to accept payment in the only way in which payments could honestly be made, that is, by accepting German goods and services. JCT: Notice they wanted money and not the goods that they would buy with that money. This means that they'd have to again fight to convert their production into scarce money instead of just paying with bartered products. This is standard usurious problem of the whole world. You can't pay your banker with increased production. He wants only cash so you must fight to sell your production before you can pay. Germany could have paid in real goods and services if the creditors had been willing to accept such goods and services. The government made up the deficits by borrowing from the Reichsbank. The result was an acute inflation which was not injurious to the influential groups though it was generally ruinous to the middle classes and thus encouraged extremist elements. JCT: So financial policies were at the root of the acute inflation and the general malaise which ruined the middle class and made them so thankful to Hitler when he used a national LETS system to provide them with currency to generate full employment while the rest of the world suffered the worst unemployment and depression in recorded history. Page 307 On Jan 9,1923, the Reparations Committee voted 3 to 1 (Britain opposing France, Belgium and Italy) that Germany was in default. Armed forces of the three nations began to occupy the Ruhr two days later. Germany declared a general strike in the area, ceased all reparation payments, and adopted a program of passive resistance, the government supporting the strikers by printing more paper money. The area occupied was no more than 60 miles long by 30 miles wide but contained 10% of Germany's population and produced 80% of Germany's coal, iron and steel and 70% of her freight traffic. Almost 150,000 Germans were deported. JCT: Again, pissing them off to the point where they were ready to go to war to fight back. Page 308 A compromise was reached by which Germany accepted the Dawes Plan for reparations and the Ruhr was evacuated. The Dawes Plan was largely a J.P. Morgan production drawn up by an international committee of financial experts presided over by American banker Charles Dawes. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig05a.htm (18 of 22)22.5.2005 19:17:51"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Germany paid reparations for five years (1924-1929) and owed more at the end than it had owed at the beginning.

It is worthy of note that this system was set up by the international bankers and that the subsequent lending of other people's money to Germany was very profitable to these bankers. Using these American loans, Germany's industry was largely rebuilt to make it the second best in the world and to pay reparations. JCT: At least he admits that war reparations were very profitable to the bankers. I don't think they were profitable to anyone else. Page 309 By these loans Germany's creditors were able to pay their war debts to England without sending goods or services. Foreign exchange went to Germany as loans, back to Italy, Belgium, France and Britain as reparations and finally back to the US as payments on war debts. In that period, Germany paid 10.5 billion marks in reparations but borrowed 18.6 billion abroad. Nothing was settled by all this but the international bankers sat in heaven under a rain of fees and commissions. JCT: I must point out that you'll read this kind of frank honest information in no other history book that I know of. I've heard that it's available at amazon.com and if it is, I'd recommend it to the library of any monetary reformer. Page 310 The Dawes Plan was replaced by the Young Plan, named after the American Owen Young (a Morgan agent). A new private bank called the Bank for International Settlements was established in Switzerland. Owned by the chief central banks of the world and holding accounts for each of them, \"a Central Bankers' Bank,\" it allowed payments to be made by merely shifting credits from one country's account to another on the books of the bank. The Young Plan lasted for less than 18 months. The crash of the New York stock market in 1929 marked the end of the decade of reconstruction and ended the American loans to Germany. JCT: The Young Plan had projected Germany payments lasting until 1990 and considering how the Dawes plan had ended up with them owing more at the end of the plan than when it started, it's not unrealistic to assume that in 1990, they might have again owed more than when they started and possibly renegotiated payments for another 60 or 70 years.

As it dwindled, the volume of money and credit erected on that reserve had to be reduced by raising the interest rate. Prices fell because of the reduced money supply so that it became almost impossible for the banks to sell collateral to obtain funds to meet the growing demand for money. JCT: Here Quigley tells us loans are savings and has forgotten that he had earlier told us it was new credit. Page 311 On May 8, 1931, the largest Austrian bank, the Credit-Anstalt (a Rothschild institution) which controlled 70% of Austria's industry, announced a $140 million schillings loss. The true loss was over a billion and the bank had been insolvent for years. The Rothschilds and the Austrian government gave the Credit-Anstalt 160 million to cover the loss but public confidence had been destroyed. A run began on the bank. To meet this run, the Austrian banks called in all the funds they had in German banks. The German banks began to collapse. These latter began to call in all their funds in London. The London banks began to fall and gold flowed outward. On Sept.21, England was forced off the gold standard. The Reichsbank lost 200 million marks of its gold reserve in the first week of June and a billion in the second. The discount rate was raised step by step to 15% without stopping the loss of reserves but destroying the activities of the German industrial system almost completely. JCT: I always find it amazing that all the bankers have to do is withdraw money from circulation precipitating a panic and everything shuts down. Even though they have the same men, machinery, resources, and with the only change being a withdrawal of money from circulation and all industrial activity is paralyzed by a mental impediment. It's the reason I wrote the poem about the ants being superior to men in http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/pombank.htm \"MOTHER NATURE In Mother Nature, ants you see, no slouchers, not a one, They manage full employment which man has yet begun.

The President suggested a moratorium for one year if its debtors would extend the same privilege to their debtors. Acceptance of this plan was delayed by French demands which were rejected by the U.S. Page 312 At the June 1932 Lausanne Conference, German reparations were cut to a total of only 3 billion marks but the agreement was never ratified because of the refusal of the US Congress to cut war debts equally drastically. In 1933, Hitler repudiated all reparations. JCT: Someone had to or they'd still be owing today. Though I may be giving the Rothschilds and Rockefellers a rough time, I'm sure that in the new LETS world of future, they'll jump at the chance to change their names and not be associated with their murderous forbears. I can't help feeling an complete contempt for their kind. I consider them the kind of people who would steal the medicine money from a dying child, not because they need it but just so they can sit on a bigger pile they'll never be able to spend, not because they need it but just so the dying child doesn't get it.

CHAPTER VII: FINANCE, COMMERCIAL POLICY, AND BUSINESS POLICY 1897-1947 REFLATION AND INFLATION 1897-1925 page 315 A real understanding of the economic history of twentieth century Europe is imperative to any understanding of the events of the period. Such an understanding will require a study of the history of finance. JCT: That we can't find any other recent historians to say this indicates how important Quigley is to finding out about real history. Page 316 The outbreak of war in 1914 showed these financial capitalists in their worst, narrow in outlook, ignorant and selfish, while proclaiming, as usual, their total devotion to the social good. They generally agreed that war could not go on for more than six to ten months because of the \"limited financial resources\" of the belligerents (by which they meant gold reserves). This idea reveals the fundamental misunderstanding of the nature and of money on the part of the very persons who were reputed to be experts on the subject. Wars are not fought with gold or even with money but by proper organization of real resources. JCT: Gee, because they didn't understand how credit could work to finance a war that would last 5 years, we accidentally stumbled into a war that profited them over 5 years. Though this could be true of the Professor Flahertys of the world who teach these falsehoods to their students while actually believing them themselves, it can't be true for the few higher bankers who understand the banking system as well as we who understand that once the gold runs out, the credit can http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig07a.htm (1 of 28)22.5.2005 19:18:00"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"g$biloxi finance everything even better than the gold ever could. We find that Quigley often repeats the theme of international bankers stumbling into such profitable wars accidentally, the only serious errors I've found in his work. If he were right that history if mostly accidental, then one would expect that the half the accidents might benefit us. Yet, that all the accidents always benefit the bankers must indicate that these are not accidental policies at all. The attitudes of bankers were revealed most clearly in England, where every move was dictated by efforts to protect their own position and to profit from it rather than by considerations of economic mobilization for war or the welfare of the British people. War found the British banking system insolvent in the sense that its funds, created by the banking system for profit and rented out to the economic system to permit it to operate, could not be covered by the existing volume of gold reserves or collateral which could be liquidated rapidly. JCT: So we know that Quigley understands that money is created by the banking system for profit and rented out to the economic system to permit it to operate implying that they could choose not to permit the economic system to operate, as they often have done. Accordingly,the bankers secretly devised a scheme by which their obligations could be met by fiat money (so-called Treasury Notes), but as soon as the crisis was over, they then insisted that the government must pay for the war without recourse to fiat money (which was always damned by the bankers as immoral) but by taxation and by borrowing at high interest rates from the bankers. JCT: Only in times of crisis, usually war or deprivation severe enough for the population to revolt, would the bankers not object too much to \"Treasury Notes\" interest-free which they call fiat money but then would insist that it be paid for with money created by the bankers and borrowed at high interest. What's interesting is that bankers' money is also \"fiat money\" though they never all it so. Just like Abraham Lincoln's Treasury Notes are created by the Treasury money plates and borrowed by the government interest-free to cover expenses, Bankers' Notes are created by bankers money plates and borrowed by the government at interest to cover those same expenses. There is no difference between the fiat money created by a government Treasury and the fiat money created by a group of private bankers except that in the case of government money, taxation need only recuperate the original principal of the loan while in the case of banker money, taxation needs to recuperate both the original principal of the loan and interest to pay private bankers. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig07a.htm (2 of 28)22.5.2005 19:18:00"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"g$biloxi I've always felt that my four minute Plates poem taken from my Poem to the Queen in the Crucial Information section of my web site best explains the disadvantages of using bankers' fiat money compared to using government fiat money: When you were little, did you ever dream of printing cash? Of filling up your wallet with some money in a flash? Creating money accurately means TO HAVE THE PLATES, The stamping of some paper into notes best demonstrates; Or stamping metal into coins; or blips computerized, Into your bank account deposits, checks now authorized. So whether paper, metal, volts of electricity, TO HAVE THE PLATES is printing money absolutely free. Now if you printed to spend, the others would bewail, They'd call it counterfeiting and send you off to jail. But what if Crown would let you merely print it up to lend? With only what you could collect in interest to spend? If you could print and lend a thousand out at ten percent, You'd make a hundred interest on printing that you lent. But if you could print up and lend a million out you'd get, An extra hundred thousand dollars for your fee on debt! If Crown stops using its own money plates and comes to you, A billion printed nets a hundred million revenue!! With everybody being taxed to pay you interest, Of all the scams in history, TO HAVE THE PLATES is best!!! Though never spending, only lending, riches do await, To all who with the plates become the loan-sharks to the state. And though to join the few who thusly profit, one might dream, Wake up to see we're all the victims of their greedy scheme.

Of course, bankers eternally decry the inflationary impacts of Treasury fiat money while ignoring the impact of taxation for debt service while never decrying the same impacts of bank created fiat money giving rise to taxation for debt service. A great scam for those who can get the plates and be part of it. So whenever Quigley speaks of orthodox financial methods, he's talking about government borrowing interest-bearing fiat money from private plate-holders and when he speaks of unorthodox financial methods, he's talking about government borrowing interest-free fiat money from the public plate-holder. Though history is replete with examples of such interest-free unorthodox financing to permit full employment with debt service, the most recent example of unorthodox finance was the Argentinian provinces who, instead of taking their bonds to the bankers to borrow private fiat money to spend and then tax out with interest, printed up small denomination bonds to spend and tax out without interest. See http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/np2.htm The decision to use Treasury Notes to fulfill the bankers' liabilities was made on July 25, 1915 by Sir John Bradbury. The first Treasury Notes were run off the presses at Waterloo and Sons on July 28th. It was announced that the Treasury Notes, instead of gold, would be used for bank payments. The discount rate was raised at the Bank of England from 3% to 10% to prevent inflation, a figure taken merely because the traditional rule of the bank stated that a 10% bank rate would draw gold out of the ground itself. JCT: Notice that there were never any inflationary fears while bankers created the fiat money to put into circulation at interest and such fears were only raised when the Treasury did it to put into circulation interest-free.

JCT: Who knows how many other examples of government interest- free notes have been erased from economists' history books too? Every single instance, as far as I can tell. Other than Quigley, which is more a history book than an Economics book, can anyone cite any Economics books which mentions any unorthodox financial system? Funny that such an economic notion as unorthodox finance is only found in a history text and no economics texts, isn't it? It's these kind of 100% omissions that convince me of the existence of an invisible conspiracy of bankers no matter who wants laugh at the notion. Page 317 At the outbreak of war, most of the belligerent countries suspended gold payments and accepted their bankers' advice that the proper way to pay for the war was by a combination of bank loans and taxation of consumption. The governments paid for the war by taxation, by fiat money, by borrowing from banks (which created credit for the purpose) and by borrowing from the people by selling them war bonds. Each of these methods had a different effect upon the two consequences of the war: inflation and public debt. a) Taxation gives no inflation and no debt. b) Fiat money gives inflation and no debt. JCT: Of course, Quigley has no idea about Inflation Shift B and doesn't seem to understand that fiat chips issued in exchange for new collateral does not cause inflation.

So its' true we'll get inflation from bank credit, it's not due to the increase in money, inflation shift A, it's due to the interest on the debt, inflation shift B. But of course, since inflation does occur, we can understand why he'd attribute it to the increase in money since the shift B decrease in purchasable collateral was unknown to him and to today's economists. d) Sales of bonds give no inflation but give debt. JCT: And the interest on such debt would cause inflation shift B so here, he's off base but this is not something that he has been able to empirically show, it only makes sense to him. Since there was no inflation shift A, increased money, he concludes there won't be any inflation, such conclusion not taking into account inflation shift B from the interest. It would appear from this table that the best way to pay for the war would be by taxation and the worst way would be by bank credit. Probably the best way to finance war is a combination of the four methods. JCT: Actually, the best way is the way they were all forced to go when orthodox methods failed. Fiat money from the Treasury. Canada's Committee On Monetary & Economic Reform, COMER, continually harps on the fact that during the war, the Treasury created half the money and the banks the other half. Today, the Treasury creates 1% and the banks 99%. They want the Treasury to create more but not necessarily 100%. I don't care if banks or the Treasury create it as long as it is positive-feedback-free. Page 318 In the period 1914-1918, the various belligerents used a mixture of these four methods but it was a mixture dictated by expediency and false theories so that at the end of the war all countries found themselves with both public debts and inflation. While the prices in most countries rose 200 to 300 percent and public debts rose 1000%, the financial leaders tried to keep up the pretense that the money was as valuable as it had ever been. For this reason, they did not openly abandon the gold standard. Instead, they suspended certain attributes of the gold standard. In most countries, payments in gold and export of gold were suspended but every effort was made to keep gold reserves up to a respectable percentage of notes. These attributes were achieved in some cases by deceptive methods. In Britain, the gold reserves against notes fell from 52% to 18% in the month of July 1914; then the situation was concealed, http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig07a.htm (6 of 28)22.5.2005 19:18:00"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"g$biloxi partly by moving assets of local banks into the Bank of England and using them as reserves for both, partly by issuing a new kind of notes (Currency Notes) which had no real reserve and little gold backing. JCT: With little consequence since the backing by gold is not what makes money valuable, it's the labor of people that you can buy with your money that is the true backing. Page 320 As soon as the war was over, governments began to turn their attention to restoring the prewar financial system. Since the essential element was believed to be the gold standard, this movement was called \"stabilization.\" JCT: Remember this word. Stabilizing meant making the gold of those who had gold worth more by taking more from the people who had no gold. It often turned into out-and-out death for the poor, henceforth to be called \"morting.\" Productive capacity in both agriculture and industry had been increased by the artificial demand of the war period to a degree far beyond the ability of normal domestic demand to buy the products. JCT: Food production had increased far beyond the ability to buy the products but not to eat them. Thus the famous Social Credit expression \"Poverty amidst plenty.\" Lots of food but no money to buy it with. The backwards areas had increased their outputs of raw materials and food so greatly that the total could hardly have been sold. JCT: Again, the limitation was on the sale, not on the availability. Thus the real tragedy of the 20th century where it is admitted that early on in the century, we already had the potential for life-support to provide abundance for all yet such abundance was denied the citizenry by creating a shortage of the tokens to buy it with. Earth could have been paradise of abundance for the past hundred years and yet the bankers kept it an alley where men weep and gnash their teeth just for the fun and profit they made out of morting people with debt. The result was as situation where all countries were eager to sell and reluctant to buy. The only sensible solution to this problem of excessive productive capacity would have been a substantial rise in domestic standards of living but this would have required a fundamental reapportionment of the national income so that claims to this product of the excess capacity would go to those masses eager to consume, rather than continue to go to the minority desiring to save. Such reform was rejected by the ruling groups in both \"advanced\" and \"backwards\" countries so that this solution was reached only to a http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig07a.htm (7 of 28)22.5.2005 19:18:00"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"g$biloxi small degree in a relatively few countries (chiefly US and Germany in 1925-1929).

Ruling groups, and we know that that has always been those who finance the politicians, decided that the abundance would be kept unbuyable bought by the masses, such ruling groups having thereby morted many of those masses by insufficiency in a land of plenty. We should start a topic where we assume that we're finally all in Heaven and we get to be the prosecutors of the Rothschilds and Rockefellers before God who draw up the indictment. It would have great therapeutic value for those of us who feel the heartache of knowing that it didn't have to be this way. I'm sure that those of us who understand how the bankers have done it to us feel a special pain that the sheeple who think it's just nature's way will never understand. So why don't we pretend that we're finally at he Judgment day and let's lay out the indictment for genocide of the poor against the bankers. Now that I think of it, I'm probably the only person on Earth who has already had that soul-satisfying moment of accusing the bankers of genocide of the poor in the public eye before my nation's highest court. Three times personally and three times having made the arguments for others. So, I've had the thrill of making the case against the bankers of genocide to their faces. I really enjoyed it. We'd simply have to pick various examples of where bankers' policies resulted in death. I can pick up my newspaper and come up with half a dozen in only a few moments. Bankers committed genocide when their funding cuts reduced the number of ambulances and someone died. Bankers committed genocide when their funding cuts reduced the number of hospital beds and someone died. Bankers committed genocide when their funding cuts reduced welfare and someone died of a malnutrition disease. Bankers committed genocide when their funding cuts reduced welfare and someone died of attempted robbery or trying to stop one. Bankers committed genocide when their funding cuts caused a gang of kids to kill another for his sneakers despite stores full of sneakers. The ways that bankers' funding cuts have killed people are just too numerous to count. Virtually every crime on every crime drama on television can be laid to the poverty motive: \"I did it for the money.\" Other than a few insanities, 90% of the death on the planet, assuming 10% die calmly and naturally, can be laid on the banking conspiracy. And believe me, to call these pillars of the community \"morters\" in public affords a great feeling to anyone who has been frustrated by http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig07a.htm (8 of 28)22.5.2005 19:18:00"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"g$biloxi the knowledge that we've always been a short step away from heaven and have been kept in hell by these men nevertheless.

Because, as Quigley explains, the needless agonies they have inflicted will get clearer and clearer as we go on. Page 324 The powers of financial capitalism had another far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. JCT: Remember that Quigley is one of them. He's one of their professors. He's one of the slave-drivers, not one of the slaves. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences. The apex of the system was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basle, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the world's central banks which were themselves private corporations. Each central bank sought to dominate its government by its ability to control Treasury loans, to manipulate foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the country, and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world. JCT: And they've pulled it off. In each country, the power of the central bank rested largely on its control of credit and money supply. In the world as a whole the power of the central bankers rested very largely on their control of loans and the gold flows. They made agreements on all the major financial problems of the world, as well as on many of the economic and political problems, especially in reference to loans, payments, and the economic future of the chief areas of the globe. JCT: So it's fair to say that the state of the world is their responsibility. The Bank of International Settlements, B.I.S. is generally regarded http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig07a.htm (9 of 28)22.5.2005 19:18:00"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"g$biloxi as the apex of the structure of financial capitalism whose remote origins go back to the creation of the Bank of England in 1694. JCT: Only as far as Quigley sees. Astle points out that they had an international banking cartel, a Bank of International Settlements, several millennia ago and it's difficult to believe given our continual history of agony and war that they took a break from control for a millennium or two. No, it's just that this historian couldn't have known what history had been erased from his books to know. That's why we have such a great debt of gratitude to Astle for having dug up and processed so much almost-erased information. Page 325 It was set up to be the world cartel of every-growing national financial powers by assembling the nominal heads of these national financial centers. The commander in Chief of the world system of banking control was Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, who was built up by the private bankers to a position where he was regarded as an oracle in all matters of government and business. In government, the power of the Bank of England was a considerable restriction on political action as early as 1819 but an effort to break this power by a modification of the bank's charter in 1844 failed. In 1852, Gladstone, then chancellor of the Exchequer and later Prime Minister, declared, \"The hinge of the whole situation was this: the government itself was not to be a substantive power in matters of Finance, but was to leave the Money Power supreme and unquestioned.\" JCT: This is the Prime Minister saying that the most important function of an economy was to be left to the profitable control of private elements. Sure, many economists will argue that there is government control because the President gets to nominate which bankers serve on the Federal Reserve Board but it fails to note that they're still all bankers and that picking one or two of them to their 14 year term is about the only control at all. This power of the Bank of England was admitted in 1924 by Reginald McKenna, who had been Chancellor of the Exchequer, when he, as Chairman, told the stockholders of the Midland bank, \"I am afraid the ordinary citizen will not like to be told that the banks can, and do, create money. And they who control the credit of a nation direct the policy if Governments and hold in the hollow of their hands the destiny of the people.\" In that same year, Sir Drummond Fraser, vice- president of the Institute of Bankers stated, \"The Governor must be the autocrat who dictates the terms upon which alone the Government can obtain borrowed money.\" On Sep. 26, 1921, Vincent Vickers, director of the bank, the Financial Times wrote, \"Half a dozen meant the top of the Big Five Banks could upset the whole fabric of http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig07a.htm (10 of 28)22.5.2005 19:18:00"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"g$biloxi government by refraining from renewing Treasury Bills.\" JCT: These quotes have been cited by most monetary reformers and the fact that Quigley does too is testament to the honesty with which he is dealing with these issues. Page 326 Norman had no use for governments and feared democracy. Both of these seemed to him to be threats to private banking and thus to all that was proper and precious to human life. He viewed his life as a kind of cloak-and-dagger struggle with the forces of unsound money which were in league with anarchy and Communism. When he rebuilt the Bank of England, he constructed it as a fortress prepared to defend itself against any popular revolt. For much of his life, he rushed about the world under the assumed name of \"Professor Skinner.\" JCT: Interesting that he worried that people would someday blame the bankers and not the government but as long as most people thought that the government ran the central bank and not the other way around, he didn't have too much to worry. The the Bank of England was picketed by some Social Credit Greenshirts during the Depression and me in 1997 but other than those protests, it's been pretty successful at having the blame for its policies laid at the doorstep of the government. Norman had a devoted colleague in Benjamin Strong, the first governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Strong owed his career to the favor of the Morgan bank. In the 1920s, they were determined to use the financial power of Britain and the US to force all the major countries of the world to go on the gold standard and to operate it through central banks free from all political control, with all questions of international finance to be settled by agreements by such central banks without interference from governments. JCT: I consider the money system as the brain of the economic machinery. Money decides what will be produced. Bankers have decided that funds to farm production will be kept to a minimum and funds to war production will be kept to a maximum and that's what gets done. The engineers who would be just as happy building tractors find that the only paychecks available are for building tanks and guess what engineers end up building? Those who control the allocation of funds control what gets done no matter what governments or people want. Is it any wonder that bankers want no interference from governments in their running of the world? But having had no such interference, we can now safely lay the results at their feet for explanation. Page 327 It must not be felt that these heads of the world's chief central http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig07a.htm (11 of 28)22.5.2005 19:18:00"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"g$biloxi banks were themselves substantive powers in world finance. They were not. Rather, they were the technicians and agents of the dominant investment bankers of their own countries, who had raised them up and were perfectly capable of throwing them down. The substantive financial powers of the world were in the hands of investment bankers (also called \"international\" or \"merchant\" bankers) who remained largely behind the scenes in their own unincorporated private banks. JCT: These are the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Warburgs, et al, whose psychological profiles will be of such interest to future historians and students. Finding out what made the kind of person who could condemn hundreds of millions to agonizing lives and deaths tick will surely occupy more time than any other interest. I'd like to know how they rationalize what they've done and how they live with themselves. Of course, if they really are just evil aliens who consider themselves superior to the human race and feed off us as nonchalantly as we feed off cattle, then I'll understand. But if it's found that these great banking families, the parasite royalty, are actually human, then I'd bet that the study of what made them do and think what they did will most fascinate future generations. I wonder sometimes wonder if they'll find that they had a malevolent gene or was it all the inbreeding to keep their fortunes in the same small group over millennia? I hope these questions get answered in my lifetime. But I'd be most pleased to find out that they were actually aliens and no real human could sink as low as a Rothschild or Rockefeller could. These formed a system of international cooperation and national dominance which was more private, more powerful, and more secret than that of their agents in the central banks. This dominance of investment bankers was based on their control over the flows of credit and investment funds in their own countries and throughout the world. They could dominate the financial and industrial systems of their own countries by their influence over the flow of current funds through bank loans,the discount rate,the rediscounting of commercial debts; they could dominate governments by their control over current government loans and the play of the international exchanges. Almost all of this power was exercised by the personal influence and prestige men who had demonstrated their ability in the past to bring off successful financial coups, to keep their word, to remain cool in a crisis, and to share their winning opportunities with their associates. In this system, the Rothschilds had been pre-eminent during much of the nineteenth century, but, at the end of that century, they were being replaced by J.P. Morgan in New York. JCT: J.P. Morgan was nothing but a stooge for Rothschild and Rockefeller.

CHAPTER VII: FINANCE, COMMERCIAL POLICY, AND BUSINESS POLICY 1897-1947 Page 327 At the present stage, we must follow the efforts of the central bankers to compel the world to return to the gold standard of 1914. JCT: And count up the corpses as this group compels the world. Page 328 The problem of public debts arose from the fact that as money (credit) was created, it was usually made in such a way that it was not in the control of the state but was in the control of private financial institutions which demanded real wealth at some future date for the creation of claims on wealth in the present. The problem of public debt could have been met in one or more of several fashions: a) by increasing the amount of real wealth... b) by devaluation... c) by repudiation... d) by taxation... e) by the issuance of fiat money and the payment of the debt by such money. JCT: I don't like a) because the bankers end up with all the profits of production; b) is unnecessary; c) is only proper for the repudiation of the interest component of the debt but never the original principal for which value was received unless they'd like to make the case they shouldn't have to pay for the weapons and chains bought by their dictator to keep them enslaved; d) taxation is silly since the problem is already not enough money; I like e) which converts interesting-bearing debt whose principal grows and grows exponentially into interest-free debt so the principal can be reduced with each payment. Page 329 Efforts to pay the public debt by fiat money would have made the inflation problem worse. Orthodox theory rejected fiat money as solutions to the problem. JCT: Unfortunately, this would seem so to someone who doesn't understand that replacing interest-bearing debt money with interest- free debt money changes nothing but the debt service. No new money is added for which old money is not erased. If a hundred billion old interest-bearing dollars are replaced by a hundred billion interest- free dollars, why should there be inflation? So the fact he believes in inflation shift A and has not conceived of inflation shift B isn't even key here. It's a straight replacement. No inflation shift A. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig07a.htm (13 of 28)22.5.2005 19:18:00"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 332 In Britain, the currency notes which had been used to supplement bank notes were retired and credit was curtailed by raising the discount rate to panic level. The results were horrible. Business activity fell drastically and unemployment rose to well over a million and a half. The outcome was a great wave of strikes and industrial unrest. JCT: So what was good to make the bankers richer made everyone else poorer. To safety the value of their gold, ordinary people had to suffer wage and service cuts. Upping the value of bankers' gold was necessarily laid on the backs of the working classes. Bradburys that worked to finance war-time production were not going to be able to finance peace-time production. Page 333 To maintain the gold reserve at all, it was necessary to keep the discount rate at a level so high (4.5% or more) that business activity was discouraged. As a result of this financial policy, Britain found herself faced with deflation and depression for the whole period of 1920-1923. The number of unemployed averaged about 1.75 millions for each of the thirteen years of 1921-1932 and reached 3 million in 1931. Belgium, France and Italy, accepted orthodox financial ideas and tried to deflate in 1920-1921 but after the depression which resulted, they gave up the task. JCT: So orthodox financial methods to deflate the money supply and make gold-holders richer always cause depression for the workers. So governments that pursue deflationary policies have gold-holders' and not workers' interests at heart. Of course, considering that most politicians came from the gold-holding classes and few from the non- gold-holding classes, what would one expect? Of course the politicians were in favor of their gold being more valuable no matter how many ordinary people went sick and hungry. What's amazing is that they knew first-hand the Bradburys had saved their nation and boosted production and were still willing to cut production and murder their nation in the name of making their gold worth more. Page 334 The Dawes Plan provided the gold reserves which served to protect Germany from the accepted principles of orthodox finance. JCT: Otherwise, without gold as a base, they wouldn't have been allowed to have any money according to orthodox financial policies. And since the only people profiting from the war debts were the bankers who received their payments, they were keenly supportive of their governments lending Germany gold so she could pay the bankers http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig07a.htm (14 of 28)22.5.2005 19:18:00"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"g$biloxi their interest. Page 336 Financial capitalism had little interest in goods at all, but was concerned entirely with claims on wealth - stocks, bonds, mortgages, insurance, proxies, interest rates, and such. It built railroads in order to sell securities, not to transport goods. Corporations were built upon corporations in the form of holding companies so that securities were issued in huge quantities bringing profitable fees and commissions to financial capitalists without any increase in economic production whatever. Indeed, these financial capitalists discovered that they could not only make killings out of the issuing of such securities, they could also make killings out of the bankruptcy of such corporations through the fees and commissions of reorganization. A very pleasant cycle of flotation, bankruptcy, flotation, bankruptcy began to be practiced by these financial capitalists. The more excessive the flotation, the greater the profits and the more imminent the bankruptcy. The more frequent the bankruptcy, the greater the profits of reorganization and the sooner the opportunity of another excessive flotation. JCT: Of course, the lives of those thrust into unemployment and need by their cycle of flotation, bankruptcy, etc. wasn't taken into consideration. Page 337 The growth of financial capitalism made possible a centralization of world economic control and a use of this power for the direct benefit of financiers and the indirect injury of all other economic groups. Financial control could be exercised only imperfectly through credit control and interlocking directorates. JCT: And of course, many in the booboisie argue vehemently that this power for the direct benefit of financiers to the indirect injury of all other economic groups was never used on purpose. Only conspiracy nuts would think that. Page 338 The real key rested on the control of money flows which were held by investment bankers in 1900. THE PERIOD OF DEFLATION, 1927-1936 Page 339 After 1929, deflation reached a degree which could be called acute. JCT: By this he must mean that people were dying in the streets and things looked bad. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig07a.htm (15 of 28)22.5.2005 19:18:00"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"g$biloxi In the first part of this period (1921-1925), the dangerous economic implications of deflation were concealed by a structure of self-deception which pretended that a great period of economic progress would be inaugurated as soon as the task of stabilization had been accomplished. JCT: As soon as the value of their gold had stabilized to a lot more, things would be better for everyone. This psychological optimism was completely unwarranted by the economic facts. After 1925, when deflation became more deep-rooted and economic conditions worsened, the danger from these conditions was concealed by a continuation of unwarranted optimism. JCT: I'm sure it wasn't optimism being stated by the people themselves and more a lying media owned by the gold-holders telling the people that everything was getting better. THE CRASH OF 1929 Page 342 When France stabilized the franc at a level at which it was devalued, the Bank of France sold francs in return for foreign exchange. The francs were created as credit in France thus giving an inflationary effect. JCT: Maybe, maybe not. It all depends on whether equivalent collateral was created with the new money issued. Remember Edgie the economist who played Poker at my table and would scream \"inflation\" any time a new player entered the with a new rack of poker chips. Even though we had to take him to the cage every time to reassure him that the new chips were backed up with new collateral in the cage, his conditioning prompted to forget how the cage worked and scream \"inflation\" every time he saw new chips enter the game. Flaherty like most economists in the world was never taught cage accounting and suffers from this same conditioning to believe that any increase in the chips causes the value of the other chips to go down. Page 343 The financial results of the stock market boom in the US was credit diverted from production to speculation and increasing amounts of funds being drained from the economic system into the stock market where they circulated around and around, building up prices of securities. JCT: A lot similar to today where trillions move in stock market transactions so they can make 1% commissions and only billions move in productive purchases. Page 344 Early in 1929, the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig07a.htm (16 of 28)22.5.2005 19:18:00"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"g$biloxi became alarmed at the stock market speculations draining credit from industrial production. To curtail this, they called upon member banks to reduce their loans on stock collateral to reduce the amount of credit available for speculation. Instead, the available credit went more and more to speculation and decreasingly to productive business. Call money rates in New York which had reached 7% at the end of 1928 were at 13% by June 1929. JCT: So just before the stock market crash, the FED started jacking up the loanshark rate. This is the true cause of the crash because as credit tightened, more and more people needed to dump their securities to get money to pay their debts and this \"panic\" or credit crunch set the stage where the loans were called in precipitating the crash. How many people knew that Winston Churchill had been invited over to Wall Street to witness the crash? It certainly let him know who ruled the real world. Page 346 To restore confidence among the wealthy (who were causing the panic) an effort was made to balance the budget by cutting public expenditures drastically. This, by reducing purchasing power, had injurious effects on business activity and increased unrest among the masses of the people. JCT: Count up the children who got sick and died because daddy had no job to buy medicine, count up all the desperadoes who turned to crime, count up all the people who were morted in this bid to restore the confidence among the wealthy and lay the blame on the Rothschilds and Rockefellers where it belongs. Page 350 Washington left gold in 1933 voluntarily in order to follow an unorthodox financial program of inflation. JCT: It's not fair to call this unorthodox finance. It wasn't. Page 351 The Thomas Amendment to the Agricultural Adjustment Act (1933) gave the president the power to devaluate the dollar up to 50%, to issue up to $3 billion fiat money, and to engage on an extensive program of public spending. Page 352 The economies of the different countries were so intertwined with one another that any policy of self-interest on the part of one would be sure to injure others in the short run and the country in the long run. The international and domestic economic systems had developed to the point where the customary methods of thought and procedure in regard to them were obsolete. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig07a.htm (17 of 28)22.5.2005 19:18:00"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"g$biloxi page 353 As a result of the crisis, regardless of the nature of its primary impact, all countries began to pursue policies of economic nationalism. This spread rapidly as a result of imitation and retaliation. JCT: Pursuant to the Miracle Equation, all countries borrow Principal to produce their goods and try to sell them at Principal+Interest. Since no country can purchase with the P issued at home the prices of P+I, the unpurchasable portion must be exported in order to survive. This accounts for the trade wars where every country tries to capture with foreign sales enough to pay their home interest while at the same time preventing any home Principal from buying foreign goods and leaving. This explains \"dumping\" whereby a nation will overcharge its own citizens to that even more is left unpurchased which can then be offered at an even cheaper rate to obtain the foreign funds. Example: Country borrows $100 billion at 10% to produce 10 widgets for sale at $11 billion each. The home country buys $100 billion worth of widgets and successfully exports the other $10 billion it could not buy at home and pays off its debt. If it can't successfully export and sell the excess it couldn't sell at home, the banks will foreclose and generate unemployment and inflation. So what some countries do is to charge $12 billion per widget to the home market and selling only 8 widgets so that they can try to gain the outside $10 billion necessary to pay their interest by offering two widgets to get the necessary $10 billion. This is called dumping. Otherwise, why would anyone object to countries wishing to sell us products at a loss unless the removal of that currency causes us problems. So it's the eternal struggle of mortgage that forces countries to try to export what they don't have sufficient money to buy at home. Page 355 The Bank of France raised its discount rate from 2.5% to 6% in 1935 with depressing economic results. In this way, the strain on gold was relieved at the cost of increased depression. The Right discovered that it could veto any actions of the Left government merely by exporting capital from France. JCT: Once again, protection of gold leads to misery for the people.

Like I say, I can't imagine any of them choosing to keep their name in the new world where everyone will be aware of what they did. Page 357 The historical importance of the banker-engendered deflationary crisis of 1927-1940 can hardly be overestimated. It gave a blow to democracy and to the parliamentary system and thus became a chief cause of World War II. It so hampered the Powers which remained democratic by its orthodox economic theories that these were unable to rearm for defence. It gave rise to a conflict between the theorists of orthodox and unorthodox financial methods. JCT: So the bankers caused the Great Depression, hurt democracy and caused World War II with another 50 million casualties. R&R always made the biggest money with the biggest flows of blood. The bankers' formula for treating a depression was by clinging to the gold standard, by raising interest rates and seeking deflation, and by insisting on a reduction in public spending, a fiscal surplus or at least a balanced budget. JCT: Clinging to the gold standard did no good for those who had no gold, raising interest hurt everyone but those who had money, seeking deflation benefited only those who had money, reducing public spending hurt those without money. The pattern is consistent. Everything good for those with money, everything bad for those without. These ideas were rejected totally, on a point by point basis, by the unorthodox economists, (somewhat mistakenly called Keynesian). The bankers' formula sought to encourage economic recovery by \"restoring confidence in the value of money,\" that is, their own confidence in what was the primary concern of bankers. The unorthodox theorists sought to restore purchasing power by increasing, instead of reducing, the money supply and by placing it in the hands of potential consumers rather than in the banks or in the hands of investors. JCT: Increasing the money supply helps everyone, not just rich, and placing it in the hands of all consumers, not just the bankers, again helps everyone, not just the rich. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig07a.htm (19 of 28)22.5.2005 19:18:00"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"g$biloxi page 358 The whole relationship of money and resources remained a puzzle to many and was still a subject of debate in the 1950s but at least a great victory had been won by man in his control of his own destiny when the myths of orthodox financial theory were finally challenged in the 1930s. JCT: They may have been challenged but certainly never defeated. They're still called unorthodox because the orthodox way is still always to the advantage of those with the money and never of those without. REFLATION AND INFLATION 1933-1947 Page 360 Except for Germany and Russia, most countries in the latter half of 1937 experienced sharp recession. JCT: Why this was so has to do with their not following the orthodox advice of the bankers interested only in increasing their own wealth. Page 361 As a result of the failure of most countries (excepting Germany and Russia) to achieve full utilization of resources, it was possible to devote increasing percentages of resources to armaments without suffering any decline in the standards of living. JCT: In other words, they had plenty of unemployed to shift to armaments without taking anyone away from productive enterprise where they couldn't find enough money to be paid anyway. Page 366 It was discovered by Germany in 1932, by Italy in 1934, by Japan in 1936 and by the United States in 1938 that deflation could be prevented by rearming. JCT: This is a confusing way of putting it. It should actually say that it was discovered that deflation caused by bankers refusing to fund production could be prevented by bankers agreeing to fund destruction. As long as they wanted to produce peace-time production, the bankers would not create money and only when they were ready to produce war-time production were the bankers ready to create money to fund it. So since the bankers would only fund war and not peace, Quigley concluded that war production fought deflation. Page 368 Britain made barter agreements with various countries, including one direct swap of rubber for wheat with the US. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig07a.htm (20 of 28)22.5.2005 19:18:00"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"g$biloxi JCT: This is definitely unorthodox finance. Too had they didn't keep trading using a central barter system. Then we'd have a global LETS as I've been advocating for so many years. Page 369 The period of reflation after 1933 was caused by increases in public spending on armaments. In most countries,the transition from reflation to inflation did not occur until after they had entered the war. Germany was the chief exception and possibly also Italy and Russia, since all of these were making fairly full utilization of their resources. In France and the other countries overrun by Germany, such full mobilization of resources was not achieved before they were defeated. JCT: You'd have to wonder why economists aren't more interested in how Germany managed full employment while the rest of the world were suffering high unemployment of depression. And they still aren't interested in how they did it. Page 370 The use of orthodox financing in the First World War had left a terrible burden of intergovernmental debts and ill-feeling. JCT: Not ill-feeling for the bankers even if it was deathly- feeling for everyone else. Page 371 The post Second World War economy was entirely different in character from that of the 1920s following the First World War. This was most notable in the absence of a post-war depression which was widely expected but which did not arrive because there was no effort to stabilize on a gold standard. The major difference was the eclipse of the bankers who have been largely reduced in status from the masters to the servants of the economic system. This has been brought about by the new concern with real economic factors instead of with financial counters, as previously. As part of this program, there has been a great reduction in the economic role of gold. CHAPTER VIII: INTERNATIONAL SOCIALISM AND THE SOVIET CHALLENGE Page 375 Industrialism, especially in its early years, brought with it social and economic conditions which were admittedly horrible. Human beings were brought together around factories to form great new cities which were sordid and unsanitary. In many cases, these persons were reduced to conditions of animality, which shock the imagination. JCT: What shocks the imagination is that human (?) bankers http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig07a.htm (21 of 28)22.5.2005 19:18:00"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"g$biloxi planned it to be that way. Crowded together in want and disease, with no leisure and no security, completely dependent on weekly wage which was less than a pittance, they worked twelve to fifteen hours a day for six days in the week among dusty and dangerous machines with no protection against inevitable accidents, disease, or old age, and returned at night to crowded rooms without adequate food and lacking light, fresh air, heat, pure water, or sanitation. These conditions have been described for us in the writings of novelists such as Dickens in England, Hugo or Zola in France. JCT: Rothschild's and Rockefeller's planet described in literature. Page 376 The Socialist movement was a reaction against these deplorable conditions to the working masses. It has been customary to divide this movement into two parts at the year 1848, the publication of the Communist Manifesto of Karl Marx. This work began with the ominous sentence, \"A specter is haunting Europe - the specter of Communism,\" and ended with the trumpet blast \"Workers of the world, unite.\" In general, the former division believed that man was innately good and that all coercive power was bad, with public authority the worst form of such coercive power. All the world's evils, according to the anarchists, arose because man's innate goodness was corrupted and distorted by coercive power. The remedy, they felt, was to destroy the state. The simplest way to destroy the state would be to assassinate the chief of the state to ignite a wholesale uprising of oppressed humanity. JCT: The we have a bunch of guys who want to blame the idiot politicians who got hooked into the loansharks rather than the loansharks themselves. Getting rid of the chief of state would have absolutely no effect with a ready replacement idiot waiting in the wings. Page 377 Syndicalism was a somewhat more realistic and later version of anarchism. It was equally determined to abolish all public authority. The state would be destroyed by a general strike and replaced by a flexible federation of free associations of workers. JCT: Syndicalism was just another group again blaming the wrong guys. A free association of workers ready to get hooked into the same loansharks wouldn't be much of an improvement. The second group of radical social theorists wished to widen the power and scope of governments by giving them a dominant role in economic http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig07a.htm (22 of 28)22.5.2005 19:18:00"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"g$biloxi life. The group divided into two chief schools: The Socialists and the Communists. JCT: Government needs only not be subservient to the money creators but do the creating itself for it to take its proper dominant place in the scheme of things. But as long as they let the bankers create the money and then loanshark it to the government, they will forever be subservient. the only problem with these suggestions is that they never mention the role of money creator in their plans. Page 378 From Ricardo, Marx derived the theory that the value of economic goods was based on the amount of labor put into them. JCT: That's a good theory and would work fine if people could finally accept that money does not do work and does not to deserve to be paid on an equivalent basis with human labor. Page 379 Marx built up a complicated theory which believed that all history is the history of class struggles. JCT: True, all history is the struggle between the debt slave masters and the debt slaves. The money which the bourgeoisie took from the proletariat in the economic system made it possible for them to dominate the political system, including the police and the army. From such exploitation, the bourgeoisie would become richer and richer and fewer and fewer in numbers and acquire ownership of all property in the society while the proletariat would become poorer and poorer and more and more numerous and be driven closer and closer to desperation. Eventually, the latter would rise up and take over. JCT: Call the loansharks the \"bourgeoisie\" and the proletariat the \"debt slaves\" and it's a good explanation of how interest makes the rich become richer and the poor become poorer. Page 381 In fact, what occurred could be pictured as cooperative effort by unionized workers and monopolized industry to exploit unorganized consumers by raising prices higher and higher, quite contrary to the expectations of Marx. Where he had expected impoverishment of the masses and concentration of ownership with gradual elimination of the middle classes, there occurred instead rising standards of living, dispersal of ownership, a relative decrease in the numbers of laborers, and a great increase in the middle classes. Due to income and inheritance taxes, the rich became poorer and poorer, relatively speaking. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig07a.htm (23 of 28)22.5.2005 19:18:00"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"g$biloxi JCT: What a joke. Just because they put their money into trust funds and foundations which they still control is not to say that the rich have become poorer and poorer at all. And a better-fed group of slaves was still just a group of slaves nevertheless. No matter their standard of living, they were still in hock up their necks. THE BOLSHEVIK REVOLUTION TO 1924 Page 385 The new government forced the abdication of the czar. The more radical Socialists had been released from prison or had been returned from exile (in some cases, such as Lenin, by German assistance) JCT: And Rockefeller and Mackenzie King helped Lenin get to Russia too. Some Canadians were quite upset that Lenin's return pulled Russia out of the war which freed up Germans on the Eastern Front to go and kill Americans and Canadians on the Western Front. But having the bankers help the Bolsheviks take over Russia was far more important to them than the lives of their own countrymen. It's this kind of banker's treason that we keep running into over and over. Selling arms to the enemy, helping the enemy defeat our allies, quite treasonous and never published, let alone punished. Page 386 Lenin campaigned to replace the Provisional Government with a system of Soviets and to adopt an immediate program of peace and land distribution. The Bolshevik group seized the centers of government in St. Petersburg and within 24 hours, issued a series of decrees which abolished the Provisional government, ordered the end of the war with Germany and the distribution of large land holdings to the peasants. JCT: Though the land may have been distributed to the peasants, they had no intention of letting them keep it for long. And didn't. Page 387 By 1920 industrial production in general was about 13% of the 1913 figure. At the same time, paper money was printed so freely to pay for the costs of war, civil war, and the operation of the government that prices rose rapidly and the ruble became almost worthless. JCT: Maybe but at least they had money to pay their agents with while their opponents did not. The secret police (Cheka) systematically murdered all real or potential opponents.

The British seized the oil fields of the Caspian region (late 1918) while the French occupied parts of the Ukraine about Odessa (March 1919). By 1920, Russia was in complete confusion. Poland invaded Russia occupying much of the Ukraine. JCT: This invasion of parts of Russia is almost unreported in most histories. Since the Bolshevik Communists were supported by Wall Street money, despite all my historical researches, I'm still mystified about why this invasion took place. Any suggestions? Page 389 As part of this system, not only were all agricultural crops considered to be government property but all private trade and commerce were also forbidden; the banks were nationalized while all industrial plants of over five workers and all craft enterprises of over ten workers were nationalized. This culminated in peasant uprisings and urban riots. Within a week, peasant requisitioning was abandoned in favor of a \"New Economic Policy\" of free commercial activity in agriculture and other commodities, with the re-establishment of the profit motive and of private ownership in small industries and in small landholding. JCT: So they learned in no time that they had to keep the profit motive of private ownership alive for maximum production. Seems they soon forgot that lesson though. Page 395 The Bolsheviks insisted that the distribution of income in a capitalistic society would become so inequitable that the masses of the people would not obtain sufficient income to buy the goods being produced by the industrial plants. JCT: That's certainly happened. As such unsold goods accumulated with decreasing profits and deepening depression, there would be a shift toward the production of armaments to provide profits and produce goods which could be sold and there would be an increasingly aggressive foreign policy in order to obtain markets for unsold goods in backward and undeveloped countries. JCT: I've already described the eternal search to sell goods that can't be sold at home to foreign markets and as the Social Credit engineer, Major Douglas said, economic war always leads to real war. Such aggressive imperialism would inevitably make Russia a target of aggression in order to prevent a successful Communist system there http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig07a.htm (25 of 28)22.5.2005 19:18:00"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"g$biloxi from becoming an attractive model for the discontented proletariat in capitalistic countries.

They certainly feared the \"good example.\" Page 396 Communism in Russia alone required that the country must be industrialized with breakneck speed and must emphasize heavy industry and armaments rather than rising standards of living. This meant that goods produced by the peasants must be taken from them by political duress, without any economic return, and that the ultimate in authoritarian terror must be used to prevent the peasants from reducing their level of production. It was necessary to crush all kinds of foreign espionage, resistance to the Bolshevik state, independent thought, or public discontent. JCT: Of course, when you realize that the Bolsheviks were simply serving the international bankers, the reasons for this seem silly. The alternate reason is that bankers always love it best when the population are on their knees so any action to bring the population to its knees needs no other explanation. Page 397 Stalin forced the peasants off their land. In the space of six weeks, (Feb-Mar 1930) collective farms increased from 59,400 with 4.4 million families to 110,200 farms with 14.3 million families. All peasants who resisted were treated with violence; their property was confiscated, they were beaten or sent into exile in remote areas; many were killed. This process, known as \"the liquidation of the kulaks\" affected five million kulak families. Rather than give up their animals, many peasants killed them. The number of cattle was reduced from 30.7 million in 1928 to 19.6 million in 1933. The planting season of 1930 was entirely disrupted. Three million peasants starved in 1931-1933. Stalin told Churchill that 12 million died in this reorganization of agriculture. JCT: Realizing that Stalin was working for the international bankers, what they did to the Russian peasants seems little different than what they did to the North American peasants during the Great Depression. Just more heavy handed.

Special stores were established where the privileged could obtain scarce goods at low prices; restaurants with different menus were set up in industrial plants for different levels of employees; housing discrimination became steadily wider. JCT: This is the ugliest part of the whole system, that privileged elites got special stores that the average people couldn't access. This is so hypocritical for a group of workers that it is indicative that the system really wasn't by the workers for the workers but rather by the bankers for the bankers. Page 402 As public discontent and social tensions grew, the use of spying, purges, torture and murder increased out of all proportion. Every wave of discontent resulted in new waves of police activity. Hundreds of thousands were killed while millions were arrested and exiled to Siberia or put into huge slave-labor camps. Estimates vary from two million as high as twenty million. JCT: I'd really like to find out how Rothschild and Rockefellers gained by all these dead people. I can understand their profiting from war but simply killing millions doesn't seem all that profitable for them. But I'd certainly bet that they did profit from this misery as they profit from all other misery. Page 403 For every leader who was publicly eliminated, thousands were eliminated in secret. By 1939, all the leaders of Bolshevism had been driven from public life and most had died violent deaths. There were two networks of secret-police spies, unknown to each other, one serving the special department of the factory while the other reported to a high level of the secret police outside. JCT: Of course, there's always the chance that this was the test of the prototype civilization the bankers have in mind for us. A few millionaires, lots of police and lots of slaves. We must always keep in mind that the Bolshevik Revolution's financing was Wall Street money directed by Jacob Shiff of the famous usury company Kuhn Loeb who quite proudly took credit for it. Unfortunately, most people have been suckered into believing that Wall Street feared the Russian workers' revolution when in reality, they and their privileged elites, really owned it. Page 404 Whenever the secret police needed more money it could sweep large numbers of persons, without trial or notice, into its wage deduction system or into its labor camps to be hired out. It would seem that the secret police were the real rulers of Russia. JCT: What a joke.

Page 417 The precarious structure left by Bismarck was not managed but merely hidden from public view by a facade of nationalistic, anti foreign, anti-Semitic, imperialistic, and chauvinistic propaganda of which the emperor was the center. The monarchy represented the body, which was supported by four legs: the army, the landlords, the bureaucracy and the industrialists. The revolution of 1918 was not really a revolution at all because it removed the monarchy but it left the quartet of legs. Page 426 The German inflation, which was a great benefit to the Quartet, destroyed the economic position of the middle classes and lower middle classes and permanently alienated them from the republic. Page 427 The Nationalist Party built up a pervasive propaganda campaign to show that all Germany's problems were caused by the democratic and laboring groups, by the internationalists, and by the Jews. Page 428 The Centre and Left shared this nationalistic poison sufficiently to abstain from any effort to give the German people the true story of Germany's responsibility for the war and for her own hardships. Thus the Right was able to spread its own story of the war, that Germany had been overcome by a \"stab in the back\" from \"the three Internationals\": the \"Gold\" International of the Jews, the \"Red\" International of the Socialists, and the \"Black\" International of the Catholics, an unholy triple alliance which was symbolized in the gold, red, and black flag of the Weimar Republic.

The destruction of the Weimar Republic has five stages: 1) Bruning: March 24 1930 - May 30 1932 2) Von Papen: May 31 1932 - November 14 1932 3) Schleicher: December 2 1932 - January 28 1933 4) Hitler: January 30 1933 - March 5 1933 5) Gleichschaltung: March 6 1933 - August 2 1934 When the economic crisis began in 1929, Germany had a democratic government of the Center and Social Democratic parties. The crisis resulted in a decrease in tax receipts and a parallel increase in demands for government welfare services. This brought to a head the latent dispute over orthodox and unorthodox financing of a depression. Big business and big finance were determined to place the burden of the depression on the working classes by forcing the government to adopt a policy of deflation - that is, by wage reductions and curtailment of government expenditures. The Social Democrats wavered in their attitude but in general were opposed to this policy. Schacht, as president of the Reichsbank, was able to force the Socialist Rudolf Hilferding out of the position of minister of finance by refusing bank credit to the government until this was done. In March 1930, the Center broke the coalition on the issue of reduction of unemployment benefits, the Socialists were thrown out of the government, and Heinrich Bruning, leader of the Center Party, came in as chancellor. Because he did not have a majority, he had to put the deflationary policy into effect by the use of presidential decree. This marked the end of the Weimar Republic. The Socialists permitted Bruning to remain in office by refusing to vote on a motion of no confidence. Left in office, Bruning continued the deflationary policy by decrees. Page 431 Bruning's policy of deflation was a disaster. The suffering of the people was terrible with almost eight million unemployed out of twenty-five million employable.

THE NAZI REGIME 1933-1934 Adolf Hitler's life had been a succession of failures, the seven years 1907-1914 being passed as a social derelict in Vienna and Munich. There he had become a fanatical Pan-German anti-semite, attributing his own failures to the \"intrigues of international Jewry.\" Page 434 During the Great War, he was an excellent soldier always volunteering for the most dangerous tasks. Although he was decorated with the Iron Cross first class in 1918, he was never promoted beyond Private First Class. His regiment of 3,500 suffered 3,260 killed and Hitler himself was wounded twice. After the war, he stayed with the army and eventually became a political spy for the Reichswehr. In the course of spying on the numerous political groups, Hitler became fascinated by the rantings of Gottfried Feder against the \"interest slavery of the Jews.\" Hitler joined the National Socialist German Worker's Party which drew up a Twenty-five Point Program. Page 435 These included: 4) all Jews and other aliens eliminated; 5) all unearned incomes to be abolished; 6) to punish all war profiteers and usurers with death. Page 446 Prices were set at a level sufficient to give a profit to most participants and quotas were based on assessments estimated by the farmers themselves. The autarky program gave them a stable market for the products, shielding them from the vicissitudes which they had suffered under liberalism with its unstable markets and fluctuating prices. The prices fixed under Nazism were not high but were adequate, especially in combination with other advantages. Payments for interest and taxes were both reduced. All farms of over family size were made secure in possession of their owner's family, with no possibility of alienation, by increasing the use of entail on great estates and by the Hereditary Farms Act for lesser units. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig09.htm (4 of 36)22.5.2005 19:18:25"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 447 A law of December 28, 1939 stated, what had always been understood, that in his civil service work a party member was not subject to party orders but only to the orders of the civil service superior.

The fact party candidates are named by an inner clique is of tremendous importance and is the key to the control which the inner clique exercises over the House of Commons, yet it is rarely mentioned in books on the English political system. The party control is almost completely centralized in the hands of a largely self-perpetuating inner clique which has power of approval over all candidates. Cabinet can force the majority by using party discipline to pass bills.

This meant that they had property and income and did not need to work for a living; they obtained an education in a separate and expensive system; they married within their own class; they had a distinctive accent; and they had a distinctive attitude based on the training provided in the special educational system of the \"classes.\" http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig09.htm (5 of 36)22.5.2005 19:18:25"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 465 This educational system was based on three great negatives: a) education must not be vocational, not aimed at assisting one to make a living; b) education is not aimed directly at creating or training intelligence; c) education is not aimed at finding the \"Truth.\" It is aimed at developing a moral outlook, a respect for traditions, qualities of leadership and cooperation, and that ability for cooperation in competition summed up in the English idea of \"sport\" and \"playing the game.\" Because of the restricted numbers of the upper class, these attitudes applied chiefly to one another, and did not necessarily apply to foreigners or even to the masses. They applied to people who \"belonged\" and not to all human beings. Page 469 House members are expected to vote as their party whips tell them to and are not expected to understand the contents of the bills for which they are voting. Legislation originates in the meetings of the clique of the party, acting as first chamber. If accepted by the Cabinet, it passes the House of Commons almost automatically. This situation is sometimes called \"Cabinet dictatorship.\" Page 470 There have been restrictions on democracy in Britain almost all based on one criterion, the possession of wealth. Britain, until 1945, was the world's greatest plutocracy. In political life, local government had a restricted suffrage. Elected members were unpaid thus restricting these posts to those who had leisure (that is, wealth). Page 471 Members of Parliament were, for years, restricted to the well-to- do by the fact that Members were unpaid. In 1938, each candidate must post a deposit of #150 amounting to more than the total annual income of about three-quarters of all English families which is forfeited if he does not receive over one-eighth of the total vote. As a result of these monetary barriers, the overwhelming mass of Englishmen could not participate actively in politics unless they could find an outside source of funds. Until 1915, the two parties represented the same social class, the small group known as \"society.\" Both Conservatives and Liberals were controlled by the same small clique consisting of no more than half-a-dozen chief families, their relatives and allies.

This is quite different from the US where both major parties are middle-class parties and where geographic, religious and traditional influences are more important than class influences in determining party membership. Page 474 In eight years (1931-1939) thirteen directors of the \"Big Five Banks\" and two directors of the Bank of England were raised to the peerage by the Conservative government. Of ninety peers created, thirty five were directors of insurance companies. In 1935, Walter Runciman, as president of the Board of Trade, introduced a bill to grant a subsidy of #2 million to tramp merchant vessels and gave #92,000 to his father's company in which he held 21,000 shares. There is relatively little objection to activities of this kind in England.

In the election of 1931, the government allowed 15 period on the BBC for political campaigning, it took 11, gave 3 to Labour and 1 to the Liberals.

These are private clubs to which admission was by nomination with large admission fees. Sons of wage earners formed less than 1% of the admissions and members of the bar are almost entirely from the well-to-do classes. Since judges are appointed exclusively from barristers, the judicial system has also been monopolized by the upper classes. Obtaining justice has been complex, slow and above all, expensive.

Page 483 The 1909 Liberal budget was aimed directly at Conservative supporters by its taxation of unearned incomes, especially from landed properties. Its rejection by the House of Lords was denounced by Asquith as a breach of the constitution which gave control over money bills to the House of Commons. The Lords refused to yield until Asquith threatened to create enough new peers to carry his bill. This bill provided that the Lords could not veto a money bill and could not prevent any other bill from becoming law if it was passed in three sessions of the Commons over a period of at least two years. Page 485 Liberal Lloyd George's effort to deflate prices after the Great War in order to go back onto the gold standard was fatal to prosperity and domestic order. Unemployment and strikes increased. The Conservatives prevented any realistic attack on these problems and passed the Emergency Power Act of 1920 which for the first time gave a peace-time government the right to proclaim a state of siege (as was done in 1920, 1921, 1926). Page 486 In 1924, Winston Churchill, as chancellor of the Exchequer, carried out a stabilization policy which put England on the gold standard. This policy of deflation drove Britain into an economic depression and a period of labour conflict and the policy was so bungled in its execution that Britain was doomed to semi-depressions for almost a decade, to financial subjugation to France until 1931 and was driven closer to domestic rebellion than she had been at any time since the Chartist movement of 1848. The deflation of 1926 hit the mines with special impact since prices could only be cut if wages were cut. The government invoked the Emergency Powers Act and the Trade Unions Congress ordered a General Strike but soon ended it leaving the striking miners to shift for themselves. The miners stayed out for six months and then began to drift back to work to escape starvation.

Labour members had no understanding of economics. Snowden, the economic expert\" of the Cabinet, had financial views about the same as Montagu Norman of the Bank of England. Page 490 As for the bankers, they were in control throughout the crisis. While publicly they insisted on a balanced budget, privately, they refused to accept balancing by taxation and insisted on balancing by cuts in relief payments. Working in close cooperation with American bankers, they were in a position to overthrow any government which was not willing to crush them completely. While they refused cooperation to the Labour government, they were able to obtain a loan of #80 million from the US and France for the National Government when it was only four days old. The National government at once attacked the financial crisis with a typical bankers' weapon: deflation. It offered a budget including higher taxes and drastic cuts in unemployment benefits and public salaries. Riots, protests, and mutiny in the navy were the results. The domestic program of the National Government was to curtail the personal freedom of individuals. On this, there was no real protest for the Labour opposition had a program which, in fact if not in theory, tended in the same direction. Page 491 The police of London were reorganized in 1933 to destroy their obvious sympathy with the working classes by restricting all ranks above inspector to persons with an upper-class education. A severe Incitement to Disaffection Act in 1934 threatened to destroy the personal freedoms built up over centuries by making police searches of homes less restricted and making the simple possession of material likely to disaffect the armed forces a crime. For the first time in three generations, personal freedom and civil rights were restricted in time of peace. The Prevention of Violence Act of 1939 empowered a secretary of state to arrest without warrant and to deport without trial. Page 492 Neville Chamberlain was chiefly responsible for the National government's fiscal policies. For the first time in almost a century, there was an increase in the proportion of total tax paid by the working class. For the first time since 1846, there was a tax on food. There was a reversal in the trend to more education for the people. The budget was kept balanced by at a considerable price in human suffering and in wastage of Britain's irreplaceable human resources. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig09.htm (9 of 36)22.5.2005 19:18:25"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Hundreds of thousands had been unemployed for years and had their moral fiber completely destroyed by years of living on inadequate dole.

Chamberlain's Derating Act of 1929 exempted industry from payment of three quarters of its taxes while many unemployed were allowed to starve. CHAPTER XI: CHANGING ECONOMIC PATTERNS Page 497 The economic system itself has become organized for expansion and if it does not expand, it tends to collapse. The basic reason for this maladjustment is that investment has become an essential part of the system and if investment falls off, consumers have insufficient incomes to buy the consumers' goods which are being produced in another part of the system because part of the flow of purchasing power created by the production of goods was diverted from purchasing goods it had produced into savings, and all the goods produced could not be sold until those savings came back into the market by being invested. Page 498 If the groups in society who control the savings which are necessary for progress are the same vested interests who benefit by the existing way of doing things, they are in a position to defend these vested interests and prevent progress merely by preventing the use of surpluses to finance new inventions. The 20th century's economic crisis was a situation of this type. GREAT BRITAIN Page 499 The element of secrecy is one of the outstanding features of English business and financial life. The inner circle of English financial life remains a matter of \"whom one knows,\" rather than \"what one knows.\" Jobs are still obtained by family, marriage, or school connections and important positions are given to men who have no training, experience or knowledge to qualify them. Page 500 At the core of English financial life have been seventeen private firms of \"merchant bankers\" with a total of less than a hundred active http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig09.htm (10 of 36)22.5.2005 19:18:25"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"g$biloxi partners including Baring Brothers, N.M. Rothschild, J. Henry Schroder, Morgan Grenfell, Hambros and Lazard Brothers. These merchant bankers had a dominant position with the Bank of England and, strangely enough, still have retained some of this, despite the nationalization of the Bank by the Labour government in 1946. Page 501 Financial capitalism was marked not only by a growing financial control of industry but also by an increasing concentration of this control and by an increasing banking control of government. The control of the Bank of England over business was exercised indirectly through the joint-stock banks. This growth of a \"money trust\" led to an investigation. A bill was drawn up to prevent further concentration but was withdrawn when the bankers made a \"gentlemen's agreement\" to ask Treasury permission for future amalgamations. Page 502 In 1931, financiers led by Montagu Norman and J.P. Morgan forced the resignation of the British Labour government. But the handwriting was already on the wall. The deflationary financial policy of the bankers had alienated politicians and industrialists and driven monopolist trade unions to form a united front against the bankers. Labour and industry were united in opposition to continuance to the bankers' economic policy with its low prices and high unemployment. The decisive factor which caused the end of financial capitalism in Britain was the revolt of the British fleet in 1931 and not the abandonment of gold six days later. The mutiny made it clear that the policy of deflations must be ended. As a result, no effort was made to defend the gold standard. Page 503 The Coal Mines Act of 1930 allowed the National Shipbuilders Security to buy up and destroy shipyards. By 1934, one quarter of Britain's shipbuilding capacity had been eliminated. The Purchase Finance Company was set up to buy up and destroy flour mills. By 1933, over one-sixth of the flour mills in England had been eliminated. GERMANY Page 507 In Germany, capital was scarce when industrialism arrived and industry found itself dependent upon banks almost at once. The chief credit banks floated securities for industry by granting credit to the firm, taking securities in return. These securities were slowly sold to the public with the bank retaining enough stock to give it control http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig09.htm (11 of 36)22.5.2005 19:18:25"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"g$biloxi and appointing its men as directors to give that control final form. The importance of interlocking directorships can be seen from the fact that the same Dresdner Bank had its directors on the boards of over two hundred industrial concerns in 1913. This banking control of industry was made even closer since most investors left their securities on deposit with the banks which voted all this stock for directorships and other control measures, unless the stock-owners expressly forbade it. The banks also voted the stock left as collateral for loans and all stock bought on margin. Page 509 The control of German financial capitalism rested in the credit banks. It was largely beyond the control of the government and rested in private hands. Of the hundreds of German credit banks, the eight so-called \"Great Banks\" were the masters of the German economy from 1865 to 1915 and controlled 74% of the capital assets of all 421 banks. Page 512 I.G. Farbenindustrie made many individual cartel agreements with Du Pont and other American corporations. Page 514 In France, Britain and the US, the war played a significant role in demonstrating conclusively that economic stagnation and underemployment of resources were not necessary and could be avoided if the financial system were subordinated to the economic system. In Germany, this was not necessary since the Nazis had already made this discovery in the 1930s. Thus a surplus of labor, low wages, experience in unorthodox financial operations and an immense task to be done all contributed to the German revival. FRANCE Page 515 With the founding of the Bank of France in 1800, financial power was in the hands of about ten or fifteen banking houses whose founders, in most cases, had come from Switzerland. These bankers, all Protestant, were deeply involved in the agitations leading up to the French Revolution. When it got out of the hand, they were the chief forces behind the rise of Napoleon. As a reward for this support, Napoleon gave these bankers a monopoly over French financial life by giving them control of the new Bank of France. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig09.htm (12 of 36)22.5.2005 19:18:25"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 516 By 1811, most of these bankers had gone over to the opposition and survived the change in regime in 1815. As a result, the Protestant bankers who had controlled financial life under the First Empire were still the main figures on the board of regents of the Bank of France until 1936. The chief names were Mirabaud, Mallet, Neuflize, and Hottinger. In the course of the nineteenth century, a second group was added to French banking circles. This second group, largely Jewish, was also non-French origin, the majority Germanic (like Rothschild, Heine, Fould, Stern and Worms). A rivalry soon grew up between the older Protestant bankers and the newer Jewish bankers, largely along political rather than religious lines which grew confused as some of the Jewish group gave up their religion and moved over to the Protestant group. The leadership of the Protestant group was exercised by Mirabaud, the leadership of the Jewish group was held by Rothschild. These two wings were so close that Mirabaud and Rothschild together dominated the whole financial system and frequently cooperated together even when their groups as a whole were in competition. After 1838, this simple picture was complicated by the slow rise of a third group of bankers who were Catholics which soon split into two halves and joined the other two groups. Page 517 The rivalry of these two great powers fills the pages of French history in the period 1884-1940. It paralyzed the French political system and economic system preventing economic recovery from the depression in 1935-1940. From 1880-1925, the private bankers continued to exist and grow in power. They were at first chiefly interested in government obligations and the greatest bankers, like Mirabaud and Rothschild, had intimate connections with governments and weak connections with the economic life of the country. Page 518 To finance railroads, the small savings of many were gathered and made available to the private banker to direct wherever he thought fitting. Thus the private banker became a manager of other persons' funds rather than lender of his own. The private banker became much more influential and much less noticeable. He now controlled billions where he formerly controlled millions and he did it unobtrusively, acting from the background, concealed from public view. The public did not notice that the names of private bankers and their agents still graced the list of directors of new financial enterprises. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig09.htm (13 of 36)22.5.2005 19:18:25"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 520 The centre of the French economic system in the 20th century was not to be found, as some have believed, in the Bank of France, but, instead, resided in a group of almost unknown institutions - the private banks. There were over a hundred of these private banks and two (Rothschild and Mirabaud) were more powerful than all the others combined. These private banks acted as the High Command of the French economic system. Their stock was closely held in the hands of about forty families. They were the same private banks which had set up the Bank of France divided into a group of seven Jewish banks, a group of seven Protestant banks and a group of five Catholic banks. The various groups continued to cooperate in the management of the Bank of France which was controlled until 1936, as it had been in 1813, by the handful of private banks which created it. Page 521 The state was influenced by the Treasury's need for funds from the Bank of France. These investment banks supplied long-term capital to industry and took stock and directorships in return. In 1931, Paribas held the securities of 357 corporations and its own directors and top managers held 180 directorships in 120 of the more important of these. Page 522 The Jewish bankers were allied to Standard Oil and Rockefeller while the Catholic-Protestant bankers were allied to Royal Dutch Shell and Deterding. Page 524 In 1936, there were about 800 important firms. Of these 800, the Paribas bloc controlled almost 400 and the Union-Comite bloc about 300.

Havas was a great monopolistic news agency. It could, and did, suppress or spread both news and advertising. It received secret subsidies from the government for almost a century. The monopoly on distribution of periodicals and books could be used to kill papers which were regarded as objectionable. After 1937, the Paribas bloc was badly split by the controversy over orthodox and unorthodox financial methods for dealing with depression.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Page 529 By the 1880s, the techniques of financial capitalism reached levels of corruption which were never approached in Europe. This corruption sought to cheat the ordinary investor by flotations and manipulations of securities for the benefit of insiders. The practitioners of these dishonesties were as socially acceptable as their wealth entitled them to be without animadversions on how that wealth was obtained. Page 530 Corrupt techniques associated with the names Daniel Drew and Jay Gould were also practiced by Morgan and others who became respectable from longer sustained success. Any reform of Wall Street practices came from pressure from the farming West and was long delayed by the close alliance of Wall Street with the two major political parties. By 1900, the influence of Morgan in the Republican party was dominant, his chief rivalry coming from Rockefeller of Ohio. From 1880 to 1930, financial capitalism approximated a feudal structure in which two great powers, centered in New York, dominated a number of lesser powers. No description of this structure as it existed in the 1920s can be given in a brief compass, since it infiltrated all aspects of American life and especially all branches of economic life. At the center were a group of less than dozen investment banks which were still unincorporated partnerships at the height of their powers. These included J.P. Morgan, the Rockefeller family, Kuhn, Loeb, Dillon, Read, Brown Brothers and Harriman, and others. Each of these was linked in organizational or personal relationships with various banks, insurance companies, railroads, utilities and industrial firms. The result was to form a number of webs of economic power. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig09.htm (15 of 36)22.5.2005 19:18:25"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"g$biloxi J.P. Morgan worked in close relationship with a group of banks and insurance companies. The whole nexus dominated a network of business firms which included at least one-sixth of the two hundred largest non-financial corporations. Page 531 The Rockefeller group, investing only its own profits, functioned as a capitalist unit in close cooperation with Morgan and controlled over half the assets of the oil industry. Page 532 The economic power represented by these figures is almost beyond imagination to grasp. Morgan and Rockefeller together frequently dominated the national Republican Party while Morgan occasionally had extensive influence in the national Democratic Party. These two were also powerful on the state level, especially Morgan in New York and Rockefeller in Ohio. Mellon was a power in Pennsylvania and Du Pont in Delaware. In the 1920s, this system of economic and political power formed a hierarchy headed by the Morgan interests and played a principal role both in political and business life. Morgan, operating on the international level in cooperation with his allies abroad, especially in England, influenced the events of history to a degree which cannot be specified in detail but which certainly was tremendous. The deflationary financial policies on which these bankers insisted were laying the foundations of the economic collapse into general social disaster by 1940. Unemployment which had reached 13 million persons in 1933 was still at 10 million in 1940 Page 533 The deflationary policies of the bankers were acceptable to heavy industry chiefly because it was not unionized. With assembly-line techniques financed by the bankers and unorganized labor, the employers could rearrange, curtail, or terminate labor without notice on a daily basis and could thus reduce labor costs to meet falls in prices from bankers' deflation. The fact that reductions in wages and large lay-offs also reduced the volume of purchasing power as a whole, to the injury of the groups selling consumers' goods, was ignored by the makers of heavy producers' goods. In this way, farmers and other segments of the society were injured by the deflationary policies of the bankers and by the employment policies of heavy industry, closely allied to the bankers. When these policies became unbearable in the depression of 1929- 1933, these other interest blocs deserted the Republican party which remained subservient to high finance and heavy industry.

Roosevelt and the New Deal. Page 534 The New Deal's actions against finance did not represent any victory for unorthodox financing, the real key to either monopoly capitalism or to a managed pluralist society. The reason for this was that the New Deal was fundamentally orthodox in its ideas on the nature of money. Roosevelt was quite willing to unbalance the budget and to spend in a depression in an unorthodox fashion because he had grasped the idea that lack of purchasing power was the cause of the lack of demand which made unsold goods and unemployment, but he had no idea of the causes of the depression and had quite orthodox ideas on the nature of money. As a result, his administration treated the symptoms rather than the causes of the depression and, while spending unorthodoxly to treat these symptoms, did so with money borrowed from the banks in the accepted fashion. The New Deal allowed bankers to create the money, borrowed it from the banks,and spent it. This meant that the New Deal ran up the national debt to the credit of the banks, and spent money in such a limited fashion that no drastic re- employment of idle resources was possible. One of the most significant facts about the New Deal was its orthodoxy on money. For the whole 12 years he was in the White House, Roosevelt had statutory power to issue fiat money in the form of greenbacks printed by the government without recourse to the banks. This authority was never used. As a result of such orthodoxy, the depression's symptoms of idle resources were overcome only when the emergency of the war in 1942 made it possible to justify a limitless increase in the national debt by limitless borrowing from private persons and the banks. But the whole episode showed a failure to grasp the nature of money and the function of the monetary system, of which considerable traces remained in the postwar period. Page 535 One reason for the New Deal's readiness to continue with an orthodox theory of the nature of money, along with an unorthodox practice in its use, arose from the failure of the Roosevelt administration to recognize the nature of the economic crisis itself. This failure can be seen in Roosevelt's theory of \"pump priming.\" He sincerely believed, as did his Secretary of the Treasury, that there was nothing structurally wrong with the economy, that it was temporarily stalled, and would keep going of its own powers if it could be restarted... The inadequacy of this theory of the depression was shown in 1937 when the New Deal, after four years of pump priming and a victorious election in 1936, stopped its spending. Instead of taking off, the http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig09.htm (17 of 36)22.5.2005 19:18:25"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"g$biloxi economy collapsed in the steepest recession in history. The New Deal had to resume its treatment of symptoms but now without hope that the spending program could ever be ended, a hopeless prospect since the administration lacked the knowledge of how to reform the system or even how to escape from borrowing bank credit with its mounting public debt, and the administration lacked the courage to adopt the really large-scale spending necessary to give full employment of resources. The administration was saved from this impasse by the need for the rearmament program followed by the war. Since 1947 the Cold War and the space program have allowed the same situation to continue, so that even today, prosperity is not the result of a properly organized economic system but of government spending, and any drastic reduction in such spending would give rise to an acute depression. THE ECONOMIC FACTORS Page 540 There are a number of important elements in the economic situation of the 20th century. 8. The increasing disparity in the distribution of income is the most controversial and least well-established characteristic of the system. It would appear that the disparity in national income has been getting wider. In the US, the richest one-fifth receive 46% of the income in 1910, 51% in 1929 and 48% in 1937. In the same three years, the share of the poorest one-fifth fell from 8% to 5.4% to 3.6% If instead of one-fifth, we examine the richest and poorest one- tenth, in 1910 the ratio was 10, in 1929 it was 21.7, in 1937, it was 34.4. This means that the rich were getting richer relatively and probably absolutely while the poor were getting poorer both relatively and absolutely. Page 542 The progressives who insisted that the lack of investment was caused by lack of consumer purchasing power were correct. But the conservatives who insisted that the lack of investment was caused by lack of confidence were also correct. Each was looking at the opposite side of a single continuous cycle: a) purchasing power creates demand for goods; b) demand for goods creates confidence in the minds of investors; c) confidence creates new investment; d) new investment creates purchasing power which then creates demand. It would appear that the economic factors alone affected the distribution of incomes in the direction of increasing disparity.

This long-run benefit began to appear when capacity employment of capital and labor was achieved in 1937. Page 546 In the modern economic community, the sum total of goods and services appearing in the market is at one and the same time the income of the community and the aggregate cost of producing goods and services in question. Aggregate costs, aggregate incomes and aggregate prices are the same since they are merely opposite sides of the identical expenditures. The purchasing power available in the community is equal to income minus savings. If there are any savings, the available purchasing power will be less than the aggregate prices being asked for the products for sale and the amount of the savings. Thus, all the goods and services produced cannot be sold as long as savings are held back. In order for al the goods to be sold, it is necessary for the savings to reappear in the market as purchasing power. The disequilibrium between purchasing power and prices which are created by the act of saving is restored completely by the act of investment, and all the goods can be sold at the prices asked. But whenever investment is less than savings, the available supply of purchasing power is inadequate by the same amount to by the goods being offered. This margin by which purchasing power is inadequate because of an excess of savings over investment may be called the \"deflationary gap.\"This \"deflationary gap\" is the key to the twentieth century economic crisis and one of the three central cores of the whole tragedy of the century. THE RESULTS OF THE ECONOMIC DEPRESSION Page 547 The deflationary gap arising from a failure of investment to reach the level of savings can be closed either by lowering the supply of goods to the level of available purchasing power or by raising the supply of purchasing power to a level able to absorb the existing supply of goods, or a combination of both. The first solution will give a stabilized economy on a low level of activity; the second will give a stabilized economy on a high level of activity. Left to itself, the economic system under modern conditions would adopt the former procedure working as follows: The deflationary gap will result in http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig09.htm (19 of 36)22.5.2005 19:18:25"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"g$biloxi falling prices, declining economic activity and rising unemployment.

This decline continues until the volume of savings reaches the level of investment at which point the fall is arrested and the economy becomes stabilized at a low level. This process did not work itself out in any industrial country during the great depression because the disparity in national income was so great that a considerable portion of the population would have been driven to zero incomes and absolute want before savings of the richer segment fell to the level of investment. Under such conditions, the masses of population would have been driven to revolution and the stabilization, if reached, would have been on a level so low that a considerable portion of the population would have been in absolute want. Because of this, governments took steps to arrest the course of the depression before their citizens were driven to desperation. The methods used to deal with the depression and close the deflationary gap were all reducible to two fundamental types: a) those which destroy goods, and b) those which produce goods which do not enter the market. The destruction of goods will close the deflationary gap by reducing the supply of unsold goods through lowering the supply of goods to the level of the supply of purchasing power. It is not generally realized that this method is one of the chief ways in which the gap is closed in a normal business cycle where goods are destroyed by the simple expedient of not producing the goods which the system is capable of producing. The failure to use full level of 1929 output represented a loss of $100 billion in the US, Britain and Germany alone. This loss was equivalent to the destruction of such goods. Destruction of goods by failure to gather the harvest is a common phenomenon under modern conditions. When a farmer leaves his crop unharvested because the price is too low to cover the expense of harvesting, he is destroying the goods. Outright destruction of goods already produced is not common and occurred for the first time as a method of combating depression in the years 1930-1934. During this period, stores of coffee, sugar, and bananas were destroyed, corn was plowed under, and young livestock was slaughtered to reduce the supply on the market. The destruction of goods in warfare is another example of this method of overcoming deflationary conditions in the economic system. Page 548 The second method of filling the deflationary gap, namely, by producing goods which do not enter the market, accomplishes its purpose by providing purchasing power in the market, since the costs of production of such goods do enter the market as purchasing power, http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig09.htm (20 of 36)22.5.2005 19:18:25"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"g$biloxi while the goods themselves do not drain funds from the system if they are not offered for sale. New investment was the usual way in which this was accomplished in the normal business cycle but it is not the normal way of filling the gap under modern conditions of depression. We have already seen the growing reluctance to invest and the unlikely chance that the purchasing power necessary for prosperity will be provided by a constant stream of private investment. It this is so, the funds for producing goods which do not enter the market must be sought in a program of public spending. Any program of public spending at once runs into the problems of inflation and public debt. These are the same two problems mentioned in connection with the efforts of government to pay for the First World War. The methods of paying for a depression are exactly the same as the methods of paying for a war, except that the combination of methods used may be somewhat different because the goals are somewhat different. In financing a war, we should seek to achieve a method which will provide a maximum of output with a minimum of inflation and public debt. In dealing with a depression, since a chief aim is to close the deflationary gap, the goal will be to provide a maximum of output with a necessary degree of inflation and a minimum of public debt. Thus the use of fiat money is more justifiable in financing a depression than in financing a war. Moreover the selling of bonds to private persons in wartime might well be aimed at the lower-income groups in order to reduce consumption and release facilities for war production, while in a depression (where low consumption is the chief problem) such sales of bonds to finance public spending would have to be aimed at the savings of the upper-income groups. These ideas on the role of government spending in combating depression have been formally organized into the \"theory of the compensatory economy.\" This theory advocates that government spending and fiscal policies be organized so that they work exactly contrary to the business cycle, with lower taxes and larger spending in deflationary period and higher taxes with reduced spending in a boom period, the fiscal deficits of the down cycle being counterbalanced in the national budget by the surpluses of the up cycle. Page 549 This compensatory economy has not been applied with much success in any European country except Sweden. In a democratic country, it would take the control of taxing and spending away from the elected representatives of the people and place this precious \"power of the purse\" at the control of the automatic processes of the business cycle as interpreted by bureaucratic (and representative) experts. Moreover, all these programs of deficit spending are in jeopardy in a country with a private banking system. In such a system, the creation of money http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig09.htm (21 of 36)22.5.2005 19:18:25"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"g$biloxi (or credit) is usually reserved for the private banking institutions and is deprecated as a government action. The argument that the creation of finds by the government is bad while creation of funds by the banks is salutary is very persuasive in a system based on traditional laissez faire and in which the usual avenues of communications (such as newspapers and radio) are under private, or even banker, control. Public spending as a method of counteracting depression can vary very greatly in character, depending on the purposes of the spending. Spending for destruction of goods or for restriction of output, as under the New Deal agricultural program, cannot be justified easily in a democratic country with freedom of communications because it obviously results in a decline in national income and living standards. Spending for non-productive monuments is somewhat easier to justify but is hardly a long-run solution. Spending for investment in productive equipment (like the Tennessee Valley Authority Dam) is obviously the best solution since it leads to an increase in national wealth and standards of living and is a long-run solution but it marks a permanent departure from a system of private capitalism and can be easily attacked in a country with a capitalistic ideology and a private banking system. Spending on armaments and national defence is the last method of fighting depression and is the one most readily and most widely adopted in the twentieth century. A program of public expenditure on armaments is a method for filling the deflationary gap and overcoming depression because it adds purchasing power to the market without drawing it out again later (since the armaments, once produced, are not put up for sale). From an economic point of view, this method of combating depression is not much different from the method listed earlier under destruction of goods, for, in this case also, economic resources are diverted from constructive activities or idleness to production for destruction. The appeal of this method for coping with the problem of depression does not rest on economic grounds at all, for, on such grounds, there is no justification. It's appeal is rather to be found on other, especially political, grounds. Page 550 The adoption of rearmament as a method of combating depression does not have to be conscious. The country which adopts it may honestly feel that it is adopting the policy for good reasons, that it is threatened by aggression, and that a program of re-armament is necessary for political protection. It is very rare for a country consciously to adopt a program of aggression, for, in most wars, both sides are convinced that their actions are defensive. It is almost http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig09.htm (22 of 36)22.5.2005 19:18:25"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"g$biloxi equally rare for a country to adopt a policy of re-armament as a solution for depression. If a country adopts re-armament because of fear of another's arms and these last are the result of efforts to fill a deflationary gap, it can also be said that the re-armament of the former has a basic economic cause. In the 20th century, the vested interests usually sought to prevent the reform of the economic system (a reform whose need was made evident by the long-drawn-out depression) by adopting an economic program whose chief element was the effort to fill the deflationary gap by re-armament. THE PLURALIST ECONOMY AND WORLD BLOCS The economic disasters of two wars, a world depression, and the post-war fluctuations showed clearly by 1960 that a new economic organization of society was both needed and available. The laissez- faire competitive system had destroyed itself and almost destroyed civilization as well by its inability to distribute the goods it could produce. The system of monopoly capitalism had helped in this disaster. Page 551 The almost simultaneous failure of laissez-faire, Fascism, and of Communism to satisfy the growing popular demand both for rising standards of living and for spiritual liberty had forced the mid-20th century to seek some new economic organization. Underdeveloped peoples have been struck by the conflicting claims of the two great super-Powers.. The former offered the goods the new peoples wanted (rising standards of living and freedom) while the latter seemed to offer methods of getting these goods (by state accumulation of capital, government direction of resources) which might tend to smother these goals. The net result has been a convergence toward a common, if remote, system of the future whose ultimate nature is not yet clear but which we might call the \"pluralist economy.\" CHAPTER XII: THE POLICY OF APPEASEMENT 1931-1936 Page 559 The structure of collective security was destroyed completely under the assaults of Japan, Italy and Germany who were attacking the whole nineteenth century way of life and some of the most fundamental attributes of Western Civilization itself. They were in revolt against democracy, against the parliamentary system, against laissez-faire and the liberal outlook, against nationalism (although in the name of http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig09.htm (23 of 36)22.5.2005 19:18:25"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"g$biloxi nationalism), against humanitarianism, against science and against all respect for human dignity and human decency. It was recruited from the dregs of society. Page 560 During the nineteenth century, goals were completely lost or were reduced to the most primitive level of obtaining more power and more wealth. But the constant acquisition of power or wealth, like a narcotic for which the need grows as its use increases without in any way satisfying the user, left man's \"higher\" nature unsatisfied. Page 561 Germany could have made no aggression without the acquiescence and even in some cases the actual encouragement of the \"satisfied\" Powers, especially Britain. THE JAPANESE ASSAULT, 1931-1941 The similarity between Germany and Japan was striking: each had a completely cartelized industry, a militaristic tradition, a hard- working population which respected authority and loved order, a facade of parliamentary constitutionalism which barely concealed the reality of power wielded by an alliance of army, landlords, and industry. Page 562 The steady rise in tariffs against Japanese manufactured goods after 1897 led by America served to increase the difficulties of Japan's position. The world depression and the financial crisis hit Japan a terrible blow. Under this impact, the reactionary and aggressive forces were able to solidify their control and embark on that adventure of aggression and destruction that ultimately led to the disasters of 1945. Page 563 Separate from the armed forces were the forces of monopoly capitalism, the eight great economic complexes controlled as family units knows as \"zaibatsu\" which controlled 75% of the nation's wealth. By 1930, the militarists and zaibatsu came together in their last fateful alliance. Page 569 Japan's unfavorable balance of trade was reflected in a heavy outflow of gold in 1937-1938. It was clear that Japan was losing its financial and commercial ability to buy necessary materials of foreign origin. The steps taken by America, Australia, and others to restrict export of strategic or military materials to Japan made this problem http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig09.htm (24 of 36)22.5.2005 19:18:25"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"g$biloxi even more acute. The attack on China had been intended to remedy this situation by removing the Chinese boycott on Japanese goods. Page 570 Under the pressure of the growing reluctance of neutral countries to supply Japan with necessary strategic goods, the most vital being petroleum products and rubber, it seemed that the occupation of the Dutch Indies and Malaya could do much to alleviate these shortages but which would lead to an American war on Japan. They decided to attack the United States first. THE ITALIAN ASSAULT, 1934-1936 Page 571 In 1922, the Fascists came to power in a parliamentary system; in 1925 it was replaced by a political dictatorship while the economic system remained that of orthodox financial capitalism; in 1927 an orthodox and restrictive stabilization of the lira on the international gold standard led to such depressed economic conditions that Mussolini adopted a much more active foreign policy; in 1934 Italy replaced orthodox economic measures by a totalitarian economy functioning beneath a fraudulent corporate facade. Italy was dissatisfied over its lack of colonial gains at Versailles and the refusal of the League to accede to Tittoni's request for a redistribution of the world's resources in accordance with population needs made in 1920. In a series of agreements with Austria and Hungary known as the \"Rome Protocols,\" the Austrian government under Engelbert Dollfuss destroyed the democratic institutions of Austria, wiped out all Socialist and working-class organizations, and established a one-party dictatorial corporate state at Mussolini's behest in 1934. Hitler took advantage of this to attempt a Nazi coup in Austria, murdering Dollfuss in July 1934 but he was prevented by the quick mobilization of Italian troops on the Brenner frontier and a stern warning from Mussolini. Page 572 Hitler's ascension to office in Germany in 1933 found French foreign policy paralyzed by British opposition to any efforts to support collective security or to enforce German observation of its treaty obligations by force. As a result, a suggestion from Poland in 1933 for joint armed intervention in Germany to remove Hitler from office was rejected by France. Poland at once made an non-aggression pact with Germany and extended a previous one with the Soviet Union. In 1934, France under Jean Louis Bathou, began to adopt a more active policy against Hitler seeking to encircle Germany by bringing http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig09.htm (25 of 36)22.5.2005 19:18:25"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"g$biloxi the Soviet Union and Italy into a revived alignment of France, Poland, the Little Entente, Greece and Turkey. Page 573 France's Laval was convinced that Italy could be brought into the anti-German front only if its long-standing grievances and unfulfilled ambitions in Africa could be met. Accordingly, he gave Mussolini 7% of the stock in the Djibouti-Addis Ababa Railway, a stretch of desert 114,000 square miles in extent but containing only a few hundred persons (sixty-two according to Mussolini) on the border of Libya, a small wedge of territory between French Somaliland and Italian Eritrea, and the right to ask for concessions throughout Ethiopia. While Laval insisted that he had made no agreement which jeopardized Ethiopia's independence or territorial integrity, he made it equally clear that Italian support against Germany was more important than the integrity of Ethiopia in his eyes. France had been Ethiopia's only friend and had brought it into the League of Nations. Italy had been prevented from conquering Ethiopia in 1896 only by a decisive defeat of her invading forces at the hands of the Ethiopians themselves, while in 1925, Britain and Italy had cut her up into economic spheres by an agreement which was annulled by a French appeal to the League. Laval's renunciation of France's traditional support of Ethiopian independence brought Italy, Britain and France into agreement on this issue. Page 574 This point of view was not shared by public opinion in these three countries. Stanley Baldwin (party leader and prime minister) erected one of the most astonishing examples of British \"dual\" policy in the appeasement period. While publicly supporting collective security and sanctions against Italian aggression, the government privately negotiated to destroy the League and to yield Ethiopia to Italy. They were completely successful in this secret policy. The Italian invaders had no real fear of British military sanctions when they put a major part of their forces in the Red Sea separated from home by the British-controlled Suez canal. The British government's position was clearly stated in a secret report by Sir John Maffey which declared that Italian control of Ethiopia would be a \"matter of indifference\" to Britain. This opinion was shared by the French government too. Unfortunately, public opinion was insisting on collective sanctions against the aggressor. To meet this demand, both governments engaged in a public policy of unenforced or partially enforced sanctions at wide variance with their real intentions. Foreign Secretary Samuel Hoare delivered a smashing speech to support sanctions against Italy. The day previously he and Anthony http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig09.htm (26 of 36)22.5.2005 19:18:25"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Eden had secretly agreed with Pierre Laval to impose only partial economic sanctions avoiding all actions such as blockade of the Suez canal. Page 575 A number of governments including Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France and Britain had stopped all exports of munitions to Ethiopia as early as May 1935 although Ethiopia's appeal to the League for help had been made on March 17th while the Italian attack did not come until October. The net result was that Ethiopia was left defenceless and her appeal to the US for support was at once rejected. Hoare's speech evoked such applause from the British public that Baldwin decided to hold a general election on that issue. Accordingly, with ringing pledge to support collective security, the National government won an amazing victory and stayed in power until the next general election ten years later (1945). Although Article 16 of the League Covenant bound the signers to break off all trade with an aggressor, France and Britain combined to keep their economic sanctions partial and ineffective. The imposition of oil sanctions was put off again and again until the conquest of Ethiopia was complete. The refusal to establish this sanction resulted from a joint British-French refusal on the grounds that an oil sanction would be so effective that Italy would be compelled to break of its was with Ethiopia and would, in desperation, make war on Britain and France. This, at least, was the amazing logic offered by the British government later. Page 576 Hoare and Laval worked out a secret deal which would have given Italy outright about one-sixth of Ethiopia. When news of this deal was broken to the public, there was a roar of protest on the grounds that this violated the election pledge made but a month previously. To save his government, Baldwin had to sacrifice Hoare who resigned on December 19 but returned to Cabinet on June 5 as soon as Ethiopia was decently buried. Laval fell from office and was succeeded by Pierre Flandin who pursued the same policy. Ethiopia was conquered on May 2 1936. Sanctions were removed in the next two months just as they were beginning to take effect. The consequences of the Ethiopian fiasco were of the greatest importance. The Conservative Party in England was entrenched in office for a decade during which it carried out its policy of appeasement and waged the resulting war. The US passed a \"Neutrality Act\" which encouraged aggression, at the outbreak of war, by cutting off supplies to both sides, to the aggressor who had armed at his leisure and to the victim as yet unarmed. Above all, it destroyed French efforts to encircle Germany. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig09.htm (27 of 36)22.5.2005 19:18:25"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"g$biloxi CIRCLES AND COUNTERCIRCLES, 1935-1939 Page 577 The remilitarization of the Rhineland in violation of the Versailles Treaty was the most important result of the Ethiopian crisis.

Page 579 The British attitude towards eastern Europe was made perfectly clear when Sir John Simon demanded arms equality for Germany. Adding to the encirclement of France was the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of June 1935. Page 580 Parallel with the encirclement of France went the encirclement of the Soviet Union known as the anti-Comintern Pact, the union of Germany and Japan against Communism. The last encirclement was that against Czechoslovakia. Hungary and Germany were both opposed to Czechoslovakia as an \"artificial\" creation of the Versailles Conference. The Polish-German agreement of 1934 opened a campaign until the Polish invasion in 1938. An analysis of the motivations of Britain in 1938-1939 is bound to be difficult because the motives of government were clearly not the same as the motives of the people and in no country has secrecy and anonymity been carried so has been been so well preserved as in Britain. In general, motives become vaguer and less secret as we move our attention from the innermost circles of the government outward. As if we were looking at the layers of an onion, we may discern four points of view: 1) the anti-Bolsheviks at the center; 2) the \"three-bloc-world\" supporters close to the center; 3) the supporters of \"appeasement\" and 4) the \"peace at any price\" group in peripheral position. Page 581 The chief figures in the anti-Bolshevik group were Lord http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig09.htm (28 of 36)22.5.2005 19:18:25"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Curzon, Lord D'Abernon and General Smuts. They did what they could to destroy reparations and permit German re-armament. This point of view was supported by the second group, the Round Table Group, and came later to be called the Clivenden Set which included Lord Milner, Lord Brand (managing director of Lazard Brothers, international bankers). This group wielded great influence because it controlled the Rhodes Trust and dominated the Royal Institute of International Affairs. They sought to contain the Soviet Union rather than destroy it as the anti-Bolsheviks wanted. They advocated a secret alliance of Britain with the German military leaders against the Soviet. Page 583 Abandoning Austria, Czechoslovakia and the Polish Corridor to Germany was the aim of both the anti-Bolsheviks and the \"three-bloc\" people. Page 584 From August 1935 to March 1939, the government built upon the fears of the \"peace at any price\" group by steadily exaggerating Germany's armed might and belittling their own, by calculated indiscretions like the statement that there were no real anti-aircraft guns in London, by constant hammering at the danger of air attack without warning, by building ostentatious and quite useless air-raid trenches in the streets and parks of London, and by insisting through daily warnings that everyone must be fitted with a gas mask immediately (although the danger of a gas attack was nil). In this way, the government put London into a panic in 1938 and by this panic, Chamberlain was able to get the people to accept the destruction of Czechoslovakia. Since he could not openly appeal on the anti- Bolshevik basis, he had to adopt the expedient of pretending to resist (in order to satisfy the British public) while really continuing to make every possible concession to Hitler which would bring Germany to a common frontier with the Soviet Union. Page 585 Chamberlain's motives were not really bad ones; he wanted peace so he could devote Britain's limited resources to social welfare; but he was narrow and totally ignorant of the realities of power, convinced that international politics could be conducted in terms of secret deals, as business was, and he was quite ruthless in carrying out his aims, especially in his readiness to sacrifice non-English persons who, in his eyes, did not count.

As a result of more than a thousand years of such struggles, almost all elements of Spanish society have developed a fanatical intolerance, an uncompromising individualism, and a fatal belief that physical force is a solution to all problems, however spiritual. Page 588 The war of 1898, by depriving Spain of much of its empire, left its over-sized army with little to do and with a reduced area on which to batten. Like a vampire octopus, the Spanish Army settled down to drain the life-blood of Spain and, above all, Morocco. This brought the army officers into alignment with conservative forces consisting of the Church (upper clergy), the landlords, and the monarchists. The forces of the proletariat discontent consisted of the urban workers and the much larger mass of exploited peasants. Page 591 In 1923, while most of Spain was suffering from malnutrition, most of the land was untilled and the owners refused to use irrigation facilities which had built by government. As a result, agricultural yields were the poorest in western Europe. While 15 men owned about a million acres and 15,000 men owned about the of all taxed land, almost 2 million owned the other half, frequently in plots too small for subsistence. About 2 million more, who were completely landless, worked 10 to 14 hours a day for about 2.5 pesetas (35 cents) a day for only six months in the year and paid exorbitant rents without any security of tenure. In the Church, while the ordinary priests share the poverty and tribulations of the people, the upper clergy were closely allied with government and supported by an annual grant. They had seats in the upper chamber, control of education, censorship, marriage. In consequence of this alliance of the upper clergy with government and the forces of reaction, all animosities built against the latter came to be directed against the former also. Although the people remained universally and profoundly catholic, they also became incredibly anticlerical reflected in the proclivity for burning churches. All these groups, landlords, officers, upper clergy, and monarchists, were interest groups seeking to utilize Spain for their own power and profit.

The republic lasted only five years before Civil War began in 1936 after being challenged constantly from the Right and the extreme Left. Because of shifting governments, the liberal program which was enacted into law in 1931 was annulled or unenforced. Page 593 In an effort to reduce illiteracy (over 45% in 1930), the republic created thousands of new schools and new teachers, raised teachers' salaries, founded over a thousand libraries. Army officers were reduced with the surplus being retired on full pay. The republican officers tended to retire, the monarchists to stay on. To assist the peasants and workers, mixed juries were established to hear rural rent disputes, importation of labor for wage-breaking purposes was forbidden; and credit was provided for peasants to obtain land, seed, or fertilizers on favorable terms. Customarily uncultivated lands were expropriated with compensation to provide farms for a new class of peasant proprietors. Most of these reforms went into effect only partially. Few of the abandoned estates could be expropriated because of the lack of money for compensation. Page 594 The conservative groups reacted violently. Three plots began to be formed against the new republic, the one monarchist led by Sotelo in parliament and by Goicoechea behind the scenes; the second a parliamentary alliance of landlords and clericals under Robles; and the last a conspiracy of officers under Generals Barrera and Sanjurjo. In the meantime, the monarchist conspiracy was organized by former King Alfonso from abroad. Goicoechea performed his task with great skill under the eyes of a government which refused to take preventative action because of its own liberal and legalistic scruples. He organized an alliance of the officers, the Carlists, and his own Alfonsist party. Four men from these three groups then signed an agreement with Mussolini in 1934 who promised arms, money, diplomatic support and 1.5 million pesetas, 10,000 rifles,10,000 grenades, and 200 machine guns.

This led to a violent agitation which burst into open revolt in the two separatist centers of the Basque country and Catalonia. The uprising in Asturias spearheaded by anarchist miners hurling dynamite from slings, lasted for nine days. The government used the Foreign Legion and Moors, brought to Morocco by sea, and crushed the rebels without mercy. The latter suffered at 5,000 casualties. After the uprising, 25,000 suspects were thrown into prison. The uprising of October 1934, although crushed, split the oligarchy.

By its insistence on enforcing non-intervention against the Loyalists, while ignoring the systematic and large-scale evasions of the agreement in behalf of the rebels, Britain was neither fair nor neutral, and had to engage in large-scale violations of international law. Britain refuse to permit any restrictions to be placed on war material going to Portugal (to the rebels). It refused to allow the Loyalist Spanish Navy to blockade the seaports held by the rebels, and took immediate action against efforts by the Madrid government to interfere with any kind of shipments to rebel areas, http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig09.htm (33 of 36)22.5.2005 19:18:25"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"g$biloxi while wholesale assaults by the rebels on British and other neutral ships going to Loyalist areas drew little more than feeble protests from Britain. Britain was clearly seeking a rebel victory and instead of trying to enforce nonintervention, was actively supporting the rebel blockade of Loyalist Spain when the British Navy began, in 1937, to intercept British ships headed for Loyalist ports and on some pretext, or simply by force, made them go elsewhere. The rebel forces were fewer than the Loyalists but were eventually successful because of their great superiority in artillery, aviation, and tanks as a result of the one-sided enforcement of the non-intervention agreement. Page 600 The failure of Franco to capture Madrid led to a joint Italian- German meeting where it was decided to recognize the Franco government and withdraw their recognition from Madrid on Nov. 18, 1936. Japan recognized the Franco regime in December. As a result, Franco received the full support of the aggressor states while the Loyalist government was obstructed in every way by the \"peace-loving\" Powers. Italy sent 100,000 men and suffered 50,000 casualties, Germany sent 20,000 men. On the other side, the Loyalists were cut off from foreign supplies almost at once because of the embargoes of the Great Powers and obtained only limited amounts, chiefly from Mexico, Russia and the US until the Non-intervention agreement cut these off. On Jan. 18, 1937, the American Neutrality Act was revised to apply to civil as well as international wars and was invoked against Spain immediately but unofficial pressure from the American government prevented such exports to Spain even earlier. The Madrid government made violent protests against the Axis intervention both before the Non-intervention Committee in London and before the League of Nations. These were denied by the Axis Powers. An investigation of these charges was made under Soviet pressure but the Committee reported that these charges were unproved. Anthony Eden went so far to say that so far as non-intervention was concerned, \"there were other governments more to blame tan either Germany or Italy.\" Page 601 Soviet intervention began Oct 7,1936, three and a half years after Italian intervention and almost three months after both Italian and German units were fighting with the rebels. The Third International recruited volunteers throughout the world to fight in Spain. This Soviet intervention in support of the Madrid government at a time when it could find support almost nowhere else served to increase Communist influence in the government very greatly. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig09.htm (34 of 36)22.5.2005 19:18:25"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 602 The Italian submarine fleet was waiting for Russian shipping in the Mediterranean and did not hesitate to sink it in the last few months of 1936. Although the evidence for Axis intervention in Spain was overwhelming and was admitted by the Powers themselves early in 1937, the British refused to admit it and refused to modify the non- intervention policy. Britain's attitude was so devious that it can hardly be untangled although the results were clear enough. The real sympathy of the London government clearly favored the rebels although it had to conceal the fact from public opinion since this opinion favored the Loyalists over Franco by 57% to 7% according to a 1938 opinion poll. Page 603 On December 18, 1936, Eden admitted that the government had exaggerated the danger of war four months earlier to get the non- intervention agreement accepted, and when Britain wanted to use force to achieve its aims, as it did in the piracy of Italian submarines in 1937, it did so without risk of war. The non-intervention agreement, as practiced, was neither an aid to peace nor an example of neutrality, but was clearly enforced in such a way as to give aid to the rebels and place all possible obstacles in the way of the Loyalist government suppressing the rebellion. The attitude of the British government could not be admitted publicly and every effort was made to picture the actions of the Non- intervention Committee as one of even-handed neutrality. In fact, it was used to throw dust in the eyes of the world, especially the British public. For months, the meaningless debates of this committee were reported in detail to the world and charges, countercharges, proposals, counterproposals, investigations and inconclusive conclusions were offered to the a confused world, thus successfully increasing its confusion. While debating and quibbling on about issues like belligerence, patrols, volunteers, etc., before the Committee in London, the Franco forces, with their foreign contingents, slowly crushed the Loyalist forces.

Page 608 The Social Democrats were unable to reconcile their desire for union with Germany (called Anschluss) with the need for financial aid from the Entente Powers who opposed this. The Social Democrats embarked on an amazing program of social welfare by a system of direct taxes which bore heavily on the well-to- do. Page 609 Before 1914, the living conditions of the poor had been maintained by a very undemocratic political system under which only 83,000 persons, on a property basis, were allowed to vote and 5,500 of the richest were allowed to choose one-third of all seats on city council. By 1933, the Social Democrats had built almost 60,000 dwellings so efficiently that the average cost per apartment was only about $1,650 each with average rent of $2 per month. Thus the poor of Vienna had all kinds of free or cheap medical care, dental care, education, libraries, amusements, sports, school lunches and maternity care provided by the city.

Seipel formed a \"Unity List\" of all the anti-Socialist parties he could muster but the election gave his party only 73 seats compared to 71 for the Social Democrats, 12 for the pan-Germans, 9 for the Agrarian League. He sought to change the Austrian constitution into a presidential dictatorship which required a two-thirds vote. It became necessary to use illegal methods. Page 610 The secret documents published since 1945 make it quite clear that Germany had no carefully laid plans to annex Austria and was not encouraging violence by the Nazis in Austria. Instead, every effort was made to restrict the Austrian Nazis to propaganda in order to win a gradual peaceful extension of Nazi influence. Page 611 The invasion of Austria in 1938 was a pleasant surprise even for the Nazi leaders and arose from several unexpected favorable circumstances. Secret documents now make it clear that in 1937 the German and British governments made secret decisions which sealed the fate of Austria and Czechoslovakia. It is evident from some of Hitler's statements that he had already received certain information about the secret decisions being made by Chamberlain on the British side. Page 612 The British government group controlling foreign policy had reached a seven point decision regarding Germany: 1. Hitler's Germany was the front-line bulwark against the spread of Communism in Europe. 2. The aim was a four power pact including Britain, France, Italy and Germany to exclude all Russian influence from Europe. 3. Britain had no objection to German acquisition of Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Danzig. 4. Germany must not use force to achieve its aims as this would precipitate a war in which Britain would have to intervene. Page 622 For years before June 1938, the government insisted that British rearming was progressing in a satisfactory fashion. Churchill questioned this and produced figures on German rearmament to prove http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig13.htm (2 of 31)22.5.2005 19:18:42"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"g$biloxi that Britain's own progress in this field was inadequate. These figures (which were not correct) were denied by the government. As late as March 1938, Chamberlain said that British rearmament were such as to make Britain an \"almost terrifying power.\" But as the year went on, the government adopted a quite different attitude. In order to persuade public opinion that it was necessary to yield to Germany, the government pretended that its armaments were quite inadequate. Page 623 We now know that this was a gross exaggeration. Britain produced almost 3000 \"military\" planes in 1938 and about 8,000 in 1939 compared to 3350 \"combat\" planes produced in Germany in 1938 and 4,733 in 1939. It is quite clear that Britain did not yield to superior force in 1938, as was stated at the time and has been stated since by many writers including Churchill. We have evidence that Chamberlain knew these facts but consistently gave a contrary impression and that Lord Halifax went so far as to call forth protests from the British military attaches in Prague and Paris. The British government made it clear to Germany both publicly and privately that they would not oppose Germany's projects. Dirksen wrote to Ribbentrop on June 3 1928 \"Anything which could be got without firing a shot can count upon the agreement of the British.\" THE CZECHOSLOVAK CRISIS, 1937-1938 Page 626 The economic discontent became stronger after the onset of the world depression in 1929 and especially after Hitler demonstrated that his policies could bring prosperity to Germany. Page 627 Within two weeks of Hitler's annexation of Austria, Britain put pressure on the Czechs to make concessions to the Germans; to encourage France and Germany to do the same. All this was justified by the argument that Germany would be satisfied if it obtained the Sudetenland and the Polish Corridor. All these assumptions were dubious. Page 628 Czechoslovakia was eliminated with the help of German aggression, French indecision and war-weariness, and British public appeasement and merciless secret pressure.

Page 633 It was necessary to impose the plan for Czechoslovakia on public opinion of the world by means of the slowly mounting war scare which reached the level of absolute panic on September 28th. The mounting horror of the relentless German mobilization was built up day by day while Britain and France ordered the Czechs not to mobilize in order \"not to provoke Germany.\" We now know that all these statements and rumors were not true and that the British government knew that they were not true at the time. Page 634 The Chamberlain government knew these facts but consistently gave a contrary impression. Lord Halifax particularly distorted the facts. Just as the crisis was reaching the boiling point in September 1938, the British ambassador in Paris reported to London that Colonel Lindbergh had just emerged from Germany with a report that Germany had 8,000 military planes and could manufacture 1,500 a month. We now know that Germany had about 1,500 planes, manufactured 280 a month. Page 635 Lindbergh repeated his tale of woe daily both in Paris and in London during the crisis. The British government began to fit the people of London with gas masks, the prime minister and the king called on the people to dig trenches in the parks, schoolchildren began to be evacuated. In general, every report or rumor which could add to the panic and defeatism was played up, and everything that might contribute to a strong or a united resistance to Germany was played down. Page 636 The Anglo-French decision was presented to the Czechoslovak government at 2a.m. on September 19 to be accepted at once. The Czechoslovak government accepted at 5p.m. on September 21st. Lord Halifax at once ordered the Czech police to be withdrawn from the Sudeten districts, and expressed the wish that the German troops move in at once. Page 638 At Munich, Hitler, Chamberlain, Mussolini and Daladier carved up Czechoslovakia without consulting anyone, least of all the Czechs. Germany was supreme in Europe.

THE YEAR OF DUPES, 1939 Page 642 Concessions to Germany continued but now parallel with concessions went a real effort to build up a strong front against Hitler. Page 643 The anti-Bolshevik and \"three-bloc-world\" groups had expected Hitler would get the Sudetenland, Danzig, and perhaps the Polish Corridor and that he would then be stabilized between the \"oceanic bloc\" and the Soviet Union. As a result of these hidden and conflicting forces, the history of international relations from September 1938 and September 1939 or even later is neither simple nor consistent. In general, the key to everything was the position of Britain. As a result of Lord Halifax's \"dyarchic\" policy, there were not only two policies but two groups carrying them out. Lord Halifax tried to satisfy the public demand for an end to appeasement while Chamberlain, Wilson, Simon and Hoare sought to make secret concessions to Hitler in order to achieve a general Anglo-German settlement. The one policy was public; the other was secret. Since the Foreign Office knew of both, it tried to build up the \"peace front\" against Germany so that it would look sufficiently imposing to satisfy public opinion and to drive Hitler to seek his desires by negotiation rather than by force so that public opinion in England would not force the government to declare a war that they did not want in order to remain in office. This complex plan broke down because Hitler was determined to have a war merely for the personal emotional thrill of wielding great power, while the effort to make a \"peace front\" sufficiently collapsible so that it could be case aside if Hitler either obtained his goals by negotiation or made a general settlement with Chamberlain merely resulted in making a \"peace front\" which was so weak it could neither maintain peace by threat of force nor win a war when peace was lost. Page 644 On March 15th, Chamberlain told the Commons that he accepted the seizure of Czechoslovakia and refused to accuse Hitler of bad faith. But two days later, when the howls of rage from the British public showed that he had misjudged the electorate, he denounced the seizure. However, nothing was done other than to recall Henderson from Berlin for consultations and cancel a visit to Berlin by the president of the Board of Trade. The seizure was declared illegal but was recognized in fact at once.

Page 647 Germany opened its negotiations with Poland in a fairly friendly way on October 24, 1938. It asked for Danzig and a strip a kilometer wide across the Polish Corridor to provide a highway and four-track railroad under German sovereignty. Poland's economic and harbor rights in Danzig were to be guaranteed and the \"corridor across the Corridor\" was to be isolated from Polish communications facilities by bridging or tunneling. Germany also wanted Poland to join an anti-Russian bloc. Germany was prepared to guarantee the country's existing frontiers, to extend the Non-aggression Pact of 1934 for 25 years, to guarantee the independence of Slovakia and to dispose of Ruthenia as Poland wished. These suggestions were rejected by Poland. About the same time, the Germans were using pressure on Romania to obtain an economic agreement which was signed on March 23rd. On March 17, London received a false report of a German ultimatum to Romania. Lord Halifax lost his head and, without checking his information, sent telegrams to Greece, Turkey, Poland, Bulgaria, Soviet Union asking what each country was prepared to do in the event of a German aggression against Romania. Four replied by asking London what it was prepared to do but Moscow suggested and immediate conference which Halifax rebuffed, wanting nothing more than an agreement to consult in a crisis. Poland was reluctant to sign any agreement involving Russia. However, when news reached London of Hitler's demands on Poland, Britain suddenly issued a unilateral guarantee of the latter state (March 31st). Page 648 \"In the event of any action which clearly threatened Polish independence and which the Polish government accordingly considered it vital to resist with their national forces, His Majesty's Government would feel themselves bound at once to lend the Polish Government all support in their power.\" This was an extraordinary assurance. The British government since 1918 had resolutely refused any bilateral agreement guaranteeing any state in western Europe. Now they were making a \"unilateral\" declaration in \"eastern\" Europe and they were giving that state the responsibility of deciding when that guarantee would take effect, something quite unprecedented. If Germany used force in Poland, public opinion in Britain would force Britain to declare war whether there was a guarantee or not. If the chief purpose of the unilateral guarantee to Poland was to frighten Germany, it had precisely the opposite effect. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig13.htm (6 of 31)22.5.2005 19:18:42"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 649 Hitler announced that the terms he had offered Poland had been rejected, negotiations broken off.

Page 650 In 1939, there was talk of a British loan to Poland of #100 million in May; On August 1 Poland finally got a credit for $8 million at a time when all London was buzzing about a secret loan of #1 billion from Britain to Germany. In 1936, Poland was given 2 billion francs as a rearmament long and on May 19, 1939, an agreement was signed by which France promised full air support to Poland on the first day of war, local skirmishing by the third day, and a full-scale offensive on the sixteenth day. On Aug. 23, General Gamelin informed his government that no military support could be given to Poland until the spring of 1940 and that a full-scale offensive could not be made before 1941-1942. Poland was never informed of this change and seems to have entered the war on September 1st in the belief that a full-scale offensive would be made against Germany during September. The failure to support Poland was probably deliberate in the hope that this would force Poland to negotiate with Hitler. If so, it was a complete failure. Poland was so encouraged by the British guarantee that it not only refused to make concessions but also prevented the reopening of negotiations by one excuse after another until the last day of peace. Page 651 In light of these facts, the British efforts to reach a settlement with Hitler and their reluctance to make an alliance with Russia, were very unrealistic. Nevertheless, they continued to exhort the Poles to reopen negotiations with Hitler, and continued to inform the German government that the justice of their claims to Danzig and the Corridor were recognized but that these claims must be fulfilled by peaceful means and that force would inevitably be met with force. The British continued to emphasize that the controversy was over Danzig when everyone else knew that Danzig was merely a detail, and an almost indefensible detail. Danzig was no issue on which to fight a world war, but it was an issue on which negotiation was almost mandatory. This may have been why Britain insisted that it was the chief issue. But because it was not the chief issue, Poland refused to negotiate because it feared it would lead to partition of Poland. Danzig was a free city under supervision of the League of Nations and while it was within the Polish customs and under Polish economic control, it was already controlled politically under a German http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig13.htm (7 of 31)22.5.2005 19:18:42"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Gauleiter and would at any moment vote to join Germany if Hitler consented.

The Russians probably regarded the first British suggestion that the Soviet Union should give unilateral guarantees to Poland similar to those of Britain as a trap to get them into a war with Germany in which Britain would do little or nothing or even give aid to Germany. That this last possibility was not completely beyond reality is clear from the fact that Britain did prepare an expeditionary force to attack Russia in March 1940 when Britain was technically at war with Germany but was doing nothing to fight her. Russia offered the guarantee if it were extended to all states on their western frontier including Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania. This offer meant that Russia was guaranteeing its renunciation of all the territory in these six states which it had lost to them since 1917. Instead of accepting the offer, the British began to quibble. They refused to guarantee the Baltic States on the ground that these states did not want to be guaranteed although they had guaranteed Poland on March 31st when Jozef Beck did not want it and had just asked the Soviet Union to guarantee Poland and Romania, neither of whom wanted a Soviet guarantee. When the Russians insisted, the British countered by insisting that Greece, Turkey, Holland, Belgium, and Switzerland must also be guaranteed. Page 655 France and Russia were both pushing Britain to form a Triple Alliance but Britain was reluctant and delayed the discussions to the great irritation of the Soviet leaders. To show its displeasure, the Soviet Union on May 3rd replaced Litvinov with Molotov as foreign minister. This would have been a warning, Litvinov knew the West and was favorable to democracy and to the Western Powers. As a Jew, he was anti-Hitler. Molotov was a contrast from every point of view.

In London, according to rumor, neither side wanted an agreement. Considering Chamberlain's secret efforts to make a settlement with Germany, there is no reason to believe that he wanted an agreement with Russia. The Russians demanded an exact military commitment as to what forces would be used against Germany; they wanted guarantees whether the states concerned accepted or not; they wanted specific permission to fight across a territory such as Poland. These demands were flatly rejected by Poland on August 19th. On the same day, Russia signed a commercial treaty with Germany. Two days later, France ordered its negotiators to sign the right to cross Poland but Russia refused to accept this until Poland consented as well. Page 657 On Aug. 23, Ribbentrop and Molotov signed an agreement which provided that neither signer would take any aggressive action against the other signer or give any support to a third Power in such action. The secret protocol delimited spheres of interest in eastern Europe. The line followed the northern boundary of Lithuania and the Narew, Vistula, and San rivers in Poland and Germany gave Russia a free hand in Bessarabia. This agreement was greeted as a stunning surprise in the Entente countries. There was no reason why it should have been. The British begged the Poles and the Germans to negotiate; the Italians tried to arrange another four-Power conference; various outsiders issued public and private appeals for peace; secret emissaries flew back and forth between London and Germany. All this was in vain because Hitler was determined on war and his attention was devoted to manufacturing incidents to justify his approaching attack. Political prisoners were taken from concentration camps, dressed in German uniforms, and killed on the Polish frontier as \"evidence\" of Polish aggression. A fraudulent ultimatum with sixteen superficially reasonable demands on Poland was presented to the British ambassador when the time limit had elapsed. It was not presented to the Poles because the Polish ambassador in Berlin had been ordered by Beck not to accept any document from the Germans. Page 658 The German invasion of Poland at 4:45a.m. on September 1, 1939, did not end the negotiations to make peace, nor did the complete collapse of Polish resistance on September 16.

CHAPTER XIV: WORLD WAR II: THE TIDE OF AGGRESSION, 1939-1941 Page 661 The Second World War lasted exactly six years. It was fought on every continent and on every sea. Deaths of civilians exceeded deaths of combatants and many of both were killed without any military justification as victims of sheer brutality, largely through cold- blooded savagery by Germans, and to a lesser extent by Japanese and Russians, although British and American attacks from the air on civilian populations and on non-military targets contributed to the total. The distinctions between civilians and military personnel and between neutrals and combatants which had been blurred in the First World War were almost completely lost in the second. Civilians killed reached 17 millions. The armies had no new weapons which had not been possessed in 1918 but the proportions of these and the ways in which they cooperated with one another had been greatly modified. Page 662 The chief reason the Germans had sufficient military resources was not based, as is so often believed, on the fact that Germany was highly mobilized for war, but on other factors. In the first place, Hitler's economic revolution in Germany had reduced financial considerations to a point where they played no role in economic or political decisions. When decisions were made, on other grounds, money was provided through completely unorthodox methods of finance, to carry them out. In France and England, on the other hand, orthodox financial principles, especially balanced budgets and stable exchange rates, played a major role in all decisions and was one of the chief reasons why these countries did not mobilize or why, having mobilized, they had totally inadequate numbers of airplanes, tanks, etc. Page 665 Strategic bombing used long-range planes against industrial targets and other civilian objectives.

No attack was made by France and strict orders were issued to the British Air Force not to bomb any German land forces until April 1940. Similar orders to the Luftwaffe by Hitler were maintained for part of this same period. When some British Members of Parliament put pressure to drop bombs on German munition stores in the Black Forest, Sir Kingsley Wood rejected the suggestion declaring: \"Are you aware it is private property? Why, you will be asking me to bomb Essen next.\" Essen was the home of Krupp Munitions factories. Blockade of Germany was established in such a perfunctory fashion that large quantities of French iron ore continued to go to Germany through the neutral Low Countries in return for German coal coming by the same route. Hitler issued orders to his air force not to cross the Western frontier except for reconnaissance, to his navy not to fight the French, and to his submarines not to molest passenger vessels and to treat unarmed merchant ships according to established rules of international prize law. In open disobedience of these orders, a German submarine sank the liner Athenia on September 3rd. The Soviet Union was invited by Hitler to invade Poland from the east and occupy the areas which had been granted to it in the Soviet- German agreement of August 23rd. The Russians were afraid the Western Powers might declare war on Russia in support of their guarantee to Poland. When the Polish government moved to Romania, the Soviet Union felt that it could not be accused of aggression against Poland if no Polish state still existed on Polish soil and justified their advance with the excuse that they must restore order.

Early in October, Hitler made a tentative offer to negotiate peace with the Western Powers on the grounds that the cause of fighting for Poland no longer existed.

Contrary to general opinion, Germany was neither armed to the teeth nor fully mobilized in this period. In each of the four years 1939-1942, Britain's production of tanks, self-propelled guns, and planes was higher tan Germany's. As late as September 1941, Hitler issued an order for substantial reduction in armaments production. In 1944, only 33% of Germany's output went for direct war purposes compared to 40% in the U.S. and almost 45% in Britain. Page 671 In order to reduce the enemy's ability to buy abroad, financial connections were cut, his funds abroad were frozen, and his exports were blocked. The U.S. cooperated as well, freezing the financial assets of various nations as they were conquered by the aggressor Powers and finally the assets of the aggressors themselves in June 1941. At the same time, pre-emptive buying of vital commodities at their source to prevent Germany and its allies from obtaining them began. Because of limited British funds, most of this task of pre-emptive buying was taken over by the U.S., almost completely by Feb. 1941. The blockade was enforced by Britain with little regard for international law or for neutral rights there was relatively test from the neutrals. The U.S. openly favored Britain while Italy and Japan equally openly favored Germany. On the whole, the blockade had no decisive effect on Germany's ability to wage war until 1945. Germany's food supply was at the pre-war level until the very last months of the war by starving the enslaved peoples of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Russia and other countries. Page 674 During the \"phony war\" there were persons in Britain, France and Germany who were eager to make war or peace. Such persons engaged in extensive intrigues in order to negotiate peace or to prevent it. There were a number of unsuccessful efforts to make peace between the Western Powers and Germany in the six months following the defeat of Poland. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig13.htm (12 of 31)22.5.2005 19:18:42"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 677 Hitler had no political ambition with respect to the Balkans or the Soviet Union. From both he wanted nothing more than the maximum supply of raw materials and a political peace which would permit these goods to flow.

For some unexplained reason the Finns seem to have felt that the Russians would not attack their country but the Soviets attacked at several points November 29th. Page 680 In early 1939, the Anglo-French leaders now prepared to attack the Soviet Union both from Finland and from Syria. On February 5, 1940, the Supreme War Council decided to send to Finland an expeditionary force of 100,000 heavily armed troops to fight the Soviet hordes. Germany at once warned Norway and Sweden that it would take action against them if the two Scandinavian countries permitted passage of this force. Germany feared the Anglo-French forces would be able to stop shipments of Swedish iron ore across Norway to Germany. The evidence supports these fears because the high quality of Swedish iron ore was essential to the German steel industry. As early as September 1939, the British were discussing a project to interrupt the Swedish shipments either by an invasion of Norway of by mining Norwegian territorial waters. When Germany heard of the Anglo-French expeditionary force, it began to prepare its own plans to seize Norway first. THE FALL OF FRANCE (MAY-JUNE 1940) AND THE VICHY REGIME. Page 690 Hitler was so convinced that Britain would also make peace that he gave lenient terms to France. France did not give up any overseas territories or any ports on the Mediterranean, no naval vessels or any airplanes or armaments. Northern France and all the western coast to the Pyrenees came under occupation but the rest was left unoccupied, ruled by a government free from direct German control.

When the war began, American public opinion was united in its determination to stay out. The isolationist reaction following American intervention in the First World War had become stronger in the 1930s. Historian were writing extensively to show that Germany had not been solely guilty of beginning the war in 1914 and that the Entente Powers had made more than their share of secret treaties seeking selfish territorialism, both before the war and during the fighting. In 1934, a committee of the U.S. Senate investigated the role played by foreign loans and munition sales to belligerents in getting the U.S. involved in World War I. Through the carelessness of the Roosevelt administration, this committee fell under the control of isolationists led by Republican Senator Gerald Nye. As a result, the evidence was mobilized to show that American intervention in WWI had been pushed by bankers and munitions manufacturers (\"merchants of death\") to protect their profits and their interests in an Entente victory. American public opinion had the uncomfortable feeling that American youths had been sent to die for selfish purposes concealed behind propaganda slogans about \"the rights of small nations,\" \"freedom of the seas,\" or \"making the world safe for democracy.\" All this created a widespread determination to keep out of Europe's constant quarrels and avoid what was regarded as the \"error of 1917.\" Page 708 The isolationist point of view had been enacted into the so- called Neutrality Act curtailing loans and munitions sales to belligerent countries. Materials had to be sold on a \"cash and carry\" basis and had to be transported on foreign ships. Also, loans to belligerents were forbidden. These laws gave a great advantage to a state like Italy which had ships to carry supplies from the U.S. or which had cash to buy them here in contrast to a country like Ethiopia which had no ships and little cash. Page 709 Roosevelt called a special session of Congress to revise the neutrality laws so that the Entente powers could obtain supplies in the U.S. The embargo on munitions was repealed.

The extremes ranged from the advocates of immediate intervention into the war on the side of Britain to the defenders of extreme isolation. Most American opinion was somewhere between the two extremes. In order to unify America's political front, Roosevelt took two interventionists into his cabinet as Secretaries of War and the Navy. Roosevelt himself was sympathetic to this point of view. Page 710 Wendell Wilkie assured the American people that Roosevelt's re- election in 1940 meant that \"we will be at war.\" Roosevelt replied with assurances that \"We will not sent our army, navy, or air forces to fight in foreign lands except in case of attack. Your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars.\" This campaign oratory was based on the general recognition that the overwhelming majority were determined to stay out of war. Page 711 Strategic plans were drawn up deciding that Germany was the major danger, with Japan of secondary importance, and that every effort, including actual warfare, should be used. Germany's declaration of war on the U.S. four days after Pearl Harbor saved the U.S. from the need to attempt something which American public opinion would have never condoned, an attack on Germany after we had been attacked by Japan. Page 714 Roosevelt improvised a policy which consisted in almost equal measure of propagandist public statements, tactical subterfuges, and hesitant half-steps. In September 1940, Roosevelt gave fifty old WWI destroyers to Britain in return for 99 year leases of naval and air bases in this hemisphere. Page 715 Loans were forbidden by the Neutrality Act. To Roosevelt, it seemed foolish to allow monetary considerations to stand as an obstacle in the way of self-defence (as he regarded the survival of Great Britain). Page 716 Opponents argued that Britain had tens of billions in concealed assets and that Lend-Lease was merely a clever trick for foisting the costs of Britain's war onto the backs of American tax-payers. Still others insisted that Lend-Lease was an unneutral act which would arouse German rage and eventually involved the American people in a http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig13.htm (15 of 31)22.5.2005 19:18:42"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"g$biloxi war they had no need to get in.

At once, isolationists were in full cry and an ACt extending selective-service training passed 203-202.

No one pointed out that a Germany defeat by British methods would leave the Soviet armies supreme in all Europe with no forces to oppose them. Page 719 At the same time he gave Britain ten coast-guard cutters, Roosevelt seized possession of 65 Axis and Danish ships in American harbors. The financial assets of the Axis Powers were frozen. American flying schools were made available to train British aviators. By presidential proclamation, the American Neutrality Zone was extended to Iceland. The U.S. navy was ordered to follow all Axis raiders or submarines west of this meridian broadcasting their positions to the British. Page 720 American naval escort of British convoys could not fail to lead to a \"shooting war\" with Germany. The Roosevelt administration did not shrink from this possibility. Fortunately for the Administration's plans, Hitler played right into its hands by declaring war on the U.S. By that date, incidents were becoming more frequent. On Oct. 17, the U.S. destroyer Kearney was torpedoed; two weeks later, the destroyer Rueben James was blown to pieces. On Nov. 10, an American escort of 11 vessels picked up a convoy of six vessels including America's three largest ocean liners with 20,000 British troops and guarded them from Halifax to India and Singapore. Many of the activities of the American Navy in the summer of 1941 were known not at all or were known only very imperfectly to they American public but it would seem that public opinion generally supported the Administration's actions. In September, Roosevelt sought to repeal the Neutrality Act forbidding the arming of merchant vessels which was done on Oct. 17.

Most of these were Ukranians and eager to fight with the Nazis against the Stalinist regime. Anti-Stalinist deserters serving in the Nazi forces reached 900,000 in June 1944 under Soviet general A. A. Vlasov. At the end of the war, hundreds of thousands of Vlasov's supporters fled westward to the American and British armies for refuge from Stalin's vengeance but were handed over to the Soviet Union to be murdered out of and or sent to slave-labor camps in Siberia. The dimensions of the human suffering involved in this whole situation is beyond the human imagination. CHAPTER XV: WORLD WAR II: THE EBB OF AGGRESSION,1941-1945 THE RISING SUN IN THE PACIFIC, TO 1942 PAGE 732 Japanese aggressions of 1941 which culminated in the attack on Pearl Harbor were based on fear and weakness and not on arrogance and strength. By 1939, the Japanese economy was beginning to totter under the growing restrictions on Japanese trade imposed by Western countries and acute material shortages. Problems such as these might have driven many nations, even the West, to desperate action. The world depression made it very difficult to increase Japanese exports. The excessively high American tariff, although no so intended, seemed to the Japanese to be an aggressive restriction on their ability to live. The \"imperial preference\" regulations of the British Commonwealth had a similar consequence. Since Japan could not defend itself against such economic measures, it resorted to political measures and the Western Powers would inevitably defend themselves with even greater economic restrictions driving Japan to open war. Page 735 The American government began to tighten the economic pincers on Japan just as Japan was seeking to tighten its military pincers on China. Japan was able to close all routes to China. The American government retaliated with economic warfare. In 1938, it established a \"moral embargo\" on the shipment of aircraft or their parts and bombs to Japan. In 1939, large U.S. and British loans to China sought to http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig13.htm (17 of 31)22.5.2005 19:18:42"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"g$biloxi strengthen its collapsing financial system and Washington gave notice to cancel the 1911 commercial treaty with Japan opening the door to all kinds of economic pressure. The \"moral embargo\" was extended to cover light metals and all machinery or plans for making aviation gasoline. Such a policy was opposed by isolationists insisting such economic sanctions could only be enforced, in the long run, by war. If Japan could not get petroleum, bauxite, rubber and tin by trade, it could be prevented from seizing these areas producing these products only by force. To avoid this obvious inference,l Cordell Hull sought to make America's economic policy ambiguous so that Japan might be deterred by fear of sanctions not yet imposed and won by hopes of concessions not yet granted. Such a policy was a mistake but it obtained Roosevelt's explicit approval since it allowed more aggressive elements of Japanese to take control and any drastic action seeking to end the strain became welcome. Page 736 The ambiguity of American commercial policy slowly resolved in the direction of increasing economic sanctions. There was a steady increase in America's economic pressure by the growth of financial obstacles and by increasing purchasing difficulties. From Hull's doctrinaire refusal to encourage any Japanese hope that they could win worthwhile American concessions, the advocates of extremism gained influence. The President ordered the embargo of many goods which Japan needed, including aluminum, airplane parts, all arms and munitions, optical supplies, and various \"strategic\" materials but left petroleum and scrap iron unhindered. Page 737 American diplomatic pressure on Japan must be timed to avoid pushing Japan into desperate action before American-German relations had passed the breaking point. Page 739 On July 26, 1941, the U.S. froze all Japanese financial assets in the U.S. virtually ending trade between the two countries. Members of the British Commonwealth issued similar orders. As a result of these pressures, Japan found itself in a position where its oil reserves would be exhausted in two years, its aluminum reserves in seven months. The chief of the Navy told the emperor that if Japan resorted to war, it would be very doubtful that it could win. It was also clear that if war came, economic pressure was too damaging to allow Japan to postpone such operations until 1942. The decision was made to negotiate until late October. If an agreement could be reached, the http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig13.htm (18 of 31)22.5.2005 19:18:42"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"g$biloxi preparations for war could be suspended, otherwise the negotiations would be ended and the advance to open war continued. The Cabinet sought desperately to reach an agreement in Washington. Page 741 The Japanese misjudged American psychology. Nomura found it impossible to reach an agreement because Hull's demands were extreme. The Americans had broken the secret Japanese codes and knew that war would begin if Nomura failed to obtain relaxation of the economic embargo. They did not however have the plans for the attack on Pearl Harbor. Page 742 On November 27th, a war warning was sent from Washington to Pearl Harbor but no increased precautions were made. On December 7, an army enlisted man, using radar, detected a group of strange planes coming down from the north 132 miles away but his report was disregarded. The American losses included 2,400 killed, 1,200 injured. Japanese losses amounted to a couple of dozen planes. TURNING THE TIDE, 1942-1943 Page 751 At Casablanca, the political decision of Roosevelt and Churchill on unconditional surrender was published with great fanfare, and at once initiated a controversy which still continues based on the belief that it had an adverse influence by discouraging any hopes within Axis countries that they could find a way out by slackening their efforts, by revolting against their governments, or by negotiations seeking some kind of of \"conditional\" surrender. There seems little doubt that it solidified our enemies and prolonged their resistance where opposition to the war was widespread and active.

Major decisions were made in 1943 which played a major role in determining the nature of the postwar world. Page 757 Although Soviet demands were clearly in conflict with the high purposes of the Atlantic charter, Churchill was not averse to accepting them on the grounds of physical necessity but American objections to discussions of territorial questions while the war was still going on forced him to refuse Stalin's requests.

At the American centers of power, there was complete conviction in the value of unrestricted aid to Russia.

Page 760 The Americans decided to choke off the Italian offensive in order to concentrate on the cross-channel attack. The attack on North Africa was a substitute for an attack on Germany from Italy. Page 762 Once ashore, the Sicilian campaign was ineptly carried on because occupation of territory was given precedence over destruction of the enemy. No efforts were made to close the Straits of Messina so the Germans were able to send almost two divisions as reinforcements from Italy and later, when the island had to be abandoned, they were equally free to evacuate it in seven days without the loss a man. Page 763 The history of Italy in 1943 is a history of lost opportunities. Italy might have got out in the summer and the Germans might have been ejected shortly afterward. Instead, Italy was torn to pieces and got out of the war so slowly that Germans were still fighting on Italian soil at the final surrender in 1945. These great misfortunes were the result of a number of forces: 1) weakness of Italy relative to Germany; 2) weakness of Allies after diversion of power to Britain; 3) mistrust of Italians by Allies; 4) the inflexible Allied insistence on unconditional surrender which left the Italians helpless to resist the Germans. Page 764 When the Italian government offered the join the Allies in fighting the Germans, they insisted that the publication of the armistice and a tentative paratrooper drop in Rome be put off until sufficient Allied forces were within striking distance to protect the city from the German troops nearby. Eisenhower refused and published the Italian surrender one day before the American Army landed at Salerno. The Germans reacted to the news of the Italian \"betrayal\" with characteristic speed. Available forces converged on the Salerno beachhead, an armored division fought its way into Rome, Italian troops were disarmed everywhere, and the Italian government had to flee. Numerous vessels were sunk by the Germans. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig13.htm (20 of 31)22.5.2005 19:18:42"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 765 As Allied forces slowly recovered Italian territory from the tenacious grasp of the Germans, the royal government remained subservient to its conquerors.

While these political events were taking place, the military advance was moving like a snail. The Allied invasion of Italy was given very limited resources for a very large task.. It was only under such limitations of resources, explicitly stated, that the Americans accepted the British suggestion for an invasion of Italy at all.

It was further suggested that General Clark should have obliterated the monastery with aerial bombardment but had failed to do so because he was a Roman Catholic. After Feb. 15, 1944, General Clark did destroy the site completely without helping the situation a bit. We now know that the Germans had not been using the monastery; but once it was destroyed by us, they dug into the rubble to make a stronger defence. On May 16th, a Polish Division captured Monte Cassino.

At least 100,000 Polish prisoners of war, out of 320,000 captured in 1939, had been exterminated. The German radio suddenly announced on April 13, 1943, that German forces in occupied Russia had discovered, at Katyn, near Smolensk, Russia, mass graves containing the bodies of 5,000 Polish officers who had been murdered by the Soviet authorities in 1940. Moscow called this a Nazi propaganda trick and declared that the Polish officers had been murdered and buried by the Nazis themselves when they captured the officers and this Soviet territory.

This assumption implies that America should have threatened to reduce of to cut off Lend-Lease supplies going unless we could obtain Soviet agreement to the kind of eastern European settlement we wanted.

While they were still talking and when the Soviet army was only six miles from Warsaw, the Polish underground forces in the city, at a Soviet invitation, rose up against the Germans. A force of 40,000 responded to the suggestion but the Russian armies stopped their advance and obstructed supplies to the rebels in spite of appeals from all parts of the world. After sixty-three days of hopeless fighting, the Polish Home Army had to surrender to the Germans. This Soviet treachery removed their chief obstacle to Communist rule in Poland and the London government in London was accordingly ignored.

The shift to city bombing was more or less accidental. In spite of the erroneous ideas of Chamberlain, Baldwin, Churchill, the war opened and continued for months with no city bombing at all, for the simple reason that the Germans had no intentions, no planes, and no equipment for strategic bombing. The attack on cities began by accident when a group of German planes which were lost dumped their bomb loads, contrary to orders, on London on August 1940. The RAF retaliated by bombing Berlin the next night. Goring in counter-retaliation. British efforts to counterattack by daylight raids on military objectives resulted in such losses that the air offensive was shifted to night attacks. This entailed a shift from industrial targets to indiscriminate bombing of urban areas. This was justified with the wholly mistaken argument that civilian morale was a German weak point and that the destruction of workers' housing would break this morale. The evidence shows that the German war effort was not weakened in any way by lowering civilian morale in spite of the horrors heaped on it. Page 802 The most extraordinary example of this suffering occurred in the British fire raids on Hamburg in 1943 which was attacked for more than a week with a mixture of high-explosive and incendiary bombs so persistently that fire-storms appeared. The air in the city heated to over a thousand degrees began to rise rapidly with the result that winds of hurricane force rushed into the city. The water supply was destroyed and the flames were too hot for water to be effective. Final figures for the destruction were set at 40,000 dead, 250,000 houses destroyed with over a million made homeless. This as the greatest destruction by air attacks on a city until the fire raid on Tokyo on March 9 1945 which still stands today as the most devastating air attack in human history.

These considerations form the background to the Yalta and Potsdam conferences and the decision to use to atom bomb on Japan.

Page 831 World War II transformed a system where man's greatest problems were the material ones of man's helplessness in the face of natural threats of disease, starvation, and natural catastrophes to the totally different system of the 1960s and 1970s where the greatest threat to man is man himself and where his greatest problems are the social (and non-material) ones of what his true goals of existence are and what use he should make of his immense power of the universe, his fellow men. For thousands of years, some men had viewed themselves as creatures a little lower than angels, or even God, and a little higher than the beasts. Now, in the 20th century, man has acquired almost divine powers and it has become increasingly clear that he can no longer regard himself as an animal but must regard himself as at least a man if not obligated to act like an angel or even a god. Page 832 The whole trend of the 19th century had been to emphasize man's animal nature and seek to increase his supply of material necessities. Page 833 The great achievements of the 19th century and the great crisis of the 20th century are both related to the Puritan tradition of the 17th century which regarded the body and the material as sinful and dangerous and something which must be sternly controlled. Page 837 These methods appeared in a number of ways, notably in an emphasis on self-discipline for future benefits, on restricted consumption and on saving in a devotion to work, and in a postponement of enjoyment to a future which never arrived. A typical example might be John D. Rockefeller: great saver, great worker, and great postponer of any self-centered action, even death. To such people, the most adverse comments which could be made about a failure to distinguish from a \"successful\" man were that he was a \"saltrel,\" a \"loafer,\" a \"sensualist,\" and \"self-indulgent.\" These terms reflected the value that the middle classes placed on work, saving, self-denial and social conformity. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig13.htm (26 of 31)22.5.2005 19:18:42"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 838 The nineteenth century's emphasis on acquisitive behavior, on achievement, and on infinitely expansible demand is equally associated with the middle-class outlook. These basic features are inevitably lacking in backward, tribal, underdeveloped peasant societies and groups, not only in Africa and Asia but also in much of the Mediterranean, Latin America, central France, in the Mennonite communities of Pennsylvania and elsewhere. The lack of future preference and expansible material demands in other areas are essential features of the 20th century crisis. George Sorel (Reflections on Violence, 1908) sought a solution to this crisis in irrationalism, in action for its own sake. The other tendency sought a solution in rationalization, science, universality, cosmopolitanism and the continued pursuit of truth. The war became a struggle between the forces of irrationality represented by Fascism and the forces of Western science and rationalization represented by the Allied nations. RATIONALIZATION AND SCIENCE Page 838 Rationalization gradually spread into the more dominant problem of business. From maximizing production, it shifted to maximizing profits. The introduction of rationalization into war was attributed to the efforts of Professor P.M.S. Blackett (Nobel Prize 1948) to apply radar to antiaircraft guns. From there, Blackett took the technique into antisubmarine defence whence it spread under the name \"Operational Research\" (OP). Operational research, unlike science, made its greatest contribution in regard to the use of existing equipment rather than the effort to invent new equipment. It often game specific recommendations, reached through techniques of mathematical probability, which directly contradicted the established military procedures. A simple case concerned the problem of air attack on enemy submarines: For what depth should the bomb fuse be set? In 1940, RAF set its fuses at 100 feet. based on three factors: 1) the time interval between the moments when the submarine sighted the plane and the plane sighted the submarine; 2) the speed of approach of the plane; and 3) the speed of submergence of the submarine. The submarine was unlikely to be sunk if the bomb exploded more than 20 feet away. Operational Research added an additional factor:How near was the bomber to judging the exact spot where the submarine went down? since this error increased rapidly with the distance of the original sighting, a submarine which had time to submerge deeply would http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig13.htm (27 of 31)22.5.2005 19:18:42"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"g$biloxi almost inevitably be missed by the bomb in position if not in depth; but with 100 foot fuses, submarines which had little time to submerge were missed because the fuse was too deep even when the position was correct. OP recommended setting fuses at 25 feet to sink the near sightings and practically conceded the escape of all distant sightings. When fuses were set at 35 feet, successful attacks on submarines increased 400 percent with the same equipment. Page 839 The British applied OP to many similar problems. 1) With an inadequate3 number of A.A. guns, is it better to concentrate them to protect part of a city thoroughly or to disperse them to protect all of the city inadequately? (The former is better) 2) Repainting night bombers from black to white when used on submarine patrol increased sightings of submarines 30%. 3) Are small convoys safer for merchant ships than large ones (No by a large margin.) 4) With an inadequate number of patrol planes, was it better to search the whole patrol area some days (as was the practice) or to search part of it ever day with whatever planes were available? (the latter was better). OP calculated the number of people killed per ton of bombs dropped showing that the casualties inflicted on Germany were about 400 civilians killed per month - about half the German automobile accident death rate - while 200 RAF crewmen were killed per month in doing the bombing. Later it was discovered the raids were actually killing 200 German civilians contributing little to the war effort at the cost of the 200 RAF men each month and thus were a contribution to the German victory. These estimates made it advisable to shift planes to U-boat patrol. A bomber in its average life of 30 missions, dropped 100 tons of bombs killing 20 Germans and destroying a few houses. The same plane in 30 missions of submarine patrol saved 6 loaded merchant ships and their crews from submarines. This discovery was violently resisted by the head of the RAF, Sir Arthur (Bomber) Harris. Page 840 In 1938, Vannevar Bush, professor of electrical engineering and vice-president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology persuaded Roosevelt to create the National Defence Research Committee with Bush as Chairman. When money ran short, they obtained half from MIT and an equal sum from John D. Rockefeller.

The rationalizing of society used the tremendous advances in mathematics of the 19th century but a good deal came from new developments. Amlong these have been applications of game theory, information theory, symbolic logic, cybernetics, and electronic computing. The newest of these was probably game theory, worked out by a Hungarian refugee mathematician, John von Neumann, at the Institute for Advanced Study. This applied mathematical techniques to situations in which persons sought conflicting goals in a nexus of relationships governed by rules. The basic work was \"Theory of Games and Economic Behavior\" by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern (Princeton 1944). Page 843 A flood of books all sought to apply mathematical methods to information, communications, and control systems. THE TWENTIETH-CENTURY PATTERN Page 862 The decision to use the bomb against Japan marks one of the turning points in history of our times. The scientists who were consulted had no information on the status of the war itself, had no idea how close to the end Japan already was. Some people like General Groves wanted it to be used to justify the two billion they had spent. After it was all over, Director of Military Intelligence for the Pacific theatre of War Alfred McCormack, who was probably in as good position as anyone to for judging the situation, felt that the Japanese surrender could have been obtained in a few weeks by blockade alone. \"The Japanese had no longer enough food in stock, and their fuel reserves were practically exhausted. We were mining all their harbors and if we had brought this operation to its logical conclusion, the destruction of Japanese cities with incendiary and other bombs would have been quite unnecessary. But General Norstad declared at Washington that this blockading action was a cowardly proceeding unworthy of the Air Force. It was therefore discontinued.\" Page 863 IT was equally clear that the defeat of Japan did not require the A-bomb just as it did not require the Russian entry into the war or an American invasion of the Japanese home islands. But again, other factors involving interests and nonrational considerations were too powerful. However, if the U.S. had not finished the bomb project or had not used it, it seems most unlikely that the Soviet Union would have made its postwar efforts to get the bomb. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig13.htm (29 of 31)22.5.2005 19:18:42"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 864 The Russian leaders would almost certainly not have made the effort to get the bomb if we had not used it on Japan. On the other hand, if we had not used the bomb on Japan, we would have been quite incapable of preventing the Soviet forces from expanding wherever they were ordered in Eurasia in 1946. Page 865 The growth of the army of specialists destroys one of the three basic foundations of political democracy. These three bases are: 1) that men are relatively equal in factual power; 2) that men have relatively equal access to the information needed to make a government's decisions; 3) that men have a psychological readiness to accept majority rule in return for those civil rights which will allow any minority to work to build itself up to become a majority. Page 866 It is increasingly clear that in the 20th century, the expert will replace the industrial tycoon in control of the economic system even as he will replace the democratic voter in control of the political system. This is because planning will inevitably replace laissez-faire in the relationships between the two systems. Hopefully, the elements of choice and freedom may survive for the ordinary individual in that he may be free to make a choice between two opposing political groups (even if these groups have little policy choice within the parameters of policy established by the experts) and he may have the choice to switch his economic support from one large unit to another. But in general, his freedom and choice will be controlled within very narrow alternatives by the fact that he will be numbered from birth and followed, as a number, through his educational training, his required military and other public service, his tax contributions, his health and medical requirements, and his final retirement and death benefits. Page 867 One consequence of the nuclear rivalry has been the almost total destruction of international law as existed from the middle of the 17th century to the end of the 19th. That old international law was based on distinctions which no longer exist including the distinction between war and peace, the rights of neutrals, the distinction between public and private authority. These are now destroyed or in great confusion. The post-war balance of terror reached its peak of total disregard both of noncombatants and of neutrals in the policies of John Foster Dulles who combined sanctimonious religion with \"massive http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig13.htm (30 of 31)22.5.2005 19:18:42"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"g$biloxi retaliation wherever and whenever we judge fit\" to the complete destruction of any non-combatant or neutral status. Page 868 As a result, all kinds of groups could destroy law and order without suffering retaliation by ordinary powers and could become recognized as states when they were totally lacking in the traditional attributes of statehood. For example, the Leopoldville group were recognized as the real government of the whole Congo in spite of the fact that they were incapable of maintaining law and order over the area. Similarly, a gang of rebels in Yemen in 1962 were instantly recognized before they gave any evidence whatever of ability to maintain control or of readiness to assume the existing international obligations of the Yemen state and before it was established that their claims to have killed the king were true. Page 869 Under the umbrella of nuclear stalemate, outside governments subsidize murders or revolts as the Russians did in Iraq and as the American CIA did in several places, successfully in Iran in 1953, and in Guatemala in 1954 or very unsuccessfully as in the Cuban invasion of 1961. Under the Cold War umbrella, small groups can obtain recognition as states by securing the intervention (usually secret) of some outside Power.

NUCLEAR RIVALRY AND COLD WAR, RACE FOR THE H-BOMB 1950-1957 CHAPTER XVII: NUCLEAR RIVALRY AND THE COLD WAR: AMERICAN ATOMIC SUPREMACY 1945-1950 THE FACTORS Page 873 The period 1945 to early 1963 forms a unity during which a number of factors interacted upon one another to present a very complicated and extraordinarily dangerous series of events. That mankind and civilized life got through the period may be attributed to a number of lucky chances rather than to any particular skill among the two opposing political blocs. The Cold War is almost always described in terms which put minor emphasis or even neglect the role of technological rivalry because most historians do not feel competent to discuss it but chiefly because much of the evidence is secret. Because of such secrecy, the story of this rivalry falls into two quite distinct and even contradictory parts: 1) what the real situation was; and 2) what prevalent public opinion believed the situation to be. For example, the Soviet Union had an H-bomb many months before we did when public opinion believed the opposite; the 1960 believe throughout the world of a so-called \"missile gap\" or American inferiority in nuclear missiles when no such inferiority existed. Page 875 The balance of nuclear weapons was the central factor in the Cold War. Cessation on nuclear testing came close to achievement in 1950 when both sides had atomic weapons but was destroyed at that time by President Truman's order to proceed with the development of the hydrogen bomb. By 1963, both sides had these weapons and the balance of terror had been achieved. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig17.htm (1 of 34)22.5.2005 19:19:35"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 879 The party struggle in the U.S. found the intellectuals (including scientists), the internationalists, the minorities and the cosmopolitans in the Democratic Party with the businessmen, bankers and clerks in the Republican Party. The Republicans had fallen into the control (represented by Senators Taft, Wherry, Bridges and Jenner) of those who were most ignorant of the real issues and were most remote from any conceptions of national political responsibility. Page 880 This group, to whom we often give the name \"neo-isolationist,\" knew nothing of the world outside the U.S., and generally despised it. Thus, they gave no consideration to our allies or neutrals, and saw no reason to know or to study Russia, since it could be hated completely without need for accurate knowledge. All foreigners were regarded as unprincipled, weak, poor, ignorant and evil, with only one aim in life, namely, to prey on the United States. These neo-isolationists and unilateralists were equally filled with suspicion or hatred of any American intellectuals, including scientists, because they had no conception of any man who placed objective truth higher than subjective interests since such an attitude was a complete challenge to the American businessman's assumption that all men are and should be concerned with the pursuit of self-interest and profit. Neo-isolationism had a series of assumptions which could not be held by anyone who had any knowledge of the world outside U.S. middle- class business circles. These beliefs were seven in number: 1) Unilateralism: that the U.S. should and could act by itself without need to consider allies, neutrals or the Soviet Union; 2) National omnipotence: that the U.S. is so rich and powerful that no one else counts and that there is no need to study foreign areas, customs, policies; Page 881 3) Unlimited goals (or utopianism): the belief that there are final solutions to the world's problems. Upholders of this view refused to accept that constant danger and constant problems were a perpetual condition of human life except in brief and unusual circumstances. Dulles insisted that the Truman policy of containment must be replaced by a policy of \"liberation.\" These policies were not designed to win conclusively and did not seek to solve the problem of the Soviet Union but to live with it, \"presumably forever.\" He did accept preventive war in the form of massive retaliation if the Communists made any further advances. 4) The neo-isolationist belief that continuance of the Soviet threat arose from internal treason within America. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig17.htm (2 of 34)22.5.2005 19:19:35"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 882 5) Since the chief \"high moral principle\" which motivated the neo- isolationists insisted that Soviet Russia and Democrats were engaged in a joint tacit conspiracy to destroy America by high taxes by using the Cold War to tax America into bankruptcy 6) Since neo-isolationists rejected all partial solutions, there was little they could do but talk loudly and sign anti-communist pacts. 7) The unrealistic and unhistoric nature of neo-isolationism meant that it could not actually be pursued as a policy. It was pursued by John Foster Dulles with permanent injury to our allies. When Senator McCarthy turned his extravagant charges of subversion and treason from the State Department to the army, his downfall began. The neo- isolationist forces still continue in an increasingly irresponsible form under a variety of names including John Birch Society members or more generally as the \"Radical Right.\" Page 885 Robert Oppenheimer was on a total of thirty five government committees. There was a shadow on Oppenheimer's past. In his younger and more naive days, he had been closely associated with Communists. Certainly never a Communist himself, and never, at any time, disloyal to the U.S., he had nonetheless associated with Communists. His brother Frank and his wife were Communist Party workers while Oppenheimer's own wife was an ex-Communist, widow of a Communist who had been killed fighting Fascism in Spain in 1937. The Oppenheimers continued to have friends who were Communists and contributed money until the end of 1941. Page 886 All this derogatory information was known to General Groves and to Army Intelligence and used in 1953-1954 to destroy his reputation. It was an essential element in the neo-isolationist McCarthyite, Dulles interregnum of 1953-1957. THE ORIGINS OF THE COLD WAR, 1945-1949 Page 891 IN the Soviet system, while most Russians lived in poverty, a privileged minority, buying in special stores with special funds and special ration cards, had access to luxuries undreamed of by the ordinary person. Page 900 In 1944, Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau took advantage of his close personal friendship with Roosevelt to push forward his own http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig17.htm (3 of 34)22.5.2005 19:19:35"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"g$biloxi pet scheme to reduce Germany to a purely agricultural state by almost total destruction of her industry, the millions of surplus population to be, if necessary, deported to Africa. The secretary, supported by his assistant secretary, Harry Dexter White, was deeply disturbed by Germany's history of aggression. The only way to prevent it was to reduce Germany's industry and thus her warmaking capacity as close to nothing as possible. The resulting chaos, inflation, and misery would be but slight repayment for the horrors Germany had inflicted on others over many years. By personal influence, Morgenthau obtained acceptance of a somewhat modified version of this plan by both Roosevelt and Churchill at the Quebec conference of September 1944. The error at Quebec was quickly repudiated but no real planning was done and the Morgenthau Plan played a considerable role in the JCS 1067, the directive set up to guide the American military occupation of Germany. It proposed reparations be obtained by dismantling Germany industry. The JCS 1067 directive ordered that Germany be treated as a defeated enemy and not as a liberated country. No steps were taken to secure its economic recovery. Page 901 At the Potsdam conference, it was agreed that the German economy should not be permitted should not be permitted to recover higher than the standard of living of 1932, at the bottom of the depression, the level, in fact, which had brought Hitler to power in 1933. It took more than two years of misery for Germany to secure any changes in these American objectives. Hunger and cold took a considerable toll, and the Germans, for two years, experienced some of the misery they had inflicted on others in the preceding dozen years. The Germany currency reform of 1948 is the fiscal miracle of the post-war world. From it came (1) an explosion of industrial expansion and economic prosperity for West Germany; (2) they tying of the West Germany economy to the West; (3) an example for other western European in economic expansion; and (4) a wave of prosperity for western Europe as a whole. AMERICAN CONFUSIONS, 1945-1950 Page 909 The American response to the Soviet refusal of postwar cooperation was confused and tentative. Winston Churchill in June 1946 spoke of the \"Iron Curtain\" which Staling was lowering between the Soviet bloc and the West. Lasting from 1947-1953, the chief characteristics of \"containment\" were economic and financial aid to other nations to http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig17.htm (4 of 34)22.5.2005 19:19:35"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"g$biloxi eliminate the misery and ignorance which fosters communism.

As a result, the means themselves tend to become goals. Page 911 Each service has alliances with the industrial complexes which supply their equipment. These complexes not only supply funds for each service to carry its message to the Congress but also exert every influence to retain equipment by dangling before the high officers who can influence contracts, offers of future well-paying consultant positions with the industrial firms concerned. Most high officers retired and then took consultant jobs with those firms.

These are but a few of more than a hundred general officers whose post retirement alliances with industrial firms encouraged their successors, still on active service, to remain on friendly terms with such appreciative business corporations. Page 919 Pearl Harbor was a total surprise. This last point was so hard to believe, once the evidence was available, that the same groups who were howling about Soviet espionage in 1948-1955 were also claiming that Roosevelt expected and wanted Pearl Harbor. Both these beliefs, if they were believed, were based on gigantic ignorance and misconceptions about the nature of intelligence. Page 921 A great deal of nuclear information (whether secret or not is unknown) as well as uranium metal, went to the Soviet Union as part of Lend-Lease in 1943. Major George Racey Jordan, USAAF, tried in vain to disrupt these shipments at the time. While most of Jordan's evidence is unreliable, the shipment of uranium to Russia is corroborated from other sources.

This is particularly true of Elizabeth Bentley who exaggerated her role.

Numerous other accused Communists, both in government and out, whose names were given to the committee in the same breath as Hiss or Lattimore were almost totally ignored. Page 927 Others called before the committee who refused to give evidence under the Fifth Amendment which protects against self-incrimination were in fact Communists and Bentley and Chambers knew them as such. Page 938 The revelation of Communist influence in the U.S. was undoubtedly valuable but the cost in damage to reputations of innocent persons was very high. Much of this damage came from the efforts of Senator Joseph McCarthy, Republican, of Wisconsin to prove that the State Department and the army were widely infiltrated with Communists. Page 939 McCarthy was not a conservative, still less a reactionary. He was a fragment of elemental force, a throwback to primeval chaos. He was the enemy of all order and all authority, with no respect, or even understanding, for principles, laws, regulations, or rules. As such, he had nothing to do with rationality or generality. Concepts, logic, distinctions of categories were completely outside his world. It is clear he did not have any idea what a Communist was, still less Communism itself, and he did not care. This was simply a term he used in his game of personal power. Most of the terms which have been applied to him, such as \"truculent,\" \"brutal,\" \"ignorant,\" \"sadistic,\" \"foul-mouthed,\" \"brash,\" are quite correct but not quite in the sense http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig17.htm (6 of 34)22.5.2005 19:19:35"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"g$biloxi that his enemies applied them, because they assumed that these qualities and distinctions had meaning in his world as they did in their own.

His act was that of Peck's Bad Boy but on a colossal scale. He sought fame and acclaim by showing an admiring world of schoolmates what a tough guy he was, defying all the rules, even the rules of decency and ordinary civilized behavior. But like the bad boy of the schoolyard, he had no conception of time or anything established, and once he had found his act, it was necessary to demonstrate it every day. His thirst for power, the power of mass acclaim and publicity, reached the public scene at the same moment as television, and he was the first to realize what could be done by using the new instrument for reaching millions. His thirst for power was insatiable because like hunger, it was a daily need. It had nothing to do with the power of authority or regulated discipline, but the personal power of a sadist. All his destructive instincts were against anything established, the wealthy, the educated, the well-mannered, the rules of the Senate, the American party system, the rules of fair play. As such, he had no conception of truth or the distinction between it and falsehood, just as he had no conception of yesterday, today, tomorrow as distinct entities. He simply said whatever would satisfy, momentarily, his yearning to be the center of the stage surrounded by admiring, fearful, shocked, amazed people. He did not even care if their reaction was admiration, fear, shock, or amazement and he did not care if they, as persons, had the same reaction or a different one the next day or even a moment later. He was exactly like an actor in a drama, one in which he had made the script as he went along, full of falsehoods and inconsistencies, and he was genuinely surprised and hurt if a person whom he had abused and insulted for hours at a hearing did not walk out with him to a bar or even to dinner the moment the hearing session was over. He knew it was an act; he expected you to know it was an act. There was really no hypocrisy in it, no cynicism, no falsehood, as far as he was concerned, because he was convinced that this was the way the world was. Everyone he was convinced, had a racket; this just happened to be his, and he expected people to realize this and to understand it. Page 930 Of course, to the observant outsider who did not share his total amorality, it was all false, invented as he went along, and constantly changed, everything substantiated by documents pulled from his briefcase and waved about too rapidly to be read.

Every time he spoke, with each version he became a larger more nonchalant hero. In 1952, he intimidated the Air Force into awarding him the Distinguished Flying (given for twenty five combat missions) although he had been a grounded intelligence officer who took occasional rides in planes. Since laws and regulations were, for McCarthy, nonexistent, his business and financial affairs are, like his life, a chaos of illegalities. Page 931 He seized upon Communism. \"That's it,\" he said. \"The government is full of communists. We can hammer away at them.\" Without any real conception of what he was doing, and without any research or knowledge of the subject, on February 9, McCarthy waved a piece of paper and said \"I have here in my hand a list of 205 members of the Communist Party still working and shaping the policy of the State Department.

According to Senate Republican Leader Taft, \"It was a perfectly reckless performance.\" Nevertheless, Taft and his colleagues determined to accept and support these charges since they would injure the Administration. Few people realize that in five years of accusations, McCarthy never turned up a Communist in the State Department although undoubtedly there must have been some. Page 933 He claimed that \"the top Russian espionage agent\" in the U.S., Alger Hiss's boss in the State Department, \"the chief architect of our Far Eastern policy\" was Professor Owen Lattimore. The trouble was Lattimore was not a Communist, not a spy, and not employed by the State department. In July, the Tydings subcommittee condemned McCarthy for a \"fraud and a hoax.\" McCarthy had the power of an inflamed and misled public opinion. Tydings was beaten in Maryland in 1950. Benton from Connecticut who introduced the resolution to expel McCarthy from the Senate in 1951 and whose charges were fully supported by the Senate's investigation of McCarthy's private finances, was defeated in 1952.

Nixon said \"We're kicking the Communists and fellow travellers and security risks out of the Government by the thousands.\" It was soon clear that no Communists were kicked out and that security risks included all kinds of persons. For a while, the Administration tried to outdo McCarthy by demonstrating in hearings that China had been \"lost\" to the Communists because of the careful planning and intrigue of Communists in the State Department. But they failed to prove their contention. Page 935 There is considerable truth in the China Lobby's contention that the American experts on China were organized into a single interlocking group which had a general consensus of a Leftish character. It is also true that this group, from its control of funds, academic recommendations, and research of publication opportunities, could favor persons who accepted the established consensus and could injure, financial or in professional advancement, persons who did not accept it. It is also true that the established group, by its influence on book reviewing in the New York Times, the Herald Tribune and the Saturday Review, a few magazines including the \"liberal weeklies\" and in the professional journals, could advance or hamper any specialist's career. It is also true that these things were done in the United States by the Institute of Pacific Relations, that this organization had been infiltrated by Communists, and by Communist sympathizers, and that much of this group's influence arose from its access to and control over the flow of funds from financial foundations to scholarly activities. All these things were true, but they would have been true of many other areas of American scholarly research and academic administration. On the other hand, the charges of the China Lobby that China was \"lost\" because of this group is not true. Yet the whole subject is of major importance in understanding the twentieth century.

Behind this unfortunate situation lies another, more profound, relationship, which influences matters much broader than Far Eastern policy. It involves the organization of tax-exempt fortunes of international financiers into foundations to be used for educational, scientific, and \"other public purposes.\" Sixty or more years ago, public life in the East was dominated by the influence of \"Wall Street\" referring to international financial capitalism deeply involved in the gold standard, foreign exchange fluctuations,floating of fixed-interest securities and shares for stock-exchange markets. Page 937 This group, which in the United States, was completely dominated by J.P. Morgan and Company from the 1880s to the 1930s was cosmopolitan, Anglophile, internationalist, Ivy League, eastern seaboard, high Episcopalian and European-culture conscious. Their connection with the Ivy League colleges rested on the fact that large endowments of these institutions required constant consultation with the financiers of Wall Street and was reflected in the fact that these endowments were largely in bonds rather than in real estate or common stocks. As a consequence of these influences, J.P. Morgan and his associates were the most significant figures in policy making at Harvard, Columbia and Yale while the Whitneys and Prudential Insurance Company dominated Princeton. The chief officials of these universities were beholden to these financial powers and usually owed their jobs to them. The significant influence of \"Wall Street\" (meaning Morgan) both in the Ivy League and in Washington explains the constant interchange between the Ivy League and the Federal Government, and interchange which undoubtedly aroused a good deal of resentment in less-favored circles who were more than satiated with the accents, tweeds, and High Episcopal Anglophilia of these peoples. Poor Dean Acheson, in spite of (or perhaps because of) his remarkable qualities of intellect and character, took the full brunt of this resentment from McCarthy and his allies. The same feeling did no good to pseudo-Ivy League figures like Alger Hiss. Page 938 In spite of the great influence of this \"Wall Street\" alignment, an influence great enough to merit the name of the \"American Establishment,\" this group could not control the Federal Government and, in consequence, had to adjust to a good many government actions thoroughly distasteful to the group. The chief of these were in taxation law, beginning with the graduated income tax in 1913, but culminating above all else with the inheritance tax. These tax laws drove the great private fortunes dominated by Wall Street into tax- http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig17.htm (10 of 34)22.5.2005 19:19:35"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"g$biloxi exempt foundations which became the major link in the Establishment network between Wall Street, the Ivy League and the Federal government. Dean Rusk, Secretary of State after 1961, formerly president of the Rockefeller Foundations, is as much a member of this nexus as Alger Hiss, the Dulles brothers, Jerome Green, etc. More than fifty years ago, the Morgan firm decided to infiltrate the Left-wing political movements of the United States. This was relatively easy to do since these groups were starved for funds and eager for a voice to reach the people. Wall Street supplied both. The purpose was not to destroy, dominate, or take over but was really three-fold: 1) to keep informed about the Left-wing or liberal groups; 2) to provide them with a mouthpiece so they could blow off steam; 3) to have a final \"veto\" on their actions if they ever went radical. There was nothing really new about this decision, since other financiers had talked about it and even attempted it earlier. The best example of the alliance of Wall Street and Left-wing publication was \"The New Republic\" a magazine founded in 1914 by Willard Straight using Payne Whitney money. The original purpose for establishing the paper was to provide an outlet for the progressive Left and to guide it in an Anglophile direction. This latter task was entrusted to Walter Lippmann. Willard Straight, like many Morgan agents, was present at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. Page 940 The first New Republic editor,Herbert Croly wrote, \"Of course, the Straights could always withdraw their financial support if they ceased to approve of the policy of the paper;and in that event, it would go out of existence as a consequence of their disapproval.\" The chief achievement of The New Republic in 1914-1918 and again in 1938- 1948 was for interventionism in Europe. Page 942 Straight allowed the Communists to come into the New Republic. The first to arrive was Lew Frank. Page 944 Frank joined a \"Communist Research Group\" which met in the Manhattan home of the wealthy \"Wall Street Red,\" Frederick Vanderbilt Field. Page 945 To Morgan, all political parties were simply organizations to be used, and the firm always was careful to keep a foot in all camps. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig17.htm (11 of 34)22.5.2005 19:19:35"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Like the Morgan interest libraries, museums and art, its recognition of the need for social work among the poor went back to the original founder of the firm, George Peabody. To this same figure may be attributed the use of tax-exempt foundations for controlling these activities as in the use of Peabody foundations to support Peabody libraries and museums. Unfortunately, we do not have space here for this great and untold story, but it must be remembered that what we do say is part of a much larger picture. Our concern at the moment is with the links between Wall Street and the Left, especially the Communists. Here the chief link was the Thomas W. Lamont family. Tom Lamont was brought into the Morgan firm, as Straight several years later, by Henry P. Davison, a Morgan partner. Each had a wife who became a patroness of Leftish causes and two sons, of which the elder was a conventional banker, and the youngest was a Left-wing sympathizer and sponsor. HUAC files show Tom Lamont, his wife Flora, and his son Corliss as sponsors and financial angels to almost twenty extreme Left organizations, including the Communist Party itself. Page 946 In 1951, the McCarran Committee sought to show that China had not been lost to the Communists by the deliberate actions of a group of academic experts on the Far East and Communist fellow travellers whose work in that direction was controlled and coordinated by the Institute of Pacific Relations (IPR). The influence of the Communists in the IPR is well established but the patronage of Wall Street is less well known. The IPR was a private association of ten independent national councils in ten countries concerned with affairs in the Pacific. Money for the American Council of the IPR came from the Carnegie Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation. The financial deficits which occurred each year were picked up by financial angels, almost all with close Wall Street connections. There can be little doubt that the IPR line had many points in common both with the Kremlin's party line on the Far East and with the State Department's police line in the same area. Clearly there were some Communists, even party members, involved but it is much less clear that there was any disloyalty to the U.S. There was a great deal of intrigue both to help those who agreed with the IPR line and to influence U.S. government policy in this direction, but there is no evidence of which I am aware of any explicit plot or conspiracy to direct American policy in a direction favorable either to the Soviet Union or to international Communism. Page 948 It must be confessed that the IPR had many of the marks of a fellow traveller or Communist \"captive\" organization.

For example, Elizabeth Bentley testified on the IPR and identified almost every person associated with the organization as a Communist. Page 949 This Radical Right fairy tale, which is not an accepted folk myth in many groups in America, pictured the recent history of the United States as a well-organized plot of extreme Left-wing elements, operating from the White House itself and controlling all the chief avenues of publicity in the United States. This plot, if we are to believe the myth, worked through such avenues as the New York Times, Herald Tribute, Christian Science Monitor, Washington Post, Atlantic Monthly, and Harper's Magazine and had at its core the wild-eyed and bushy-haired theoreticians of Socialist Harvard and the London School of Economics. It was determined to bring the U.S. into World War II on the side of England (Roosevelt's first love) and Soviet Russia (his second love) and, as part of this consciously planned scheme, invited Japan to attack Pearl Harbor all the while undermining America's real strength by excessive spending and unbalanced budgets. Page 950 This myth, like all fables, does in fact have a modicum of truth. There does exist and has existed for a generation, an international Anglophile network which operates to some extent in the way the Radical Right believes the Communists act. In fact, this network, which we may identify as the Round Table Groups, has no aversion to cooperating with the Communists, or any other groups, and frequently does so. I know of the operations of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960s, to examine its papers and secret records. I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments. I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known. The Round Table Groups have already been mentioned several times. At the risk of some repetition, the story will be summarized here because the American branch of this organization (sometimes called the \"Eastern Establishment) has played a very significant role in the history of the United States in the last generation. The Round Table Groups were semi-secret discussion and lobbying groups whose original purpose was to federate the English-speaking world along lines laid down by Cecil Rhodes. By 1915, Round Table groups existed in seven countries including England, South Africa, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India and the United States. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig17.htm (13 of 34)22.5.2005 19:19:35"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 951 Money for their activities originally came from Cecil Rhodes, J.P. Morgan, the Rockefeller and Whitney families and associates of bankers Lazard Brothers and Morgan, Grenfell and Company. The chief backbone of this organization grew up along the already existing financial cooperation running from the Morgan Bank in New York to a group of international financiers in London led by Lazard Brothers. Lionel Curtis established in England and each dominion a front organization to the existing local Round Table Group. This front organization called the Royal Institute of Public Affairs, had as its nucleus in each area the existing submerged Round Table Group. Page 952 In New York, it was known as the Council on Foreign Relations and was a front for J.P. Morgan and Company in association with the very small American Round Table Group. The American organizers were dominated by the large number of Morgan \"experts\" including Lamont and Beer, who had gone to the Paris Peace Conference and there became close friends with the similar group of English \"experts\" which had been recruited by the Milner group. In fact, the original plans for the Royal Institute and the Council on Foreign Relations. In 1928, the Council on Foreign Relations was dominated by the associates of the Morgan bank. Closely allied with this Morgan influence were a small group of Wall Street lawyers whose chief figures were Elihu Root, John W. Davis, the Dulles Brothers, John J. McCloy. Page 953 On this basis, there grew up in the 20th century a power structure between London and New York which penetrated deeply into university life, the press, and the practice of foreign policy. The American branch of this \"English Establishment\" exerted much of its influence through five American newspapers (New York Times and Herald Tribune, Christian Science Monitor, Washington Post, Boston Evening Transcript). It might be pointed out that the existence of this Wall Street Anglo-American axis is quite obvious once it is pointed out. It is reflected by the fact that such Wall Street luminaries such as John W. Davis, Lewis Douglas, Jock Whitney and Douglas Dillon were appointed to be American ambassadors in London. This double international network in which the Round Table groups formed the semi-secret or secret nuclei of the Institutes of International Affairs was extended into a third network for Pacific Affairs in 1925 by the same people for the same motives.

These organizations and their financial backers were in no sense reactionary or Fascistic persons, as Communist propaganda would like to depict them. Quite the contrary, they were gracious and cultured gentlemen who were much concerned with the freedom of expression of minorities and the rule of law for all and who were convinced that they could forcefully civilize the Boers, the Irish, the Arabs, and the Hindus, and who are largely responsible for the partitions of Ireland, Palestine, and India. If their failures now loom larger than their successes, this should not be allowed to conceal the high motives with which they attempted both. It was this group of people, whose wealth and influence so exceeded their experience and understanding, who provided much of the framework of influence which the Communist sympathizers and fellow travellers took over in the United States in the 1930s. It must be recognized that the power of these energetic Left-wingers exercised was never their own power or Communist power but was ultimately the power of the international financial coterie, and, once the anger and suspicions of the American people were aroused as they were in the 1950s, it was a fairly simple matter to get rid of the Red sympathizers. Before this could be done, however, a congressional committee, following backward to their source the threads which led from the admitted Communists like Whittaker Chambers, through Alger Hiss, and the Carnegie Endowment to Thomas Lamont and the Morgan Bank, fell into the whole complicated network of the interlocking tax-exempt foundations. The Eighty-third Congress set up in 1953 a Special Reece Committee to investigate Tax-Exempt Foundations. It soon became clear that people of immense wealth would be unhappy if the investigation went too far and that the \"most respected\" newspapers in the country, closely allied with these men of wealth, would not get excited enough about any revelations to make the publicity worthwhile. An interesting report showing the Left-wing associations of interlocking nexus of tax-exempt foundations was issued in 1954 rather quietly.. Four years later, the Reece Committee's general counsel, Rene A Wormser, wrote a shocked, but not shocking, book on the subject called \"Foundations: Their Power and Influence.\" Page 956 Jerome Green is a symbol of much more than the Wall Street influence in the IPR. He is also a symbol of the relationship between the financial circles of London and those of the eastern U.S. which http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig17.htm (15 of 34)22.5.2005 19:19:35"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"g$biloxi reflects one of the most powerful influences in 20th century American and world history. The two ends of this English-speaking axis have sometimes been called, perhaps facetiously, the English and American Establishments. There is, however, a considerable degree of truth behind the joke, a truth which reflects a very real power structure. It is this power structure which the Radical Right in the U.S. has been attacking for years in the belief they are attacking the Communists. These misdirected attacks did much to confuse the American people in 1948-1955. By 1953 most of these attacks had run their course. The American people, thoroughly bewildered at the widespread charges of twenty years of treason and subversion, had rejected the Democrats and put into the White House a war hero, Eisenhower. At the time,two events, one public and one secret, were still in process. The public one was the Korean War; the secret one was the race for the thermonuclear bomb. CHAPTER XVIII: NUCLEAR RIVALRY AND COLD WAR, RACE FOR THE H-BOMB 1950-1957 Page 965 On March 1, 1954, we exploded our first real thermonuclear bomb at Bikini atoll. It was a horrifying device which spread death-dealing radioactive contamination over more than 8,000 square miles and injurious radiation over much of the world. Page 968 To prepare public opinion to accept use of the H-bomb, if it became necessary, Strauss sponsored a study of radioactive fallout whose conclusion was prejudged by calling it \"Project Sunshine.\" By selective release of some evidence and strict secrecy of other information, they tried to establish in public opinion that there was no real danger to anyone from nuclear fallout even in all-out nuclear war. This gave rise to controversy between the scientists and the Administration on the danger of fallout. The Eisenhower through the Dulles doctrine of \"massive retaliation\" was so deeply committed to nuclear war that it could not permit the growth of public opinion which would refuse to accept the use of nuclear weapons because of objections to the danger of fallout to neutrals and non-combatants. By 1953, this struggle became so intense that supporters of massive retaliation decided they must destroy the public image and public career of Oppenheimer. THE KOREAN WAR AND ITS AFTERMATH, 1950-1954 Page 970 http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig17.htm (16 of 34)22.5.2005 19:19:35"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"g$biloxi The emphasis on nuclear retaliation to Communist aggression anywhere in the world made it necessary to draw a defence perimeter over which such aggression would trigger retaliation. At the insistence of MacArthur, that perimeter was drawn to exclude Korea, Formosa and Mainland China; accordingly, all American forces had been evacuated from South Korea in June 1949. Page 971 The Soviet Union interpreted this to mean that the U.S. would allow South Korea to be conquered by the North. Instead, when Russia, through its satellite North Korea, sought to take Korea, this game rise to an American counteraction. Page 972 For forty-eight hours after the Korean attack, the world hesitated, awaiting America's reaction. Truman immediately committed American air and sea forces in the area south of 38 degrees and demanded a UN condemnation of the aggression. Thus, for the first time in history, a world organization voted to use collective force to stop armed aggression. This was possible because the North Korean attack occurred at a time when the Soviet delegation was absent from the UN Security Council, boycotting it as a protest at the presence of the delegation from Nationalist China. Accordingly, the much-used Soviet veto was unavailable. Page 974 The frontier was reached by UN forces as the month ended. The Red Chinese decision to intervene was made nine days after American troops crossed the 38th parallel into North Korea. It was inevitable as Red China could hardly be expected to allow the buffer North Korean state to be destroyed and American troops to occupy the line of the Yalu. As soon as it became clear that American forces would continue past the 38th parallel to the Yalu, the Chinese intervened, not to restore the 38th parallel frontier but to clear the U.N. forces from Asia completely. Page 975 The Truman Administration, after the victory at Inchon, did not intend to stop at the 38th parallel and hoped to reunite the country under the Seoul government. It is probable that this alone triggered the Chinese intervention. On October 9, 1950, two of MacArthur's planes attacked a Russian air base sixty-two miles inside Russian territory.

Morgan and Company, of old Siwash against Harvard, of the Chicago Tribune against the Washington Post or New York Times, of simple absolutes against complex relativisms, of immediate final solutions against long-range partial alleviations, of frontier activism against European though, a rejection, out of hand, of all the complexities of life which had arisen since 1915 in favor of a nostalgic return to the simplicities of 1905, and above all a desire to get back to the inexpensive, thoughtless, and irresponsible international security of 1880. Page 980 This neurotic impulse swept over the U.S. in a great wave in the years 1948-1955, supported by hundreds of thousands of self-seeking individuals, especially peddlers of publicity and propaganda, and financed no longer by the relatively tied-up funds of declining Wall Street international finance, but by its successors, the freely available winnings of self-financing industrial profits from such new industrial activities as air power, electronics, chemicals, which pretended to themselves that their affluence was entirely due to their own cleverness. At the head of this list were the new millionaires led by the Texas oil pluggers whose fortunes were based on tricky tax provisions and government-subsidized transportation systems.

In June 1951, Senator McCarthy delivered a speech in the Senate of 60,000 words attacking General Marshall as a man \"steeped in falsehood\" who has \"recourse to the lie whenever it suits his convenience,\" one of the architects of America's foreign policy made by \"men high in Government who are concerting to deliver us to disaster, a conspiracy so black that when it is finally exposed, its principals shall be forever deserving of the maledictions of all honest men.\" Page 987 Eisenhower had no particular assets except a bland and amiable disposition combined with his reputation as a victorious general. He also had a weakness, one which is frequently found in his profession, the conviction that anyone who has become a millionaire, even by inheritance, is an authoritative person on almost any subject. Page 988 If elected, he would go to Korea to make peace. Although himself not a neo-isolationist or a reactionary, Eisenhower had few deep personal convictions and was eager to be president. When his advisers told him that he must collaborate with the Radical Right, he went all the way, even to the extent of condoning McCarthy's attack on General Marshall when he, under McCarthy's pressure, removed a favorable reference to Marshall from a Wisconsin speech. Eisenhower allotted the functions of government to his Cabinet members (\"eight millionaires and a plumber\"). Page 991 Attorney General Herbert Brownell confided to a businessmen's luncheon in Chicago that President Truman, knowing that Harry Dexter White was a Russian spy, had promoted him from assistant secretary of the treasury to executive director of the U.S. Mission to the International Monetary Fund in 1946. The House Committee on Un- American activities at once issued a subpoena to the ex-President to testify which was ignored. McCarthy's attacks on the U.S. Information Agency overseas libraries led to burning of books like Tom Sawyer and Robin Hood as http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig17.htm (19 of 34)22.5.2005 19:19:35"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"g$biloxi subversive (Robin Hood stole from the rich and gave to the poor, clearly a Communist tactic).

THE RISE OF KHRUSHCHEV, 1953-1958 Page 1009 Immediately after Stalin's death, the \"collective leadership\" was headed by Malenkov, Beria and Molotov. Malenkov supported a policy of relaxation with increased emphasis on production of consumers goods and rising standards of living, as well as increased efforts to avoid any international crises which might lead to war; Beria supported a \"thaw\" in internal matters, with large-scale amnesties for political prisoners as well as rehabilitation of those already liquidated; Molotov continued to insist on the \"hard\" policies of Stalin with no relaxation of domestic tyranny.

These uprising were crushed with the full power of the Soviet occupation armored divisions.

Page 1012 Khrushchev's six-day visit to Tito is of great importance because it showed Russia in an apologetic role for a major past error and because it reversed Stalin's rule that all Communist parties everywhere must follow the Kremlin's leadership such that \"differences in the concrete application of Socialism are the exclusive concern of individual countries.\" En route home, he stopped in Sofia and place the fuse in another, even larger, stick of dynamite, by a secret denunciation of Stalin personally as a bloodthirsty tyrant. Back in Moscow, Khrushchev won over the majority by arguing that the loyalty of the satellites, and especially their vital economic cooperation, could be ensured better by a loose leash than by a club. Page 1013 The Russians spoke favorably about disarmament which, to them, meant total renunciation of nuclear weapons and drastic cuts in ground forces, a combination which would make the United States very weak against Russia while leaving Russia still dominant in Europe. Page 1012 The Geneva Conference discussions were conducted in an unprecedented atmosphere of friendly cooperation which came to be known as the \"Geneva spirit\" and continued for several years and was never completely overcome even when matters were at their worst following the U-2 incident of 1960 and the Cuban crisis of 1962. Page 1016 At the Twentieth Party Congress in February 1956, the first speech of 50,000 words delivered by Khrushchev over seven hours urged the need for coexistence with the West and references to the possibility of peaceful rather than revolutionary change from capitalism to Socialism.

The formula \"enemy of the people\" was specifically introduced for the purpose of physically annihilating these persons. How is it that a person confesses to crimes that he has not committed? Only in one way - by application of physical pressure, tortures, taking away of his human dignity.

A study of Khrushchev's life shows that he defended Stalin's acts which caused the deaths of millions. The fault was not merely with Stalin; it was with the system, it was with Russia. The more completely total and irresponsible power is concentrated in one man's hands, the more frequently will a monster of sadism be produced. The very structure of Russian life drove Khrushchev, as it had driven Stalin, to concentrate all power in his own hands. Neither man could relax halfway to power for fear that someone else would continue on, seeking the peak of power. The basis of the whole system was fear and like all neurotic drives in a neurotic system, such fear could not be overcome even by achievement of total power. That is why it grows into paranoia as it did with Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great, Paul I, Stalin and others.

The vote was 7-4 against him with Mikoyan, Kirichenko and Suslov his only supporters. He was offered the reduced position of minister of agriculture. Page 1032 Khrushchev refused to accept the result, denying that the Presidium had the authority to remove a first secretary, and appealing to the Central Committee. The members of this larger group joined in the discussions as they arrived while Khrushchev's supporters sought to delay the vote until his men could come in from the provinces. Marshall Zhukov provided planes to bring in the more distant ones. The discussion became bitter when Zhukov threatened to produce evidence that Malenkov and Molotov had been deeply involved in the bloody purges of 1937. Madame Furtseva, an alternate member of the Presidium, filibustered with a speech for six hours. Eventually, there were 309 members present. When the vote was finally taken, Khrushchev's supporters voted for him solidly and his removal, already voted by the http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig17.htm (23 of 34)22.5.2005 19:19:35"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Presidium, was reversed. Khrushchev at once counterattacked. He moved and carried the expulsion from the Presidium of Malenkov, Molotov, Kaganovich and Shepilov for \"anti-party\" activities. Then came the election of a new Presidium with fifteen full members instead than the previous eleven, and nine alternates instead of the previous six. This change was Khrushchev's most smashing personal victory and the most significant event in Russia's internal history. It led Khrushchev to a position of political power more complete than Stalin's had been although it was clear that Khrushchev would never be allowed to abuse his power the way Stalin had done. Page 1033 Khrushchev did not rest on his oars. During the summer of 1957, he made notable concessions to the peasants (ending compulsory deliveries from products of their personal plots), slammed down the lid on freedom of writers and artists, pushed vigorously both the \"virgin lands\" scheme and the decentralization of industry, and worked to curtail the growing autonomy of the armed forces and revived trade unions into the new regional economic councils. Page 1034 Russian objection to city-bombing or to strategic terror of the V-2 kind as ineffective and a waste of resources was undoubtedly sincere. The Soviet Union has no idea of being able to achieve military victory over the United States simply because they have no method of occupying the territory of the United States at any stage in a war. Page 1035 They are unlikely to use nuclear weapons first although fully prepared to resort to them once they are used by an enemy. Page 1036 However such a war is regarded by the Soviet leaders as highly undesirable while they, in a period of almost endless cold war, can seek to destroy capitalist society by nonviolent means. This theory of \"nibbling\" the capitalist world to death is combined with a tactic which would resist \"capitalist imperialism\" by encouraging \"anti- colonialism.\" Stalin and Dulles saw the world largely in black-and-white terms: who was not with them was obviously against them. Page 1037 Stalin did not see the possibility of colonial areas becoming non-Communist and non-colonial independent states and rebuffed the http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig17.htm (24 of 34)22.5.2005 19:19:35"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"g$biloxi local native groups. Khrushchev did the opposite. Page 1038 This shift in the Soviet attitude toward neutralism was helped by Dulles' refusal to accept the existence of neutralism. His rebuffs tended to drive those areas which wanted to be neutral into the arms of Russian because the new nations of the developing Buffer Fringe valued their independence above all else. The Russian acceptance of neutralism may be dated about 1954 while Dulles still felt strongly adverse to neutralism four or five years later. This gave the Soviet Union a chronological advantage to compensate for its many disadvantages in the basic struggle to win the favor of the neutrals. THE COLD WAR IN EASTERN AND SOUTHERN ASIA, 1950-1957 Page 1039 By 1939, there was only one independent state in southeast Asia: Siam. Thus all southeast Asia, except Thailand, was under the colonial domination of five Western states in 1939. French Indochina emerged from Japanese occupation as the three states of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, each claiming independence. Efforts by the European Powers to restore their prewar rule led to violent clashes with the supporters of independence. These struggles were brief and successful in Burma and Indonesia but were very protracted in Indochina. Page 1042 In all these areas, native nationalists were inclined to the political Left, if for no other reason than the fact that the difficulties of capital accumulation and investment to finance economic improvements could be achieved only under state control. In some cases, such Communism may have been ideological but inmost cases, it involved little more than the desire to play off the Soviet Union and China against the Western imperialist Powers. Page 1042 A communist revolt in the Philippines had already begun and was joined by similar uprisings in Burma, Indonesia, and Malaya. Most of these revolts took the form of agrarian agitations and armed raids by Communist guerrilla jungle fighters. Since the operated on a hit-and- run basis and had to live off the local peasantry, their exploitation of peasant life eventually made them decreasingly welcome to this very group for whom they pretended to be fighting. In the Philippines, the rebels were smashed in 1953. In Indonesia, Sukarno repressed the insurrection and executed its http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig17.htm (25 of 34)22.5.2005 19:19:35"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"g$biloxi leaders. In Malaya, the Communists were systematically hunted down and destroyed by British troops. In Burma, they weren't eliminated until 1960. The real problem was Indochina. There, the French Army was uncompromising and Communist leadership was skillful. As a result, the struggle became part of the Cold War. The Malay peninsula is dominated by a series of mountain ranges with their intervening rivers running southward from Chinese Yunnan. These rivers fan out into fertile alluvial deltas which produce surplus foods for undemanding peoples. Page 1043 Indochina brought considerable wealth to France. After the Japanese withdrawal, the Paris government was reluctant to see this wealth, chiefly from the tin mines, fall into native groups and by 1949, decided to use force to recover the area. Opposed to the French effort was Ho Chi Minh, a member of the French Communist Party. Ho had set up a coalition government under his Viet Minh Party and proclaimed independence for Vietnam (chiefly Tonkin and Annam) in 1945, while French troops, in a surprise coup, seized Saigon in the south. Ho received no support from the Kremlin. At first, Ho sought support from the United States but after the establishment of Red China in 1949, he turned to that new Communist state for help. Mao's government was the first state to give Vietnam diplomatic recognition (January 1950) and at once began to send military supplies and guidance. Since the U.S. was granting extensive aid to France, the struggle in Vietnam became, through surrogates, a struggle between the United States and China. In world opinion, this made the U.S. the defender of European imperialism against anti- colonial native nationalism. During this turmoil, independent neutralist governments came into existence in Laos and Cambodia. Both states accepted aid from whoever would give it and both were ruled by an unstable balance of pro- Communists, neutralists, and pro-Westerners, all with armed supporters. On the whole, the neutralist group was largest and the pro-Western was the smallest but could obtain support from America's wealth. The decisive influence was that the Communists were prepared to accept and support neutralism years before Dulles would condone it. Page 1044 The readiness of Dulles and the French Army to force a showdown in Vietnam was unacceptable to the British and many in France. Out of this came a Soviet suggestion for a conference on Indochina in Geneva. By early 1954, the Communist guerrillas were in control of most of northern Indochina, were threatening Laos, and were plaguing villages as far south as Saigon. About 200,000 French troops and 300,000 Vietnamese militia were tied in knots by about 335,000 Viet http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig17.htm (26 of 34)22.5.2005 19:19:35"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Minh guerrillas. France was being bled to death with nothing to show for it. By the end of March 1953, the outer defences of the French strong point at Dien Bien Phu were crumbling. The French chief of staff found Dulles ready to risk all-out war with Red China by authorizing direct American intervention in Indochina. As usual, Dulles thought that wonders could be achieved by air strikes alone against the besiegers of Dien Bien Phu and for a few day, at Dulles' prodding, the United States tottered \"on the brink of war.\" Dulles proposed \"a united action policy:\" \"If Britain would join the United States and France would agree to stand firm, the three Western states could combine with friendly asian nations to oppose communist forces. Page 1045 President Eisenhower agreed but his calls to Churchill and Eden found the British government opposed to the adventure because the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1950 bound Russia to come to the assistance of China if it were attacked by the United States as Dulles contemplated. During the 1954 Far Eastern Geneva Conference, two American aircraft carriers, loaded with atomic weapons, were cruising the South China Sea, awaiting orders from Washington to hurl their deadly bombs at the Communist forces besieging the 15,000 exhausted troops trapped at Dien Bien Phu. In Washington, Admiral Radford was vigorously advocating such aggressive action on a generally reluctant government. In Paris, public outrage was rising over Indochina where the French had expended 19,000 lives and $8 billion without improving matters a particle. The fall of Dien Bien Phy on May 7th led to the fall of the French government. The new prime minister promised a cease-fire or his own retirement within 30 days. He barely met the deadline. The Indochinese settlement of July 20, 1954 was basically a compromise, some of whose elements did not appear in the agreement itself. A Communist North Vietnam state was recognized north of the 17th parallel and the rest was left in three states: Laos, Cambodia and South Vietnam. The new state system was brought within the Dulles network of trip-wire pacts on September 8, 1954 when Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Thailand, Philippines and the U.S. formed the South-East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) and extended their protection to Laos, Cambodia and South Vietnam. The Geneva agreement was to neutralize the Indochina states but was apparently not acceptable to the Dulles brothers and any possible stability in the area was soon destroyed by their activities, especially through the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) seeking to subvert the neutrality of Laos and South Vietnam by channeling millions in American funds to Right-wing army officers, building up large military forces, rigging elections, and backing reactionary http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig17.htm (27 of 34)22.5.2005 19:19:35"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"g$biloxi coups d'etat.

In Laos, the chief political figure was Prince Phouma, leader of the neutralist group, who tried to keep a balance between the Communist Pathet Lao on his Left and the American-subsidized politicians and militarists led by General Nosavan on his Right. American aid was about $40 million a year of which about $36 million went to the army. This was used, under American influence, as an anti- neutralist rather than an anti-Leftist influence culminating in a bungled army attack on two Pathet Lao battalions in 1959 and openly rigged elections in which all the Assembly seats were won by Right- wing candidates in 1960. In August 1960, an open revolt in behalf of the neutralist Phouma game rise to a Right-wing revolution led by General Nosavan. This drove the neutralists in the arms of the Pathet Lao. The SEATO Council refused to support the American position, the Laotian army was reluctant to fight, and the American military mission was soon involved in the confused fighting directly. The American bungle in Laos was repeated, with variations, elsewhere in southern and southeastern Asia. In South Vietnam, American aid, largely military, amounted to about two thirds of the country's budget, and by 1962, it had reached $2 billion. Such aid, which provided little benefit for the people, corrupted the government, weakened the swollen defense forces, and set up a chasm between the rulers and people which drove the best of the latter Leftward, in spite of the exploitative violence of the Communist guerrillas. A plebiscite in 1955 was so rigged that the American- supported candidate won over 98% of the vote. The election of 1960 was similarly managed, except in Saigon, the capital, where many people refused to vote. As might have been expected, denial of a fair ballot led to efforts to assassinate the American-sponsored President, Diem, and gave rise to widespread discontent which made it possible for the Communist guerrillas to operate throughout the country. The American- sponsored military response drove casualties to a high sustained figure by 1962 and was uprooting peasantry throughout the country in an effort to establish fortified villages which the British had introduced with success in Malaya. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig17.htm (28 of 34)22.5.2005 19:19:35"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 1047 These errors of American policy, which were repeated in other places, arose very largely from two factors: 1) American ignorance of local conditions which were passed over in animosity against Russia and China; 2) American insistence on using military force to overcome local neutralism which the mass of Asiatic people wanted. The American militarization of both Thailand and South Vietnam was used to increase pressure on Cambodia which was driven to seek support for its independence from China and Russia. North Vietnam had a deficiency of food while South Vietnam, like all delta areas, is a zone of rice surplus and thus a shining target for North Vietnamese aggression. The collapse of the world price of rice at the end of the Korean War left Burma with an unsellable surplus of almost two million tons. Within the next three years, Burma signed barter agreements with Red China and Soviet Europe by which Burma got rid of a third of its surplus each year in return for Communist goods and technical assistance. These returns were so poor in quality, high in price and poorly shipped that Burma refused to renew the agreements in 1958. SOUTHERN ASIA Farther west, in southern Asia (correctly called the Middle East from the Persian Gulf to Burma) American bungling also opened may opportunities for Soviet penetration which the Soviets failed to exploit. Page 1048 India was determined to be neutral; Pakistan was willing to be an ally of the United States. Page 1049 The partition of India before independence in 1947, as in Palestine and earlier in Ireland, received strong impetus from the Round Table Group, and in all three cases, it led to horrors of violence. In India's case, the partition was a butchery rather than a surgical process. Imposed by the British, it cut off two areas in northwestern and northeastern India to form a new Muslim state of Pakistan (cutting right through the Sikhs in the process). The two new nations began under two new leaders. In the post-partition confusion, minorities on the wrong sides of the lines sought to flee, as refugees, to India or Pakistan, while the Sikhs sought to establish a new homeland by exterminating Muslims in East Punjab. In a few weeks, almost 200,000 were killed and twelve million were forced to flee as refugees.

Under military rule, a sweeping land-reform program restricted owners to 500 irrigated or 1000 non-irrigated acres with the surplus distributed to existing tenants or other peasants. Former landlords received compensation in long-term bonds. Page 1052 The American insistence on the non-committed nations adopting anti-Soviet lines opened the way for the Soviet to pose as the friend of such nations by supporting their neutralism. Page 1053 At the end of World War II, about 80 percent of Iran's population were peasants. Four fifths of the land was almost entirely useless, being either mountainous or arid. Moreover, the peasants who tilled the land were much oppressed by heavy rents to absentee landlords who also controlled, as separate rights, essential access to water. Only about a seventh of the land was owned by peasants who worked it. Peasants retained little more than a fifth of what they produced. The shah has shifted the basis of his support from the elite landed group to this growing middle class. Before 1914, the shah sought to raise funds for his personal use by selling concessions and monopolies to foreign groups. Most of these were exploitive of the Iranian peoples. Of these, the most important was the concession for petroleum which came into possession of the new Anglo-Persian Oil Company which came to be controlled, through secret stock ownership, by the British government. Page 1054 At the end of World War I, Iran was a battleground between Russian and British armed forces. By 1920, the withdrawal of British forces left the anti-Bolshevik Russian Cossack Brigade as the only significant military force in the country. The chief Iranian officer in that force, Reza Pahlavi, in the course of 1921-1925 gradually took over control of the government and eventually deposed the incompetent 28-year-old Shah Ahmad. Pahlavi's chief aim was to break down tribalism and localism. To this end, he defeated the autonomous tribes, settled nomadic groups in villages, shifted provincial boundaries to break up local loyalties, created a national civil service and police force, established national registration with identity cards for all, and used universal conscription to mingle various groups in a national army. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig17.htm (30 of 34)22.5.2005 19:19:35"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"g$biloxi All these projects needed money and the chief resource, oil, was tied up completely in the concession held by the AIOC with the inevitable result that it became the target of the Iranian nationalist desire for traditional development funds. The older Iranian elite would have been satisfied with a renegotiated deal but the newer urban groups demanded the complete removal of foreign economic influence by nationalization of the petroleum industry. Page 1056 By 1950, the Shah put his prime minister in to force through the supplemental agreement. Opposing groups introduced nationalization bills. Gradually, the nationalization forces began to coalesce about a strange figure, Mr. Muhammad Mossadegh, with a doctorate in Economics. Politically, he was a moderate but his strong emotional appeal to Iranian nationalism encouraged extreme reactions among his followers. The company insisted that its status was based on a contractual agreement which could not be modified without its consent. The British government maintained the agreement was a matter of international public law which it had a right to enforce. The Iranian government declared it had the right to nationalize an Iranian corporation operating under its law on its territory, subject only to adequate compensation. The nationalist arguments against the company were numerous: 1) It had promised to train Iranians for all positions possible but had only used them in menial tasks, trained few natives and employed many foreigners. 2) The company had reduced its payments to Iran, which were based on profits, by reducing the amount of its profits by bookkeeping tricks. It sold oil at very low prices to wholly-owned subsidiaries outside Iran or to the British Navy, allowing the former to resell at world prices so that AIOC made small profits, while the subsidiaries made large profits not subject to the Iranian royalty obligations. Iran believe that all profits should fall under the obligations. but as late as 1950, AIOC admitted that the accounts of 59 such dummy corporations were not included in AIOC accounts. 3) AIOC generally refused to pay Iranian taxes, especially income tax but paid such taxes to Britain; at the same time, it calculated the Iranian profit royalties after such taxes so that the higher British taxes went, the less the Iranian payment became. Thus, Iran paid income tax to Britain. In 1933, AIOC paid #305,000 in British taxation and #274,000 in Iranian taxes. In 1948, the two figures were #28.3 million to Britain and #1.4 million to Iran. Page 1057 4) The payment to Iran was also reduced by putting profits into reserves or into company investments outside Iran, often in http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig17.htm (31 of 34)22.5.2005 19:19:35"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"g$biloxi subsidiaries, and calculating the Iranian share only on the profits distributed as dividends. Thus in 1947, when profits were really #40.5 million, almost #15 million went to British income taxes, over #7 million to stockholders, and only #7 million to Iran. If the payment to Iran had been calculated before taxes and reserves, it would have received at least #6 million more that year. 5) AIOC's exemption from Iranian customs deprived Iran of about #6 million a year. 6) The company drew many persons to arid and uninhabited areas and then provided very little of the costs of housing, education, or health. 7) AIOC as a member of the international oil cartel reduced its oil production and thus reduced Iran's royalties. 8) AIOC continued to calculate its payments to Iran in gold at #8.1 per ounce for years after the world gold price had risen to #13 an ounce while the American Aramco in Saudi Arabia raised its gold price on demand. 9) AIOC's monopoly prevented Iran developing other Iranian oil fields. As a consequence of all these activities, the Iranian nationalists of 1952 felt angered to think that Iran had given up 300 million tons of oil over fifty years and obtained about #800 million in profits. The Iranian opposition to nationalization was broken in 1951 when the prime minister was assassinated. The nationalization bill was passed and at the request of the Majlis, the shah appointed Mossadegh prime minister to carry it out. This was done with considerable turmoil which included strikes by AIOC workers against mistimed British wage cuts, anti-British street riots and the arrival of British gun-boats at the head of the Persian Gulf. Rather than give up the enterprise or operate it for the Iranian government, AIOC began to curtail operations and ship home its engineers. In May 1951, it appealed to the International Court of Justice in spite of Iranian protests that the case was a domestic one, not international. Only in July, 1952, did the court's decision uphold Iran's contention by refusing jurisdiction. Page 1058 At first, the U.S. supported Iran's position fearing British recalcitrance would push Iran toward Russia. However it soon became apparent that the Soviet Union, while supporting Iran's position, was not going to interfere. The American position then became increasingly pro-British and anti-Mossadegh. This was intensified by pressure from the international petroleum cartel comprising the seven greatest oil companies in the world. As soon as Britain lost its case in the International Court of Justice, it put into effect a series of reprisals against Iran which http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig17.htm (32 of 34)22.5.2005 19:19:35"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"g$biloxi rapidly crippled the country. Iranian funds were blocked; its purchases in British controlled markets were interrupted; its efforts to sell oil abroad were frustrated by a combination of the British Navy and the world oil cartel (which closed sales and distribution facilities to Iranian oil). These cut off a substantial portion of the Iranian government's revenues and forced a drastic curtailment of government expenditures. Page 1059 Mossadegh broke off diplomatic relations with the British, deported various economic and cultural groups, and dismissed both the Senate and the Iranian Supreme Court which were beginning to question his actions. By that time, almost irresistible forces were building up against Mossadegh, since lack of Soviet interference gave the West full freedom of action. The British, the AIOC, the world petroleum cartel, the American government and the older Iranian elite led by the shah combined to crush Mossadegh. The chief effort came from the CIA under the personal direction of Allen Dulles, brother of the Secretary of State. Dulles, a former director of the Schroeder Bank in New York. It will be remembered that the Schroeder Bank in Cologne helped to arrange Hitler's accession to power as chancellor in January 1933. In the Near East, the mobs are easily roused and directed by those who are willing to pay and Dulles had the unlimited secret funds of the CIA. From these he gave $10 million to Colonel H. Norman Schwartzkopf who was in charge of training the Imperial Iranian Gendarmerie and this was judiciously applied in ways which changed the mobs tune. The whole operation was directed personally by Dulles from Switzerland. In August Mossadegh held a plebiscite to approve his policies. The official vote was about two million approvals against twelve hundred disapprovals but his days were numbered. On August 13th, the Shah precipitated the planned anti-Mossadegh coup by naming General Zahedi as prime minister and sent a messenger dismissing Mossadegh. The latter refused to yield and called his supporters into the streets where they rioted against the Shah who fled with his family to Rome. Two days later, anti-Mossadegh mobs, supported by the army, defeated Mossadegh supporters. He was forced out of office and replaced by General Sahedi. The shah returned from Italy on August 22nd. Page 1060 The fall of Mossadegh ended the period of confusion. From 1953 on, the shah and the army, backed by the conservative elite, controlled the country and the docile Majlis.

The shah's own estates were among the first to be distributed but by the end of 1962 over 5000 villages had been granted to their peasants.

In this pleasant period of self-deception, the Soviet Union entered upon an unofficial international suspension of nuclear bomb testing from 1958 until 1961.

The ten percent increase each year in the West German gross national product was something that could not be denied or disbelieved. Page 1102 In East Germany in 1960, almost a million farmers were forced into less than 20,000 collective farms by methods of violence and social pressure similar to those Stalin had used. And the consequences were similar: agricultural production collapsed. Shortages of food were soon followed by other shortages.

Latin American lacks the outlook that will mobilize its resources in constructive rather than destructive directions. Obviously, the birthrate must decrease or the food supply must be increased faster than the population. And some provision must be made to provide peasants with capital and know-how before the great landed estates are divided up among them.

Page 1113 We hear a great deal about Latin America's need for American capital and American know-how, when in fact the need for these is much less than the need for utilization of Latin America's own capital and know-how. The wealth and income of Latin America, in absolute quantities, is so great and it is so inequitably controlled and distributed that there is an enormous accumulation of incomes, far beyond their consumption needs, in the hands of a small percentage of Latin Americans. Much of these excess incomes are wasted, hoarded, or merely used for wasteful competition in ostentatious social display largely due to the deficiencies of Latin American personalities and character. The solution is not to redistribute incomes but to change the patterns of character and of personality formation so that excess incomes will be used constructively and not wasted. Page 1114 At least half the value of American aid has been wiped away by the worsening of Latin America's terms of trade which made it necessary for it to pay more and more for its imports at the same time that it got less and less for its exports made worse by much of the available supply of foreign exchange spent for self-indulgent and non constructive spending abroad or simply to hoard their money in New York, London or Switzerland. The solution must be found in more responsible, more public-spirited, and more constructive patterns of outlook, of money flows, and of political and social security. A similar solution must be found for social deficiencies like inadequate housing, education, and social stability.

Such reform can come about only when the surpluses that accumulate in the hands of the Latin American oligarchy are used to establish more progressive utilization of Latin American resources. Page 1123 The whole system is full of paradox and contradiction. The obstacle to progress and hope rests in the oligarchy because it controls wealth and power, and also because there is no hope at all unless it changes its ideology. Page 1124 World War II, by increasing demand for Latin America's mineral and agricultural products, pushed starvation and controversy away from the immediate present. Latin American boomed: the rich got richer; the poor had more children. A few poor became rich, or at least richer.

Production costs of tin rose above market price thus wiping out their foreign exchange earnings. Worse, the world price of tin collapsed in 1957. The problems could hardly be handled because of popular pressures in a democratic country to live beyond the country's income. The final collapse did not occur because of the efforts of President Siles and assistance from the United States. Page 1129 If any proof were needed that radical reform for sharing the wealth of the few among the many poor is not an easy, or feasible method, Bolivia's hard-working Indians, once hopelessly dull, morose, and sullen, are not bright, hopeful, and self-reliant. Even their clothing is gradually shifting from the older funereal black to brighter colors and variety. Few contrasts could be more dramatic than that between the Bolivian revolutionary government (in which a moderate regime was pushed toward radicalism by popular pressures and survived, year after year, with American assistance) and the Guatemala revolution where a Communist-inspired regime tried to lead a rather inert population in the direction of increasing radicalism but was overthrown by direct American action within three years (1951-1954). Guatemala is one of the \"banana republics.\" The retail value of Latin America's part of the world's trade in bananas is several billion dollars a year but Latin America's gets less than 7% of that value. One reason for this is the existence of the United Fruit Company which owns two million acres of plantations in six countries and handles about a third of the world's banana sales. It pays about $145 million a year into the six countries and claims to earn about $26 million profits on its $159 million investment but this profit figure of about 16.6% is undoubtedly far below the true figure. In 1970, 95% of the land held by United Fruit was uncultivated. Page 1130 Guatemala, like Bolivia, has a population that consists largely of impoverished Indians and mixed bloods (mestizos). From 1931 to 1944 it was ruled by the dictator Jorge Ubico, the last of a long line of corrupt and ruthless tyrants. When he retired to New Orleans in 1944, free elections chose Juan Jose Arevalo (1945-1950) and Jacobo Arbenz Guzman (1950-1954) as presidents. Reform was long overdue and these two administrations tried to provide it, becoming increasingly anti- American and pro-Communist over their nine-year rule. When they began, civil or political rights were almost totally unknown and 142 persons (including corporations) owned 98% of the arable land. Free speech and press, legalized unions, and free elections preceded the work of reform but opposition from the United States began as soon as it http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig19.htm (6 of 31)22.5.2005 19:20:05"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"g$biloxi became clear that the Land Reform Act of June 1952 would be applied to the United Fruit Company. This act called for redistribution of uncultivated holdings above a fixed acreage or lands of absentee owners, with compensation from the twenty year 3 percent bonds equal to the tax value of the lands. About 400,000 acres of United Fruit lands fell under this law and were distributed by the Arbenz Guzman government to 180,000 peasants. This was declared to be a Communist penetration by Allen Dulles, Director of the CIA, which soon found an American-trained and American-financed Guatemalan Colonel, Carlos Castillo Armas, who was prepared to lead a revolt against Arbenz. With American money and equipment, and even some American \"volunteers\" to fly \"surplus\" American planes, Armas mounted an attack of Guatemalan exiles from bases in two adjacent dictatorships, Honduras and Nicaragua.\" Both these countries are horrible examples of everything a Latin American government should not be, corrupt, tyrannical, cruel, and reactionary, but they won the favor of the United States State Department by echoing American foreign policy at every turn. Nicaragua, often a target of American intervention in the past, was decayed, dirty, and diseased under the twenty-year tyranny of Anastasio Somoza (1936-1956). His assassination handed the country over to be looted by his two sons, one of whom became president while the other served as commander of the National Guard. Page 1131 From these despotic bases, the CIA-directed assault of Colonel Armas overthrew Arbenz Guzman in 1954 and established in Guatemala a regime similar to that of the Somozas. All civil and political freedoms were overthrown, the land reforms were undone, and corruption reigned. When Armas was assassinated in 1957 and a moderate elected as his successor, the army annulled those elections and held new ones in which one of their own, General Fuentes, was \"elected.\" He liquidated what remained of Guatemala's Socialist experiments by granting these enterprises, at very reasonable prices, to his friends while collecting his own pay of a $1 million a year. Discontent from his associates led to a conservative army revolt but American pressure secured his position. The U.S. could not afford a change of regime since that country was the chief aggressive base for the Cuban exiles' attack on Cuba at the Bay of Pigs in April 1962. The CIA success in attacking \"Communist\" Guatemala from dictatorial Nicaragua in 1954 was not repeated in its more elaborate attack on \"Communist\" Cuba from dictatorial Guatemala in 1962. In fact, the Bay of Pigs must stand as the most shameful event in U.S. history since the end of World War II. The causes of the Cuban disaster, if we oversimplify, may be organized in terms of two intersecting factors: 1) the personality deficiencies of the Cubans themselves such as their http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig19.htm (7 of 31)22.5.2005 19:20:05"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"g$biloxi lack of rationality and self-discipline, their emotionalism and corruptibility; 2) the ignorance and ineptitude of the American State Department which seems incapable of dealing with Latin America in terms of the real problems of the area but instead insists on treating it in terms of America's vision of the world, which is to day, America's political preconceptions and economic interests. Cuba is more Spanish than much of Latin America and only obtained its independence in 1898, two generations later than the rest of Latin America. Then, for over thirty years, until the abrogation of the Platt Amendment in 1934, Cuba was under American occupation or the threat of direct American intervention. It fell under American economic domination by American investments on the island and by becoming deeply involved in the american market, especially for sugar. A local oligarchy of Cubas was built up including an exploitative landlord group that had not existed previously. With the establishment of the Good Neighbor Policy in 1933 and ending the threat of American direct intervention, it became possible for the Cubans to overthrow the tyrannical and bloody rule of General Machado which had lasted for eight years (1925-1933). Page 1132 The opportunity to begin a series of urgently needed and widely demanded social reforms under Machado's successor, San Martin, was lost when the United States refused to recognize or to assist the new regime. As a result, a ruthless Cuban army sergeant, Fuegencio Batista, was able to overthrow San Martin and begin a ten-year rule through civilian puppets chosen in fraudulent elections, and then directly as president himself. When San Martin was elected president in 1944, he abandoned his earlier reformist ideas and became the first of a series of increasingly corrupt elected regimes over the next eight years. The fourth such election for 1953 was prevented when Batista seized power once again in 1952. The next seven years were filled with Batista's efforts to hold his position by violence and corruption against the rising tide of discontent against his rule. One of the earliest episodes in that tide was an attempted revolt by a handful of youths, led by 26-year-old Fidel Castro in eastern Cuba on July 26, 1953. The failure of the rising gave Castro two years of imprisonment and more than a year of exile but at the end of 1956, he landed with a handful of men to begin guerrilla operations. Batista's regime was so corrupt that many segments of the army and middle class were neutral or favorable to Castro's operations. The necessary arms and financial support came from these groups although the core of the movement was made up of peasants and workers led by young middle-class university students. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig19.htm (8 of 31)22.5.2005 19:20:05"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"g$biloxi This Castro uprising was not typical because of Castro's fanatical thirst for power, his ruthless willingness to destroy property or lives in order to weaken the Batista regime, and his double method of operation, from within Cuba rather than from abroad and from a rural base, the peasants, rather than the usual urban base, the army, used by most Latin American rebels. On New Year's day of 1959, Castro marched into Havana. Within two weeks, the supporters of the Batista regime and dissident elements in Castro's movement began to be executed by firing squad. For a year, Castro's government carried on reforms aimed at satisfying the more obvious demands of the dispossessed groups. Military barracks were converted into schools; the militia was permanently established to replace the regular army; rural health centers were set up; a full-scale attack was made on illiteracy; new schools were constructed; urban rents were cut in half; utility rates were slashed; taxes were imposed on the upper classes; the beaches, once reserved for the rich, were opened to all; and a drastic land reform was launched. Page 1133 These actions were not integrated into any viable economic program but they did spread a sense of well-being in the countryside although they curtailed the building boom in the cities, largely rooted in American investment, and they instigated a flight of the rich from the island to refuge in the U.S. Castro sought to export revolution to the rest of Latin America. Arms and guerrilla fighters were sent, and lost, in unsuccessful efforts to invade Panama, Nicaragua, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. Failure of these turned him to methods of more subtle penetration, largely worked by propaganda and the arming and training of small subversive groups, especially where democratic or progressive regimes seemed to be developing as in Venezuela or Colombia. At the same time, an unsuccessful effort was made to persuade all Latin America to form an anti-Yankee front. Although the U.S. had promised in 1959 to follow a policy of non- intervention toward Cuba, these changes within the island and a visit of Soviet Deputy Premier Mikoyan in February 1960 forced a reconsideration of this policy. The Mikoyan agreement promised Cuba petroleum, arms and other needs for its sugar followed by establishment of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in May and with Red China later in the year. The Soviet embassy in Havana became a source of Communist subversion for all Latin America almost at once, while in September Khrushchev and Castro jointly dominated the annual session of the General Assembly of the U.N. in New York. Castro obtained petroleum for Cuban sugar. When he insisted that American-owned refineries in Cuba process this oil, they refused and http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig19.htm (9 of 31)22.5.2005 19:20:05"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"g$biloxi were at once seized by Castro. Page 1134 The U.S. struck back by reducing the Cuban sugar quota in the American market which led, step by step, to Castro's sweeping nationalization of foreign-owned factories on the island. The United States retaliated by establishing a series of embargoes on Cuban exports to the U.S. These controversies led Castro into an economic trap similar to that into which Nasser had fallen with Egypt's cotton. Each nationalist leader committed his chief foreign-exchange-earning product (sugar and cotton) to the Soviet Union as payment for Communist (often Czech) arms. This tied these countries to the Soviet Union and deprived them of the chance to use their own source of foreign money for equipment so urgently needed for economic improvement. By December when American diplomatic relations with Cuba were broken off, the Cuban economic decline had begun and soon reached a point where standards of living were at least a third below the Batista level except for some previously submerged groups. At the end of 1960, the Eisenhower Administration decided to use force to remove Castro. This decision was a major error and led to a totally shameful fiasco. The error apparently arose in the CIA and was based on a complete misjudgment of the apparent east with which that agency had overthrown the Arbenz regime in Guatemala in 1954 by organizing a raid of exiles, armed and financed by the CIA, into Guatemala from Nicaragua. The CIA analyzed this apparently successful coup quite incorrectly,since it assumed that Arbenz had been overthrown by the raiding exiles when he had really been destroyed by his own army which used the raid as an excuse and occasion to get rid of him. But on this mistaken basis, the CIA decided to get rid of Castro by a similar raid of Cuban exiles from Guatemala. This decision was worse than a crime; it was stupid. A unilateral, violent attack on a neighboring state with which we were not at war, in an area where we were committed to multilateral and peaceful procedures for settling disputes, was a repudiation of all our idealistic talk about the rights of small nations and our devotion to peaceful procedures that we had been pontificating around the world since 1914. It was a violation of our commitment to non-intervention in the Americas and specifically in Cuba. In sequence to our CIA intervention in Guatemala, it strengthened Latin American picture of the U.S. as indifferent to Latin America's growing demand for social reform. The whole operation, patterned on Hitler's operations to subvert Austria and Czechoslovakia in 1938 was bungled as Hitler could never have bungled anything. The project was very much a Dulles brothers' job and its execution was largely in the hands of the CIA. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig19.htm (10 of 31)22.5.2005 19:20:05"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 1135 The plan of invasion of Cuba seems to have been drawn on typical Hitler lines: the expeditionary force was to establish a beachhead in Cuba, set up a government on the island, be recognized by the U.S. as the actual government of Cuba, and ask Washington for aid to restore order in the rest of the island which it did not yet control. The CIA assured President Kennedy that if matters were allowed to go on as they were, Castro would be strengthened in power (which was untrue) and that the invasion would be success because of the Cuban people, led by the anti-Castro underground, would rise against him as soon as they heard of the landing. The executive committee of Cuban refugees in the U.S., mostly representatives of the older ruling groups in Cuba, were eager to restore the inequitable economic and social system that had existed before Castro. They were alienated from the most vigorous anti-Castro groups in the Cuban underground who had no desire to turn back the clock to the Batista era. The CIA would not cooperate with the anti- Castro underground because it was opposed to their wish for social and economic reform. Accordingly, the CIA launched the invasion without notifying the Cuban underground. Then the attack was bungled. Page 1136 This greatly strengthened Castro's prestige in Latin American more than in Cuba itself. This in turn permitted him to survive a deepening wave of passive resistance and sabotage within Cuba itself, chiefly from the peasants to recapture control of the Cuban revolutionary movement. Page 1138 In May 1961, Castro proclaimed that Cuba would be a socialist state but despite his statements, he was not in any way a convinced Communist or a convinced anything else, but was a power-hungry and emotionally unstable individual, filled with hatred of authority himself, and restless unless he had constant change and megalomaniac satisfactions. His tactical skill, especially in foreign affairs, is remarkable, and shows similarity to Hitler's.

A heavy responsibility rests with the United States for this widespread failure to find solutions to problems all the way from Pakistan to Peru. The basic reason for this is that our policies in this great area have been based on efforts to find solutions to our own problems rather than theirs; to make profits, to increase supplies of necessary raw materials, to fight Hitler, to keep out Communism and prevent the spread of neutralism. The net result is that we are now more hated than the Soviet Union and neutralism reveals itself as clearly as it dares through the whole area. Page 1141 The sole consequence of the Dulles efforts to do the wrong thing along the Pakistani-Peruvian axis has been to increase what he was seeking to reduce: local political instability, increased Communist and Soviet influence, neutralism, and hatred of the U.S. Although the Dulles period shows most clearly the failures of American foreign policy in Latin America, the situation was the same, both before and since Dulles. American policy has been determined by American needs and desires and not by the problems of Latin Americans. There are four chief periods in U.S. policy in Latin America in the 20th century: 1) a period of investment and interventionism (until 1933) and was basically a period of American imperialism. American money came as investments seeking profits out of the exploitation of the areas resources. There was little respect for the people themselves and intervention by American military and diplomatic forces was always close at hand as a protection for American profits and investments. 2) the Good Neighbor Policy in 1933 reduced intervention while retaining investment. 3) from 1940 until 1947, our efforts to involved the are in our foreign policy against Hitler and Japan; 4) since 1947, against the Soviet Union. Both these efforts have been mistakes. Page 1142 That this failure continued into the 1960s was clear in Washington's joy at the military coup that ejected the left-of-center Goulart government from Brazil in 1964 for that government, however misdirected and incompetent, at least recognized that there were urgent social and economic problems in Brazil demanding treatment.

On the whole, it cannot be said that it has been a success. It's achievement has been ameliorative rather than structural, and this alone indicates that it has not been a success. For unless there are structural reforms, its economic development will not become self- sustaining or even manage to keep up with the growth of population on the basis of income per capita. Page 1145 The failure of the Alliance for Progress to achieve what it was touted to achieve was a result that it was not intended primarily to be a method for achieving a better life for Latin Americans but was intended to be a means of implementing American policy in the Cold War. This became clearly evident at the second Punta del Este Conference in 1962 where Washington's exclusive control over the granting of funds was used as a club to force the Latin American states to exclude Cuba from the Organization of American States. The original plan was to cut off Cuba's trade with all Western Hemisphere countries. A two-thirds vote was obtained only after the most intense American \"diplomatic\" pressure and bribery involving the granting and withholding of American aid to the Alliance. Even at that, six countries, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, and Ecuador, representing 70% of Latin America's population refused to vote for the American motions.

THE JAPANESE MIRACLE Page 1148 The post-war agrarian reform redistributed the ownership of land by the government taking all individual land holdings beyond 7.5 acres, all rented land over 2.5 acres, and the land of absentee landlords. The former owners were paid with long-term bonds. In turn, peasants without land or with less than the maximum permitted amount were allowed to buy land from the state on a long-term low-interest- rate basis. Cash rents for land were also lowered. As a result, Japan became a land of peasant owners with about 90% of the cultivated land worked by its owners. Page 1151 Agrarian reform has driven Communism out of the rural areas and restricted it to the cities, chiefly to student groups.

COMMUNIST CHINA Page 1159 Previous to the Land Reform Law of 1950, 10% of families owned 53% farm land while 32% owned 78% of the land. This left over two thirds of such families with only 22% of the land. The first stage in agrarian reform had been the \"elimination of landlordism.\" The landlords were eliminated with great brutality in a series of spectacular public trials in which landlords were accused of every crime in the book. At least 3 million were executed and several times that number were imprisoned but the totals may have been much higher. The land thus obtained was distributed to poor peasant families with each obtaining about one-third of an acre. The second stage sought to establish cooperative farming. In effect, it took away from the peasants the lands they had just obtained. The third stage constituting the basic feature of the \"Great Leap Forward\" merged the 750,000 collective farms into about 26,000 http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig19.htm (14 of 31)22.5.2005 19:20:05"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"g$biloxi agrarian communes of about 5,000 families each.

The falseness of these theories was fully evident in the rising standards of living of the advanced industrial countries.

These growing characteristics of the South Vietnam government centered around the antics of the Diem family. President Diem's brother Nhu was the actual power in the government heading up a semi-secret political organization that controlled all military and civil appointments.

Page 1173 By 1955, these were already beginning to persecute the Buddhist majority, at first by harassing their religious festivals and parades but later with brutal assaults on their meetings. An attempted coup by army units was crushed and the Diem rule became increasingly arbitrary. American military assistance tried to curtail the depredations of the Communist guerrillas. The intensity of the guerrilla attacks steadily increased following Diem's re-election with 88% of the vote. American intervention was also stepped up and gradually began to shift from a purely advisory and training role to increasingly direct participation in the conflict. From 1961 onward, American casualties averaged about one dead a week, year after year. The Communist guerrilla casualties were reported to be about 500 per week but this did not seem to diminish their total number or relax their attacks. These guerrilla attacks consisted of rather purposeless destruction of peasant homes and villages, apparently designed to convince the natives of the impotence of the government and the advisability of cooperating with the rebels. To stop these depredations, the government undertook the gigantic task of organizing the peasants into \"agrovilles\" or \"strategic hamlets\" which were to be strongly defended residential centers entirely enclosed behind barricades. The process, it was said, would also improve the economic and social welfare of the people to give them a greater incentive to resist the rebels. There was considerable doubt about the effectiveness of the reform aspect of this process and some doubt about the defence possibilities of the scheme as a whole. Most observers felt that very little American economic aid ever reached the village level but instead was lost on much higher levels. By the summer of 1963, guerrillas were staging successful attacks on the strategic hamlets and the need for a more active policy became acute. Page 1175 This final crisis in the story of the Diem family and its henchmen arose from religious persecution of the Buddhists under the guise of maintaining political order. On November 1, 1963, an American-encouraged military coup led by General Minh overthrew the Diem family. A new government with a Buddhist premier calmed down the domestic crisis but was no more able to suppress guerrilla activities.

Page 1184 It is usually not recognized that the whole economic expansion of Western society rests upon a number of psychological attitudes that are prerequisites to the system as we have it but are not often stated explicitly. Two of these may be identified as: 1) future preference and 2) infinitely expandable material demand. In a sense, these are contradictory since the former implies that Western economic man will make almost any sacrifice in the present for the same of some hypothetical benefit in the future while the latter implies almost insatiable demand in the present. Nonetheless, both are essential features of the overwhelming Western economic system. Future preference came out of the Christian outlook and especially the Puritan tradition which was prepared to accept almost any kind of sacrifice in the temporal world for the sake of future eternal salvation, willing to restrict their enjoyment of income for the sake of capital accumulation. The mass production of this new industrial system was able to continue and to accelerate to the fantastic rate of the 20th century so that today, the average middle-class family of suburbia has a schedule of future material demands which is limitless. Without these two psychological assumptions, the Western economy would break down or would never have started. At present, future preference may be breaking down and infinitely expanding material demand may soon follow it in the weakening process. If so, the American economy will collapse unless it finds new psychological foundations.

Page 1204 When Khrushchev renounced the use of both nuclear war and conventional violence, and promised to defeat the West by peaceful competition, he was convinced that the Soviet Union could out-perform the U.S. because it could, in his opinion, overcome the American lead in the race for economic development that the Socialist way of life would become the model for emulation by the uncommitted nations. Page 1213 In other economies, when additional demands are presented to the economy, less resources are available for alternative uses. But in the American system, as it now stands, additional new demands usually lead to increased resources becoming available for alternative purposes, notably consumption. Thus if the Soviet Union embraced a substantial increase in space activity, the resources available for raising Russian levels of consumption would be reduced while in America, any increases in the space budget makes levels of consumption also rise. Page 1214 It does this because increased space expenditures provide purchasing power for consumption that makes available previously unused resources out of the unused American productive capacity. This unused capacity exists in the American economy because the structure of our economic system is such that it channels flows of funds into the production of additional capacity (investment) without any conscious planning process or any real desire by anyone to increase our productive capacity. It does this because certain institutions in our system (such as insurance, retirement funds,social security payments, undistributed corporate profits and such) and certain individuals who personally profit by the flow of funds not theirs into investment continue to operate to increase investment even when they have no real desire to increase productive capacity (and indeed many decry it). In the Soviet Union, on the contrary, resources are allotted to the increase of productive capacity by a conscious planning process and at the cost of reducing the resources available in their system for consumption or for the government (largely defence). Thus the meaning of \"costs\" and the limitations on ability to mobilize economic resources are entirely different in our system from the Soviet system and most others. In the Soviet economy, \"costs\" are real costs, measurable in terms of the allotment of scarce resources http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig19.htm (19 of 31)22.5.2005 19:20:05"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"g$biloxi that could have been used otherwise. In the American system, \"costs\" are fiscal or financial limitations that have little connection with the use of scarce resources or even with the use of available (and therefore not scarce) resources. The reason for this is that in the American economy, the fiscal or financial limit is lower than the limit established by real resources and therefore, since the financial limits act as the restraint on our economic activities, we do not get to the point where our activities encounter the restraints imposed by the limits of real resources (except rarely and briefly in terms of technically trained manpower, which is our most limited resource). These differences between the Soviet and American economies are: 1) the latter has built-in, involuntary, institutionalized investment which the former lacks; 2) the latter has fiscal restraints at a much lower level of economic activity which the Soviet system also lacks. Thus greater activity in defence in the USSR entails real costs since it puts pressure on the ceiling established by limited real resources while greater activity in the American defence or space effort releases money into the system which presses upward on the artificial financial ceiling, pressing it upward closer to the higher, and remote, ceiling established by the real resources limit of the American economy. This makes available the unused productive capacity that exists in our system between the financial ceiling and the real resources ceiling; it not only makes these unused resources available for the government sector of the economy from which the expenditure was directly made but also makes available portions of these released resources for consumption and additional capital investment. Page 1215 For this reason, government expenditures in the U.S. for things like defence or space may entail no real costs at all in terms of the economy as a whole. In fact, if the volume of unused capacity brought into use by expenditures for these things (that is, defence and so on) is greater than the resources necessary to satisfy the need for which the expenditure was made, the volume of unused resources made available for consumption or investment will be greater than the volume of resources used in the governmental expenditure and this additional government effort will cost nothing at all in real terms, but will entail \"negative\" real costs. (Our wealth will be increased by making the effort). The basis for this strange, and virtually unique, situation is to be found in the large amount of unused productive capacity in the U.S. even in our most productive years. In the second quarter of 1962, our productive system was running at a very high level of prosperity, yet it was functioning about 12% below capacity, which represented a loss of $73 billion annually. In this way, in the whole period from the http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig19.htm (20 of 31)22.5.2005 19:20:05"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"g$biloxi beginning of 1953 to the middle of 1962, our productive system operated at $387 billion below capacity. Thus if the system had operated near capacity, our defence effort over the nine years would have cost us nothing, in terms of loss of goods or capacity. This unique character in the American economy rests on the fact that the utilization of resources follows flow lines in the economy that are not everywhere reflected by corresponding flow lines of claims on wealth (that is, money). In general, in our economy the lines of flow of claims on wealth are such that they provide a very large volume of savings and a rather large volume of investment, even when no one really wants new productive capacity; they also provide an inadequate flow of consumer purchasing power, in terms of flows, or potential flows, of consumer goods; but they provide very limited, sharply scrutinized and often misdirected flows of funds for the use of resources to fulfill the needs of the government sector of our trisectored economy. As a result, we have our economy distorted resource-utilization patterns, with overinvestment in many areas, overstuffed consumers in one place and impoverished consumers in another place, a drastic undersupply of social services, and widespread social needs for which public funds are lacking. In the Soviet Union, money flows follow fairly well the flows of real goods and resources, but, as as result, pressures are directly on resources. These pressures mean that saving and investment conflict directly with consumption and government services (including defence), putting the government under severe direct strains, as the demands for higher standards of living cannot be satisfied except by curtailing investment, defence, space, or other government expenditures. Page 1216 Many countries of the world are worse off the Soviet Union because their efforts to increase consumers' goods may well require investment based on savings that must be accumulated at the expense of consumption. As a chief consequence of these conditions, the contrast between the \"have\" nations and the \"have-not\" nations will become even wider. This would be of little great importance to the rest of the world were it not that the peoples of the backward areas, riding the \"crisis of rising expectations\" are increasingly unwilling to be ground down in poverty as their predecessors were. At the same time, the Superpower stalemate increases the abilities of these nations to be neutral, to exercise influence out of all relationship to their actual powers, and to act, sometimes, in an irresponsible fashion. These neutrals and other peoples of backward areas have acute problems. Solutions do exist but the underdeveloped nations are unlikely to find them. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig19.htm (21 of 31)22.5.2005 19:20:05"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 1221 A growing lowest social class of the social outcasts (the Lumpenproletariat) has reappeared. This group of rejects from the bourgeois industrial society provide one of our most intractable future problems because they are gathered in urban slums, have political influence, and are socially dangerous. In the U.S. where these people congregate in the largest cities and are often Negroes or Latin Americans, they are regarded as a racial or economic problem, but they are really an educational and social problem for which economic or racial solutions would help little. This group is most numerous in the more advanced industrial areas and now forms more than 20% of the American population. Since they are a self-perpetuating group and have many children, they are increasing in numbers faster than the rest of the population. Page 1229 The pattern of outlook on which the tradition of the West is based has six parts: 1) There is truth, a reality (thus the West rejects skepticism, solipsism and nihilism) 2) No person, group, or organization has the whole picture of the truth (thus there is no absolute or final authority.) 3) Every person of goodwill has some aspect of the truth, some vision of it from the angle of his own experience. 4) Through discussion, the aspects of the truth held by many can be pooled and arranged to form a consensus closer to the truth than any of the sources that contributed to it. 5) This consensus is a temporary approximation of the truth which new experiences make it necessary to reformulate. 6) Thus Western man's picture of the truth advances closer and closer to the whole truth without ever reaching it. This methodology of the West is basic to the success, power and wealth of Western Civilization. Page 1231 To the West, in spite of all its aberrations, the greatest sin from Lucifer to Hitler, has been pride, especially in the form of intellectual arrogance, and the greatest virtue has been humility, especially in the intellectual form which concedes that opinions are always subject to modification by new experiences, new evidence, and the opinions of our fellow men. The most triumphant of these aspects is science, whose method is a perfect example of the Western tradition. The scientist goes eagerly to work each day because he has the humility to know that he does not have any final answers and must work to modify and improve the answers http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig19.htm (22 of 31)22.5.2005 19:20:05"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"g$biloxi he has.

Its values and aspirations were middle-class and power or influence within it was in the hands of middle-class people. Most defenders of bourgeois America saw the country in middle- class terms and looked forward to a not remote future in which everyone would be middle-class except for a small shiftless minority of no importance. America was regarded as a ladder of opportunity. Wealth, power, prestige and respect were all obtained by the same standard, based on money. This in turn was based on a pervasive emotional insecurity that sought relief in the ownership and control of material possessions. Page 1235 Years ago in Europe, the risks (and rewards) of commercial enterprise, well reflected in the fluctuating fortunes of figures such as Antonio in The Merchant of Venice were extreme. A single venture could ruin a merchant or make him rich. This insecurity was increased by the fact that the prevalent religion of the day disapproved of what he was doing, seeking profits or taking interest, and he could see no way of providing religious services to the town dwellers because of the intimate association of the ecclesiastical system with the existing arrangement of rural landholding. Page 1236 Credit became more important than intrinsic personal qualities, and credit was based on the appearance of things, especially the appearances of the external material accessories of life. Old values such as future preference or self-discipline, remained, but were redirected. Future preference ceased to be transcendental in its aim and became secularized. Page 1237 Middle-class self-discipline and future preference provided the http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig19.htm (23 of 31)22.5.2005 19:20:05"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"g$biloxi savings and investment without which any innovation - no matter how appealing in theory - would be set aside and neglected. The middle-class character is psychic insecurity founded on lack of secure social status. The cure for such insecurity became insatiable material acquisition. From this flowed attributes of future preference, self-discipline, social conformity, infinitely expandable material demand, and a general emphasis on externalized impersonal values. The urge to seek truth or to help others are not really compatible with the middle-class values. Page 1238 One of the chief changes, fundamental to the survival of the middle-class outlook, was a change in society's basic conception of human nature. This had two parts to it. The traditional Christian attitude was that human nature was essentially good and that it was formed and modified by social pressures and training. The \"goodness\" of human nature was based on the belief that it was a kind of weaker copy of God's nature. In this Western point of view, evil and sin were negative qualities; they arose from an absence of good, not from the presence of evil. Thus sin was the failure to do the right thing, not doing the wrong thing. Opposed to this view was another which received its most explicit formulation by the Persian Zoroaster in the seventh century B.C. It came in through the Persian influence on the Hebrews, especially during the Babylonian Captivity of the Jews, in the sixth century and more fully through the Greek rationalist tradition from Pythagoras to Plato. The general distinction of this point of view from Zoroaster to William Golding (in Lord of the Flies) is that the world and the flesh are positive evils and that man, in at least this physical part of his nature, is essentially evil. As a consequence, he must be disciplined totally to prevent him from destroying himself and the world. In this view, the devil is a force, or being, of positive malevolence and man, by himself, is incapable of good and is, accordingly, not free. He can be saved in eternity by God's grace alone and he can get through this temporal world only by being subjected to a regime of total despotism. The contrasts can be summed up thus: Orthodox; Puritan. Evil is an absence of Good; Evil is a positive entity. Man is basically good; Man is basically evil. Man is free; Man is a slave of his nature. Man can contribute to his salvation by good works; http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig19.htm (24 of 31)22.5.2005 19:20:05"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Man can be saved only by God. Self-discipline is necessary to guide or direct; Discipline must be external and total. Truth found from experience and revelation interpreted by tradition; Truth is found by rational deduction from revelation. Luther, Calvin, Thomas Hobbes, Blaise Pascal and others believed that truth was to be found in rational deduction from a few basic revealed truths in sharp contrast with the orthodox point of view still represented by the Anglican and Roman churches which saw men as largely free in a universe whose rules were to be found by tradition and consensus. Page 1240 The Puritan point of view led directly to mercantilism which regarded political-economic life as a struggle to the death in a world where there not sufficient wealth or space for different groups. To them, wealth was limited to a fixed amount and one man's gain was someone else's loss. That meant that the basic struggles of this world were irreconcilable and must be fought to a finish. This as part of the Puritan belief that nature was evil and that a state of nature was a jungle of violent conflicts. One large change was the Community of Interests which rejected mercantilism's insistence on limited wealth and the basic incompatibility of interests for the more optimistic belief that all parties could somehow adjust their interests within a community in which all would benefit mutually. Above all, the middle-class which dominated the country in the first half of the 20th century were a small group of aristocrats. Below were the petty bourgeoisie who had middle-class aspirations. Below these two were two lower classes: the workers and the Lumpenproletariat. Page 1242 In America, as elsewhere, aristocracy represents money and position grown old, and is organized in terms of families rather than of individuals. Traditionally it was made up of those families who had money, position,and social prestige for so long that they never had to think about these and,above all, never had to impress any other person with the fact that they had them. They accepted these attributes of family membership as a right and an obligation. Since they had no idea that these could be lost, they were self-assured, natural but distant. Their manners were gracious but impersonal. Their chief characteristic was the assumption that their family position had obligations. This \"noblesse oblige\" led them to participate in school sports (even if they lacked obvious talent) to serve their university (usually a family tradition) in any helpful way, and to offer their services to http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig19.htm (25 of 31)22.5.2005 19:20:05"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"g$biloxi their local community, their state, and their country as an obligation. Page 1243 Another good evidence of class may be seen in the treatment given to servants who work in one's home: the lower classes treat these as equals, the middle-classes treat them as inferiors, while the aristocrats treat them as equals or even superiors. On the whole, the number of aristocratic families in the U.S. is very few, with a couple in each of the older states. A somewhat larger group of semi- aristocrats consists of those like the Lodges, Rockefellers, or Kennedys,who are not yet completely aristocratic either because they are not, in generations, far enough removed from money-making, or because of the persistence of a commercial or business tradition in the family. The second most numerous group in the U.S. is the petty bourgeoisie, including millions of persons who regard themselves as middle-class and are under all the middle-class anxieties and pressures but often earn less money than unionized laborers. As a result of these things, they are often very insecure, envious, filled with hatreds, and are generally the chief recruits for any Radical Right, Fascist, or hate campaigns against any group that is different or which refuses to conform to middle-class values. Made up of clerks, shopkeepers, and vast numbers of office workers in business, government, finance and education, these tend to regard their white collar status as the chief value in life, and live in an atmosphere of envy, pettiness, insecurity, and frustration. They form the major portion of the Republican Party's supporters in the towns of America, as they did for the Nazis in Germany thirty years ago. Page 1244 Eisenhower himself was repelled by the Radical Right whose impetus had been a chief element in his election although the lower- middle-class had preferred Senator Taft as their leader. Eisenhower however had been preferred by the Eastern Establishment of old Wall Street, Ivy League, semi-aristocratic Anglophiles whose real strength rested in their control of eastern financial endowments operating from foundations, academic halls, and other tax-exempt refuges. As we have said, this Eastern Establishment was really above parties. They had been the dominant element in both parties since 1900 and practiced the political techniques of J.P. Morgan. Page 1245 They were, as we have said, Anglophile, cosmopolitan, Ivy League, internationalist, astonishingly liberal, patrons of the arts, and relatively humanitarian.

The ability of the latter to nominate Eisenhower over Taft in 1952 was a bitter pill to the radical bourgeoisie. Kennedy was an Establishment figure. His introduction to the Establishment arose from his support in Britain. His acceptance into the English Establishment opened its American branch as well. Another indication of this connection was the large number of Oxford-trained men appointed to office by President Kennedy. Page 1246 In the minds of the ill-informed, the political struggle in the U.S. has always been viewed as a struggle between Republicans and Democrats at the ballot box in November. Wall Street long ago had seen that the real struggle was in the nominating conventions. This realization was forced upon the petty-bourgeois supporters of Republican candidates by their inability to nominate their congressional favorites. Just as they reached this conclusion, the new wealth appeared in the political picture, sharing petty-bourgeois suspicions of the East, big cities, Ivy League universities, foreigners, intellectuals, workers and aristocrats. By the 1964 election, the major political issue in the country was the financial struggle behind the scenes between the old wealth, civilized and cultured in foundations, and the new wealth, virile and uninformed, arising from the flowing profits of government-dependent corporations in the West and Southwest. At issue here was the whole future face of America, for the older wealth stood for values and aims close to the Western traditions of diversity, tolerance, human rights and values, freedom, and the rest of it, while the newer wealth stood for the narrow and fear-racked aims of petty-bourgeois insecurity and egocentricity. The nominal issues between them, such as that between internationalism and unilateral isolationism (which its supporters preferred to rename \"nationalism\") were less fundamental than they seemed, for the real issue was the control of the Federal government's tremendous power to influence the future of America by spending of government funds. The petty bourgeois and new wealth groups wanted to continue that spending into the industrial-military complex, such as defence and space, while the older wealth and non-bourgeois groups wanted to direct it toward social diversity and social amelioration for the aged and the young, for education, for social outcasts, and for protecting national resources for future use. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig19.htm (27 of 31)22.5.2005 19:20:05"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"g$biloxi Page 1247 The outcome of this struggle, which still goes on, is one in which civilized people can afford to be optimistic.

The policies that are vital and necessary for America are no longer subjects of significant disagreement, but are disputable only in details of procedure, priority, or method: we must remain strong, continue to function as a great World power in cooperation with other Powers, avoid high-level war, keep the economy moving, help other countries do the same, provide the basic social necessities for all our citizens, open up opportunities for social shifts for those willing to work to achieve them, and defend the basic Western outlook of diversity, pluralism, cooperation,and the rest of it, as already described.

Thus Goldwater was able to take control of the party by default. The virulence behind the Goldwater campaign, however, had nothing to do with default or lack of intensity. Quite the contrary. His most ardent supporters were of the extremist petty-bourgeois mentality driven to near hysteria by the disintegration of the middle-class and the steady rise to prominence of everything they considered anathema: Catholics, Negroes, immigrants, intellectuals, aristocrats, scientists, and educated men generally, cosmopolitans and internationalists and, above all, liberals who accept diversity ad a virtue. http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/quig19.htm (28 of 31)22.5.2005 19:20:05"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"g$biloxi This disintegration of the middle classes had a variety of causes, some of them intrinsic, many of them accidental, a few of them obvious, but many of them going deeply into the very depths of social existence.

These early assaults were aimed at the commercialization of life under bourgeois influence and were fundamentally reformist in outlook because they assumed that the evils of the system could somehow be removed. By the 1920s, the attack was much more total and saw the problem in moral terms so fundamental that no remedial action was possible. Only complete rejection of middle- class values could remove the corruption of human life seen by Sinclair Lewis in Babbitt or Main Street.

The tragedy of the period covered by this book is obvious but the hope may seem dubious to many. Only the passage of time will show if the hope I seem to see in the future is actually there or is the result of mis-observation and self-deception. The historian has difficulty distinguishing the features of the present and generally prefers to restrict his studies to the past,where the evidence is more freely available and where perspective helps him to interpret the evidence. Thus the historian speaks with decreasing assurance about the nature and significance of events as they approach his own day. The time covered by this book seems to this historian to fall into three periods: the 19th century from 1814 to 1895; the 20th century after World War II, and a long period of transition from 1895 to 1950. The 20th century is utterly different from the 19th century and the age of transition between the two was one of the most awful periods in all human history.

These characteristics of late nineteenth-century life culminated in World War II in which more than 50 million persons were killed, most of them by horrible deaths. The hope of the twentieth century rests on the recognition that war and depression are man-made, and needless. They can be avoided in the future by turning from the 19th century characteristics just mentioned and going back to other characteristics that our Western society has always regarded as virtues: generosity, compassion, cooperation, rationality, and foresight, and finding an increased role in human life for love, spirituality, charity, and self-discipline. On the whole, we do know now that we can avoid continuing the horrors of 1914-1945 and on that basis alone we maybe optimistic over our ability to go back to the tradition of our Western society and to resume its development along its old patterns of Inclusive Diversity.
